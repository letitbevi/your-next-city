It was more like taking an antique vase and flinging it off a cliff: the only uncertainty was over the length of the drop and the extent of the damage. As traders logged off last night, it was hard to find an asset that was up on the year. Tokyo shares did worse in 2008 than in 1990, when Japan began its lost decade. America&apos;s  S&amp;P-500 made its biggest annual loss since 1931. In Britain, the benchmark FTSE-100 yesterday closed down 32% on the year, the worst performance since the index was created. Those turbocharged emerging markets continue to motor, it is true - only this time they are heading south. All that talk about China and India hauling the west out of a slump was bunkum; Asia&apos;s giants have also caught the fallout of America&apos;s housing bust. Oil and many other commodities surged to record highs until summer, but they have dropped like a brick ever since. The two notable gainers of 2008 were gold and government bonds, and they are the financial equivalent of a giant duvet - something for investors to cower under when the rest of the world is too grim to bear. Shares may gain some respite in the new year but not much, not while the credit drought drags on and economic recovery is a faint hope rather than a distinct prospect. In all this gloom lies a lesson for politicians. Both Gordon Brown and David Cameron want the British to invest in the stock market. In his bid to create a &quot;share-owning... democracy&quot; Mr Brown has allowed tax breaks for equity ownership and doled out small sums for parents to invest on behalf of their children. The prime minister has the social democrat&apos;s itch to make more people wealthier, but the New Labourite&apos;s aversion to anything as pre-historic as blatant income redistribution. His solution? Encouraging voters to become their own fund managers. How this equity culture withstands the crash is an interesting question. Defenders of mass share ownership will argue that stocks are about long-term performance but that is to forget the 20-year slump Wall Street suffered after 1929. Mr Brown is just one of a generation of progressive politicians who have learned to stop worrying and love financial markets. Bill Clinton mused about investing leftover social security funds in Wall Street, while the EU emissions trading scheme with its permits and auctions is a triumph of financial engineering (one awaits the creation of carbon debt obligations). All this thinking was marked by a belief in the smooth functioning of markets. What is needed now more than ever are ideas about how to deliver public goods even when markets fail."}, {"sentences": ["The G550 can fly a group of businessmen from London to Tokyo without a refuelling stop and, according to Crichlow, was almost impossible to get hold of in the used-plane market six months ago - and then it would have cost about $58m."], "tags": ["Citigroup", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Banking", "Credit crunch", "US economy", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-03T00:01:00Z", "title": "Corporate jet sales plummet in credit crunch era", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/03/citigroup-corporate-jet-sales-g550", "article": "The price of second-hand corporate jets has been slashed as businesses offload an asset that has come to embody the height of corporate excess during the credit crunch. This week the US government set tight restrictions on the use of Citigroup&apos;s corporate aeroplane after the bank accepted a $45bn (\u00a328bn) bail-out.  This followed a public outcry after the chief executives of General Motors, Chrysler and Ford made one of the biggest corporate PR gaffes of recent times by flying to Washington bail-out hearings in private jets. The howls of indignation were still ringing in their ears when a bill sanctioning a government-funded rescue was approved by Congress in December with a proviso: any carmaker seeking federal funds must undergo &quot;divestiture of all passenger aircraft owned or leased&quot;. Such is the disdain for private aeroplanes on Capitol Hill that it has been enshrined in legislation. Corporate jets are officially out of favour with US politicians, who now have the power to rescue or destroy companies. Ford pre-empted the bill last month by announcing that it was exploring the sale of its private jets. The corporate jet market has deteriorated markedly in the last few months .  Even if Ford finds a buyer for those planes, no one will want to boast about it, says Gary Crichlow, an analyst at the aviation consultancy Ascend. &quot;The use of business jets has suddenly become vilified. Companies might decide from a public perception point of view that they might not want to be seen owning an aircraft, particularly in the US.&quot;  Second-hand valuations for the Gulfstream G550, a Rolls-Royce among corporate jets, have fallen sharply as the market has dried up. The G550 can fly a group of businessmen from London to Tokyo without a refuelling stop and, according to Crichlow, was almost impossible to get hold of in the used-plane market six months ago - and then it would have cost about $58m. Now, he said, they are much easier to source and would cost $50m to $55m, a discount of up to 14%. &quot;Six months ago you could probably find a G550 but they were few and far between. But now some are being sold for a price that would have been reasonable a few years ago but is a rock-bottom price now,&quot; he said. Crichlow said the corporate jet market would have a &quot;rough ride&quot;. Sales of corporate jets were expected to peak in 2011 but the slump in the US economy last year has changed those forecasts. He expects the market peak to have been passed last year with more than 1,045 jets due to be delivered worldwide and about two-thirds of that total coming from US orders.  This year he says the delivery total will be flat. &quot;Jet ownership is definitely going to take a hit because of the need to conserve cash. People will be trying to sell them. That will see a lot more aircraft coming on to the market and the increase in supply will depress used jet values further.&quot;  There are 16,000 purpose-built business jets in the world, according to Ascend, with only 500 lying idle. North America has the largest share, with about two-thirds of all private aeroplanes, followed by Europe with about 15%. The growth markets are in economies such as Brazil, India and China with the American share of all new deliveries falling from three-quarters to just over half since 2003.  However, an aviation source said Ford needed to sell its aircraft as soon as possible. Otherwise, Congress is, in effect, forcing cash-strapped car manufacturers to lose money on their assets - as a precondition for giving them government cash. &quot;There has been a major downturn in corporate usage,&quot; said the source. &quot;The financial sector and the New York finance community, who are big users of jets, are not going to use them. So there is going to be significant overcapacity and aircraft dumping. But those who can get their aircraft out on to the market over the next six months will find there may be opportunities to realise value out of their aircraft.&quot;  After that, said the source, the market could be glutted with more firms joining Ford in trying to make some cash and avoid the withering criticism on Capitol Hill. First-class only Coca-Cola and Kraft Foods both said security concerns justified their jets. Kraft said: &quot;For reasons of security and personal safety, Kraft Foods requires chairman and chief executive officer Irene Rosenfeld to use the company&apos;s aircraft for all travel.&quot; Boeing said sales had not fallen. It sells more than half of its jets to rich individuals, 35% to governments and the rest to chartered operators. Boeing has two 737 jets for its own executives. &quot;Companies find it hard to justify the purchase because it looks so extravagant, but it is a great productivity tool,&quot; Boeing said."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo &quot;cyber femme&quot; Sputniko and psych rockers O!"], "tags": ["London listings", "Clubbing", "Music"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-03T00:05:56Z", "title": "Pick of the week: Clubs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/03/london-listings-clubs-clubbing", "article": "The Plan B Magazine Review Of 2008The Macbeth, N1, Saturday The folks from Plan B pop open their record bags for some hardcore techno.Actually, they&apos;ll probably go for some of the year&apos;s best indie/rock music.

Chanel&apos;s decision to shed 200 staff last week was the first serious tremor from the global financial crisis to hit the luxury goods industry. The company had been seen as one of the most successful brands in this sector. Now the job losses, thought to represent nearly 10% of Chanel&apos;s workforce, have raised fears for the industry worldwide. The news comes a week after Chanel announced it was shelving a touring art exhibition designed by the architect Zaha Hadid that was due in London this year. The exhibition, the Chanel Mobile Art Pavilion, attracted controversy in New York where Chanel was reported to have paid $400,000 plus an undisclosed charitable donation to pitch the structure in Central Park. &quot;Considering the current economic crisis, we decided it was best to stop the project,&quot; a Chanel spokesperson said. &quot;We will be concentrating on strategic growth investments.&quot; Creative director Karl Lagerfeld remains bullish. Chanel is a privately run company that does not disclose financial figures but is not seen as being in danger. &quot;I see it like a horrible but healthy thing,&quot; Lagerfeld said. &quot;It was too rotten anyway so it had to be cleaned up. It may be a difficult moment for a lot of people, but in the end it was needed, because it was really going too far.&quot; Chanel is one of the most profitable and extravagant of the luxury houses, founded on the rigid principles of Coco Chanel, who pioneered its famous tweed jackets, quilted bags and profitable fragrances, including Chanel No 5. Its fashion shows had previously been seen as bold displays of power. For spring/summer 2009, Chanel re-created the entire front of its famous Rue Cambon store in Paris for a 15-minute show - the same store from which 16 members of staff are said to have been laid off. Chanel had benefited from the boom by quietly increasing the price of its bags in recent years with apparently no adverse effect on sales. Lagerfeld believes this gives the brand a cushion against any impending financial difficulties. &quot;The business in the past three years increased so much every year,&quot; he said, &quot;that if they [the bags] are suddenly 25% less, that is exactly the point we were three years ago - we weren&apos;t poor then.&quot; The fashion industry has been in pessimistic mood since major designers began discounting heavily before the traditional Christmas sales, a sign that the economic crisis was affecting consumer confidence. In November, New York designer Marc Jacobs had marked down his autumn/winter range by 40%, and by December he had cancelled his Christmas party, previously an event of notorious extravagance with staff flown to New York from all around the world. Last year Jacobs famously arrived at his Arabian Nights-themed party dressed in a giant camel&apos;s toe. The outfit he would have worn for his 2008 party, themed Rock and Roll Circus, has not been revealed. Jacobs&apos;s discounting was soon copied by most high-end stores in Manhattan, while in London Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Liberty all discounted heavily before their usual sales, with online vouchers and reductions for store-card holders of up to 50%. Louis Vuitton, another bastion of the luxury goods industry, has shelved plans for a new store in Tokyo, one of its key markets. Donna Karan cancelled plans to shoot a spring advertising campaign, opting for catwalk pictures instead. Shares in LVMH, parent company of Louis Vuitton and Donna Karan as well as Christian Dior and Givenchy, have fallen by nearly 50%, from \u20ac82.10 (\u00a378.54) at the beginning of last year to \u20ac48.21 on Friday. The industry now fears the knock-on effect of poor sales figures as it enters one of the most crucial periods of the year, with two months of fashion shows that are vastly expensive for the brands that stage the collections, the stores and journalists who travel to them. Many brands have announced cutbacks, with Marni, Fendi and Valentino all opting out of the next menswear shows, and US department stores such as Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus admitting they would be skipping the Paris couture shows. Vera Wang has already announced that her show at the New York womenswear collections in February would be scaled down, while British brand Temperley will opt for a presentation in Manhattan. Other cuts are expected to follow. &quot;No one knows how bad it&apos;s going to get,&quot; said Katie Grand, seen as the most influential British stylist, who next month launches a new magazine called Love for Cond\u00e9 Nast. &quot;It&apos;s a very good excuse to step back and think, do we really need a men&apos;s show, do we really need to spend a million euros on a fashion show, is that the way to represent yourself at the moment or could that money be better spent?&quot; Grand, who helped launch the careers of models such as Agyness Deyn and designers such as Giles Deacon, and is a consultant for Louis Vuitton and Loewe, said fashion didn&apos;t face as big a challenge as other ailing sectors. &quot;It&apos;s not the same as the disaster in the music industry, where there&apos;s been a complete change in technology. There is that thing with fashion where women can excuse spending vast amounts of money on handbags because they can convince themselves that it&apos;s an investment.&quot; Grand cites brands such as Herm\u00e8s, which posted sales rises of 14.2% in the first three quarters of 2008. &quot;If you have a Herm\u00e8s handbag, if times get tough you can always sell them,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s how people justify it to themselves.&quot; Troubles in the luxury goods industry are causing concern for London&apos;s designers, who rely on creative influence rather than financial clout. &quot;Designers have to hold their nerve and carry on doing what they&apos;re doing,&quot; says Lulu Kennedy of Fashion East, whose biannual shows at London Fashion Week launched now globally recognised designers such as Henry Holland, Christopher Kane, Marios Schwab and Richard Nicholl. &quot;If they have a style they should just stay true to it. People will buy it if they still love it.&quot; Kennedy has already noticed cut-backs at some brands. &quot;From talking to the designers they&apos;re having to look at their pricing and manufacturing,&quot; she says. &quot;They can&apos;t carry on regardless. In practical terms they are having to cut back on luxurious fabrics, bargain harder with their suppliers and slightly mix it up with other cheaper stuff.&quot; Brands are also altering their patterns to reduce the price tag. &quot;I was round at a designers and they were taking some details out of a sample they were about to send to production,&quot; Kennedy says. &quot;They took out some pleats, didn&apos;t use double French seams and changed the fabric. There was definitely some scaling back.&quot; Some designers, however, are pushing ahead with plans for expansion, like London-based designer Gareth Pugh, favoured by Beyonc\u00e9 and Kylie Minogue, who is staging his first menswear show in Paris later this month. Giorgio Armani is pushing ahead with plans to launch a new flagship store on Fifth Avenue during New York fashion week, which he called &quot;an act of faith toward the Americans and Fifth Avenue shoppers&quot;. And Louis Vuitton hopes to reap the benefits of the alleged $10m fee it paid Madonna to star in its new advertising campaign. It certainly needs to: the shoes featured in the images are said to cost around \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,800). The hope within the fashion industry is that, no matter how difficult the next few months, those with genuine talent will be able to remain in business. &quot;It is an oversaturated market,&quot; said Kennedy. &quot;Hopefully good, stylish, pioneering designers will find a way to survive. But it is tough out there, it really, really is.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["I know Tokyo well but this year I want to explore the rest of the country.&quot;  acehotel.com Lisa Sounio Founder: DopplrAge: 38 Holiday planning for the Facebook generation     Photograph: Lisa Sounio    Most social networking sites allow you to tell people where you have been."], "tags": ["Hotels", "Skiing holidays", "Family holidays", "Travel", "Luxury travel", "Walking holidays", "Green travel", "San Francisco holidays", "Seattle holidays", "Scotland holidays", "Austria holidays", "Norway holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Social networking", "Media", "Christmas and New Year holidays"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-04T00:01:00Z", "title": "Meet the bright young stars of travel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jan/04/young-stars-travel-future-innovation", "article": "Alex Calderwood Founder: Ace HotelsAge: 38 Shaking up the hotel trade by blending luxury and budget     Alex Calderwood, founder of Ace Hotels.

So it&apos;s all the more impressive that Austick, one of the most innovative guides working in Europe today, grew up in Newcastle and started out working for his dad&apos;s electrical engineering firm. &quot;After a while it was a case of &apos;Son, you ain&apos;t going to fit in here&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;I spent every possible spare minute skiing, so pretty soon I decided I had to make it my career.&quot;  After parting company with his dad, aged 19, Austick moved to St Anton, Austria, and by 2000 had become the first Briton to have both the top British skiing-instruction qualification and the highest-level mountain guiding certificate. The same year, he set up Piste to Powder, a ski school specifically catering to the growing number of people who wanted to ski off-piste. Rather than hiring a private guide for at least \u00a3250 a day, it meant individuals could turn up, pay a flat fee (this winter \u00a371) and join a group of a similar standard. A simple idea, but traditional Alpine ski schools have always been slow to innovate, and copycat operations are only now starting to pop up in the Alps.  But Austick didn&apos;t stop there. Recognising that more and more skiers were looking for adventures away from crowded resorts, he started running trips to ever more remote slopes - from Greenland to Alaska, Russia, the Himalayas and South America. Austick pushed into the least visited areas, until clients were skiing down mountains that had never been climbed, let alone skied before. In Alaska, the group travelled into the wilderness on a ski-equipped light aircraft then set up camp, in Greenland they arrived by dogsled.  Now Austick has a new focus - the Lyngen Alps in arctic Norway. &quot;When I first went I&apos;d never seen anywhere like it for skiing - super mountains, great snow, and your final turns finish on the beach where the waves are breaking.&quot; He started ski trips in the area based on a chartered sail boat, but has now built his own wilderness lodge, from which skiers are ferried by speed boat to different mountains each day. &quot;For your average alpine skier, the concept of skiing untracked powder, and ending up on the beach, is just bananas really.&quot;  \u2022 Top tip: &quot;Ski touring [using sticky skins attached to skis to climb uphill, rather than ski lifts] is coming into its own. Heliskiing is fun, but there&apos;s a level of stress that you don&apos;t get with ski touring. People are wanting to come back to the roots and get back to the real feeling of being in mountains.&quot; www.pistetopowder.com; lyngenlodge.com Stevie Christie Director: Wilderness ScotlandAge: 31Sharing a love of adventure in the highlands and islands     Photograph: Murdo Macleod    What separates Wilderness Scotland from other similar companies is the local knowledge every member of staff has, which helps create its unique brand of holidays. Christie is no exception; he joined the company in 2003 as a mountain guide and still loves to get out on the mountains whenever he can.  &quot;I grew up in the area and after three years at the Scottish Executive, working on environmental policy, I knew I wanted a job that - at least partly - involved being outdoors,&quot; he says.  &quot;Wilderness Scotland was started by Neil Burnie and Paul Eastow in Neil&apos;s bedroom. They had both worked overseas on eco-projects in the developing world, but felt that no one was offering that type of holiday back in Scotland. The idea was to combine their experience of working in ecology, with their expert knowledge of the local area.&quot; Alongside traditional hiking and mountain-biking holidays, Wilderness Scotland offers more unusual trips - kayaking, photography and family exploratory holidays - and has expanded its brand of eco-friendly holidays overseas. &quot;We set up a sister company about three years ago, Wilderness Journeys, which runs trips to remoter parts of Kenya, South America and Bhutan. All the trips work with local people, and ensure the economic benefits go to the local community.&quot;  Wilderness Scotland is run on green principles, and is introducing an optional payment of \u00a35-\u00a310 per booking, matched by the company, to go to nominated environmental projects. \u2022 Top tip: &quot;The credit crunch means more people will be holidaying in the UK - as they should. Scotland is the adventure capital of Europe, and has some of the best mountain-biking and kayaking in the world.&quot; wildernessscotland.com Jamie Andrews Co-founder: Loco2travel Age: 25Finding a viable alternative to flying  The idea was conceived by Jamie&apos;s sister Kate, who wanted to travel after university and found there were limited resources for people who wanted to make long-haul journeys without flying. &quot;She mocked up the website, but the problem was that it was almost impossible to create a journey planning tool that could combine global information on bus, train, boat and ferry links,&quot; he says. &quot;At this point it was just an idea, and Kate decided to go travelling.&quot; This was where Jamie came in; having worked for a web development company, he created the current loco2travel.com website. &quot;It&apos;s very much a version 1.0 at the moment,&quot; he says. &quot;There are two main strands we&apos;re working on. The journey planner is integral to what we want the site to be. But the other strand is to enable people to have authentic gap-year experiences; to travel overland and get involved in projects as you travel.&quot; Andrews admits travelling overland can be daunting, and loco2 aims to set up itineraries - including placements with community projects - to make it easier. &quot;We want to be useful for those who want to travel on a whim, and for those planning a whole adventure.&quot; \u2022 Top tip: &quot;Convergence on Copenhagen is about bringing people together who are travelling to November&apos;s Climate Conference without flying.

The second is where a group comes to us - either corporate or friends - who might want a ski trip to Switzerland or to go kite-surfing in Italy, and we organise the holiday for them.  &quot;We&apos;ve also introduced &apos;Snowdays&apos;, where we book a variety of accommodation in a ski resort and arrange entertainment and excursions people can join in or not as they like. People nominate a group leader and use their name when booking on the site. We collate all the bookings, then contact the group leader with the information, so no one has to take responsibility for booking the whole trip.&quot;  \u2022 Top tip: &quot;Holidays are going to be the new hunting ground for singles - the days of &apos;singles holidays&apos; as such, are long gone.

We decided on a yurt and in 2007, we took just one yurt around the country, offering treatments,&quot; says Dawes.  While at the festivals, they realised that although there were companies offering &quot;comfortable accommodation&quot;, a gap in the market remained.  &quot;There was nothing particularly luxurious, and we felt yurts could offer that, so we went back to the guy in Devon where we had bought our first one and ordered 12 more. We then set up a mobile hotel: each yurt has a kingsized bed and fresh flowers, and we still offer the spa treatments. At some festivals we offer a B&amp;B service - fresh croissants and coffee.&quot;  Yurtel&apos;s clients tend to be older people who might not go to festivals if it meant toughing it out under canvas, and they intend to up the luxury factor.  &quot;We&apos;re looking to add five more yurts and also a shower and toilet trailer.&quot; But Dawe admits that their long-term goal is a touch more glamorous: &quot;Our ultimate dream is a health retreat somewhere overseas. We&apos;re heading to Goa next month to look at possible locations.&quot; \u2022 Top tip: &quot;As the recession bites, holidaying in the UK will become more popular.

Lee was joined in the studio&apos;s control room by his music-recording team. A large window overlooked the cavernous soundstage where Judy Garland recorded &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, in 1938, when the lot belonged to MGM. A 95-piece orchestra that Lee had engaged had not yet arrived. A month earlier, at a press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, Lee had sparked a very public feud with Clint Eastwood when he accused him of having omitted black soldiers from his two recent movies about Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. (Historians estimate that between 700 and 900 black servicemen participated in the battle.) The spat had escalated quickly. Eastwood told the Guardian that he had left out the black soldiers because none had actually raised the flag, adding that &quot;a guy like that should shut his face&quot;. Lee shot back, telling ABCNews.com, &quot;The man is not my father and we&apos;re not on a plantation either.&quot; Lee&apos;s remarks appeared online three days before he began recording the score for Miracle at St Anna. Lee sees the movie, the first by a major American director to treat the experience of black soldiers in the war, as redress not only for Eastwood&apos;s pictures but for an all-white Hollywood vision of the second world war which dates to the 1962 John Wayne movie The Longest Day - and before.  As the orchestra began to gather on the soundstage, Lee scribbled notes about the score on a yellow legal pad. He is 5ft 6in, with a barrel chest and a pigeon-toed walk. His baleful, half-hooded eyes peered out from behind tortoiseshell frames. There was a diamond stud in his left earlobe. He is 51, has a small bald spot at the crown of his short Afro, and wore an orange T-shirt with a picture of Barack Obama and the word &quot;REPRESENT&quot;.  It&apos;s been more than 20 years since Lee&apos;s debut, the 1986 movie She&apos;s Gotta Have It - a breezy sex comedy about a liberated African-American woman and her three male suitors - and he remains Hollywood&apos;s most prominent black filmmaker. He has directed 18 features, three of which (Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever, and Malcolm X) have earnt him a reputation as a filmmaker obsessed with race. Releasing movies at an average of nearly one a year, Lee has maintained a pace matched only by Woody Allen.  Lee is the artistic director of NYU&apos;s graduate film programme, where he teaches a master class in directing. He also makes music videos and TV ads (he has done spots for Converse, Jaguar, Taco Bell and Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s, among others) and has made two superb documentaries: 4 Little Girls, about the 1963 bombing by the Ku Klux Klan of a black church in Alabama, and When the Levees Broke, about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. He is able to accomplish so much in part because he often rises at 5am. &quot;You want to get a lot done, you gotta get up in the morning,&quot; he told me. The rest, he says, is &quot;time management&quot;. But Lee&apos;s output also reflects the unusual fecundity of his imagination. &quot;Spike was the idea man,&quot; Herb Eichelberger, who taught Lee in an undergraduate film course in Atlanta in 1977, told me. &quot;He was a good writer, and he would explore those ideas and turn them into full-blown mini-epics.&quot; Terence Blanchard, the score&apos;s composer, arrived in the control room. A heavy-set African-American from New Orleans, Blanchard has known Lee for 20 years. He played trumpet on She&apos;s Gotta Have It, School Daze and Mo&apos; Better Blues, and in 1991 Lee hired him to be the composer for Jungle Fever. Blanchard has scored all but two of Lee&apos;s films since. Unlike most directors, Lee includes the composer in the process from the start, often before a script even exists - &quot;from the inception of ideas&quot;, as he puts it. Lee&apos;s emphasis on the music results in scores that often clash with the dialogue, making it difficult to hear the actors. &quot;Of course you want people to understand the dialogue,&quot; he told me. &quot;But the human brain is wonderful - with the correct score and the correct mix, the brain can multi-task and hear the dialogue and the music at the same time.&quot; Before Lee and Blanchard could get to work, a Sony studio employee approached carrying a poster of Miracle at St Anna. He wanted the men to sign it, so that it could be mounted in the hallway next to posters for other movies whose scores had been recorded in the studio. &quot;Yeah, OK,&quot; Lee said, brusquely. He added, &quot;We want the John Williams spot&quot; - referring to the composer who writes the endlessly imitated music for Steven Spielberg&apos;s movies. &quot;You&apos;ll be right next to John Williams,&quot; the Sony man said, in a mollifying tone. &quot;How&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;We want the John Williams-Spielberg, you know?&quot; Lee repeated. &quot;We&apos;ll take down the Memoirs of a Geisha, and put yours...&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t put us next to Judd Apapoe, whatever that guy is,&quot; Lee interrupted, referring to Judd Apatow, the director of the goofball comedies Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. &quot;We gotta be next to Spielberg and Williams!&quot; &quot;You got it,&quot; the man said. He obtained the signatures, then scurried away like a soldier ducking enemy fire. Blanchard opened a sound-proof door and walked on to the soundstage, where he took his place at a podium facing the musicians. On a large screen at the back of the stage, a scene from the end of the film began to play: battle-weary black soldiers moved through the cobblestoned streets of Colognora, a tiny hill town in Tuscany near where the 92nd Division, also known as the Buffalo Soldiers (they took the name from the original Buffalo Soldiers, six all-black army regiments from the late 19th century), fought. Nazi soldiers staged an ambush, and Lee captured the ensuing violence with a series of sweeping tracking shots and fast edits that are characteristic of his kinetic visual style. The orchestra played Blanchard&apos;s surging score - a passage heavy on brasses and piercing violins, but in a minor key and with a slow tempo that contrasted sharply with the battle onscreen. Where many filmmakers would have demanded a rousing score to complement the action, Blanchard and Lee had devised music that was unexpectedly elegiac, emphasising the wasted lives. As the battle scene unfolded, Lee got up from the console and hurried to the front of the control room, where he sat at a table that held a small monitor. He moved his face close to the screen as a GI spoke his dying words to a fellow soldier. A trumpet played softly under the dialogue. When the scene ended, Lee leaped from his chair and shouted, &quot;Woooo!&quot; Blanchard came back into the control room. &quot;Was the brass big enough?&quot; he asked. &quot;Hell, yeah,&quot; Lee said. He laughed and jumped up and down. The plot of Miracle at St Anna revolves around a bond that forms between one of the Buffalo Soldiers and an orphaned nine-year-old Italian boy and, in this respect, Miracle reflects Lee&apos;s opinion - as he expressed it to me - that love can transcend colour. But the movie is not without racial provocations. It is based on a novel by James McBride, who adapted it for the screen, but Lee had McBride add a scene involving Axis Sally - Germany&apos;s version of Tokyo Rose - a woman born in Maine, who migrated to Germany before the war and, embracing the Nazi cause, broadcast anti-American propaganda over Radio Berlin. In the film, Axis Sally, played by the German actress Alexandra Maria Lara, is shown sitting at a table in front of a swastika, speaking into a microphone. Her words echo over loudspeakers mounted on trucks as the Buffalo Soldiers advance toward the Serchio River: &quot;Welcome, 92nd Division, Buffalo Soldiers. We&apos;ve been waiting for you. Do you know our German Wehrmacht has been here digging bunkers for six months? Waiting? Your white commanders won&apos;t tell you that, of course. Why? Because they don&apos;t care if you die. But the German people have nothing against the Negro. That&apos;s why I&apos;m warning you now with all my heart and soul. Save yourself, Negro brothers. Why die for a nation that doesn&apos;t want you? A nation that treats you like a slave! Did I say slave? Yes I did!&quot; Lee had intercut the speech with reaction shots of the Buffalo Soldiers wincing and even weeping. When the scene ended, he clapped his hands, cackled, and said, &quot;Yee, yee, yee!&quot; Lee told me that he had researched the history of the Buffalo Soldiers in the second world war exhaustively, but Axis Sally&apos;s speech does not derive from a particular broadcast. Lee said that he had come up with the idea for the speech and asked McBride to incorporate it into the scene. &quot;Propaganda with some truth in it,&quot; Lee explained. &quot;Very unsettling to the Buffalo Soldiers.&quot; The effect was powerful, if not exactly subtle, but such gestures have got Lee into trouble in the past. He has justified his manipulations of reality on artistic grounds. For Do the Right Thing, his cinematic anatomy of a race riot, which was shot in the summer of 1988 in the drug- and crime-riddled Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn, Lee&apos;s crew spent weeks cleaning up a street of crack houses - painting fa\u00e7ades, fixing broken stoops - before filming began, and Lee makes no reference to drugs in the movie, a decision for which he was heavily criticised. Lee responded by saying, &quot;This film is not about drugs,&quot; and by accusing those who challenged him of racial stereotyping.  &quot;The fact that Spike Lee is a talented guy is unarguable,&quot; says Stanley Crouch, the African-American cultural critic who has long been one of Lee&apos;s fiercest detractors. &quot;But if you make movies as consistently inferior to the movies of Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese and cry &apos;racism&apos; or imply racism, when your movies are not as successful as theirs are - what is that? On a human level, his comprehension of other people is far more shallow than theirs is, and that&apos;s the basic problem that he&apos;s had from the beginning of his career, the fundamental shallowness that you get from a propagandist.&quot; Scorsese, however, says that he admires Lee. &quot;I always responded to his work as a fresh, original American voice in cinema - mainstream cinema. He actually pushes the medium in narrative storytelling. The way he uses the moving camera, the way he edits films, the use of music, the film stock that he uses - in particular, in one of the best American films, Malcolm X, but also in the documentaries. When you look at the list of the work that he&apos;s done - films, commercials, documentaries - the nature of the voice that he is in the entertainment industry in America is quite unique.&quot; &quot;People think I&apos;m this angry black man walking around in a constant state of rage,&quot; Lee complained to me when we first met, in New York last May. His annoyance at this perception is understandable; he can be funny and warm, and even his angriest movies are leavened with humour. Yet the persona he projects, imperious and impatient, can be intimidating. He had invited me to join him at the Jazz Standard to listen to Blanchard, who was playing trumpet with his small jazz combo. He sat through Blanchard&apos;s gig uttering only a few words to me, and gave me a stern glance when I tried to initiate conversation between numbers. Ernest Dickerson, who has known Lee since they were classmates at NYU film school in the early 80s and who shot all of Lee&apos;s movies up to and including Malcolm X, before becoming a director himself, said of Lee, &quot;He&apos;s never suffered fools. You&apos;ve got to bring your best game to him. He looks at everybody with, &apos;OK, what&apos;re you doing?&apos;&quot; Blanchard told me that Lee once became so incensed by the tardiness of a music copyist during the scoring of Malcolm X that he hurled a chair across the room and had the copyist fired. Spike Lee was born Shelton Jackson Lee, in Atlanta, Georgia, but his mother, Jacquelyn (who died in 1977, from cancer, when Lee was 20), gave him the nickname Spike because, she later told him, he was &quot;a tough baby&quot;. Lee is the eldest of six children (he has a half-brother, Arnold, from his father&apos;s second marriage). Lee has called his family &quot;very artistic&quot;. Jacquelyn was a high-school teacher of art and African-American literature, and Lee&apos;s father, Bill, played stand-up jazz bass, but also recorded with Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, Judy Collins, Bob Dylan, Theodore Bikel, Josh White and Odetta. &quot;My father would take us up to the Newport Jazz Festival,&quot; Lee told me. &quot;Or, if he was playing at the Village Vanguard or the Bitter End, sometimes we could stay up late and go with him.&quot; For a time, Bill Lee was the sole breadwinner, but when electric bass became ubiquitous in popular music, in the mid-60s, he refused to play it and stopped getting the lucrative studio work. His wife was obliged to return to teaching. &quot;I like the artistic stance,&quot; Lee told me, with an exasperated laugh. &quot;You have a family to support!&quot; But he added, with admiration, &quot;He&apos;s never played electric bass to date.&quot; Lee&apos;s mother took the children to Broadway plays and to movies, but Lee maintains that he was not like many directors, who say they knew from childhood that they wanted to make movies. &quot;I loved sport,&quot; he says. &quot;I knew I was never going to play professional sport, but I loved playing and I went to all the games I could afford to.&quot; When Lee was eight, the family moved to Cobble Hill, then an Italian-American neighbourhood of Brooklyn. They were the first black family to do so, Lee says. &quot;First couple of days, we got called &apos;nigger&apos; by some kids,&quot; he told me. &quot;Once they saw that there wasn&apos;t a hundred other black families moving in behind us, like we&apos;re the only one, then it was OK and it was never an issue after that.&quot;  The family later moved to the middle-class black neighbourhood of Fort Greene, to a brownstone where his father, now 80, still lives. After Lee graduated from John Dewey High School, in 1975, he became the third generation in his family to attend Morehouse, the all-black college in Atlanta. In the summer of 1977, after his second year, he returned to New York and searched, unsuccessfully, for a job. David Berkowitz, the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; serial killer, was terrorising Manhattan with random shootings, and in July there was a citywide blackout, which lasted 25 hours and resulted in looting, arson and vandalism. Lee, carrying a Super-8 camera he had been given the previous Christmas, went into the streets to film the chaos.  &quot;I just spent that whole summer shooting,&quot; he said. When he returned to Morehouse for his junior year, he decided to major in mass communications. The programme included print journalism, radio, television and film. &quot;Once I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker, I really started growing up,&quot; Lee says. &quot;I was really focused.&quot; Lee became particularly close with two other undergraduate film majors, Monty Ross and George Folkes. &quot;They said, &apos;We really want to make some changes, &apos;&quot; Herb Eichelberger recalled. &quot;&apos;We&apos;re tired of these woe-is-me films, the black always being the underdog and never getting to break even on the silver screen.&apos;&quot; For Lee&apos;s senior project, Eichelberger encouraged him to edit the footage he had shot in the summer of 1977. Lee turned it into a short feature that he called Last Hustle in Brooklyn. The film was a mock-documentary that included scenes of New Yorkers trapped in elevators during the blackout and of people looting stores, as well as scenes acted out by Lee&apos;s younger siblings. By then, Lee had applied to the top film schools in the country - the first of Eichelberger&apos;s students to do so - and had been accepted at NYU. At the time, there were only a handful of African-American directors in Hollywood, including Sidney Poitier, Gordon Parks, who directed the Shaft movies, and Michael Shultz, who made hits for Richard Pryor. &quot;When I told people at Morehouse I was going to film school to become a filmmaker,&quot; Lee says, &quot;they said I was crazy.&quot; The NYU film programme is one of the best in the US. (Ang Lee was in Lee&apos;s class, and Jim Jarmusch was there at the same time.) During his first year, Lee was shown a number of classic movies by his professors, including the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, by DW Griffith, who pioneered many cinematic techniques still in use today. But the film was notorious, even at the time of its release, for its endorsement of white supremacy and its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee felt that his professors put too much emphasis on Griffith&apos;s artistry and not enough on the film&apos;s racist message. &quot;They taught that DW Griffith is the father of cinema,&quot; Lee told me. &quot;They talk about all the &apos;innovations&apos; - which he did. But they never really talked about the implications of Birth of a Nation, never really talked about how that film was used as a recruiting tool for the KKK.&quot; For one of his first-year projects, Lee wrote and directed a 20-minute film called The Answer, about an out-of-work African-American screenwriter who agrees to write a remake of Birth of a Nation. The screenwriter ultimately decides that he cannot go through with the project and is attacked by Klan members, who burn a cross in front of his house. The Answer was shown at a screening of student films, and some members of the faculty were incensed. Roberta Hodes, a retired NYU film professor who took part in the debate over Lee&apos;s film, says that some faculty members recommended that he not be invited back for the final two years of the programme. After the first year, the school weeded out students who lacked promise. But talent was not an issue with The Answer, Hodes says. &quot;I just think it offended everyone,&quot; she told me. &quot;I felt offended, too, I&apos;m ashamed to say.&quot;  Eleanor Hamerow, former head of the film department, said that the problem was not the film&apos;s content but its overweening ambition. &quot;In first year, we&apos;re trying to teach them the basics, and certainly the idea was to execute exercises, make small films, but within limits,&quot; Hamerow said. &quot;He was trying to solve a problem overnight - the social problem with the blacks and the whites. He undertook to fix the great film-maker who made that movie, DW Griffith.&quot; Hamerow says she was among those faculty members who voted to keep Lee in the programme, so that he could, &quot;Go on and learn more.&quot; After graduation, Lee took a job at a small film distribution company in the city. That year, Jim Jarmusch released Stranger Than Paradise, a critical and commercial success by the standards of independent cinema. &quot;Jim Jarmusch was our hero,&quot; Lee told me. &quot;When you&apos;re in film school, you study Scorsese, all these people - but you don&apos;t know them. But when somebody you know, who you saw in class and saw in school, makes it ... then it&apos;s do-able. So we were all, like, &apos;Yeah, we can do it now!&apos;&quot; In 1985, Lee wrote the screenplay for She&apos;s Gotta Have It, about Nola Darling and her three suitors. Shot on the streets of Brooklyn and featuring a star turn by Lee as Mars Blackmon, a bespectacled and geeky would-be lover, the movie not only defied prevailing stereotypes of the Reagan-era inner-city black movie, but called to mind Woody Allen&apos;s early romantic comedies. To help finance the movie - which cost $175,000 - he obtained a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and seed money from his maternal grandmother, Zimmie, a frugal woman who &quot;saved her social security cheques&quot;, Lee says. Everything about the movie suggested a refined sensibility - from the lush black-and-white camerawork to the sudden explosion of colour in a dance number. (&quot;Spike&apos;s love of musicals really contributed to the dance sequence,&quot; says Dickerson, who worked as the cameraman.  &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t know that Spike is a big fan of Hollywood musicals. Big Vincente Minnelli fan.&quot;) Lee&apos;s very funny performance as Mars Blackmon - in an oversized gold medallion, a fade haircut, and puffy Air Jordans - was an unexpected success. &quot;I never wanted to act,&quot; Lee says. &quot;The only reason I was in it is that we couldn&apos;t afford to pay anyone else.&quot; She&apos;s Gotta Have It premiered at the San Francisco Film Festival and prompted a bidding war for the distribution rights. It opened in the summer of 1986, with what Lee calls a &quot;marketing gimmick&quot;: for nearly a month, the movie could be seen at only one cinema in America, Cinema Studio in New York. &quot;Every night it was sold out,&quot; Lee recalled. &quot;And I would get there and hand out buttons. Me and my friends were selling She&apos;s Gotta Have It T-shirts.&quot; When the film opened in wide release, it made about $7m. The credits announced the film as &quot;A Spike Lee Joint&quot;. Lee said: &quot;Coming from the independent world, I knew that millions and millions of dollars were not going to be spent on the promotion and marketing of my film. So in a lot of ways I had to market myself and market the brand of Spike Lee.&quot; In 1988, Nike paired Lee&apos;s Mars Blackmon character with Michael Jordan in a series of television ads directed by Lee. He eventually directed and co-starred with Jordan in eight Nike commercials, which played around the world during the late 80s and early 90s. &quot;There was a time when more people knew me as that crazy guy in those Nike commercials than knew I was Spike Lee, the director,&quot; Lee says. She&apos;s Gotta Have It also earned him the label of &quot;the black Woody Allen&quot;. Lee was not happy with the comparison. &quot;How can you say anybody is the black anybody after one film?&quot;  On the third day of recording the score for Miracle at St Anna, Lee arrived at the soundstage just before 9am. He was wearing a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;Defend Brooklyn!&quot; and he was in an upbeat mood because the Lakers had won the night before. During a break in the session, Lee took Blanchard aside and told him a story in hushed tones, about an encounter he&apos;d had with Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Eddie Murphy at the Lakers game. &quot;They were sitting together,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I went to Spielberg, &apos;Steven, it&apos;s over with Clint Eastwood.&apos; Steven laughed and said, &apos;I&apos;ll call Clint and tell him in the morning.&apos; I said, &apos;It&apos;s over.&apos; He said, &apos;Good.&apos;&quot; Blanchard had known Lee too long to believe that he had uttered his final word on Eastwood - and told him so. &quot;I don&apos;t see that shit happening,&quot; he said. &quot;No!&quot; Lee insisted. &quot;It&apos;s done!&quot; (Eastwood declined to comment for this article.) As the day wore on, Lee became increasingly irritable, speaking little with his co-workers, and then only in brief, truculent commands. During a dinner break, Lee sat apart, his back to the room, reading the newspaper and picking at some cooked shrimp.  Then Lee received a call on his BlackBerry from his family in New York. Since 1994, he has been married to Tonya Lewis Lee, a former corporate lawyer who is now a writer and television producer. The Lees have a daughter, Satchel, 13, and a son, Jackson, 11. Ten years ago, they bought a town house on the Upper East Side that used to belong to the painter Jasper Johns and, before that, to Gypsy Rose Lee. The Lees also have a home on Martha&apos;s Vineyard, and their children attend private schools on the Upper East Side, a fact that seems to cause Lee some discomfort when he discloses it. He told me he had always intended his kids to go, as he did, to state schools. &quot;But my wife put the kibosh on that,&quot; he said. Lee balks at being described as wealthy. &quot;It&apos;s not rich rich,&quot; he told me. &quot;Rich is Spielberg. Lucas. Gates. Steve Jobs. Jay-Z! Bruce Springsteen. I&apos;m not complaining. But that&apos;s money. Will Smith. Oprah Winfrey - that&apos;s a ton of money. Compared to them, I&apos;m on welfare!&quot; Jackson Lee was on the phone, telling his dad about a recent Little League game. Lee&apos;s bad mood disappeared as he paced up and down and spoke loudly into the phone. &quot;How&apos;d you do?&quot; he asked. &quot;Everyone gave you a high five?&quot; Lee asked several more questions about the game, then said, &quot;Tomorrow is your last day of school. Tell Mommy to let you watch the game. Tell Mommy you wanna watch the Lakers kick the Celtics&apos; butts!&quot; Then Lee lowered his voice. &quot;We have to talk about that grammar stuff when I get back,&quot; he said, before hanging up. &quot;All right. I&apos;m not mad at you. All right.&quot; He sat and again became absorbed in his news-paper. But when the conversation turned to politics he looked up. &quot;With this election, we&apos;re gonna find out who&apos;s really liberal,&quot; Blanchard, an Obama supporter, was saying to the others. &quot;You got people saying they&apos;re not going to vote for my man because he lacks experience. You know that&apos;s not it!&quot; &quot;Who&apos;s going to be the vice-presidential pick?&quot; Robin Burgess, the session co-ordinator and Blanchard&apos;s wife, asked. &quot;As long as it&apos;s not Hillary,&quot; Lee said. &quot;You know,&quot; Blanchard said in a wondering tone, &quot;we got friends uptown who say they can&apos;t stand Michelle. I mean, what about McCain&apos;s wife?&quot; &quot;Stepford wife,&quot; Lee muttered. &quot;I used to like Bill Clinton,&quot; Blanchard said. Lee shook his head. &quot;They showed their hand,&quot; he said. Lee has always been intensely interested in politics and believes that the cultural and financial status of African-Americans is dictated by the policies and attitudes of the politicians in power. He blames Ed Koch, the mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989, for fostering a toxic racial climate. Lee was particularly outraged by two violent incidents in the mid-80s involving the killing of unarmed blacks by white policemen, who were not convicted of any crime. In December 1986, three black youths were assaulted by a mob of white men wielding a baseball bat and sticks in Howard Beach, an Italian-American neighbourhood of Queens, where they had walked to a pizza parlour after their car broke down nearby. One youth was run over by a car as he fled his attackers. Three of the white assailants were convicted of manslaughter in the winter of 1987. Within weeks of the Howard Beach verdict, Lee began writing his third feature, a movie that brilliantly compressed race relations in New York - and, by extension, the nation - into a single day on a single city block. He set Do the Right Thing on the hottest day of the summer in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a black neighbourhood with a lone Italian-American outpost: Sal&apos;s Famous Pizzeria. Frictions between the pizzeria&apos;s white owners and its black customers build until Sal, played by Danny Aiello, demands that a black youth, Radio Raheem, turn off the boom box on which he constantly plays Public Enemy&apos;s &quot;Fight the Power&quot;. Raheem refuses, Sal smashes the boom box with a bat, and the ensuing altercation results in the arrival of white police officers. They execute a restraint hold on Raheem and choke him to death. Soon after, Sal&apos;s delivery man, Mookie - played by Lee, and until this point the only character who bridged the white and black worlds - throws a rubbish bin through the pizzeria&apos;s window and sparks a riot. The movie ends with two quotations: a plea for nonviolence from Martin Luther King - &quot;The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind&quot; - followed by a quite different sentiment from Malcolm X: &quot;I am not against using violence in self-defence. I don&apos;t even call it violence when it&apos;s self-defence, I call it intelligence.&quot; When the movie debuted, at Cannes, in May 1989, Lee was asked, at a packed press conference, why he ended it with Malcolm X rather than with King. &quot;I think that in certain times both philosophies and approaches can be appropriate,&quot; he said. &quot;But in this day and age, in the Year of Our Lord 1989, I&apos;m leaning more towards the philosophies of Malcolm X.&quot; He added, &quot;When you&apos;re being beat upside the head with a brick, I don&apos;t think that young black America is just going to turn their cheek and say, &apos;Thank you, Jesus, for hitting me upside the head with this brick.&apos;&quot; Do the Right Thing changed the public perception of Lee. From the &quot;black Woody Allen&quot; he became a kind of Malcolm X of American cinema. Mo&apos; Better Blues, his next feature, was an attempt, inspired by his musician father, to defy stereotypes about black jazz artists as self-destructive drug addicts. But the movie included two venal Jewish club owners, Moe and Josh Flatbush (played by John Turturro and his younger brother, Nicholas), who exploit the film&apos;s black jazz musicians. Lee says that he was shocked when critics characterised the portrayal of the club owners as anti-Semitic. According to Lee, his lawyer at the time told him, &quot;This could really hurt your career. You better write an op-ed piece in the New York Times.&quot; Lee&apos;s piece, published in the summer of 1990 and titled &quot;I Am Not an Anti-Semite&quot;, was combative.  Lee is still angry about the accusations. &quot;They&apos;re, like, &apos;So, Spike, are you saying that every single Jewish person is a crook?&apos;&quot; he told me. &quot;Get the fuck out of here! That&apos;s crazy.&quot; When Lee and Dickerson were in film school, they often discussed their ideal movie project. &quot;For both of us, it was to try to do an adaptation of The Autobiography of Malcolm X,&quot; Dickerson says. Lee had first read the book in junior high school and later called it &quot;the most important book I&apos;ll ever read&quot;, saying that it &quot;changed the way I thought; it changed the way I acted&quot;. In 1990, Lee learned that the director Norman Jewison was going to make a movie about Malcolm X. Jewison had worked on the movie for almost a year, securing Denzel Washington for the lead role, digging up FBI transcripts and writing a script. Lee did not believe that a white director was up to the task - and said so in the press. Jewison told me, &quot;I feel that he had pulled the race card, so I met with him.&quot; Jewison agreed to turn the movie over to Lee, who began filming in 1991. The production was fraught with problems. &quot;We were trying to make a better movie than Warner Bros wanted,&quot; says Dickerson, who was the cinematographer. Lee refused to compromise, and eventually went to prominent members of the black community for money to complete the film as he envisioned it. Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson, Prince, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan all contributed money to the film, which ran three hours and included a sequence shot on location in Egypt. Malcolm X was released in 1992 to mixed reviews and a disappointing box-office take of about $10m in its first weekend. Through the rest of the 90s and into this decade, box-office returns for Lee&apos;s films followed a downward trend. Clockers, Lee&apos;s 1995 adaptation of Richard Price&apos;s novel, took in slightly more than $13m at the box office. Girl 6, the closest Lee has come to making a comedy since She&apos;s Gotta Have It, took in less than $5m. In 1998, he released He Got Game, for which he wrote the screenplay - his first since Jungle Fever. It won praise, even from Stanley Crouch, but took in only about $20m at the box office. Summer of Sam, Lee&apos;s bravura recreation of the dismal summer of 1977 - a film that Scorsese calls &quot;excellent&quot; and which deserved to be a commercial success - also failed to become a hit. In 2000 he wrote Bamboozled, a bitter satire about down-and-out African-American actors performing a hit TV show in blackface. The film lashed out indiscriminately at anyone whom Lee perceived to be exploiting black people - including the fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger (portrayed here as a character called Timmi Hillnigger) and gangsta-rap groups. (An avowed fan of hip-hop, Lee has nevertheless criticised 50 Cent and other rappers for promoting violence in black communities.) The movie took just over $2m. &quot;It got to where people would come up to me and say, &apos;Hey, when&apos;s your next movie coming out?&apos; - and I had one opening the next day,&quot; Lee recalled. In 1997, Lee criticised Quentin Tarantino for his use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; in his movies. Samuel L Jackson, the star of Tarantino&apos;s Jackie Brown, defended the director, telling reporters at the Berlin Film Festival that the movie was &quot;a wonderful homage to black exploitation films. This is a good film, and Spike hasn&apos;t made one of those in a few years.&quot; (Jackson had appeared in Do the Right Thing and, in a stunning performance, played a crack addict in Jungle Fever.) Lee responded by telling the Washington Post that Jackson&apos;s support for Tarantino was like a &quot;house Negro defending massa&quot; - one of his favourite taunts to African-Americans against whom he has a grudge.  During this time, however, Lee also made an acclaimed documentary. In 1997, he released 4 Little Girls, about the 1963 bombing of a Baptist church in Alabama, by members of the Ku Klux Klan - an act that helped to galvanise the civil rights movement. The film is notable for its emotional restraint; its outrage and grief are channelled through interviews with the dead girls&apos; parents. It was nominated for an Oscar for best feature-length documentary. &quot;There was something about the dignity of those people he encountered when he was making 4 Little Girls that had a very deep impact on him, and in some way they seemed to help him grow up,&quot; Stanley Crouch told me. &quot;When you&apos;ve got kids yourself and you&apos;re talking to the father of someone whose child was blown up by the kind of people who blew those kids up, and you see that this person is not ranting and raving in some kind of theatrical purported rage of the sort that you see in Do the Right Thing...&quot;  Lee is less restrained in comments that accompany the DVD for 4 Little Girls, in which he carps about losing the Oscar to Into the Arms of Strangers, a documentary about the effort to rescue Jewish children from the Nazis. &quot;When I found out that one of the films - one of the other five films nominated - was a film about the Holocaust, I knew we [had] lost,&quot; he says. In 2006, Lee made When the Levees Broke, a four-hour documentary for HBO about Hurricane Katrina. He made eight trips to New Orleans over six months and shot more than 100 interviews with survivors. The film catalogues the egregious federal response to the crisis, but its chief power is its record of the toll on the city&apos;s residents. Lee was criticised for including the testimony of New Orleans residents who said that they had heard explosions before the levees gave way, thus lending credibility to conspiracy theorists who believe that the government dynamited the levees, drowning the city&apos;s impoverished Lower Ninth Ward in order to spare wealthy parts of town. Lee argued that it was his &quot;duty&quot; to present these witnesses&apos; statements, and pointed out that he included other possible explanations for what they had heard. The film also features an interview with the historian Douglas Brinkley, who calls the bombing an &quot;urban myth&quot;. The success of Inside Man, in 2006, marked an upturn in his fortunes. &quot;I got slipped the script,&quot; he told me. &quot;It had been dormant at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer&apos;s company. I said, &apos;I&apos;d like to do this.&apos;&quot; Grazer wasn&apos;t particularly troubled that Lee had recently been making small movies. &quot;I&apos;d hired directors - great directors - that weren&apos;t at the highest moment of their career,&quot; he told me. &quot;What mattered to me was that in every movie, whether it was Bamboozled or Malcolm X or Do the Right Thing, he always shot good scenes. He always had good taste.&quot;  Lee made the movie look like a Hollywood blockbuster, with his signature fluid camera moves, Blanchard&apos;s gorgeous score and a twisty plot that was a clever deconstruction of the heist film: Clive Owen&apos;s bank-robber character is not robbing the bank after all. Lee also wrote a few race-conscious passages into the script, including one in which a Sikh is taken hostage in the bank. Released by Owen, the turbaned character is set upon by the police, who panic, call him a &quot;Fuckin&apos; Arab&quot; and haul him away. Lee says he knew the film was going to be a hit, but he didn&apos;t know how big. It grossed $176m worldwide, a record for Lee, and he immediately began planning two pet projects - one about the life of James Brown, the other about the riots in Los Angeles sparked by the acquittals of the police officers who beat Rodney King. &quot;But I could not get the financing,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I deluded myself into thinking that I have a little more leeway after my biggest hit.&quot; Instead, Lee decided to try to put Miracle at St Anna into production, but again was unable to secure funding from the Hollywood studios. Eventually, he raised the money from European sources. &quot;Touchstone Pictures came on last, as American distributor.&quot; Lee is philosophical about the difficulty he has had funding his latest projects. &quot;The people who can get films made are Spielberg, Lucas, cats like that,&quot; he told me. &quot;Whatever they want to do, they get made. Everybody else? It&apos;s a battle. Woody Allen has not made his last three or four films in England and his last one in Barcelona by choice. He had to go where the financing was.&quot;  The next time we met was in midtown Manhattan. Lee was wearing a white Ralph Lauren sweat jacket with the word &quot;Beijing&quot; across the back and the Olympics logo on the front. &quot;Let&apos;s walk,&quot; he said, and started up Madison, moving at a good pace. To walk with Lee in midtown Manhattan is to experience the metropolis reduced to a small town. Every species of New Yorker - from homeless people to businessmen in pin-striped suits - recognised and hailed him. Passing cab drivers shouted, &quot;Spike!&quot; Cyclists, pedestrians, people waiting at bus stops, elderly white ladies smiled and nodded hello. Lee acknowledged them all with an expressionless nod of the head, or a quickly raised right hand. At 57th Street, Lee charged across a red light. As he approached the Niketown store, he noticed that a crowd of young men had collected on the sidewalk. &quot;Sneakerheads,&quot; as Lee calls them, have been known to camp out in front of the stores for up to a week when the company introduces a new shoe. &quot;Yo!&quot; Lee shouted. &quot;I got to find out what this is!&quot; He hurried over. The kids, some of whom had set up camp chairs, did a double-take, then exclaimed in disbelief, &quot;Spike!&quot; Lee shook their hands. &quot;What&apos;s about to drop?&quot; he asked. &quot;Tomorrow. Questlove&apos;s Nike Air,&quot; a white kid replied. Questlove is the drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots. &quot;Say, Spike - when is the new Spi&apos;zike coming out?&quot; another kid asked. Spi&apos;zike is the name of a limited-edition trainer - a mash-up of several early styles of Air Jordan - released by Nike in 2007 in honour of Lee&apos;s Mars Blackmon adverts. Lee told the kids that a new black-and-gold version was going to be out soon. &quot;The black-and-gold is out in Europe,&quot; one of the kids said. &quot;What?&quot; Lee said. &quot;No, it&apos;s not.&quot; &quot;I got a picture,&quot; the kid said, waving his BlackBerry. He showed Lee a photograph he had taken of the black-and-gold Spi&apos;zike. &quot;Shit,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I gotta make a call.&quot; He took out his BlackBerry and dialled the number of his contact at Nike. He got voicemail and hung up. &quot;How long you been out here?&quot; he asked the kids. &quot;Four days,&quot; the kids said. In the evening of Hillary Clinton&apos;s concession speech, Lee had sent me a two-word text message: &quot;Changes everything.&quot; I now asked him what he meant. &quot;Changes the whole dynamic,&quot; he said. &quot;If we have a black president, maybe it will change people&apos;s psyche.&quot; Specifically, he meant African-Americans. He went on, &quot;They don&apos;t have to be shuckin&apos; and jivin&apos; - doing the tap dance - to make a living. And I mean that &apos;tap dancing&apos; figuratively, not literally, because no disrespect to the world&apos;s greatest tap dancer, Savion Glover.&quot; I asked Lee about the debate in the mainstream press over Obama&apos;s blackness. (Time had run a story in February 2007 titled &quot;Is Obama Black Enough?&quot; and the question had since been taken up by CNN, CBS News, the Washington Post, and other news organisations.) He snorted. &quot;It&apos;s ignorance,&quot; he said. &quot;Here&apos;s the thing. I&apos;m not one of these people who&apos;re going to be defined by the ghetto mentality, that you have to have been shot, have numerous babies from many women, be ignorant, getting high all the time, walking around with pants hanging from your ass - and that&apos;s a black man? I&apos;m not buying that. That&apos;s not my definition. Are there some black people like that? Yes. But if one speaks proper English, wears a shirt and a tie...&quot; Lee was suddenly distracted by someone across the street. In a booming voice, he yelled, &quot;What&apos;s up, Nick?&quot; Stopped in traffic, in a silver SUV with the driver&apos;s window down, was Nicholas Turturro, who played one of the Jewish jazz-club owners in Mo&apos; Better Blues. &quot;Yo, buddy! Like the hat!&quot; Turturro shouted, pointing at Lee&apos;s Yankees cap, featuring a pattern of winning pennants. &quot;What size you wear?&quot; Lee bellowed. &quot;I got one already!&quot; &quot;Got one? You gotta get one for your brother! Time is running out!&quot; Turturro drove off, and Lee resumed talking about Obama&apos;s run for president. &quot;This thing is not by accident,&quot; he said. &quot;I think this thing is ordained - it&apos;s providence. It&apos;s bigger than him, it&apos;s bigger than all of us. I think this is going to be such a pivotal moment in history that you can measure time by BB, Before Barack, and AB, After Barack. That&apos;s what I feel is going to happen.&quot; He went on, &quot;There&apos;s ramifications all over the world. I mean, I know this is a presidential election for the United States of America, but this thing is worldwide news. It&apos;s not like they rang every door in Berlin to say, &apos;Barack&apos;s going to be here,&apos; for 200,000 people to show up. Two hundred thousand can come to see McCain but they&apos;re going to be protesting, and burning American flags and who knows what else?&quot; He laughed. &quot;If we were talking about two boxers, Muhammad Ali would say, &apos;He&apos;s too old, and he&apos;s too slow!&apos; And he would say, &apos;I&apos;m too young and too pretty and too fast.&apos;&quot; Lee clapped his hands. In our earlier conversations, I had tried several times to get Lee to say whether he, routinely held up as an exemplar of the angry, activist black artist, felt out of step in the supposedly &quot;post-racial&quot; world embodied by Obama. He had dodged or ignored my questions. But he seemed to offer an oblique answer when I asked if he had thought about making a television commercial for Obama&apos;s campaign. After all, Obama and his wife had gone to see Do the Right Thing on their first date, in 1989, and then had discussed Mookie&apos;s act of throwing the rubbish bin through Sal&apos;s window. &quot;You gotta be asked to do that stuff,&quot; Lee said. &quot;Look, if they need me, they know where I am. And in a lot of ways they might...&quot; He paused. &quot;You know, that shit could be used against them, too. &apos;Spike Lee, the man who said so-and-so and so-and-so. Now he&apos;s doing commercials for...&apos;&quot; He shrugged and smiled. &quot;Sometimes you might be a liability,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Just got to lay in the cut.&quot;  Lee did keep a low media profile. Behind the scenes, it was a different story. On 1 November, three days before the election, he travelled to Florida and plunged into the inner-city black Miami neighbourhood of Liberty City, known for its heavy crime and 80% unemployment rate. There, Lee helped shepherd residents of the local housing estates on to a bus bound for the voting stations. &quot;Get on the bus!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Do the right thing! Don&apos;t be bamboozled!&quot; And on election night he was in the crowd at Grant Park in Chicago for Obama&apos;s acceptance speech, snapping pictures on his BlackBerry. The next morning he would appear, via satellite, on Morning Joe, a political morning show, where he said that, with Obama&apos;s victory, his own masterpiece - Do the Right Thing - was now irrelevant. &quot;That is history,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a new America.&quot; To me, he kept it short but sweet. When  I emailed him that morning to ask, &quot;Are you having fun yet?&quot; he answered with one word: &quot;Amen.&quot; \u2022 A longer version of this story first appeared in the New Yorker \u00a9 John Colapinto \u2022 The Miracle at St Anna will be released later this year"}, {"sentences": ["A folk novel weaving history and legend was written about him during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), but it was an 18th-century version that Van Gulik found in a Tokyo book store, that became the source of his own 1949 translation and subsequent series of 20-plus novels and short stories between 1957 and 1968."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-05T15:09:29Z", "title": "Andy Lau takes on case of Detective Dee", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/05/andy-lau-detective-dee", "article": "Sherlock Holmes it is not.

As a TV special about 2006&apos;s infamous real-life Texas cheerleader scandal (in which, to quote the Dallas Morning News &quot;psycho mutant harpies&quot; terrorised a Texas school like &quot;greedy and sadistic rampaging Visigoths&quot;) hit US TV screens, cheerleading was confirmed as the most violent and dangerous sport on the planet, and Indian cricket was rocked to its very foundations by a &quot;vulgar and obscene&quot; cheerleading controversy, real-time cheerleading in George Bush&apos;s America was rocked by a devastating series of moral, aesthetic and criminal outrages. Scandal followed crime-spree followed rampage followed savage beating followed rude picture outrage after rude picture outrage as the sport&apos;s seemingly never-ending vortex of drugs, booze, sexploitation, violence and kidnapping once again hurtled spectacularly out of control along the very edge of the cliff of utter and total chaos, making 2008 a vintage year for connoisseurs of bad cheerleaders. Particular kudos goes to the varsity cheerleaders of the Morton Ranch High School in Katy, Texas who were sent to trial accused of blindfolding junior cheerleaders in bandages, duct-taping their hands, &quot;flicking their body parts&quot;, wrapping them in cling film and then pushing them into a swimming pool. And that&apos;s not all. &quot;When a girl (beep) in her pants and puts her pants on another girl&apos;s head, that&apos;s just disgusting,&quot; said the sister of one defiled junior, according to a local newspaper.\u00a0 In Florida, six cheerleaders aged 14-17 kidnapped and \u2014 in a beating that lasted half an hour \u2014 hurt another cheerleader so badly she needed hospital treatment for concussion. And they then allegedly tried to post a video of the attack on MySpace. In West Virginia  female cheerleaders sued male cheerleaders for sexual harassment. In North Carolina a cheerleader from a private Christian high school was busted for selling drugs. In Nacogdoches, Texas, cheerleaders  mock executed a rival school&apos;s mascot with handguns. In New England a Patriots cheerleader was fired for drawing penises, swastikas and antisemitic slurs on drunk people. And the Arizona State Cheerleaders had naughty pics leaked on the internet as did the Sacramento Kings cheerleaders, a school cheerleading team in Seattle, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers cheerleading squad, the Orange Coast College cheerleaders in Costa Mesa, California, the cheerleaders at a school in North Carolina, and the Cleveland Cavs cheerleaders. And then there was the 33-year-old mom in Wisconsin who stole her 15-year-old daughter&apos;s identity so she could join the cheerleading team (she was discovered when the cheque for her cheerleading uniform bounced). Further exploring what feminists call &quot;the madonna/whore dichotomy&quot; (in the land that prides itself on possessing the morals of 16th-century Holland and yet produces over 98% of the world&apos;s hardcore pornography), the University of Idaho cheerleaders were embroiled in a too-sexy-uniform scandal. In October there was a national outcry when USA Networks &quot;degayed&quot; the out gay cheerleader character Les in a screening of the movie Bring It On (while leaving untouched the film&apos;s several homophobic slurs). This follows the removal of a gay cheerleader character from Heroes in 2007. Cheerleader scandal wasn&apos;t limited to the US. In Tokyo a boy killed himself after being violently bullied by other cheerleaders. And in India there were allegations that two British cricket cheerleaders were asked to sit out a match because their skin was &quot;too dark&quot;.

As Japan greeted the Year of the Ox amid mounting pessimism over the state of its economy, more than 500 recently sacked workers queued up in a central Tokyo park for free food and shelter, and advice on how to survive recession in the world&apos;s second biggest economy. The jobless who have spent most of the past week in Hibiya Park, a stone&apos;s throw from Japan&apos;s parliament, are among tens of thousands of temporary workers who were laid off at the end of last year. More than 85,000 temporary and part-time workers are set to lose their jobs by the end of March, far higher than the 55,000 estimated earlier in the year. But Tetsushi Sakamoto, a senior Liberal Democratic party MP, sparked anger when he suggested that the park&apos;s new residents were workshy. &quot;I wonder if they are really serious about working,&quot; he said, before comparing them to radical student activists in the late 1960s. Sakamoto later apologised for the remark but has came under mounting pressure to resign. &quot;The remarks were so insulting that a retraction is not enough,&quot; said Yukio Hatoyama, secretary general of the opposition Democratic party. &quot;He should be dismissed immediately.&quot; A network of unions and community groups opened the soup kitchen on the new year to provide emergency help to the ranks of the new destitute \u2013 mainly men under 50 who once worked for subcontractors that make and supply parts for major Japanese exporters. Earlier this week the residents were moved to vacant schools and government buildings, where they will be allowed to stay until 12 January. Around the country, about 3,700 people spent the holidays in temporary accommodation, many of them men who had been laid off from temporary jobs. The country&apos;s car industry is in the midst of laying off more than 6,000 contract workers, including 3,000 of them at Toyota, which today announced more temporary factory closures in over the next three months. Sony, meanwhile, is to cut 8,000 temporary jobs worldwide by the end of March 2010 and a report today said Sanyo was considering cutting 1,000 workers in the coming months. Temporary workers were a rarity in the Japanese manufacturing industry until former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi&apos;s free market reforms in 2004 enabled firms to use non-regular labour in their factories. Now, about one in three Japanese workers are on part-time or temporary contracts. According to the health and welfare ministry, the number of temporary workers reached 3.8 million last year, almost 20% more than in 2007. The number rose by more than 90% in the manufacturing sector alone. In better days, the arrangement suited employers keen to cut personnel costs, and gave workers the freedom to move between jobs. But, as the recent flurry of layoffs proves, it also made temporary workers very expendable. In response, MPs are debating a proposal to restrict the use of so-called &quot;dispatch workers&quot; in manufacturing. &quot;I hope the discussions will lead towards a ban on day labour dispatch,&quot; Yoichi Masuzoe, the labour minister, told reporters. Volunteers at Hibiya Park said they had been overwhelmed by the number of people seeking help after the global financial crisis forced Japanese companies to slash workforces. &quot;We didn&apos;t expect so many people to turn up,&quot; said Satoshi Tokairin, a camp organiser. &quot;We knew there would be a big problem over the new year and asked the government to act quickly. But they didn&apos;t listen.&quot; Toru Hayashi is typical of the thousands who were turfed out of their company lodging as soon as they became unemployed. &quot;I have no job, no money and nowhere to live,&quot; said Hayashi, who lost his job with an office furniture supplier early last month. &quot;The sub-prime crisis has hit real-estate and we got only half the orders we had the previous year.&quot; The 45-year-old, who has spent the past few weeks sleeping in a 24-hour internet cafe, makes no attempt to hide his contempt for prime minister Taro Aso&apos;s response to the economic crisis. &quot;The government talks a lot but does nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;Aso is hopeless. We are having to depend on the generosity of ordinary people to make it through the bad times.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It was all over T4 like a rash last weekend - presenter Steve Jones wore a bomber jacket in Tokyo, while Alex James in (unfortunate) leather trousers was dishing out advice to new bands on Unsigned Act."], "tags": ["Men's fashion", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-09T00:01:00Z", "title": "Second skin: Leather for men is back with a vengeance", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/09/fashion-leather-jackets", "article": "Marlon Brando&apos;s brooding figure on a motorcycle in The Wild One is probably the most memorable modern image of a man in leather. Released in America in 1954, the film was immediately banned in Britain, but the actor&apos;s rebellious image caught on. The leather jacket, based on a second world war design by Schott Brothers of New York, was not initially easy to source in the UK. But in 1956 British company Lewis Leathers launched the Bronx jacket, aimed at a teenage audience - and it was all about getting the macho Brando look.  &quot;The association of leather and masculinity is timeless,&quot; says Tony Glenville, creative director of media and communications at the London College of Fashion, &quot;spanning everything from cavemen through to gladiators, to second world war flying aces, and encompassing cowboys and rock bands along the way.&quot; Adding manly bulk, leather has been the ideal style choice throughout popular culture, from Brando and James Dean to Sid Vicious and Bruce Springsteen, to suggest strength and rebellion. Consequently, the leather jacket has maintained its popularity. As Catherine Hayward, fashion director of Esquire, says: &quot;Leather is built to last.&quot;  At the moment you cannot move for men toughing it up in leather. It was all over T4 like a rash last weekend - presenter Steve Jones wore a bomber jacket in Tokyo, while Alex James in (unfortunate) leather trousers was dishing out advice to new bands on Unsigned Act. High School Musical&apos;s singing pin-up Zac Efron recently added a dash of rock to his look with a Strokes-like vintage style number, while David Beckham jetted into Heathrow a couple of days later, in black leather jacket, jeans and a Mark Owen-style trilby. Even Bill Clinton has been at it. In Times Square, seeing in 2009 with Hillary, the former president opted for a neat and expensive-looking take on the leather trend. Lynx must be hoping this current leather love fest continues, as they launch a new fragrance based on its smell. According to Antonia Bird, Lynx&apos;s senior brand manager, new Lynx Instinct embraces a return to masculinity and reflects a wider consumer trend towards leather in fashion, film and music culture. With an advert starring clay model cavemen that encourages wearers to &quot;unleash the man leather&quot; (interpret this as you will), the message, says Bird, is to encourage guys to &quot;rediscover their primal side, giving them the confidence to get the girl&quot;. It&apos;s not exactly subtle, and Lynx is not the first to dabble in leather-based scents, but at \u00a32.79, it is a lot cheaper than a bottle of Tom Ford Tuscan Leather cologne. On the high street, despite the credit-crunch gloom, Topman notes brisk leather business. A spokesperson reports leather jacket sales are up 76% on last year and Gap&apos;s 965 leather jacket (military front pockets, high collar), dashingly modelled by Joseph Fiennes, continues to be a bestseller, despite its \u00a3245 price tag.  It&apos;s virtually impossible to imagine modern man&apos;s wardrobe without leather, though as Glenville says, &quot;It was not until the 1960s that designers such as Pierre Cardin really began experimenting with leather in terms of clothing.&quot; During the 70s, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren successfully merged subculture with fashion, bringing rocker and fetishistic looks to the public&apos;s attention.  From the 80s onwards, designer leather became increasingly commonplace. Gianni Versace was a keen experimenter with the fabric. In his menswear collection for spring/summer 1993 he produced several looks incorporating leather: a biker jacket with metallic studs, a fringed jacket with silver metal beads and a waistcoat featuring a zip and corset-like lacing.  As designers such as Rick Owens and brands such as All Saints have developed increasingly sophisticated means of cutting leather, the fabric has become even more versatile. In recent years, the fit has become sleeker and ideal for showcasing gym-buffed bodies. Bafflingly, many men wrongly believe that wearing leather makes them look younger. &quot;As soon as you put a leather jacket on to look younger, it has the opposite effect,&quot; says Hayward. &quot;It becomes a bit Neil Diamond or Tom Jones in that sort of ageing rock star way. Take the Rolling Stones - they still wear leather sometimes and yet look much better dressed in softer tailoring.&quot;  This coming season there is also a micro trend for coloured leather. Cue Dior Homme&apos;s catwalk featuring a shiny tiny pink leather biker jacket, or the more wearable blue nappa suede blouson by Mulberry. Approach this trend with caution though. Note how the super-colourful hooded tops favoured by X Factor finalists JLS looked fun on the show but when transformed into leather (yellow, green, pink and cobalt), the effect was simply tacky.  Looking for something timeless but cut in leather is a sensible route - this is when the fabric becomes an investment. Hayward advises plumping for &quot;forever labels such as Bottega Veneta or Herm\u00e8s where the leather is usually handmade or go for something cheaper that has that crumpled, lived-in look - Topman and Cos have good options&quot;. Burberry&apos;s smoky green washed leather car coat offers classic versatility, albeit on a designer budget. Try wearing either as you would a trench, perhaps with a shirt and tie.  Clinton&apos;s neat zip-fronted jacket proves older men can wear leather, but shape becomes increasingly important. Hayward says, &quot;If you have a chunky figure, you have to be careful with leather jackets. It sounds terrible but it can become a bit suburban nightclub.&quot; American label Theory has a soft grey leather suit blazer, which teamed with casual trousers and an open-collared shirt could be ideal for weekend wear.  And finally, should you find yourself tempted to put leather anywhere near your legs - yes, shame on you, Alex James - step away from the changing room. In fact, probably best to leave the shop altogether."}, {"sentences": ["But the apparently respectable businesswoman, the eldest daughter of a Scottish publican and mother of a law graduate, has also been named by Serbian prosecutors as the mastermind of an audacious raid on a jeweller&apos;s in Tokyo in 2004, when \u00a320m worth of diamond jewellery was stolen."], "tags": ["Scotland", "Extradition", "Italy", "Crime", "UK news", "World news", "Law", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-10T00:01:00Z", "title": "Scottish businesswoman faces jail in Italy over robberies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/10/scotland-extradition", "article": "A Scottish businesswoman who has been convicted for a series of frauds and armed robberies in Milan is to be extradited to Italy after losing a long-running battle to avoid serving nearly five years in prison.  At a 90-second hearing at the appeal court in Edinburgh yesterday, Dorothy Fasola was told she was being handed over to Italian prosecutors to serve a sentence of four years and seven months for faking banknotes and stealing jewellery in the north Italian city.  Until yesterday Fasola, 59, had spent more than seven years running a successful fish and seafood export business from Peterhead, Britain&apos;s largest fishing port, north of Aberdeen.  But the apparently respectable businesswoman, the eldest daughter of a Scottish publican and mother of a law graduate, has also been named by Serbian prosecutors as the mastermind of an audacious raid on a jeweller&apos;s in Tokyo in 2004, when \u00a320m worth of diamond jewellery was stolen.  The theft - blamed on the notorious &quot;Pink Panther&quot; gang - included a necklace studded with 116 diamonds worth \u00a317m, called the Comtesse de Vendome. Fasola has denied any involvement in that raid, and neither the Japanese nor Serbian authorities have sought her extradition or formally charged her. Three Serbians, allegedly her accomplices, have since been charged and tried in Belgrade for their part in the conspiracy. Her convictions and arrests in Italy include offences dating back more than 25 years, when she and her late husband Luigi Fasola were accused of peddling stolen jewellery on an Italian cable TV shopping channel in 1983. Two women alleged rings being sold on the show had been stolen from them. In 1989 Fasola was amongst 10 people arrested at a print works churning out fake $100 bills but she again escaped prosecution. However in 1991 she was arrested after orchestrating an armed raid on a jeweller&apos;s where 30kg of gold was stolen.  According to two European arrest warrants issued by Italian prosecutors and upheld yesterday by the appeal court, she was tried and sentenced in 1998 to four years and two months in prison for the gold robbery. But Fasola was released pending an appeal and in 1999, while facing a further trial for allegedly using fake credit cards, Fasola fled Italy for Scotland.  A court in Milan sentenced her to a further four years for her role in the money counterfeiting operation in 1989. Those jail terms have since been reduced."}, {"sentences": ["Well, it&apos;s certainly not as clever as the prototype I saw at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2007 (an electric version: now that would have been something to get excited about), but there is one obvious market for it: Smart owners with friends."], "tags": ["Motoring", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-10T00:01:00Z", "title": "On the road: Toyota iQ2", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/10/road-motoring-review-toyota-iq2", "article": "The three of us circle the Toyota iQ2 warily, eyeing its truncated rear and thinking the same thing: &quot;There&apos;s no way I&apos;m getting in the back of that.&quot; It&apos;s your classic, back-seat Mexican stand-off. &quot;How are we going to get all the gear in?&quot; says Mark, the camera assistant.  &quot;Let&apos;s see,&quot; I say, trying to be positive. If we loiter any longer, people will think we&apos;re trying to nick it. I set about folding down the driver&apos;s side rear seat and pushing the front passenger seat forward. There is more space on the passenger side because, instead of a glovebox, the iQ has only a slimline leather wallet. They have virtually removed that half of the dashboard, which frees up loads more leg-room.  The subtle jockeying for front seat position has begun. I head for the passenger door, appearing to sacrifice myself to the indignities of the rear seat, then, suddenly, I feint to the left and shimmy to the right like a young Cruyff (or perhaps John Sergeant after too many mince pies), before double-backing to hold the door open with a polite smile. Mark, who was pretending to tie a shoelace (did he really think he&apos;d win with that old trick?), realises he has been outmanoeuvered, sighs, and folds himself into the back beside a motley assortment of bags and cases. The photographer, who was studying his light meter intently, nabs the passenger seat. &quot;Any chance I can move back a little?&quot; he asks. Mark, to his astonishment, says that, actually, yes, he can.  In fact, if it wasn&apos;t for the camera gear, we could have squeezed a shorty behind me, too. That would be four grown-ups in a car 265cm long: just a ruler&apos;s length longer than the two-seater Smart. Remarkable.  As you&apos;d expect, the iQ&apos;s turning circle is Bubble car tight. If it&apos;s been raining and you&apos;re a bit jerky with the throttle, you can skid the whole thing around 90 degrees on its back wheels. Mark, rubbing the back of his head, grunts that I&apos;m not to do that again. But the iQ&apos;s unexpected forte becomes apparent only as I barrel down the slip road towards the motorway. I instinctively turn up the stereo - via a dinky little joystick on the steering wheel - and brace myself for sonic torture, but for a three-cylinder, one-litre car it is amazingly quiet. In the wheelie-bin Smart, passing juggernauts can make you feel vulnerable, like the Borrowers at a roller disco, but the iQ feels like a &quot;proper&quot; car.  Mark&apos;s head may be just a couple of centimetres from the back window, but you don&apos;t feel so exposed up front: there is almost as much shoulder space inside the iQ as in its larger brother, the Auris. That&apos;s impressive, but if we look lower down the Toyota range, we encounter a problem. While the Fiat 500 comfortably out-cutes the iQ, and the new Ford Ka is a sharper drive, the iQ&apos;s biggest threat comes from a sibling: the excellent Aygo, at almost \u00a33,000 less. Is the iQ, like the Audi A2 before it, too clever and costly for its own good? Well, it&apos;s certainly not as clever as the prototype I saw at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2007 (an electric version: now that would have been something to get excited about), but there is one obvious market for it: Smart owners with friends.

Slumdog Millionaire, which opened in the UK yesterday, is a modern-day fairytale about the quintessential Indian dream of getting ahead, getting out and getting rich. To millions of slum dwellers in India, it&apos;s a familiar theme. The chances of emulating the movie&apos;s protagonist may be small, but many real-life slumdogs demonstrate a fierce optimism that they will achieve a better life, despite their dismal surroundings.  Like the setting of the film, Delhi&apos;s Wazirpur slum is lined by shacks packed so tightly they are accessible only by walking in single file past oozing sewers. In a tiny bare brick space, barely two metres by two and a half, diminutive Priya Oriya eats, cooks, bathes, sleeps and watches television. She shares the room with another woman. Priya, 17, has chosen to be a slumdog, and her life reads like a film script. After fleeing the rural hopelessness of West Bengal&apos;s tea gardens five years ago, she left her family when they fought with her over her boyfriend, a Muslim. Several abortions later, the couple are still together. &quot;I can do what I want here. I am too young to have children. I came here for a better life and I would not go back,&quot; says Priya, who earns 2,500 rupees (\u00a335) a month as a domestic servant. &quot;In the village there are no jobs. What would I do?&quot; In the freedom of the slum, she can wear what she likes and buy what she wants: a mobile phone, a CD player and a television. Although illiterate, Priya says she wants a &quot;big house&quot;. &quot;Why not? I will work for it.&quot; Like the movie portrayal, crime is never far away. Priya&apos;s younger brother became addicted to glue sniffing after joining a local gang.  &quot;I used to roam the alleys at night looking for him. Once I got him out I sent him to live with my father. He&apos;s too young to be on his own here,&quot; she says. Although the landscape of Indian cities has become dotted with new apartment blocks and gated communities of whitewashed mansions, these sit as small islands in seas of slums.  More than half of the residents of India&apos;s two biggest cities, Mumbai and Delhi, live in slums. By 2025, the population of each is expected to be exceeded only by that of Tokyo.  The most striking feature of slum life is the smell. Sewage runs freely and the stench of faeces is ever present.  Yet most people are getting on with everyday life. There are temples, mosques and churches. Children play in the dirt. Stallholders sell everything from gas canisters to saucepans on the streets. On the roof of her tenement block, 20-year-old Sunita Khatri Chhetri, who cleans factories for a living, laughs when she is told about this movie about slums and the young people who thrive inside them. &quot;It is good. We are people also. If you are in the village you cannot improve yourself. In the city you are able to be in touch with people who are higher up in society,&quot; she says in a mixture of Hindi and English. &quot;I am looking to move up. Who is not?&quot; Indian critics say Slumdog Millionaire is likely to break social taboos in India: a movie lauded around the world that will shine a spotlight on the widespread apathy about poverty.  Binoo K John, deputy editor and columnist on Mail Today, said Slumdog Millionaire gave &quot;hope to the poor in way we have never seen before&quot;. &quot;Books and films in India are generally about the elite&apos;s aspirations and their disappointments,&quot; he said. &quot;Bollywood is about family. It is about marriages. The poor, especially the urban poor, never get redemption in works of fiction in India. That is what makes Slumdog Millionaire such a fantastic film.&quot; There has been some debate about whether the film can claim to be authentically Indian. Slumdog Millionaire was directed by the British filmmaker Danny Boyle, best known for the frenetically bleak Trainspotting. The film is based on a novel, Q&amp;A, by the Indian writer and diplomat Vikas Swarup, and adapted by Simon Beaufoy, the British screenwriter best known for his Oscar-winner The Full Monty. Although a third of the movie is in Hindi, Slumdog has little to do with conventional Indian cinema, where films are invariably framed by glamorous foreign locations, family feuding and overblown fight-cum-dance sequences. Bollywood recreates Indian city streets in a studio. Boyle filmed in the warren of Mumbai&apos;s biggest slum, setting up cameras in red-light areas. Loveleen Tandan, who shares co-directing credits with Boyle, said Slumdog was &quot;an outsider&apos;s view of India, but one that is sensitive to another culture. It&apos;s got a cutting-edge look mixed in with an Indian potboiler story about gangsters and a girl stuck in the middle.&quot; She said the British director wanted a Dickensian-style tale set in an Indian city. &quot;Similar to the way Charles Dickens used Victorian London, Slumdog&apos;s got a dark side.&quot; Some experts likened Boyle&apos;s movie to last year&apos;s Booker prize winner, The White Tiger, which sparked a debate on domestic servitude. Miloon Kothari, the former UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, said Slumdog could do the same by capturing on film a sense of how people survive in horrendous conditions. &quot;There&apos;s a denial in the middle classes in India about the need for slums. Slums provide the labour in a city and are vibrant places. If the film can raise a debate about these things it should be welcomed.&quot; Urban sprawl The number of people living in urban areas has exceeded those in the countryside for the first time, according to a report by the UN last year. India was forecast to contain three of the 10 largest megalopolises by 2025. Most urban dwellers in India live in slums, under tin roofs with little access to clean water and electricity. The global issue of how much living space a person needs is likely to become more acute, especially in India, where the 1.1 billion population is expected to exceed China&apos;s 1.3 billion within a few decades. According to UN figures, 55% of India&apos;s city dwellers live in a space less than 3 sq metres (10 sq ft); against 900 sq ft for the average American. Dharavi, in Mumbai, where Slumdog Millionaire is set, is reported to be the largest slum in Asia, with about a million people per square mile. However, it may not be around much longer: officials plan to replace it with free homes as part of a $2.3bn (\u00a31.2bn) redevelopment scheme.

I try to make a note of what she is wearing as we walk towards her office past innumerable clothes rails and dismembered mannequin limbs. But, finally, I have to own up: I don&apos;t know how. Patiently, she agrees to help. &quot;I&apos;m wearing a full dress,&quot; she explains, &quot;which is in a cream colour. It&apos;s from H&amp;M. And then I like layering things up, so I like wearing little skinny tops underneath, and then I&apos;ve got a little skinny belt, again in black, black skinny jeans and then I&apos;ve got some shoe-boots on.&quot; Shoe-boots? Could that mean one of each? &quot;They&apos;re kind of in between shoes and boots,&quot; she clarifies, showing them to me. And so they are.  Is it a prerequisite of the job, then, dressing with this sort of care? &quot;I think you do think about what you wear more than other jobs,&quot; she agrees, &quot;because if you came in looking like you were wearing something boring every day, people would think, &apos;Oh yeah, she really knows what she&apos;s talking about!&apos;&quot; The words are spoken without resentment, her tone matter-of-fact. But then I have not come to see her in New York or Tokyo, or even London, though she visits those places often enough. Instead, we are in an industrial estate in rural Leicestershire. Outside the window is a car park and a ploughed field. It is in these unglamorous surroundings, and aged just 27, that Davis is responsible for designing the entire girlswear range for Asda&apos;s George label, Britain&apos;s largest retailer of children&apos;s clothes. You would have thought this alone would put her under enough pressure each day, even if it didn&apos;t matter what she wore. Wouldn&apos;t it be a relief sometimes just to pull on yesterday&apos;s jeans and hope her T-shirt would iron itself on the way to work? &quot;But it&apos;s not an effort,&quot; she insists. &quot;You love fashion, that&apos;s why you&apos;re doing it, so it&apos;s good fun. It&apos;s almost like a little bit of a social atmosphere when you come in every day. Like when girls go out at night and they see what each other is wearing. It&apos;s nice.&quot; Not that this means Davis spends all morning deciding how to dress, of course. Oh no. &quot;Because sometimes I have to sort my stuff out the night before,&quot; she says, without a trace of irony. &quot;But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a massive amount of time. I&apos;ve got things in my wardrobe that I like, so I just put different things together.  &quot;I&apos;ve got friends who don&apos;t work in fashion that worry about what they wear a lot more than I do.&quot; And actually I can believe it. Though her manner is light and airy, even faintly vague at times, Davis does not strike me as a woman who wastes time. But then one does not just glide into a career as competitive as fashion design. &quot;Along the way, people did try to discourage me,&quot; she remembers. &quot;They were like, &apos;Oh, it&apos;s really competitive.&apos; I don&apos;t think people saw it as one of those jobs you could actually do. It&apos;s one of those things that you dream about, but never get the opportunity to do. But I was always quite determined ... I just thought, it&apos;s what I love, and it&apos;s what I want to do. So I&apos;ve got to try and do it.&quot; And with people as formidable as Davis out there, the competition must have been fierce, indeed. Art has always run in her family, for a start, so she has been drawing and designing for as long as she can remember. But it was through clothes that she most wanted to express herself. &quot;I don&apos;t remember the feeling of, &apos;Oh, I want to be a fashion designer!&apos;&quot; she says. &quot;But when I was clearing out my room a couple of years ago I found a little book from infant school about what you want to do when you grow up. I had drawn a picture of myself as a fashion designer, and I&apos;d written, &apos;I want to be a fashion designer when I grow up&apos;.&quot; At the time, she was just six years old. &quot;I think it&apos;s quite weird,&quot; she shrugs, &quot;but apparently I&apos;d written it down, so I must have wanted to do it.&quot; After getting three As in her A-levels, and then studying fashion at Nottingham Trent University, Davis was immediately snapped up by Laura Ashley. &quot;They&apos;d seen my portfolio and some of my sketches and they really liked them,&quot; she recalls without conceit. &quot;I just got this call out of the blue saying, &apos;Can you come in and have an interview?&apos; And I was just like, &apos;Yup. I&apos;ll do it.&apos; Because I think once you&apos;ve got your first job it&apos;s easy then, because you&apos;ve got a bit of experience and you can build on it. Getting that first job is the challenge.&quot; At Laura Ashley, Davis worked as an assistant supporting other designers, but in her next job at, erm, Next, she finally got the chance to develop her own visions - such as her first ever commercial garment, a pair of boy&apos;s cargo trousers. &quot;I did the artwork for it as well,&quot; she remembers, her eyes bright with excitement, &quot;and I put my initials in. It was hidden among all the different numbers and letters. It was a kind of boyswear collegic distressed print on the trouser. That got produced, and I bought one!&quot; Since then, in her three years at George, Davis&apos;s output has not been large. It has been enormous. With just one assistant, and the support of one knitwear and one graphic designer, she is expected to design roughly 300 different items of clothing for each six-month season.  But despite having so much to get through, the pleasure she gets of noticing her creations out in the world has never wavered. &quot;I see people on the telly wearing it, like on Coronation Street,&quot; she says. &quot;And there was a really naughty little girl on Supernanny the other day. Every single day she was wearing a different George outfit that I&apos;d done, which was quite good.&quot; For now, Davis says she is very happy as a girlswear designer.  At college her passion was for wedding gowns, and pretty dresses still fire her imagination, but the security of a steady job has always been equally important. &quot;That sounds a bit sensible,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&apos;s what I wanted.&quot;  One day she may branch out on her own, she admits, but not yet. &quot;To have a dress or something that sells 20,000 pieces a week is quite an achievement. But it&apos;s a different kind of achievement.&quot; Even so, it can be a battle to get that dress into the stores.  This afternoon, Davis has a selection meeting with management, at which she will present her latest range - an array of little skirts and shorts for a summer that still feels very far away. If her bosses like them, the designs will appear in Asda in a few months. If they don&apos;t, Davis will argue harder. &quot;We really fight for what we want in meetings,&quot; she says, &quot;and sometimes it can get a bit heated, because I have to really stand up for my designs. It&apos;s my job to do that.  &quot;I have to make sure that the range looks as exciting and as new as possible for the customers. So I will fight ... I&apos;m always like, &apos;No, don&apos;t chuck that one out! I love that one!&apos; And they&apos;re like, &apos;We can&apos;t afford it!&apos;&quot; To accommodate her bosses&apos; tastes, of course, Davis tries to make sure her designs are always affordable, safe and not too risque for young children. When it comes to helping her find new ideas, however, her employers are very generous.  In what would be an impossible fantasy for many people, Davis spends almost 50% of her time travelling to &quot;inspirational places&quot; around the world. And when she gets there? &quot;We go shopping.&quot; I see. So she picks up a few top pieces and steals their ideas? &quot;We don&apos;t necessarily steal ideas,&quot; she replies calmly, &quot;but we look at stuff. If there&apos;s a folky theme, you could buy a piece from a collection and take inspiration from it. And that could inspire a whole range.&quot;  Even so, with such a volume of clothes to design, the ideas of her suppliers in India and Bangladesh also come in useful. Which means more travel to see what they have to offer, and to watch her pieces being made. Nevertheless, there is such a thing as too much inspiration. Indeed at times Davis finds it impossible to stop noticing clothes. &quot;You just can&apos;t help it,&quot; she says. &quot;And it&apos;s kind of your job to know what people are wearing as well.&quot;  She has, however, discovered one, albeit rather expensive, place where she can go to switch off in her spare time. &quot;Last year we went on safari,&quot; she tells me with a smile, &quot;which was great because it didn&apos;t matter what you wore!&quot; Curriculum vitae Pay &quot;Between \u00a330,000 and \u00a335,000 for my grade. I&apos;d say that was about standard throughout the industry.&quot; Hours &quot;9am to 5.30pm are your standard hours, but I&apos;d usually do 8.30am to 6pm, or something like that. But then, they could be much longer hours if you&apos;re travelling. It&apos;s difficult, because it&apos;s one of those jobs that never gets finished. You could always do a little bit more.&quot; Work/life balance &quot;A lot of people in this industry have long hours and don&apos;t have a work/life balance. But since moving to George, mine&apos;s been a lot better. They do flexible working here, which is quite good. A lot of people who have children take advantage of that, and they&apos;ll do 8am to 4pm or something.&quot; Best thing &quot;Seeing little girls wearing my stuff.&quot; Worst thing &quot;When things get changed because of price or safety.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Flights KLM&apos;s (0871 222 7474; klm.com) flight sale runs until 27 January, and fares include San Francisco from \u00a3343, Tokyo from \u00a3498 and Lima from \u00a3643."], "tags": ["Budget travel", "Skiing holidays", "Winter sun", "United Kingdom holidays", "Cruises", "Flights", "Late offers", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-11T00:01:00Z", "title": "The bargain basement: this week's travel deals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jan/11/bargain-travel-budget-offers-skiing", "article": "Ski packages Skiing in the Eurozone is pricey, but Directski (0800 587 0924; directski.com) has a week in the French resort of M\u00e9ribel from \u00a3219, based on four sharing, reduced from \u00a3359, departing 17 January.

He was a chef-entrepreneur who rose from a country p\u00e2tissier to controlling an empire that encompassed p\u00e2tisseries and gourmet boutiques in a dozen countries, a chefs&apos; school near Paris, Michelin three-star restaurants, a joint-venture with fellow celebrity chefs Paul Bocuse and Roger Verg\u00e9 at Disney World in Florida, an impeccable outside-catering operation, wine ch\u00e2teaux and many cookery books. His kitchen work was exemplary in its attention to the quality of raw materials, exactitude and technique, and its pursuit of lightness and digestibility without sacrificing flavour. He was also a pioneer in cooking for large numbers. He appreciated that the success of a recipe for hundreds of people depended on more sophisticated manipulation than mere multiplication of dinner-party quantities. It is no coincidence that when chefs Bocuse and Verg\u00e9 organised a stratospherically expensive Mediterranean cruise for 300 guests in the 1970s (they got through 120 kilos of foie gras and 60 kilos of caviar in three days), they called on the skills of their friend Len\u00f4tre to produce Bocuse&apos;s legendary truffle soup. Len\u00f4tre was born on a farm at Saint-Nicolas-du-Bosc in upper Normandy. His father, Gaston, had been chef saucier at the Grand H\u00f4tel in Paris and his mother, El\u00e9anore, cook to the Rothschild family and the banker and financier Baron Pereire. His father&apos;s ill-health forced them to abandon the farm for the nearby town of Bernay in 1930 and for Gaston soon to consider career options. Cabinet making was rejected, but perhaps the memory of a preliminary foray into sweet dishes - a rice pudding triumphantly produced at the age of 12 - prompted him to be apprenticed to a p\u00e2tissier in Pont-Audemer a few miles to the north. Despite success there, he was let go in 1936 and went to Paris to seek his fortune: his goal the famous house of Rumpelmeyer. Lack of work, thanks to the depression, forced him to push trolleys in Les Halles to earn a crust - and later to peddle home-made chocolates on his bicycle - before he landed something more suited to his skills. In 1939 came the outbreak of war and he returned to Bernay and the family hearth. The German occupation destroyed the ranks of local bakers and allowed him and his brother Marcel to open their own small business with his mother at the cash desk. The newly independent young businessman also married his first wife Colette Courallet in 1943. She was to prove as formidably astute as her spouse. In 1947 they bought the Pont-Audemer p\u00e2tisserie where he had been first apprenticed. Gaston did the baking and Colette oversaw the front of house. She would always do this with style, whether dressing her counterhands in haute couture uniforms in their smart Paris shop - customers protested that the girls were more chic than the clients - or decorating the super-luxurious restaurant Le Pr\u00e9 Catalan, in the Bois de Boulogne, in the 1970s and 1980s. Len\u00f4tre began as he meant to go on. The depredations of war had had a dire effect on standards but he insisted only on the best materials and he revived many regional specialities that people thought lost for ever. His watchwords were weight, proportion and rigour, sound rules for pastry work. In 1957 he moved to Paris, buying a shop in the rue d&apos;Auteuil in the 16th arrondissement and home to some of the most expensive real estate in the capital. On arrival there were four p\u00e2tisseries in the street; after 12 months only his remained. Success was immediate, with much ingenuity and enterprise, evinced for example by his redirecting the kitchen ventilation towards the pavement to better entice the idle passer-by. The precision and delicacy of pastry work did not desert him as he extended his range into savoury dishes from 1960, developing the business of traiteur or outside-caterer from 1964 and a brand of frozen foods for wider distribution. By 1968, with more outlets to supply, he moved the centre of operations to a large suburban site at Plaisir in Yvelines. Here he was able to establish a central kitchen, imposing universal and rigorous standards. Here too, in 1971, he opened a cookery school where working chefs could attend for short courses in all subjects. The student roll-call is impressive, as were the numbers: up to 3,000 every year. While he never adopted the minimalism of nouvelle cuisine, he was in step with the transformation of French commercial cookery in the 1970s. He explored new combinations of flavours; he embraced the lightness and playfulness that were its trademarks, so he lightened buttercreams by adding gelatine, and christened his holiday home Villa Macaron and his yacht Vol-au-Vent. His own special creations included Feuille d&apos;automne, a meringue filled with chocolate mousse enrobed with dark chocolate, and his g\u00e2teau Succ\u00e8s comprised almond meringue with nougatine and almond praline. The 1970s saw a great expansion of his boutiques, often as franchises, in Berlin in 1975, Tokyo in 1978 and New York in 1974, although the last of these closed a year later. The 43rd Len\u00f4tre boutique opened in 1999 in Las Vegas and there are now 52. In 1976 he also took the concession for Le Pr\u00e9 Catalan, appointing his nephew Patrick as chef, who would be the youngest chef in France to win two Michelin stars, and later opened the Pavillon Elys\u00e9e with its restaurant, shop and cooking school for amateurs. Len\u00f4tre&apos;s later career is freighted with superlatives of scale and prestige, whether catering for giant events or in landmark locations like the Stade de France. His kitchens at Plaisir got through nine tons of butter every month and 100 tons of chocolate each year. However, commercial nemesis did strike in 1985 when he was forced to seek capital investment from the French hotel giant Accor. This led to the complete absorption of Maison Len\u00f4tre in 1992 although Len\u00f4tre himself remained involved until his retirement. In 1999 he married his second wife Catherine but there was no diminution in the presence of his original family in the enterprise. At one stage he employed 12 of his children and relations. One daughter, Sylvie, helped in writing his 13 books, the first of which was published in 1975, while the other, Annie, looks after the gourmet gift division. His son Alain runs a cookery school in Houston, Texas. In 1991 he bought Ch\u00e2teau de Fesles and other properties in the Loire making sweet white wines (Bonnezeaux and Coteaux du Layon) as well as Clos des Varennes which produced a dry Savenni\u00e8res. After large investment and improvements, he sold them in 1996.  He is survived by his first and second wives; his three children; his younger brother Marcel; eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. \u2022 Gaston-Albert-C\u00e9lestin Len\u00f4tre, chef, born 28 May 1920; died 9 January 2009"}, {"sentences": ["The people of Fujisawa, south-east of Tokyo, may be surprised to discover that part of their town, which isn&apos;t known for cattle farming, is redolent of the &quot;the toasty odour of cow dung&quot;."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-12T13:20:28Z", "title": "Japan's Smell Club sniffs out world's best and worst odours", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/13/smell-club-japan", "article": "Worried that a trip to Japan might be ruined by the stench of feline halitosis?

The government will also transfer jobs from departments such as transport to under-staffed ones such as the department of social welfare, whose workload is growing as unemployment rises. Murphy said this week that there was a real danger of the IMF imposing swingeing cuts unless the unions came to a deal with the Irish government.

If that&apos;s a bit too out there, the PA Plaza in Tokyo, is much more down to earth. Its rooms play on more obvious themes - the Island Resort room has, er, a potted palm tree and in-room Jacuzzi, while Modern Britain sports matching pink flowery curtains, sofa and bedspread - it&apos;s romantic Britain circa 1975.  \u2022 Hotel Loire, 7-9-13 Miyakenaka, Osaka, from Y3,899 (\u00a330). A &quot;break&quot; (bookable between 6am and midnight) at the PA Plaza is two hours and costs Y5,600 Mon-Fri and Y6,200 Sat-Sun.

You may beg to differ, once you&apos;ve seen the bedspreads, naff ceiling murals and the slightly corporate looking chairs and tables. But we say embrace the tackiness. New Yorkers certainly have. New York Magazine recently voted the Liberty the Best By the Hour hotel in the city. Rooms feature &quot;mood lighting&quot;, six adult movie channels on the plasma screen TVs and - if you splash out an extra $15 for the Romantic Interlude rooms - a two-person whirlpool.

VIP&apos;s, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In a country as proud of its libido as its footballing prowess - yet where most young people live at home until they get married - the love motel is a national institution. Rooms range from the functional to five-star love nests complete with theatres (video camera optional), swimming pools, saunas and mini discos. The VIP&apos;s motel in Rio, two minutes&apos; drive from the trendy beachside suburb of Leblon, is the epitome of discretion (two private parking spaces per room and the staff never see you), and style with private poolside views of the Atlantic below and Christ the Redeemer looking down from the mountain above. Good Catholics can book a suite out of his view. VIP&apos;s rooms are so tastefully decorated, and well located, you might consider staying here even if you&apos;re not getting jiggy with it. \u2022 Rooms from R$95-R$640 (\u00a328-\u00a3190) for eight hours. +55 21 3322 5868; vipsmotel.com.br.   Hotel General La Paz, Buenos Aires, Argentina They may not be as well known as Brazil&apos;s love motels, but in Argentina they&apos;re just as common with virtually one on every block. Known as &quot;temporary lodgings&quot;, or telos, they provide some much-needed privacy to young couples living with their parents. They range from the downright downmarket, where you may have to wait your turn with other couples until the sheets are changed in an available room, to classier joints. The General Paz falls into the latter category, with suites so plush you may not want to leave after your allotted &quot;turno&quot;. \u2022 A three-hour turno costs from 260 pesos - 430 pesos (\u00a352-96).

The Hoxton, London, UK No doubt there are plenty of sleazy boltholes around the capital but we have our standards, you know. Our suggestion is the stylish Hoxton, which has daytime deals on its &quot;private offices&quot; - aka its bedrooms - for a bargain \u00a319. They&apos;re aimed at business people who need some desk space while they&apos;re in town, but there&apos;s nothing to stop you inviting your partner to step into your office.

Then again, it&apos;s most famous painting is Klimt&apos;s The Kiss. If the 20-room Hotel Orient&apos;s Kaiser suite sounds a bit too full on for your liking, try the more romantic sounding 1001 Nights.  \u2022 Three hours cost from \u20ac59 per room, Tiefer Graben 30, +43 1 533 73 07, hotelorient.at .

There is no hourly rate here but La Franca sneaks on to the list because it&apos;s aimed solely at couples and aims to please, promising &quot;discrecion absoluta&quot;.

The company said its 2,200 general managers had agreed to the unprecedented move at informal meetings last month, and insisted they would not be coerced into buying Toyota cars or punished if they failed to do so. &quot;This is not company policy and in no way mandatory, but more of a form of unofficial encouragement,&quot; Toyota spokeswoman Ririko Takeuchi told the Guardian. While it did not keep data on vehicle ownership among employees, the firm admitted that a number of middle managers owned cars made by Toyota&apos;s rivals. &quot;It&apos;s entirely a matter of personal taste,&quot; Takeuchi said. Managers who take up the offer will receive a &quot;modest&quot; discount if they buy directly from Toyota, but the range of models is limited. They will have more choice if they opt to buy from a dealer, but will pay the same as other customers. Even if every manager heeds the latest call to arms, it is unlikely to make much of a dent in Toyota&apos;s inventory. Faced with a soaring yen and a collapse in the export market, Toyota is laying off 3,000 temporary workers and closing all 12 of its domestic plants for 11 days in February and March, reducing production by as many as 200,000 vehicles. Toyota expects to have sold 8.96 million cars worldwide last year, down 4% from 2007 and well below its initial estimate of 9.5 million. Sales in the US dropped 37% in November, the biggest monthly decline for more than 25 years, and by 18% in Japan. The firm is facing an operating loss \u2013 the first since 1938 \u2013 of 150bn yen (\u00a31.1bn) to the end of March, compared with a 2.27tn yen profit last year. Confidence among carmakers was shaken again this week with reports that General Motors and Chrysler will not attend October&apos;s Tokyo Motor Show, one of the biggest events in the industry&apos;s calendar.

Several cities, including Tokyo, have earned millions of yen from the sale of rare elements found in capped teeth and artificial bones, the Asahi newspaper said. The Tokyo metropolitan government made 3.2m yen (\u00a324,700) in 2007 from the sale of 700g (1.5lb) of gold, 500g of palladium and 1.9kg of silver retrieved from cremated remains. The city earned 90,000 yen from coins placed in coffins before cremation, the report said. One of Japan&apos;s biggest crematoriums, in the central city of Nagoya, collected 12kg of metals worth more than 10m yen. The precious metals are being retrieved from ashes and bone fragments left behind after the family of the deceased have completed the ritual of packing some of the bones into an urn for burial. While the practice has ugly historical precedents \u2013 the Nazis routinely searched for gold in the ashes of murdered concentration camp prisoners \u2013 the Japanese authorities have the law on their side. In 1939, the supreme court ruled that any leftover ashes not taken away by bereaved relatives belonged to the municipality; any income they generate is considered part of the city&apos;s miscellaneous income. According to one estimate, 1,850 tonnes of bones and ashes were produced by cremations in Japan in 2007. Although one local council said it had stopped searching for precious metals after complaints that it was profiting from the dead, most families are unaware of the practice. Japan has a huge quantity of discarded mobile phones, PCs, televisions and MP3 players, which, if properly tapped, could turn it into a major producer of precious metals. About 20m mobile phones containing minute quantities of silver, gold, palladium and other precious metals are replaced in Japan every year, but only a tiny percentage are recycled. While the government is encouraging the stripping down of gadgets, experts have mixed feelings about profiting from crematoria treasure hunts. &quot;There&apos;s nothing illegal about it, so it&apos;s not something we can condemn outright,&quot; said Yuji Moriyama, of the Japan Society of Environmental Crematory. &quot;But personally, I think it&apos;s wrong. We&apos;re talking about human beings, not mobile phones. &quot;Human remains should be treated with just as much respect as they were before cremation. Whatever ashes and bones are left should be packed up and taken to the nearest Buddhist temple to be blessed and looked after properly.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Berdych began to display more consistent form towards the end of last year, winning his fourth ATP title in Tokyo by beating Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, and finishing in the top 20 for the third successive year."], "tags": ["Australian Open 2009", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport", "Jo-Wilfried Tsonga"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-15T00:05:04Z", "title": "Australian Open: So who will be this year's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jan/15/australian-open-unlikely-contenders", "article": "Marin Cilic Croatia, age 20 World ranking: 20 Australian Opens: 2 Last year: 4th round v James Blake Marin Cilic has the distinction of being the last player to defeat Andy Murray as a junior in 2005, though the 20-year-old&apos;s progress has since been a little less meteoric. His key strength is his mighty serve \u2013 at 6ft 6in he is another towering Croatian (are there any others?) and he twins that with being remarkably agile for a big man. Cilic is comfortable on different surfaces, always a good sign; he favours hard-court and grass, though he was also the junior French Open champion. He finished as his country&apos;s top player for the first time in 2008, completing the year just outside the top 20, but underlined his continuing progress with a victory against the wild-card Somdev Devvarman in the final of the Chennai Open, claiming his second ATP title.

He is 6ft 5in and his best weapons are a top-class serve and powerful forehand. But despite the champion&apos;s swagger Berdych is still waiting for a major breakthrough at slam level, and disappointed in his only slam quarter-final against Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2007. On that occasion he seemed one-dimensional and brittle, which may not bode well for future big matches. Berdych began to display more consistent form towards the end of last year, winning his fourth ATP title in Tokyo by beating Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, and finishing in the top 20 for the third successive year.

Since then he has been France&apos;s nearly man, suffering numerous injuries to his legs. As a youngster he trained in Florida at the famous Nick Bollettieri centre, and was the French Open junior champion in 2000. He has been superseded by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gilles Simon, Ga\u00ebl Monfils and Richard Gasquet, but might just follow in the footsteps of Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment, the 2001 Australian Open runner-up.

At 5ft 10in, he has a remarkably powerful serve and notably hit 32 aces in a five-set victory over Andy Roddick in the third round of the Australian Open last year. Kohlschreiber has been making steady rather then spectacular progress over the past four years and is capable of hitting hot spells, as did his super-fit countryman Rainer Sch\u00fcttler at the Open six years ago.

Gulbis first came on to the radar of the British public in 2007 when he crushed Tim Henman in the first round at Roland Garros. He spent his formative years at the Niki Pilic academy in Munich where he regularly used to outplay Djokovic, now the world No3 and reigning Australian Open champion \u2013 and did so again in the first round of the Brisbane International last week. Gulbis has a way with languages and he can speak Latvian, English, Russian and German. Biggest scalp: Novak Djokovic, Brisbane, 2009 He says: &quot;Now I&apos;m thinking much more on court.

This is not because of any great publicity effort on the part of the company itself, more because of the intense buzz of amateur speculation. As you&apos;d expect, chefs are interested in Michelin&apos;s judgements - it&apos;s the way the industry judges itself - but they&apos;re way too busy to post. Otherwise the kind of people who speculate most ferociously about the stars are an odd bunch - culinary otaku with the money to spend &apos;collecting&apos; starred restaurants who&apos;ve extrapolated an ability-to-afford into a notion of connoisseurship.  Reading their postings is like listening to that talk radio station that always seems to be playing when I get in a cab, usually on the subject of football or immigration: intense, opinionated debate of events over which the participants can have no possible influence and, to any audience, irritatingly pointless.The Michelin system judges food by a set of criteria that are irrelevant to most of us. Though they have tried to modernise and diversify, Michelin have evolved from judging everything by the standards of Parisian haute cuisine to judging them by their own set of rules, a French-inflected cuisine of the wealthy which transcends nationality simply by being identical wherever you go. By rights, the Michelin system should only matter to those who travel with full wallets and without a sense of adventure but, sadly, the media loves a ranking system and so they are taken seriously outside this tiny group. It burns me royally whenever I read comparisons between London, Paris and New York as &apos;serious foodie cities&apos; based on the number of Michelin stars. It&apos;s like judging the beauty of the population by the number of cosmetic surgeons.  London, we&apos;re told, currently has more stars than New York. What conclusion are we supposed to draw from that? Most of them are held by Ramsay restaurants and none are held by St John - seen by most as the starting point of the British food revival and still consistently voted one of the top five restaurants in the world by chefs. This tells you all you need to know about the relevance of Michelin. If it can reward characterless supra-national beigeness at the expense of authenticity, if it can ignore a national movement while rewarding those who would turn eating into a luxury good for the global jetset, then it is no valid indicator of anything. You could eat at every starred restaurant in this country and understand nothing about British food or how we eat, and you could do exactly the same in New York.  I realise that my feelings towards the star system aren&apos;t calculated to endear me to anyone - many foodies who I count as friends and whose opinions I respect care a great deal about Michelin - but here are my reasons.  Michelin, originally conceived to help curious foodies find a good meal in the French countryside, has become an organ uniquely capable of draining the joy from eating worldwide. For me, the stars have come to symbolise the way food appreciation is becoming a branch of the luxury goods industry - something I deplore completely. Furthermore, I think paying it any attention at all, outside of France, is the behaviour of a nation lacking culinary confidence.  Last year, Michelin decided to publish a guide to Tokyo and many restaurants received stars. Did this mark the final maturing of Japanese cuisine? Should we be pleased to welcome the poor primitive Japanese to the international table? In an incredibly gratifying way, Japanese chefs clearly didn&apos;t think so.  They were baffled at the choices made and incensed that a group with apparently no cultural understanding of their centuries-old traditions should presume to judge. To them Michelin&apos;s opinion was ill-informed, irrelevant and insulting. The Japanese ignored Michelin in droves and if we consider ourselves a nation with a food culture worth having, so should we.

That quality is noticeable by its absence in this psychosexual thriller, which races at breakneck speed through the story of Aoyama, a Tokyo-based documentary film-maker. We learn that since the tragic death of his wife Ryoko, seven years ago, Aoyama has understandably shunned serious relationships. But now his teenage son, Shige, and his best pal, Yoshikawa, have decided that he should get married again. The overbearing Yoshikawa&apos;s idea is to stage auditions for the female lead in a bogus movie he will &quot;produce&quot; with his initially reluctant buddy, but the covert purpose of Aoyama&apos;s auditions will be to find a new spouse. This morally dubious but highly interesting premise is strangely never developed in the plot, to the point of being completely unnecessary, as Yamasaki practically jumps out from the pile of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s into Aoyama&apos;s affections right at the start of the selection process. Basically, the other applicants needn&apos;t bother to show up, and perhaps to his credit, Murakami refuses to let Aoyama or the reader waste any time on them. So Aoyama starts to woo his dream girl, despite the predictable warnings of his close associates that there might perhaps be something not quite right about the lovely Yamasaki. You might imagine that a 42-year-old man would have the savvy to be a little concerned when an unattached 24-year-old, compliantly demure honey from Geisha Masturbation Fantasy Central starts hanging on his every word. But love is nothing if not blind, and while Aoyama does uncover a history of abuse in this troubled ex-ballerina&apos;s childhood, he&apos;s convinced that Yamasaki has transcended this hurt to become model wife material. Big mistake. The novel&apos;s first two acts, the audition concept and Aoyama&apos;s romancing of Yamasaki, are about as perfunctory and economical as modern writing gets. Yoshikawa, the best pal, lays bare the whole film audition scam over a few pages. But while the prose is taut and spare, it would be wrong to suggest that it lacks depth. The build-up contains some intelligent reflections on relationships in Japanese society, and there are acute observations about how the loss of Ryoko has affected Aoyama and the most sympathetic character in the book, his 15-year-old son.  The main problem with Audition, though, is Yamasaki. It&apos;s difficult to take her seriously as a character, as she shows us only two faces - angel and monster - and we never get any real sense that the abuse she&apos;s suffered could have precipitated the extreme psychotic behaviour she&apos;ll eventually visit on Aoyama. In this respect, the novel becomes another parable of male fear of female sexuality. Feminism has obviously never penetrated Japanese society in the same manner it did in the west, and while we have to accept Audition as being of its cultural place, it would be almost unthinkable for a male English-speaking writer, in almost any genre, to offer up a major female character like Yamasaki.  The book&apos;s tendency to race to the finishing line is no bad thing, because it is in the third act that Murakami&apos;s writing is at its strongest, in what is a genuinely shocking and grisly climax. Those who know his previous novels, particularly Piercing and Almost Transparent Blue, will be aware that his strongest suit as a writer is how he portrays tripped-out, hallucinogenic sex and violence, and both the sex between Aoyama and Yamasaki in the hotel room and the subsequent violent denouement are mesmerising and compelling.  &quot;He cried out, opening his eyes wide with terror, but the light was so intense that he immediately closed them again. He was utterly disorientated. He moved his lips, trying to ask what was happening, but the mucous membranes of his throat felt like cobwebs, dry and sticky, and no sound emerged.&quot; This is Aoyama&apos;s postcoital state, suggesting that he has big problems ahead when Yamasaki decides to get properly psycho. And so it proves. The prose in these passages is elegiac and affecting, but it has the sharp, visceral feel of the butcher&apos;s knife or surgeon&apos;s scalpel. Murakami does not spare us the blood and gore, and dog lovers of a squeamish nature might be advised to skip this novel.  Although I really wanted to know more about Yamasaki, and felt that the underdevelopment of the audition concept was perhaps an opportunity missed, the novel is a highly compulsive, one-sitting read, and Audition should add to the Renaissance Man&apos;s growing fanbase in the English-speaking world. \u2022 Irvine Welsh&apos;s latest novel is Crime (Cape).

OK, I accept there are worse things. Having your feet nailed to the floor while being forced to listen to &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; by Chris de Burgh is probably worse. But if we exclude acts of physical violence and the crappy little tunes of that crappy little Irish git with the obese caterpillar eyebrows and stick to the business of Japanese food, the only thing worse than bad cheap sushi is, as I say, the bad expensive stuff. Of the sort I was served at Buddha Bar a few weeks back. I should, of course, move on but I can&apos;t. The experience keeps repeating on me, like a rancid kipper. I wake in the night, the bedclothes clasped in my white-knuckled fists, muttering about revenge and pain. It was clear I had to do something to exorcise the experience. As firebombing the place is apparently forbidden under some tedious Observer code of conduct, I concluded that the solution lay in the good stuff. In any case, the news has been full of warnings of deflation and the occasional banker apologising for getting things stupendously wrong. Hey! It&apos;s just like being in Tokyo. Which was all the excuse I needed. But this time I really did insist on quality, and I didn&apos;t want it served to me by some chiselled, coke-snorting imperious waiter in Armani, and I didn&apos;t want it in the shadow of a giant sculpture of a prophet, and I didn&apos;t want it in a room designed by a troop of fey interior designers who had been told to express their vision. God save us from interior designers with vision. Send in the rabid crows to peck out their eyes.  A simple wish list, then, which narrowed it down a bit, particularly in London. The restaurant I wanted, I was told by knowledgeable friends, was Kikuchi in Hanway Street just off Tottenham Court Road - the sort of dank, hidden alley that TS Eliot might have been thinking of when he wrote in The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock of &quot;certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats of restless nights...&quot; Hanway Street is the kind of place you go for a quiet nervous breakdown, to contract a notifiable disease or, as it turns out, for very good sushi. No designers have had anything to do with Kikuchi. They may have used a painter and decorator at some point. It is a small, brightly lit room with a few tables and a sushi bar, commanded by one man with a chiselled 30s black-and-white movie face, a sliver of moustache and unfeasibly fast hands. The only downside to Kikuchi is the speed with which the food arrives. But it&apos;s worth putting up with being pelted with raw fish this good, and you can always eat slowly. Their selection of sushi, at \u00a324 for 12 pieces - two-thirds the Buddha Bar price and 10 times as good - brought sweet scallop and silky strips of otoro (belly tuna), a little turbot and some mackerel, some slippery, ripely female sea urchin and jewel-bright orange salmon eggs that burst pleasingly against the roof of the mouth. The rice was just warm and only lightly vinagered. An equally thrilling plate of sashimi came with razor clam and more of the fabulous tuna. Small plates cost around \u00a36. From the deep-fried list which, with that curious Japanese alchemy were completely greaseless, we had curls of fish cake sprinkled with deep-fried crumbs of parsley and some perfect tempuraed prawns. I also ordered skewers of pork and onions, breaded and deep-fried and slicked with a dark sweet sauce, which proved that not everything in the Japanese repertoire is virtuous. This was one of those street food items eaten away from the street - the kind of thing that makes you feel a little dirty while also pandering to a base need. Naturally I liked it very much. The desert list runs to three kinds of ice cream and so, to all intents and purposes, there is no sweet option here. No matter. Soho is nearby, which is always good for a lump of emergency cake. You go to Kikuchi for spankingly good fish and sweet waitresses who know their spoken English is close to unintelligible and will do everything to make you feel at home. You also go for a bill which, while hardly small, feels reasonable. And if you are me, you go as an act of revenge on all the bad restaurants. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk"}, {"sentences": ["Within an hour the streets reverberate to the banter of the inhabitants of Tokyo&apos;s hedonistic milieu: hosts and hostesses, hawkers, touts, prostitutes and carousing salarymen.", "But the vast majority pay their taxes, have proper business licences and don&apos;t have any intention of leaving.&quot; Kabuki, which occupies a mere 600 metres square of prime Tokyo real estate, was given its current name in 1948 amid plans to open a kabuki theatre which, in the end, was never built.", "The 600 square metres of Tokyo that we said was home to 300 sex shops, 160 host clubs, 80 hotels and hundreds of bars and restaurants should have been 600 metres square."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-19T08:25:00Z", "title": "Tokyo's Kabukicho district told to dim its red light", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/19/kabukicho-tokyo-cleanup", "article": "As the sun dips behind the skyscrapers on a bitterly cold evening, hordes of shoppers swarm towards subway entrances, a blaze of neon flickering in their wake.  Within an hour the streets reverberate to the banter of the inhabitants of Tokyo&apos;s hedonistic milieu: hosts and hostesses, hawkers, touts, prostitutes and carousing salarymen. Kabukicho, the Japanese capital&apos;s red light district, has come out to play. But for how much longer? With Japan eager to host the 2016 Olympics and the city&apos;s proselytising governor keen to clean away sleaze and crime, the ramshackle collection of ageing buildings housing bars and clubs catering to every sexual proclivity is in the authorities&apos; firing line.  Armed with this political mandate, police are zealously enforcing a new law requiring sex clubs and hostess bars to close their doors at midnight and turf out their last customer by 1am. A handful of clubs flout the law by dimming their lights and paying protection money to yakuza crime syndicates, but law-abiding owners say takings have plunged.  &quot;The police crackdown has halved the number of customers here, and the recession isn&apos;t helping,&quot; says Hiroshi Iwamoto, a doorman at the topless Glamorous Lovers&apos; Cafe.  &quot;I&apos;ve been in Kabukicho a long time and I&apos;d hate to see it change. This is where people come to make something of themselves.&quot; The facelift is being led by Renaissance Kabukicho, a network of public and private bodies.  &quot;We don&apos;t necessarily want to get rid of all of the local colour,&quot; says Mitsuo Hirai, who leads the project at Shinjuku city hall.  &quot;Of course we want to preserve the character of the place and strike a balance. If we can do that then it&apos;s not going to do the Olympic bid any harm, although we were always determined to clean up Kabukicho and make it a place where people can walk around in safe and pleasant surroundings.&quot; Patrols of volunteers attempt to clamp down on dozens of touts who assail passers-by with descriptions of the delights, innocent or otherwise, that await them inside.  Junior hosts, immediately recognisable by their crimped long hair and tight-fitting suits, rub shoulders with sex industry scouts and Nigerian touts who steer inebriated men into bars with promises of encounters with foreign women. Campaigners admit they have barely dented the sex industry&apos;s presence. The patrols have improved community relations but failed to stop touts seeking the commissions they need to make a living.  &quot;Soon after we started the cleanup, we realised we couldn&apos;t get rid of organised crime or the sex industry altogether,&quot; says Koichi Teratani, a documentary maker and authority on Kabukicho.  &quot;I can understand people who think that if the neighbourhood becomes too sterile, it&apos;ll end up being boring and the place will die. We&apos;re aiming for a mix of old and new, raunchy and wholesome.&quot; Signs of Kabukicho&apos;s creeping gentrification have emerged over the past year with the opening of a Best Western hotel, the closure of an ageing theatre to make way for a new development and the arrival of one of Japan&apos;s best-known talent agencies. Yet to the casual visitor and the growing number of foreign tourists who come for a peek at Japan&apos;s moral underbelly, Kabukicho is still a place of contradictions, where jazz clubs and restaurants compete for space with massage parlours and love hotels, and a yakuza office stands in the grounds of a Shinto shrine. It is an odd mix, but one that has proved remarkably resilient to change, says Mark Schreiber, a sex industry writer and Kabukicho regular for more than 40 years.  &quot;Japan is once more in recession, and the sex industry is again proving to be the closest you get to pure capitalism, because it&apos;s quickest to respond to changing circumstance,&quot; he says. &quot;At the end of the day, the authorities have to get the agreement of the residents to move. But the vast majority pay their taxes, have proper business licences and don&apos;t have any intention of leaving.&quot; Kabuki, which occupies a mere 600 metres square of prime Tokyo real estate, was given its current name in 1948 amid plans to open a kabuki theatre which, in the end, was never built.  The sex shops appeared in the 1970s thanks to Kabukicho&apos;s proximity to Shinjuku, home to the world&apos;s busiest train station.  About 150,000 people pass through Kabukicho every day, generating an estimated 300bn yen a year for the local economy.  The area is home to 4,000 businesses, including 300 sex shops, 160 host clubs, 80 hotels and hundreds of bars and restaurants.  About 1,800 gangsters operate in the area, making money from prostitution and protection rackets. Many Kabukicho locals say they support the Olympic bid, but are quick to point out that their neighbourhood has already built an admirable ethos of its own. &quot;There&apos;s no discrimination here, everyone is accepted for who they are,&quot; says Maki Tezuka, a celebrated host at the club A Place in the Sun. &quot;No one cares about your past, even if you&apos;ve made mistakes. This is a place where people come to start over again. And after that, who knows what they might make of themselves? That&apos;s the great thing about Kabukicho.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 27 January 2009.

Sitting in a traditional restaurant in a Shibuya backstreet, Late of the Pier are sulking around the table, punctuating bouts of introspective silence with sighs of uncertainty. The spread of sashimi sits before them forlorn and untouched. &quot;Why do we do this?&quot; offers electro-wizard Sam Potter. &quot;You don&apos;t get to experience the countries you visit; you&apos;re just hopping from one backstage area to another. Sometimes it&apos;s more frustrating to come all this way and hardly see the place than if you&apos;d never come at all.&quot; Cheer up, gentlemen! On the face of it, everything is dandy. They should be celebrating the fact that they are a world away from their Nottinghamshire suburbs. They&apos;ve just played a packed gig at Shibuya&apos;s O-East venue with Metronomy in support. They&apos;ve showcased promising new songs drawing on fresh influences and threw an impromptu DJ set into the middle of The Enemy are the Future, which elevated the gig to a full-on rave. Tomorrow they&apos;re hopping on the bullet-train and speeding down the spine of Japan to reign successfully over crowds in Nagoya and Osaka, too. But do not be deceived; behind this frivolous facade of montage-worthy mania lurks a darker side to the Japanese tour circuit that all bands must face. Firstly, organising the tour in the first place. Perhaps not so much an immediate concern for Late of the Pier, as they are signed to a major label with offices in Japan, but for bands on indie labels it&apos;s a nightmare of endless cost evaluations and ill communications. Touring Japan is expensive, not just for the exchange rate, but for the fact that Japanese venues charge bands high fees \u2013 the confused idea being that a live show is promotion for a band&apos;s music and not a financial venture in itself. Moreover, unlike Europe where bands can play several countries in one tour, Japan is an isolated market. It&apos;s a long way to come just to play one country. Ken McCallum, of Tokyo indie blog Japan Live, gets emails every week from bands around the world hoping to break Japan. &quot;It&apos;s hard for a band that doesn&apos;t know Japanese and doesn&apos;t have friends over here to get concert bookings,&quot; he says, &quot;because clubs are generally not interested in responding to correspondence in English from people they&apos;ve never met. If a band is able to arrange shows, they&apos;ll likely play to sparse crowds, and will have to pay to play.&quot; When you do eventually make it to Japan, after recovering from jet lag there&apos;s the language barrier to contend with \u2013 and the wildly different customs and approaches to gig-going. Some bands are perturbed by the wall of silence they meet when confronting some Japanese audiences. They needn&apos;t think it&apos;s just them; when I saw Slipknot a few years ago the riotous mosh pits became havens of tranquillity between songs. Venue managers can be notoriously obsessive compulsive. Salaryman culture has filtered down into the music world, so it&apos;s not just the office suits that get caught up in bureaucracy to keep themselves busy. &quot;Club managers here have a reputation for wanting to know everything about a show before it happens (resumes, personal interviews, required rehearsals the day of the show), which might not necessarily be that helpful in sparking a spontaneous rock&apos;n&apos;roll explosion,&quot; says McCallum. Though Late of the Pier are ticking all the boxes on the Japanese tour checklist \u2013 being accosted by super-fans, taking candid snaps of badly translated English signage and drinking foul-tasting jelly drinks from endless rows of vending machines \u2013 it turns out that box ticking is part of the problem. &quot;We&apos;re fed up of touring,&quot; says singer and guitarist Potter, the band&apos;s shy creative backbone. &quot;We don&apos;t enjoy it any more. We&apos;re musicians; we&apos;re supposed to write music. At the moment we&apos;re just performers \u2013 playing songs we made four years ago to keep our record label happy and it&apos;s getting boring.&quot; The fan mania wears off quickly, too: &quot;Someone leaked my phone number to the internet,&quot; grimaces bassist Andrew Faley. &quot;I&apos;ve had around 100 missed calls. If they do bother leaving a message, they just scream for a few seconds then hang up.&quot; However, if you are strong enough to take all these trivialities in your stride, Japan is still the most enduringly exotic place a Western band can tour, even if they see most of it from a 27th-floor hotel window. Besides, existential crises can soon be banished by encounters that put the whole globetrotting process into perspective, reminding bands why they&apos;re doing it in the first place. As Faley reveals towards the end of the night: &quot;A girl came up to me after the show and told me she was unhappy with her life and was going to commit suicide, but that listening to our band filled her with a new confidence to live. It&apos;s the strangest thing that&apos;s ever happened to me, and also the most moving.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The Japanese currency also approached a 23-year high against the pound today, but senior officials talked down speculation that financial authorities in Tokyo were planning to intervene to rein in the yen for the first time since 2004."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Japan", "Business", "Currencies", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-22T08:52:25Z", "title": "Japanese exports hammered by strong yen and cash-strapped westerners", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/22/japanese-exporters-yen", "article": "Japanese exports plunged by a record 35% in December, and economists warned today that there could be worse to come for the world&apos;s second-largest economy.

Samsung, the world&apos;s leading manufacturer of memory chips and flat-screen TVs, has seen its earnings battered by a dramatic fall in demand for memory devices and lower profit margins for flat screens. Analysts warned that there was little prospect of an immediate turnaround for the firm. &quot;Samsung will likely bleed more, if not suffer wider losses, as the global economy is expected to slump further well into the first half of this year,&quot; Lee Jeong, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities in Seoul, told Reuters. Samsung said it suffered operating losses of 937bn won (\u00a3497m) in the October-December quarter, compared with a profit of 1.78tn won a year earlier, it said in a statement. Its all-important chip business bore the brunt of the slowdown, accounting for 60% of the total losses. Net losses for the quarter reached 22.2bn won compared with a profit of 2.21tn won last year. Shares in Samsung closed down 4.1%, rallying slightly after losing almost 5%. Shares in Sony, meanwhile, plunged in Tokyo a day after it said it was expecting its first operating loss for 14 years, as weak exports and a strong yen continue to pummel earnings from sales in the US and Europe. Sony said operating losses through to the end of March would total 260bn yen, a spectacular reversal from the 200bn yen profit it forecast late last year. In Tokyo, Sony shares plunged 7% to 1,802 yen, while the benchmark Nikkei index fell 3.8% to its lowest close for two years. Sony shares lost 80% of their value last year, while Asia&apos;s biggest stock market has fallen more than 12% already this year. Analysts said Sony&apos;s poor performance was a symptom of a deep-seated malaise in the electronics sector that could continue for some time. &quot;Even though you knew the sector was in bad shape, this has been underscored by Sony, giving rise to fears about firms in the sector which share a lot of the same problems,&quot; said Hiroaki Osakabe at Chibagin Asset Management."}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo they were interested in the terrible plight of single men facing recession."], "tags": ["Work & careers", "Obama inauguration", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-23T14:48:26Z", "title": "Mira Katbamna chooses this week's best stories from the workplace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2009/jan/23/obama-work", "article": "I&apos;ve spent the whole week in a state of high excitement.

I&apos;ve even been greeting everyone with, &quot;Yes we can!&quot;, even though I&apos;m at work and clearly, we can&apos;t. The question on everyone&apos;s lips was did the Greatest Moment in Living Memory justify skiving. This was a tricky one for me. On the one hand, it was the Greatest Moment in Living Memory. On the other, I don&apos;t think President Obama approves of skiving. However, Americans weren&apos;t going to miss the momentous event, with The New York Times reporting plans for a mixture of sneaking out, extended vacation and, rather hearteningly, office parties . The big day over, attention turned to other Obama-related issues. When would world peace start? How long until the end of the recession? But undoubtedly the best Obama question was that posed by Indian business journal Live Mint: &quot;What if Obama worked in your office?&quot;. Would he be able to overcome the petty in-fighting, the pointless reports, the locked stationery cupboard?

And then go back with the steel resolve to format his laptop, when he is out for lunch, whispering, &apos;No \u2026 we won&apos;t!&apos;.&quot; The conclusion? &quot;If Obama were to join a consulting firm, he&apos;d probably come in as a junior partner in charge of sales and marketing and campus recruitment.&quot; Of course, not everyone spent the entire week obsessing over Obama. In Tokyo they were interested in the terrible plight of single men facing recession. Bachelors, you see, are having to make their own packed lunches, or as the headline has it: Bachelors tighten belts, prepare own lunches. Luckily, it turns out that many of them are quite good at it, with women \u2013 women! \u2013 colleagues congratulating them on their lunches, and large lunch boxes aimed at men flying off the shelves. Thank goodness: no one would want single men going hungry just for want of a wife. Or a bit of common sense. Lastly, some rather disturbing news from The Times of India, whose headline screams: Flirt with boss to avoid the axe! Based on a poll of 2,500 people conducted by Allianz Insurance, The Times reports that people are working extra hours, making an effort to talk to senior colleagues, dressing more professionally and flirting with their boss to avoid the sack. Now my initial reaction to this was: &quot;Those Indians, eh? All that Bollywood must have gone to their heads!&quot; If only. It turns out the poll was carried out in the UK.

Toyota will finalise details of the cuts by the end of the month, with the possible loss of hundreds of full-time jobs at its main British plant in Burnaston, Derby\u00adshire, according to the Nikkei business daily. Toyota employs 3,893 people at Burnaston and 572 at an engine plant in Deeside, Flintshire. Company officials in the UK, however, insisted it was not considering any redundancies. &quot;Toyota has a policy to make every effort to maintain stable employment for our permanent employees,&quot; a company spokesman said. &quot;In response to today&apos;s media speculation, we can confirm that we have no such plans within the UK.

The firm, which this week overtook General Motors to become the world&apos;s biggest carmaker in terms of sales, forecasts losses of 150bn yen (\u00a31.2bn) for the year to the end of March. The reported job losses in the UK and US, where Toyota employs 29,000 people, would mark the first time the company has implemented mass redundancies among regular employees since 1950. Plummeting global demand and a surge in the value of the yen against the dollar have forced Toyota and other carmakers to rein in production, lay off tens of thousands of workers and temporarily close plants. The Burnaston factory will cease production for a week each in February and March, and for two weeks in April. Officials in the US denied the firm was planning &quot;involuntary redundancies&quot;, with other reports suggesting it would shed staff through a voluntary retirement programme. &quot;No decisions have been finalised,&quot; Toyota spokesman Mike Goss said in a statement. &quot;However, current business conditions are not forcing us to make involuntary reductions of Toyota team members.&quot; Toyota&apos;s sales in the US fell 37% in December from a year earlier, and experts predict even further steep falls across the industry this year. Spiralling demand in the US has spread to markets across the world, with figures released yesterday showing production in the UK slumped by almost half in December. The number of cars made last month fell 47.5% compared with a year earlier, while commercial vehicle production sank by 56.7%, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

Simpler, more honest food", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/25/credit-crunch-cuisine", "article": "Jo\u00ebl Robuchon does not look like the world&apos;s greatest living chef. You expect a man with 25 Michelin stars to possess a certain swagger, but today Robuchon is sporting a Mao-style black chef&apos;s top and a white fluff of hair. The overall impression is that of a diminutive yoga teacher rather than a kitchen colossus.  He speaks with quiet self-deprecation - when asked to describe himself as a dish, he says he would be &quot;a potato&quot;. The understated demeanour is deceptive. Last week the 63-year-old Frenchman became the world&apos;s most Michelin-starred chef after his London restaurant, L&apos;Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, which opened in 2006, was awarded its second star.  Robuchon is one of the most influential chefs of the 21st century, having mentored Gordon Ramsay, Michael Caines and Eric Ripert among others. When he says something, members of the culinary establishment put down their spatulas, prick up their ears and listen. And according to Robuchon, the current economic crisis will lead to a revolution in the way we eat out. &quot;I have noticed that a number of three-starred Michelin restaurants are more and more empty because there are fewer and fewer business lunches,&quot; he says, when we meet in his Covent Garden restaurant. &quot;Now, people want to eat simple food quickly. They want one main course, one dessert, then they go and that&apos;s it. We have to adapt to that. &quot;This is the most important economic crisis I&apos;ve faced in my career. Restaurants will close if they don&apos;t adapt. It will become more difficult to open new restaurants, because the banks are not lending.&quot; The recession has also altered consumers&apos; demands. Robuchon believes that people struggling to make ends meet no longer want to pay for overly complicated meals in haute cuisine restaurants. Straitened times call for simpler, more honest dishes and fewer courses. &quot;There is a move towards less sophisticated cuisine,&quot; he says. &quot;My mantra is &apos;Eat the truth&apos;. I hate going to restaurants where you don&apos;t know if it&apos;s duck, chicken or veal on the plate because it is so over-complicated. It&apos;s a sort of cerebral masturbation. I tell my chefs that the best plates have a mixture of two or three flavours and no more... Sometimes it [an economic crisis] can be advantageous because new ideas can emerge for a new age.&quot; His own gastronomic empire is attempting to weather the financial storm by offering credit crunch menus. At L&apos;Atelier (which translates as &quot;workshop&quot; and conveys much of Robuchon&apos;s desire for unstuffiness), he has just introduced a \u00a319 two-course set menu for lunch - unprecedented value for a two-starred Michelin restaurant. &quot;It&apos;s a profession where you have to satisfy your clients. I say often to my young chefs: &apos;If you were cooking for your mother or your girlfriend, would you do it the same?&apos; You have to cook with love.&quot; It was religion, not love, that first drew Robuchon to the kitchen. Born into a Catholic family in Poitiers in 1945, his childhood ambition was to enter the priesthood. His family was of modest means - his father was a stonemason and his mother a housewife. Robuchon was the youngest of five and joined a seminary at 12. &quot;It was very strict. We had prayers at 6.30 in the morning, then lectures all day and the priests were very demanding,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The one moment of relaxation during the day was cooking. I would sit in the kitchen topping and tailing beans, cutting up carrots for casseroles, and it was relaxing - although, I have to say, it stopped being relaxing as soon as I got into a professional kitchen.&quot; At 15, he became an apprentice chef at a local hotel. By 28, he was head chef at Harmony-Lafayette hotel in Paris, overseeing 3,000 meals a day. At 36, he opened Jamin, his own restaurant in Paris, and within three years it was triple-starred. After a seven-year &quot;retirement&quot;, Robuchon returned in 1996 to open 12 restaurants in eight cities worldwide, including Tokyo, New York and Monte Carlo. Elements of the monastic life have stayed with him through the years. He still believes in God and although his faith is somewhat nebulous - &quot;the Jewish, Muslim, Christian God: they&apos;re all the same to me&quot; - he says it is reflected in his cooking methods.  &quot;You have to respect your products. A piece of fish or meat - that animal gave its life for you - even vegetables which we take out of the soil. That&apos;s part of my culture, my education.&quot; Robuchon&apos;s emphasis on craftsmanship and his unfussy approach - his signature dish is mashed potato - is credited with banishing the spectre of single-courgette-on-a-plate nouvelle cuisine in the 1980s. The &quot;Atelier&quot; concept was similarly straightforward: the restaurants are designed around a tapas bar model, with an open-plan kitchen and an egalitarian ethos - the London restaurant, for instance, does not take bookings for lunch. &quot;For me, London is the gastronomic capital of Europe,&quot; says Robuchon. &quot;It&apos;s the most modern, most innovative, city where new things are happening. Paris has gone to sleep. I don&apos;t see anything new coming from there. I don&apos;t want to sound immodest, but the last new thing to come out of Paris was L&apos;Atelier.&quot; With two children and four grandchildren, Robuchon says he has no plans to retire permanently because his current job &quot;doesn&apos;t feel like work&quot;. He admits that, when he was younger, he was far more demanding than he is now. &quot;Gordon Ramsay says I once threw a plate at him. At a certain stage, yes, I would shout and swear. It&apos;s true that I didn&apos;t know how to control my temper. But life - age and experience - teaches you calmness.&quot; What does he make of Ramsay&apos;s foul-mouthed reputation? He smiles. &quot;Listen, I know him. He&apos;s a great, serious chef, but television obliges him to come across as this hard man who swears. It is an image that is not at all the real man.&quot; The professional kitchen, he says, can be a place of fired-up emotion where fury bubbles over at the slightest slip of the hand.  According to Robuchon, that stress is magnified to destructive levels if chefs are driven by the need to prove themselves. &quot;The need to get a Michelin star makes cooking incredibly stressful. It can be harmful. For me, it was stressful for a long time. And I would certainly say that it is better never to have any stars than to have one taken away from you. When you lose a star, your reputation goes. I know many chefs who become depressed if they lose a star and who are beset by anxiety.&quot; Robuchon knows this more than most. In 2003 his friend and colleague, the French chef Bernard Loiseau, committed suicide amid rumours that Michelin was going to remove his third star. &quot;I remember I was on a flight back from Tokyo. I came out of the plane at 6am and the chauffeur who came to collect me said: &apos;I&apos;ve got some sad news.&apos; At that moment, a hole was created.&quot; As well as losing a close friend, it brought back bleak memories for Robuchon, whose older sister killed herself when he was in his 20s. &quot;I know, because of my sister, that suicide is a chain of events. With Bernard, I don&apos;t think that Michelin was a primary reason. He was a very anxious man - jolly on the outside, but at the same time very introvert.&quot; Robuchon, by contrast, insists he is &quot;very happy&quot; on the inside, and appears totally unflappable, almost meditative, in person. Does he think he is a success? &quot;I don&apos;t know. I have 25 Michelin stars, but what does that mean?&quot; He ponders this for a moment. &quot;It just means I have a lot of restaurants.&quot; Top restaurants in the UK and Ireland There are three champions of British cuisine, each with three Michelin stars. Michel Roux runs the Waterside Inn in Bray, Berks, and has received the three-star accolade for 24 years.Gordon Ramsay has had three stars for his Royal Hospital Road, London, for nine consecutive years.Heston Blumenthal has had three stars for the Fat Duck, also in Bray, for five years.

Established in 1998 by an international treaty in Rome, the ICC was created to provide justice for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes when national systems fail. It is a court of last resort for victims, a permanent instrument of justice to replace the ad hoc UN tribunals set up to deal with Yugoslavia and Rwanda. One hundred and eight states have ratified the Rome statute, but there are notable absentees - the US, Israel, China and India. Britain opposed the ICC until Tony Blair replaced John Major as prime minister in 1997. Questions over the court&apos;s legitimacy have inevitably arisen because it has not been ratified by key parties. The US insists it is not trying to undermine the court, but just attempting to protect US personnel abroad from an &quot;unaccountable&quot; prosecutor and &quot;frivolous&quot; cases. Russian actions in Chechnya, like Israel&apos;s in the occupied Palestinian territories, will also be off limits for the foreseeable future, risking accusations of selective justice. With Barack Obama in the White House, the US is likely to tone down its opposition, but antipathy towards the court is so entrenched that hopes for American ratification remain slim. The best that human rights advocates can hope for is a stab at ratification in a second term if Obama is re-elected. The ICC depends heavily on the goodwill of the UN security council. It was able to proceed on Darfur, where serious human rights violations have taken place, only after the US agreed not to use its veto. It did so after receiving guarantees that US citizens in Sudan would be exempt from prosecution. The security council can ask the ICC to launch investigations or the ICC prosecutor can decide independently to start investigations, but prosecutions have to be approved by a panel of judges. The decision by Luis Moreno Ocampo, the ICC prosecutor, to issue arrest warrants for President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide raised many eyebrows - evidence, if any was needed, of the political minefields the court has to negotiate. The ICC prosecutor has opened investigations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Sudan and Central African Republic, and the court has four suspects, all of them alleged warlords from Congo, in custody."}, {"sentences": ["This phenomenon was known as the search for yield and resulted in a flow of funds from Tokyo to Reykjavik."], "tags": ["Iceland", "Global recession", "World news", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-26T18:08:21Z", "title": "How Iceland went from world's biggest hedge fund to pariah in global markets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/26/iceland-hedge-fund", "article": "At the start of this decade Iceland would have made an unlikely candidate for the first sovereign-state domino to fall in the financial meltdown. A country with a population the size of Coventry, it was famous for fish, thermal power, prohibitively expensive alcohol and the odd premier league footballer. Today the word Iceland conjures up an entirely different impression; a country that turned itself into the world&apos;s biggest hedge fund and is now paying the price. Here&apos;s what happened. In the final quarter of the 20th century financial markets were gradually liberalised so that what were once domestic markets became one global market. In the early part of this decade inflation fell in most of the western world as a result of the recession triggered by the dotcom collapse and the flood of cheap imports into the west from Asia. Interest rates fell in most of the developed world, and in Japan, which had been in almost permanent recession since the early 1990s, they were almost zero. Pension funds had made big losses on their ill-judged investments in new technology shares and were looking to make amends. This phenomenon was known as the search for yield and resulted in a flow of funds from Tokyo to Reykjavik. Iceland had relatively high interest rates, so investors borrowed heavily in Japanese yen and bought Icelandic bonds. Money flooded into Iceland and its big banks borrowed $120bn (\u00a385bn) on the international markets \u2013 six times the size of the country&apos;s GDP. This is the sort of leverage normally associated with hedge funds, which borrow money for their speculative plays. The money was recycled into other European economies, including Britain where Icelandic investors bought up large parts of the high street, and all was well while the bubble continued to inflate. The financial crash has put paid to Iceland&apos;s get rich quick scheme \u2013 known as the yen carry trade \u2013 and left Iceland saddled with debts it has no hope of paying without impoverishing its people for decades to come.

Vidic was given a red card for elbowing Claudio Bieler, a striker with Ecuador&apos;s Liga de Quito, in the final of the Club World Cup in Tokyo in December. United won the match 1\u20130. Fifa said today that its disciplinary committee will hear the case on Friday with a decision expected by next Monday. A ban for Vidic, likely to be between one and three matches, would be served in the Champions League because the 2008 winner was representing the European governing body at the Fifa tournament. Inter and United, the champions of Italy and England, are set to meet in a two-legged series on 24 February and 11 March. Sir Alex Ferguson, meanwhile, has been buoyed by the news that a number of his key players are ready to return from injury.

Seven daredevil diners in Tsuruoka city, northern Japan, are recovering from severe poisoning after eating grilled blowfish testicles on Monday night. The men experienced breathing difficulties and limb paralysis, and three of them remain in hospital. Blowfish, or pufferfish, are fiendishly difficult to prepare safely because many of their internal organs contain a toxin that is said to be 10,000 times more poisonous than cyanide. &quot;Japanese chefs must have a licence to prepare blowfish in Japan,&quot; says a member of the sushi team at esteemed Japanese eatery Nobu Berkeley St, in London. &quot;This is very difficult to get and takes years of training.&quot; The chef involved in this week&apos;s disaster was not licensed and is now in the hands of the police.  Do they serve this dangerous delicacy at Nobu? &quot;It is illegal to import blowfish to the UK and eat it here,&quot; says our chef gravely. Takanori Kurokawa, executive head chef at Soseki, London, held a blowfish licence about 12 years ago when working in Tokyo. &quot;The testicles aren&apos;t normally eaten in Tokyo or Osaka,&quot; he says, &quot;as it&apos;s against local laws, but there are places where people eat them, because they&apos;re tasty.&quot; According to Kurokawa, there&apos;s a lot of toxin in the testicles, but pickling them for up to a year will dilute the poison. Nevertheless, he says, &quot;I don&apos;t agree with eating this part and wouldn&apos;t recommend anyone else doing so.&quot; The blowfish sashimi, or &quot;fugu&quot;, on the other hand, &quot;is delicious and usually eaten in winter. It is gelatinous, doesn&apos;t smell fishy, and has the most umami [that savoury flavour often associated with monosodium glutamate] of all the fish.&quot; Nearly all fatalities occur when untrained persons prepare and eat them. But, purely in the spirit of curiosity (ie don&apos;t try this at home), how does one go about preparing a blowfish? \u2022 There are many species, but only eat the &quot;torafugu&quot; - tiger puffer - it has less toxic blood.  \u2022 Remove the skin (there are no scales). Cut around the mouth and, from there, pull the skin off.  \u2022 Wash off the jelly now coating the fish with salt.  \u2022 You can eat the outer skin when cleaned and blanched but there is great skill involved in removing the spines: hold the skin in one hand and slice them all off with a knife in one movement.  \u2022 Remove the eyes. \u2022 Now gut your fish. Be very precise with your knife because the ovaries and liver contain most of the poison. (If you burst them while removing them, they will release toxins into the flesh.) \u2022 Fillet as normal for sashimi, cutting up against the bone. \u2022 Then you cut the head into two or three parts, depending on the size of the fish, which is edible once boiled.

A string of album covers followed, including Diamond Dogs for David Bowie and It&apos;s Only Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll for the Rolling Stones (both 1974). The self-styled faiseur d&apos;images created dream-like paintings of inordinate potency, crammed with symbol and smudged colour. He populated them with musicians, actors, politicians and celebrities, and painted unlikely, yet semi-plausible meetings that functioned as fantasy tableaux - Elvis and John Lennon, for example, hunkered down in an American diner. Born in Brussels, Peellaert first came to public attention in the French-speaking world in 1966 through his early work as a comic artist in a pop art vein with his character Jodelle. The following year Pravda, a female character, was launched, first in the satirical magazine Hara-Kiri and then in Pravda la Suivireuse (Pravda the Overseer). Jodelle was modelled on the singer Sylvie Vartan, widely viewed as her generation&apos;s first lady of y\u00e9-y\u00e9 in France. Pravda was based on Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, the icon of cool French pop.  These cult comics used brash, pop art colours and added twists of psychedelia, as Australian Martin Sharp was doing in London and Kelley-Mouse in San Francisco. They earned him a particular reputation in Japan where this work was republished as Guy Peellaert&apos;s Flipper Comics (2000) and an exhibition and installation entitled Looking For Pravda was held in Tokyo in 2004. The couturier Jean-Charles de Castelbajac used the two heroines for his 2001 collection Physical Graffiti, named in honour of the Led Zeppelin album.  Peellaert came to greater attention with Rock Dreams. It sold more than 1m copies in its various editions. The meticulously detailed paintings created imaginary situations, uniting people in fantasy situations, frequently adapted from iconic photographic images. Laughing moptop-era Beatles race towards the camera as if in an outtake from Help! - only this time not with screaming fans but a copper in hot pursuit. Bob Dylan sits in a limousine cradling a cat. A man we presume is Sam Cooke lies murdered in a motel room.  Rock Dreams led immediately to important commissions. Bowie had him deliver the artwork for Diamond Dogs, with the singer as some louche, human-headed dog, part-whippet, part-sphinx, totally under the skin of the public perception of Bowie at this point in his career. Peellaert did the cover for It&apos;s Only Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll in the same year. Among the acts he subsequently painted for were Guy B\u00e9art (B\u00e9art chante l&apos;espace), Bowie (Bowie at the Beeb), Willie Deville (A Horse of a Different Color), Lio (Ballades and its counterpart Pop Songs) and, just released, Second Sex&apos;s Petite mort. He was also active, especially during the 1980s, as a film poster artist for films from, among others, Robert Altman, Robert Bresson, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Wim Wenders.  He notably reprised his fantasy images with Las Vegas - The Big Room (1986), on which Michael Herr collaborated. Each book took years to create. The Big Room took 11. In an interview with the Guardian in 1986, he said: &quot;If I do two more [like this] I&apos;m going to be dead.&quot; He completed one more - the culmination of his sequence of fantasies, 20th Century Dreams (1999).  He is survived by his wife Elizabeth and son Orson. \u2022 Guy Peellaert, graphic artist, painter and photographer, born 6 April 1934; died 17 November 2008"}, {"sentences": ["As I recently reported, Tokyo&apos;s authorities have stepped up their campaign to turn Japan&apos;s biggest red-light district, Kabukicho, into somewhere visitors can take the children without corrupting them for good.", "But Kabukicho is an asault on the senses that no visitor to Tokyo should miss and, thankfully, for older tourists curious about the underbelly of one of the world&apos;s major cities, the big clean-up is encountering fierce resistance from the locals.", "To help visitors find their way around the maze of narrow streets occupying a tiny, but expensive, chunk of prime Tokyo real estate, Max Hodges, the American expat founder of White Rabbit Press, spent more than a year trawling every inch of Kabukicho to produce an audio package he describes as &quot;a museum guide, only outdoors&quot;.", "&quot;Kabukicho&apos;s one of the most fascinating parts of Tokyo,&quot; Hodges says on the website.", "You see a lot of hysterical stuff here ...

(You can hear a sample of the tour and see some of Hodges&apos; images here.) Hodges says: &quot;I wanted to dispel some of the stereotypes about the area. When people think of Kabukicho they think of commercial sex and gangsters, but there&apos;s really a lot of diverse things to do here, like go to movie theatres, batting cages, billiard rooms, restaurants and bars, spas, and hotels for all purposes. People come here to unwind and to have fun, and their light-hearted attitude is refreshing.&quot; White Rabbit Press has shifted more than 400 of the audio tours since they went on sale late last year, and bloggers who have taken the tour appear impressed, not least with Hodges&apos; recommendations for en-route sustenance at one-room shanty bars.  Andrew at PingMag was similarly charmed, drawn, he says, &quot;into a surreal experience&quot; befitting a scene from Ryu Murakami&apos;s dark and disturbing novel In the Miso Soup. Though the Tokyo metropolitan government has made a slow start in its quest to turn Kabukicho into a squeaky clean shadow of its former self, Hodges says the erosion of its character was already evident on his numerous nighttime strolls. Sky Heart, a cabaret where the female staff dressed as topless flight attendants, closed while he was putting together his guide; a building that once housed Loose Socks, a fetish club and scene of a fatal fire in 2001, has been torn down; and the Koma Theatre, a postwar staple of Kabukicho&apos;s more wholesome cultural scene is to make way for a new entertainment complex.  Operators say takings have halved since the police started enforcing a midnight curfew, ands Hodges says: &quot;Tenants are reluctant to invest in their clubs, because they know they won&apos;t be there for very long. They move out and someone else immediately takes their place.&quot; Whether or not the clean-up succeeds, the Kabukicho beloved of carousing businessmen and curious tourists, is clearly under assault.

With the prime minister due to use a visit to Davos to outline his agenda for the gathering of 20 rich and developing nations in London in April, labour leaders urged immediate and radical action to save and create jobs. Representatives of organised labour said there was a growing risk of a return to the deflationary environment of the 1930s as businesses sought to cut costs and they urged governments to act together on a reflationary package. Phil Jennings, head of the UNI international trade union, said: &quot;It feels like apocalypse now. A social timebomb is ticking. We are in a very dangerous place.&quot; He added: &quot;We have been ringing the alarm bells here at Davos for years but almost no one has been listening. We trusted the markets and the markets failed us. Sure, they delivered enormous benefits but for the very few, not for the rest of us. The levels of inequality have risen to the highest since the 1920s.&quot; Brown has insisted that the government will not stand by as unemployment rises in Britain and will lay out four priorities tomorrow for the April summit \u2013 following through on commitments to toughen up financial regulation made at the previous gathering of world leaders in Washington last November; taking action to stimulate the global economy; keeping markets open; and sustainability. As Brown prepared for Davos yesterday the chancellor, Alistair Darling, said he would not now be going. David Arkless, head of corporate affairs at recruitment agency Manpower, said economies had always recovered from downturns in the past half-century so it was important to retrain workers who were laid off so they could take advantage of new job opportunities. &quot;The stimulus packages that are being introduced have to put lots of money into preparing people to get the jobs.&quot; In an 11-point recovery plan, unions said there was a need for a &quot;Green New Deal&quot; that would channel higher state spending into climate-friendly investment and jobs. They also urged more generous \u00adunemployment benefits, spending on schools and hospitals, and a rise in foreign aid. Guy Ryder, of the International Trade Union Confederation, said unions had been issuing warnings for years but had been ignored by businesses and politicians happy to reap short-term gains from deregulation and speculation. &quot;Businesses and governments created this crisis on their own, but they won&apos;t be able to solve it unless they work with unions to stop the jobs haemorrhage, kick-start the world economy and put a proper regulatory framework in place.&quot; Unions called for further cuts in interest rates \u2013 particularly in Europe \u2013 and higher borrowing to allow governments to boost spending. Any tax cuts should be \u00adconcentrated on those with the lowest incomes. John Evans, general secretary of the trade union advisory committee to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said there were three crises feeding off each other: a housing crisis marked by falling prices, a financial crisis with banks seeing huge capital losses, and an unemployment crisis. &quot;The unemployment crisis is feeding back into asset prices and a continuing financial crisis,&quot; he said. Jennings called for immediate action by governments in their stimulus packages to put employment at the top of the agenda. &quot;The packages must be big and quick. People are angry and they are demanding action,&quot; he said. London summit Gordon Brown plans to use his visit to Davos to outline his agenda for a London summit of 20 rich and developing nations in April. But sources in Davos yesterday said the prime minister&apos;s ambition to give the summit formal status as an alternative to the G8 group had run into opposition from the US and Japan. Emerging countries such as China, India and Brazil are on the new body and keen to play a greater role in world affairs. Washington and Tokyo&apos;s misgivings mean the meeting is to be called the London summit rather than the G20 summit, sources said."}, {"sentences": ["Barcelona and Milan (La Persistencia de la Memoria) 10 1 Tiber (Lord Macaulay - Horatius, The Lays of Ancient Rome) 2 Thames (Robert Bridges - There is a Hill Beside the Silver Thames) 3 Weser (Robert Browning - The Pied Piper of Hamelin) 4 Nile (Jules Verne - Five Weeks in a Balloon) 5 Danube - (John Buchan - Greenmantle) 6 Jordan (Joshua 3.13-17) 7 Oise (RL Stevenson - An Inland Voyage) 8 Ohio (Mark Twain - The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) 9 Amazon (Rudyard Kipling - The Beginning of the Armadilloes, Just So Stories) 10 Oxus (Matthew Arnold - Sohrab and Rustum) 11 1 Rose Stanley (Muriel Spark - The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie) 2 Accrington Stanley FC (evolved from Stanley Villa FC in 1893) 3 Stanley Mortensen in Stanley Matthews&apos;s Match (Only 20th century FA Cup final hat-trick - Blackpool 4 Bolton Wanderers 3 - 1953) 4 Stanley Baldwin (&quot;... my lips are not yet unsealed ...&quot;

The failure of England&apos;s bid to host the 2006 World Cup left those involved vowing that future bids must learn the painful lessons. But with Fifa officials due to begin \u00adtearing open the letters of intent that will kick-start the race for 2018 on Monday and the English bid organisation&apos;s chief executive, Andy Anson, due to host a press conference next week to officially unveil it, some of those close to the process are starting to voice fears that history could repeat itself. In theory, England&apos;s bid has everything going for it. The World Cup is well placed to return to Europe after South Africa in 2010 and Brazil in 2014. It will be 52 long years since 1966, it has strong government support and is well funded (to the tune of \u00a315m). It will tick all the boxes in terms of stadiums, infrastructure and \u00adcommercial considerations. And, if the bid team can tap into it without tipping into arrogance, there is a rich seam of romance to be mined. But already, cracks are starting to appear as strong rivals line up. Critics say the preponderance of \u00adWestminster figures on the board \u2013 the Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney, the former minister for international development Baroness Amos, the sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe and his predecessor Richard Caborn, who does not have a vote but sits as the &quot;prime minister&apos;s ambassador&quot; \u2013 has left less room for those who know how to best negotiate the Fifa corridors of power where the campaign will be won and lost. Geoff Thompson, the British representative on the Fifa executive board and a key figure in global football politics, only has an ambassadorial role as one of nine vice-presidents, alongside the likes of the England manager Fabio Capello and David Beckham. On his appointment Anson said that avoiding the arrogance that had hobbled previous bids and building bridges with the Premier League would be priorities. At this week&apos;s board meeting, the consensus was that there is a long way to go. The Premier League chairman David Richards was not offered a place on the main board, although the Manchester United chief executive David Gill does sit on it. The \u00adPremier League spectacularly fell out with the FA chairman, Lord Triesman, who also chairs the bid board, last year when he made a damning speech about the &quot;debt mountains&quot; in English football. The schism between the two organisations has yet to heal and the perception that he has sidelined the \u00adPremier League in the 2018 structure has not helped matters. For all the work done by the FA&apos;s international development programme in Asia, Africa and South America, the Premier League remains \u00adEnglish football&apos;s main calling card outside Europe. Mending the relationship will be one of Anson&apos;s key tasks. In doing so, the former ATP chief executive will attempt to position the 2018 bid as distinct from the FA \u2013 not easy when Triesman is leading it, its chief operating officer Simon Johnson had the same job at the FA and Jane Bateman, its well-regarded former director of international development, will play a key role. Triesman&apos;s dual role was not on the agenda at a board meeting on Tuesday and nor was it raised. And he will point out that every other bidding vehicle is headed by its \u00adassociation chairman and argue that England would be at a disadvantage if that were not the case. But some of those on the board are still said to harbour \u00adreservations about whether he will be able combine both jobs. The board is being urged to learn the lessons of London&apos;s successful bid for the 2012 Olympics and appointed Sir Keith Mills, a key architect, as a non-executive director. In its letter opening the bidding process, Fifa said it was &quot;determined that this overwhelming ability to reach out to the world should benefit the game of football itself and society in general, and therefore asks that candidates make sure that this power is used in order to achieve positive change&quot;. Triesman and Anson will have to come up with a narrative at an early stage, explaining what England could do for football around the world. The final &quot;bid book&quot; is due in by May next year. While building a public and political case is important, the campaign boils down to influencing the 24 members of the Fifa executive committee. &quot;Each member should be the subject of a specific campaign designed to deliver his individual vote. There should, in effect, be 24 different bid campaigns,&quot; recommended a report commissioned by the FA following its decision to bid. One senior figure in the sports world said there were three urgent priorities: &quot;To get the domestic football politics \u00adbetter aligned, to rebuild key relationships with Richards, Thompson and the Premier League in general and to develop a really strong focus for the international campaign.&quot; Some believe that a Seb Coe figure must be found around which a political and sporting consensus can be built. \u00adOthers consider that to be a red herring, believing Coe, who as chairman of the Fifa ethics committee must stay neutral, to be a one-off. It is likely that other big names, including 1966 World Cup winners, will come in as momentum gathers. Those close to the bid point out that the executives that will drive it have barely got their feet under the desk. They include Ian Riley, the director of the technical bid who performed a similar role for South Africa, and David Magliano, the commercial and marketing director who did the same job for London 2012. And they argue that just because the likes of Sir Martin Sorrell, a non-executive member of the main board, and Leahy may not be personally known to Fifa committee members, their huge business acumen and contacts will be put to work in other ways. They hope once the bid is launched, political infighting and squabbles over expenses will recede. But senior figures in the sports world believe that if the \u00adfoundations are not strengthened now it will leave England&apos;s bid on bumpy ground. With strong European competition from Spain and Portugal&apos;s joint bid and Russia, European votes could end up split; Uefa&apos;s president Michel Platini, meanwhile, will have little choice but to abstain. When the Fifa executive cast their votes in \u00adDecember 2010, the first to reach 13 will win. There is another cloud on the horizon. The bid was conceived in a sunnier economic climate as part of Gordon Brown&apos;s vision for a &quot;golden decade&quot; of British sporting events, that would also encompass the Olympics, the rugby and cricket World Cups and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but will now be delivered against the backdrop of the worst recession in \u00addecades. Meanwhile, opposition MPs are exercised by the extent to which they believe Labour has tried to claim \u00adownership. Sutcliffe, as well as Caborn, will likely be replaced if the Tories win power. But the shadow sports minister Hugh Robertson said he believed it had already become a political football. &quot;The two great lessons to be learned from London 2012 are that sport, not government, should lead the bid and that it must attract cross-party support,&quot; he said. &quot;So far, this bid appears to have achieved \u00adneither of them. By no means is it too late to correct this but they have got to get the structure right.&quot; All involved insist they can put domestic squabbles to one side and unite for the good of the bid. It is \u00adunderstood renewed overtures will be made to \u00adRichards and the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to get them onside. Triesman will hope the presence of Gill and his Chelsea counterpart Peter Kenyon, in a vice-president role, will help. In this race, England are to the rest of the field what Paris was to London in 2005. The perception that &quot;It&apos;s England&apos;s to lose&quot; is one that Anson&apos;s team are working hard to counter. As history has proved, being an early favourite is not always a good thing - far better to sprint clear in the closing stages. Like a US presidential race, successful campaigns rely on &quot;MO&quot;. Like the ultimately triumphant 2012 bid, Anson&apos;s task will be to unite warring domestic tribes around a campaign that is at once powerful enough to inspire the nation, imaginative enough to stand out and flexible enough to sway those that will ultimately decide its fate. Failure in 2006: Bid that was doomed from the start The campaign to bring the World Cup to England in 2006 was launched on the back of the euphoria and success of Euro 96. But it was immediately hobbled by German claims that the Football Association had reneged on a &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; to back England&apos;s European Championship bid in return for a clear run at the 2006 World Cup. Despite investing \u00a310m of FA and public funds, and enlisting the help of Sir Geoff Hurst and Sir Bobby Charlton to criss-cross the globe in ambassadorial roles, the campaign was unable to shake Uefa&apos;s belief that the agreement existed. Some commentators believed the concentration on England&apos;s place as the rightful host because it was &quot;the home of football&quot; was also overplayed and risked confirming prejudices about the arrogance of the English game. It also suffered due to a lack of British representation on the main Uefa and Fifa boards. Hooliganism in Charleroi and Brussels during Euro 2000, just before the crucial vote, did not help England&apos;s chances either. And as it turned out the new Wembley, also a key part of the bid, would not have been finished. A later Commons select committee report said that the bid was innately flawed because it was unable to win the support of European committee members due to the &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; farrago. In his recent book, the former FA executive director David Davies, who also revealed that the FA was apparently offered votes for cash during the bidding process, said: &quot;The failure of England&apos;s bid was more cock-up than conspiracy \u2013 and it was a very expensive cock-up ... England should never have bid for 2006.&quot; Owen Gibson The other nine bids for 2018 RussiaPros Wealth from natural resources will bolster the bidCon 11 time zones will cause logistical headaches.

Hospitality sales are currently \u00adrunning at 27% below budget and tickets for all three England matches, against Italy, France and Scotland, are for the first time in years still on public sale eight days before the tournament. Baron fears the RFU will lose a minimum of \u00a310m in \u00adrevenue in the next financial year and is looking to slash costs by around \u00a36m to soften the significant blow. The RFU has also instigated a global crisis meeting of CEOs from the top 10 rugby nations to debate a coordinated response to the increasingly pressing financial issues affecting the sport. Baron, furthermore, has reiterated his belief that England will struggle to stage the 2015 World Cup under the current rules which require the hosts to hand over a guaranteed up-front payment of \u00a380m. &quot;Whether we can bid in this current climate is a very finely balanced decision indeed,&quot; said Baron, keenly aware the British government are in no position to help out. &quot;It is a big ask for any organisation.&quot; The sobering bulletin from Twickenham will come as little surprise to those Premiership clubs already struggling to stay afloat and the implications are potentially grim for all concerned. RFU funding underpins the English game at all levels and the tangible benefits of the World Cup victory of 2003 are still being felt. The union has recorded consistently strong figures in recent years and even reported a profit last November \u2013 \u00a31.5m after tax \u2013 despite being deprived of its normal autumn international revenue by the 2007 World Cup in France. Now, with top-priced match tickets costing \u00a383, there are increasing signs that the public are, in Baron&apos;s words, &quot;sitting on their wallets at the moment&quot;. A slackening of demand was apparent even before the autumn Tests and the RFU management insists England&apos;s recent poor results are not to blame for the increasing number of empty seats. &quot;I think it&apos;s entirely recession-based,&quot; said Baron, acknowledging that the union was already reviewing its ticket-pricing policy for next season. He is still hoping for a late surge in Six Nations sales but accepts that the enlarged 82,000-capacity stadium is unlikely to be full for next weekend&apos;s Italy game. Rival unions with smaller stadiums and populations have potentially even more cause for concern and South \u00adAfrica&apos;s hopes of attracting droves of tourists to watch this summer&apos;s Lions tour appear to be waning. Initial estimates of 50,000 Lions fans heading south are being revised sharply downwards and Baron confirmed that the sale of official packages had &quot;slowed dramatically&quot; since Christmas. With no imminent sign of better times ahead, there will be much to contemplate at the global summit Baron is trying to convene within the next six weeks. &quot;As a rugby family hopefully we can come up with some conclusions about the best way forward. It&apos;s always dangerous when action taken by one union has a knock-on effect on other unions,&quot; he said. The southern hemisphere nations will advise England that they saw trouble approaching some time ago. Australia and New Zealand scheduled a Bledisloe Cup Test in Hong Kong last year in an effort to push rugby into Asian markets and a follow-up game in Tokyo is in the pipeline. A decision on where the 2015 and 2019 World Cups will be staged is due to be taken in late July. If England do opt to step aside \u2013 the RFU is keen to delay its decision as long as possible \u2013 the leading European contender could be Italy, who have been assured of government support."}, {"sentences": ["Shock news from Japan A key player in Tokyo&apos;s bid for the 2016 Olympics had an admission to leave sports fans quaking yesterday.", "Given that seismologists estimate there is a 30% chance of a major earthquake hitting Tokyo by 2015, how will her organising committee keep safe the tens of thousands of fans in the main stadium?"], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Chelsea", "Southampton", "Fulham", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-30T00:05:17Z", "title": "Digger: London faces battle to pay for athletes' village", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/30/olympics2012-chelsea", "article": "Lend Lease, the government&apos;s construction partner for the Olympic village, has had to write down the value of its worldwide property book by more than \u00a3350m.

Lend Lease&apos;s total losses directly attributable to its UK operation have now reached \u00a3225m. Yet the Olympic Delivery Authority was yesterday standing by its belief that Lend Lease can be persuaded to invest \u00a3450m in the troubled \u00a31bn athletes&apos; village, under a shared-ownership scheme. A spokesman said he expected a deal &quot;later this year&quot;, with Lend Lease talking about &quot;early 2009&quot;. But last year&apos;s public accounts committee report on the Games stated presciently that: &quot;The uncertainty in the financial and property markets has increased the difficulties of securing private sector finance and impacted on the commercial viability of the deal.&quot; After the organisers had to raid the government contingency fund for another \u00a3231m last week to cover shortfalls in private sector funding, it seems increasingly likely that the village \u2013 the Olympics&apos; biggest construction project \u2013 will be entirely taxpayer funded. We do not have long to find out. David Higgins, the ODA&apos;s chief executive, admits that the money currently available to his organisation for building the village will run out in the middle of next year, halfway in to the construction schedules. League&apos;s youth chief quits Huw Jennings, the highly regarded former academy director at Southampton FC, who produced the young internationals Theo Walcott and Gareth Bale, has joined Fulham to do the same job. Jennings hankered for a return to an educational role after running the Premier League&apos;s department for youth development, where he is also believed to have grown frustrated with the politics involved in organising strategy alongside the Football Association and the Football League. At Fulham he will pilot a project where players are kept on in the academy structure until the age of 21, ensuring that they are able to develop technically without the pressures of having to push for a first\u2011team place. Mutu v Chelsea Chelsea will find out in the coming days how long they have to wait before lawyers confirm whether they really are due a \u00a315m windfall from their former employee Adrian Mutu, below. Fifa awarded Chelsea \u00a417.17m last August after the world governing body found Mutu culpable for a breach of contract &quot;without sporting just cause&quot; after he failed a drugs test for cocaine. Last September the Romania captain appealed the verdict to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is due to meet in March. But if the court upholds Fifa&apos;s ruling, Chelsea will find the money very handy, given their highly publicised recent cost-saving measures. Shock news from Japan A key player in Tokyo&apos;s bid for the 2016 Olympics had an admission to leave sports fans quaking yesterday. This column tracked down Hiromi Umeda, the bid&apos;s executive director of international affairs, during her visit to London to promote the city&apos;s attempt to succeed London as the Olympic Games&apos; host city. Given that seismologists estimate there is a 30% chance of a major earthquake hitting Tokyo by 2015, how will her organising committee keep safe the tens of thousands of fans in the main stadium? &quot;We&apos;ll have an earthquake, no doubt,&quot; said Umeda, cheerfully. &quot;But we have very, very good protections with anti-earthquake buildings. A modest earthquake should be OK, more or less. Probably a magnitude six will be OK and we can deal with it easily.&quot; Now geology is not one of this column&apos;s few fortes, but hang on: don&apos;t one-fifth of the world&apos;s magnitude-six earthquakes hit Japan? So what about a magnitude six? &quot;During the Olympic Games time, according to our focus \u2013 we&apos;ve made inquiries \u2013 and a magnitude six is unlikely.&quot; Yes, but what about a magnitude six?

It is far from perfect, ending melodramatically and arguably even sentimentally, but it is still a powerfully direct piece of cinema, a movie with a rich vein of compassion, humour and narrative drive. It won a prize at last year&apos;s Cannes film festival, but 2009 is the year to see it, delivering, as it does, a premonition of hard times and a fierce satire on what happens to the salaryman&apos;s family life when the worst happens, how easily he can go into denial, and how denial has been bred into us by our former lives of prosperity and success. The movie is set around five years ago and centres on Ryuhei (Teruyuki Kagawa), a loyal and energetic company man who has lost his job as part of a management shakeup that he did much to initiate. Desperate to avoid the humiliation of admitting this to his wife, Ryuhei leaves the house every day in his suit, and spends his time queueing for free food from a charity cart and applying for unattainable jobs. His wife Megumi (Kyoko Koizumi) soon suspects what has happened and must now shoulder a grim new domestic burden: pretending not to know. Their eldest son Takashi (Yu Koyanagi) also cannot find work and infuriates his father by applying to join the US military as an international volunteer - an implied rebuke to his father&apos;s inadequacies as the traditional Japanese patriarch-provider. The couple&apos;s younger son Kenji (Inowaki Kai) has been brutally forbidden on financial grounds from learning the piano, but sneaks out to buy lessons with his lunch money: a life of diurnal subterfuge much like his father&apos;s. Tokyo Sonata reminded me a little of two French movies about salaryman-delusion: Laurent Cantet&apos;s Time Out (2001) and Nicole Garcia&apos;s The Adversary (2002), both based on the same real-life story of an unemployed doctor who lived a lie and engineered his own tragedy. Like those movies, Tokyo Sonata shows how prosperous men put their careers at the centre of their identities and suffer agonies when those careers disappear - and also it shows that, in a bizarre way, pretending to have a job is actually not that different from having a job: the rituals of leaving for work, coming home from work and generally imposing your family authority can easily be maintained, and for longer than you think. Denial and pretence were there from the beginning. Kurosawa wittily shows how Ryuhei and fellow jobless sufferer Kurosu (Kanji Tsuda) find that, for a while, their bogus salaryman lives are rather pleasant: they are still the wage-earning lords of their cowed domestic fiefdom, but do not have the bother of actually having to go into work. Ry\u00fbhei&apos;s lies poison his family life, but redemption is to come from Kenji&apos;s piano lessons in a quietly moving final scene.

Household spending fell by 4.6% in December, the 10th consecutive monthly fall, while core consumer inflation edged up a mere 0.2%. &quot;Companies are not only cutting production but also cutting employment, which is deeply unsettling for households,&quot; Martin Schulz, senior economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute, told theguardian.com. &quot;We are now looking at a domestically driven recession. The domestic economy is at risk of falling apart, and if that happens we are looking at a really deep, long recession. Even if that doesn&apos;t happen, things are already bad enough.&quot; With Japan&apos;s non-regular employees, who now comprise a third of the workforce, at increasing risk of being laid off, families are refusing to spend, and analysts say the government&apos;s much-derided handout of \u00a512,000 (\u00a394) for every individual is unlikely to have any impact. Predictions of further falls in production in the coming months are making prime minister Taro Aso&apos;s boast that Japan will be the first to emerge from the recession look increasingly hollow. The economics minister, Kaoru Yosano, admitted the economy was &quot;in a very grave situation&quot;. &quot;Japan is being hit by a wave of weakening global demand,&quot; he said. The plight of Japan&apos;s exporters was underlined yesterday when Toshiba forecast record annual losses. Toyota, meanwhile, could be heading for an operating loss - its first for more than 70 years - of about \u00a5400bn for the year to the end of March, reports said today, while Sony is bracing itself for record losses this year. Although factory production is at its lowest level for 20 years, cuts in output have barely dented bloated inventories, prompting speculation there could be more reductions. Exporters&apos; desperate attempts to climb out of the crisis are being hampered by the strength of the yen, which gained 23% against the dollar and 29% against the euro last year. Economists predict that fourth-quarter GDP figures, due out next month, would show the world&apos;s second biggest economy shrinking at a double-digit annual rate. In addition, the International Monetary Fund warned that Japan&apos;s GDP would contract by 2.6% this year, the gloomiest prediction of all the G7 countries except Britain. If the IMF forecast is correct, it would be the worst contraction since the end of the second world war. &quot;As output adjustments continue, weakness in the overall economy will persist from January to March, and the degree of worsening depends on how exports turn out,&quot; said Tatsushi Shikano, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. &quot;It is already a consensus view that core consumer inflation will turn negative soon, but we must watch if a worsening of the economy pushes Japan into a deflationary spiral, even though the Bank of Japan sees no signs of that happening right now.&quot; The gloomy data stopped in its tracks a three-day rally by the Nikkei, sending the benchmark index tumbling 3.1% in Tokyo. Nintendo shares sank 12% after the video game maker cuts its earnings and sales forecasts. The company, which had enjoyed huge sales of its DS and Wii game consoles, said yesterday that annual operating profit would fall by 16%. Honda, Toyota, Sony and Toshiba were also down. The Nikkei has lost more than 10% this year after shedding more than 40% last year. The Bank of Japan is buying up corporate debt and recently brought interest rates down to just above zero, while the government this week passed a $53bn stimulus package and launched a $16.7bn fund to buy shares in struggling firms. But Schulz said Japan&apos;s financial authorities were running out of options to save the economy from a deeply damaging recession. &quot;The government has few tools left to deal with this. Japan managed to shield failing companies during the last recession \u2013 the so-called zombie firms \u2013 but you cannot protect companies from a breakdown in demand in the domestic economy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Masao Okonogi, a Korea expert at Keio University, in Tokyo, said the North was &quot;just sending a message to the United States&quot;."], "tags": ["US news", "World news", "South Korea", "North Korea"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-30T10:48:52Z", "title": "North Korea scraps all agreements with South Korea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/north-korea-south-korea1", "article": "North Korea today announced it was scrapping a non-aggression pact and all other accords with the South, increasing tensions with its neighbour. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have deteriorated rapidly since President Lee Myung-bak took office in the South last year. Analysts warned that this latest move increased the chances of a military clash, but suggested it was primarily aimed at gaining the attention of the US president, Barack Obama. Many predicted that Pyongyang would seek to unsettle the new US administration. &quot;There is neither way to improve [relations] nor hope to bring them on track,&quot; the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which oversees ties with Seoul, said, according to the North&apos;s official KCNA news agency. The committee said the agreements were &quot;dead&quot;, adding: &quot;The confrontation between the North and the South in the political and military fields has been put to such extremes that the inter-Korean relations have reached the brink of a war.&quot; Pyongyang said it would no longer respect a disputed Yellow Sea border with the South, raising the prospect of new skirmishes in an area which saw naval firefights, resulting in casualties on both sides, in 1999 and 2002. Won Tae-jae, a spokesman for Seoul&apos;s defence ministry, said the country would respond &quot;sternly&quot; to any violation of the boundary. Officials said the military was on alert. Unification ministry spokesman Kim Ho-nyeon expressed regret at the announcement, urging the North to defuse the tensions through dialogue. However, a presidential official told Reuters: &quot;Our position is there is no need to react sensitively or get happy or sad over every single statement issued [by the North] with some political motive.&quot; Lee has taken a tougher stance towards Pyongyang \u2013 contrasting with his predecessor&apos;s &quot;sunshine policy&quot; \u2013 and has clamped down on the flow of aid. The armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war was not included in today&apos;s announcement because it was signed by the North, the US and China, but not the South. The neighbours have never signed a peace treaty ending the conflict, and a heavily fortified demilitarised zone, with thousands of troops on either side, remains in place between the two. The North has a history of using aggressive rhetoric to grab attention and keep other countries guessing about its intentions. But it has also been willing to take action, detonating its first nuclear device in 2006 in protest at US sanctions it described as a &quot;declaration of war&quot;. Korea University professor Yoo Ho-yeol told Reuters that today&apos;s announcement had three aims \u2013 to pressure Lee into softening his policy, to scare the US and to drum up domestic support. &quot;The North probably believes that this type of thing is the most effective way of getting the upper hand with the US ahead of negotiations by raising tension,&quot; he said. He warned that Pyongyang could be exhausting its rhetorical options, having already threatened to reduce the South to &quot;ashes&quot; and all but closed border crossings. Earlier this month, the North&apos;s military accused the South of preparing to wage war and said it had adopted an &quot;all-out confrontational posture&quot;. &quot;What is worrying is that the possibility of a military clash is rising,&quot; Yoo said, suggesting such a confrontation could be broader than previous Yellow Sea incidents. Kim Yong-hyun, of Seoul&apos;s Dongguk University, told the Associated Press Pyongyang was signalling that it would &quot;stage a provocation&quot;, but predicted it would be limited in nature to avoid irreparable damage to relations with Seoul and Washington. Masao Okonogi, a Korea expert at Keio University, in Tokyo, said the North was &quot;just sending a message to the United States&quot;. &quot;If relations with the United States break down completely, there might be the possibility of military tension,&quot; he said. &quot;But for now, they want the United States to talk to them and any military action will just worsen the situation. It&apos;s just words for now.&quot; North Korea appeared to offer an olive branch to Obama in a new year message, and senior officials have signalled keenness to improve relations with the US. Obama has said he would be willing to meet the reclusive North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, if it advanced efforts towards nuclear disarmament. Two years ago, North Korea signed an aid for disarmament pact with the South, the US, China, Russia and Japan, but the deal stalled in August and talks in Beijing in December failed to get the process back on track. Kim is understood to have recovered after suffering a stroke last year and to be in charge of major decisions again. Some experts believe his illness has increased the influence of hardliners in the military, particularly in day-to-day affairs."}, {"sentences": ["The firm announced its earnings results after its shares fell 6.5% during trading in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Global recession", "Japan", "Business", "Business", "Hitachi", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-01-30T14:24:17Z", "title": "27,000 jobs to go at NEC and Hitachi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/30/japan-business", "article": "NEC and Hitachi, the Japanese electronics makers, will between them cut at least 27,000 jobs worldwide to try to counter falling demand and plummeting prices.

Hitachi, which makes everything from home appliances and TVs to IT systems and medical equipment, predicted it would post a huge net loss this fiscal year and said it would slash about 7,000 jobs as part of a global restructuring plan. NEC, a major producer of semiconductors, said about half of the job losses would affect full-time employees and that 40% would be in Japan. &quot;We are aiming for 20,000 or more,&quot; NEC&apos;s president, Kaoru Yano, told a news conference. &quot;It is regrettable that we have to announce such a big downgrade.

The self-indulgence and conspicuous consumption of the last decade, fuelled by easy credit and celebrity culture, is over, says Asda boss Andy Bond. The economic downturn has prompted a sea-change in consumers&apos; aspirations and shopping habits, thinks the chief executive of the Wal-Mart-owned grocer. &quot;We are moving into an era of the frivolous being unacceptable, and the frugal being cool. This won&apos;t be a recession where it is a blip and then we are back to where things were.&quot; Bond likened the change in thinking to the way postwar austerity shaped a generation, and predicted &quot;a fundamental shift that will see the emergence of a new breed of customer&quot;. To be fair, the man who runs Asda, which sells party dresses for less than a tenner and &quot;satin chemise&quot; nighties for \u00a32.45, is unlikely to advocate buying luxury labels and last-a-lifetime quality. But there are real signs that a transformation may be underway; that decadence, for the time being at least, is dying out and saving is the new spending. It is not just that demand for allotments is at a record high or that spending in the haberdashery department at John Lewis is up 20% after decades of decline as we all make do and mend. From food to high fashion, champagne to Swiss watches and cars to motor cruisers, there is evidence that spenders are becoming bargain hunters and that consumers are starting to question whether they really want - or need - that handbag hanging on Katie Holmes&apos;s arm or a supercar from Top Gear. One sign of the change in attitudes was highlighted recently by Claire Kent, a former City analyst and now a consultant to a luxury label businesses. Kent reckons &quot;luxury fatigue&quot; has taken hold, and fuelled by the credit crunch and fear of unemployment it spells the end for the &quot;it bag&quot; - those handbags that otherwise sane women, urged on by fashion and celebrity magazines, will hand over hundreds or thousands of pounds to acquire. &quot;An &apos;it&apos; handbag will become an embarrassment,&quot; said Kent. Her view is shared by Katrin Magnussen, a fashion analyst with market research group Mintel. She predicts sales of designer bags will fall rapidly. &quot;It is the end of ostentatious spending and flashing designer labels,&quot; she said yesterday. Department store Liberty is reducing the space it devotes to such bags from next month. Ferragamo, whose shoes were worn by Greta Garbo and Marilyn Monroe, is also scaling back its expansion plans, halting half of its planned store openings, while LVMH has cancelled a new Tokyo flagship store. It will be bad news indeed for the big European fashion houses, from Chanel and Balenciaga to Burberry and Mulberry. There are already plenty of signs of stress. Just a year ago the Burberry Warrior handbag - priced from \u00a3850 to \u00a313,000, depending on whether it was cut from leather or gold alligator skin - was the handbag for which even wives of hedge fund managers and Premier League footballers had to join a waiting list. A quick glance at the Burberry website now shows that they are seriously out of fashion. The alligator skin Luxury Warrior, once \u00a311,000, is now available online for \u00a34,400. A \u00a31,200 version is down to \u00a3777, a \u00a3700 version is less than \u00a3300. Trawl the current range and there isn&apos;t a handbag on sale for more than \u00a31,500. Mulberry, meanwhile, has broken the first law of branding - don&apos;t slash prices or produce cheaper versions - and come up with a \u00a395 red canvas version of its Bayswater bag in a deal with Gap. Magnussen reckons its a smart move: &quot;It is keeping the brand alive and in front of people when they can&apos;t afford the top end.&quot; The problem, said a rival, will be persuading customers to go back to paying the normal \u00a3595 for the leather versions. At the top of the fashion market, business is still brisk. At last week&apos;s haute couture shows in Paris, houses like Chanel and Dior said their made-to-measure business - frocks from \u00a310,000 and a wedding dress for \u00a3200,000 - is booming. Magnussen, however, believes the mainstream designer fashion businesses aimed at the rich is changing rapidly: &quot;Just look at the Golden Globes dresses. The stars were still all wearing designer labels, but they were so much more subdued&quot;. French luxury goods company Hermes recently posted sales growth of just 4% last year. That might sound good, but when compared to the 12% it achieved a year earlier. LVMH (Louis Vuitton-Mo\u00ebt Hennessy) has witnessed a similar slowdown, which has gained pace since the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year. Management consultants Bain &amp; Co expect sales of high-end goods to drop as much as 7% this year, which would wipe more than \u00a310bn off the \u00a3165bn market for luxury goods. &quot;Inevitably, some labels are going to disappear,&quot; said Magnussen. Much of the switching brands and trading-down is due to shoppers finding themselves strapped for cash. But even those in secure employment are changing the way they shop - partially out of fear of unemployment, but partly as a result of what Jim McCarthy, the chief executive of Poundland, calls &quot;a big psychological change&quot;. McCarthy&apos;s stores are among the few high street chains witnessing booming sales, and a big part of the growth is coming from the wealthiest shoppers. More than one in 10 Poundland shoppers is now from the AB demographic groups - up nearly a quarter in the last year. The same is true at Aldi, the German discounter which is now the fastest-growing grocer in the UK. Half of Aldi&apos;s customers are now in the ABC1 social category - 17% up on a year ago. Sales of premium food labels and organic fruit and vegetables have gone into reverse. And the higher up the ladder of luxury spending, the more pronounced is the downturn. Twelve months ago the biggest labels reckoned that this recession would pass them by, calculating that while Europe, Japan and the US might suffer, they would carry on expanding as a result of fast-growing ranks of wealthy Chinese and Russians. &quot;But the shocking economic news has now hit consumer confidence everywhere and sales at almost all price points,&quot; said one analyst. Tiffany is seeing far fewer customers walk away with one of their blue gift boxes. Sales over the Christmas period, when most jewellers do about 90% of their annual trade, were down more than a fifth on 2007 levels. Last week rival jeweller Bulgari reported a 10% decline in sales, while Swatch, which owns the Omega brand, said sales have fallen 6%. The Federation of Swiss Watchmakers said that November sales, which should be the strongest of the year, were down 12% on October levels. Bulgari boss Francesco Trapatoni said there was little point in cutting prices to stimulate demand. &quot;When the market is so bad, these activities have very little effect, and they can damage the prestige of the brand,&quot; he said. Closer to home, Theo Fennell, the celebrity&apos;s jeweller of choice, had a disastrous Christmas, with sales in December 21% lower than the year before on a like-for-like basis. The jeweller, which counts David Beckham, Elton John and Naomi Campbell among its customers, warned it would make a loss for the year to 31 March. The company is now cutting costs and looking for new investors to help cut its debts. &quot;There is a real crisis of confidence,&quot; said John Guy, a London-based luxury goods analyst at brokerage MF Global Securities. &quot;2009 will be the most difficult year luxury goods makers have faced in a long time.&quot; It is, however, the businesses which have reached down to the middle income shoppers that are likely to be hurt worst, as these shoppers reassess the need to impress. There was little sign of any new austerity at the Monaco yacht show last autumn, where boats start at about \u00a310m and climb to \u00a3200m for vessels such as Roman Abramovich&apos;s planned liner, which will come complete with an anti-attack submarine so that, if necessary, guests can make a hasty undersea escape. But exhibitors at the London Boat Show earlier this month, which displays relatively run-of-the-mill yachts and gin palaces, found business tough. At least one major UK boat-builder, Kidderminster-based Sealine, didn&apos;t even bother to show up. Sealine, together with rivals such as Fairline and Princess, have all slashed jobs as demand for \u00a3200,000-to-\u00a31m cruisers - much of which had come from credit-fuelled self-employed businessmen and bonus-driven City bankers - has hit the rocks. Suddenly it looks far more sensible to charter a boat for an annual holiday in the Med rather than own one outright. Those selling cars to the banker class are also hurting. Aston Martin, which had seen demand soar in recent years, sold 1,000 fewer cars in 2008 than 2007 and has laid off 600 of its 1,800 staff as sales continue to decline. Bentley sales were down a quarter in the UK last year, and Land Rover saw a 30% decline. But 2008 sales of the tiny Smart cars were up 43%. The biggest luxury brands will survive. After all, they have been around through previous financial crises and world wars.

It has strong echoes of The Full Monty, Billy Elliot and Laurent Cantet&apos;s L&apos;Emploi du temps in its tale of Sasaki, a 46-year-old Japanese businessman who loses his job when his department is outsourced to China. He can&apos;t tell his wife, and when she sees him queuing at a soup kitchen with a redundant friend, both in business suits, briefcases in hand, she conceals her knowledge to save him losing face. When his younger son wants to take piano lessons, impecunious Dad refuses on the grounds that it&apos;s a frivolous activity. When the lad uses his lunch money to pay for them, Sasaki gets violent. Meanwhile, his elder son, faced with unemployment, volunteers for the US Army and is posted to Iraq.  This delicately acted movie steers a course between tragedy (two of the characters commit suicide) and black comedy (the strategies and humiliations of deception). Towards the end, it appears to be veering more towards the former. But at a crucial point it takes the Billy Elliot option. In a sublime scene the mother and father attend a performance of Debussy&apos;s Claire de lune by the younger son at a Tokyo conservatoire.

I am having one of the best dreams I have ever had: I am standing at Narita airport in a sea of Japanese people all wearing blue-and-white striped shirts. Half of them are waving giant terrier heads on sticks, the other half are barking madly, because we are all waiting for the arrival of the best team in the world, the champions of Europe - Huddersfield Town, the Mighty Terriers. And now here they are, striding through Arrivals, signing autographs, smiling at the cameras. And then the manager, Lee Clark (who, in just five seasons, has led us out of the wilderness, back to our rightful place), suddenly spots me in the crowd. &quot;Dave,&quot; he says. &quot;Am I glad to see you! We lost one of our lads back at Heathrow, so we&apos;re a man short for the Fifa Club World Cup. Have you got yer boots?&quot; &quot;I have,&quot; I say. &quot;Well put &apos;em on, lad, and meet us at the stadium because I want you to...&quot; &quot;Wake up! Wake up!&quot; I open my eyes. My son, in his best Poltergeist voice, says, &quot;They&apos;re here...&quot; Reluctantly, I follow him into the living room and there they are: on the telly, striding through Arrivals, signing autographs, smiling at the cameras - the champions of Europe, Manchester United. His team, my son&apos;s team. Now my grandfather supported Huddersfield Town. My father still supports Huddersfield Town. And I support Huddersfield Town. Yet my 11-year-old son, George, supports Manchester United. How did this happen? More to the point, how could I have let this happen? On a good day, I blame Cristiano Ronaldo and global capitalism. On a bad day, I know it was me who bought the telly, who subscribed to J-Sports, and has bankrolled his Manchester United kit, ball and pencil case. So I know I have only myself to blame. However, I also have a cunning plan. Having once had the misfortune to meet Lou Reed, I know there is a lot of wisdom in the old adage that one should never meet your heroes... 2) In the court of the crimson kings, Japan annex  Through the hard work of OSM and the good graces of Rio Ferdinand and his agent, the Manchester United defender has agreed to meet me and my son and let us interview him. It is fair to say that George and I both have very different feelings about this and very different agendas. As we&apos;re getting ready to go, I put on my Huddersfield Town scarf. &quot;You&apos;re never wearing that, are you?&quot; says George. &quot;I am,&quot; I say. &quot;It&apos;s cold out.&quot; &quot;You&apos;ll embarrass me.&quot; And if I didn&apos;t wear it, I would betray and shame the proud Town traditions of our family. But I say, &quot;Shall we not go then?&quot; &quot;F- off,&quot; says George, again bringing my parenting skills into stark focus, and so off we f- down to the Pan Pacific Hotel in Yokohama.  Now back when Nottingham Forest came to Tokyo for the Toyota Cup in 1981, Brian Clough and the team stayed at the Imperial Hotel, haunt of the literary ghosts of Akutagawa and Mishima. And though, in all honesty, Forest failed to establish a significant Japanese fanbase, rumour has it you can still stay in the Brian Clough Suite at the Imperial, complete with smashed desk (Forest lost 1-0 to Nacional of Uruguay). Just ask for Room 1408. (Note: for the avoidance of doubt and legal fees, this might not be true. I just wish it were).  But the Pan Pacific Hotel, where Manchester United are staying, is everything that the Imperial is not. It is another ugly skyscraper in a mountain range of ugly skyscrapers. There are, though, two things that distinguish this building from the others: the 100 fans camped outside the hotel and the doormen wearing Manchester United scarves. Jeremy, the OSM photographer, says, &quot;I think we&apos;ve found it.&quot; We&apos;ve also found, by chance, Diana, who is handling the press for Manchester United. She is welcoming and friendly as she leads us inside the hotel and down to the lower-level space that has been turned over to Fifa. Here, just off this oversized corridor with no natural light, are the two rooms where the players do their press and also, oddly, where they eat. So while Jeremy curses his version of hell, George and I sit down to wait for Rio Ferdinand.  Before the possibility of our interviewing Rio Ferdinand arose, my impression was of a gifted defender who had scored a few own goals and perhaps was not the most serious individual to have walked the earth. But, in preparation for the interview, I bought his book, Rio: My Story. Now, I have read a lot of football books and I can&apos;t say I was much looking forward to this one, but it turned out to be one of the best &quot;autobiographies&quot; I&apos;ve read. Not only is Rio candid and self-critical in it, he&apos;s also not shy of giving his opinions on the game and society in general. So I had already begun to doubt that my cunning plan to cure George of Manchester United was actually that cunning. And, above all else, Rio certainly had no reason to agree to this interview, other than out of his own generosity with his time. And now, as if by magic, here he is.  Rio immediately puts George at ease as we walk to the interview room, asking him about his own footballing career to date (Nitera FC 2002-06; British Football Academy, Tokyo, one trial, 2008). I&apos;m waiting for Rio to ask me about my own glory days, but he doesn&apos;t and so we begin, with George going first. George: Which is your favourite place to visit as a player? Rio: I&apos;d have to say Moscow. Because it was where I had the finest hour of my football career so far. And the people were very nice and I just had a fantastic evening. Me: What time did you make me get up to watch that? George:Three in the morning. Rio: Three in the morning, yeah? Me: Yeah. Sorry, go on... George: How is it different playing for England and Manchester United? Rio: I think with Man United because every day I&apos;m with the players, you get to know their habits a lot better and so it&apos;s almost like second nature. You know where the next guy is going to move. Like with [Nemanja] Vidic, I know exactly where he&apos;s going to be, without speaking. Whereas with England, you have to get a lot of information into the team, into the individuals, in a short space of time. That&apos;s where the ability of the manager comes in and I think the one who can do that the best ends up being world champion. So fingers crossed. George: Which team is your biggest rival? Rio: In England or the Champions League? George: In England. Rio: I&apos;d have to say Chelsea, in terms of the league now this season. But in terms of the players and the team and its traditions, Liverpool and then Man City. Especially playing at Anfield; there&apos;s no better place to go and win a game of football.  George: What about the Champions League? Rio: On form, you&apos;d have to say Barcelona. But I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anyone that scares us. George: Who would you like to join Manchester United? Rio: Mmm. If I could buy one player, I&apos;d probably buy Franck Rib\u00e9ry. George: If you had to leave United, which team would you like to play for? Rio: Probably West Ham. Back to London. Family. My first-ever football club. But I don&apos;t see myself ever leaving Man United, to be honest. Now it&apos;s my turn.  Me: Well, his questions were a lot better than mine. But here goes. The last time we saw you was on the telly playing against Tottenham on Saturday evening. So how do you get from there to this hotel in Yokohama on Tuesday afternoon?  Rio: After the game, the manager took us all out, the team and the staff, for a nice meal. Then he allowed us to go out for a drink with the lads for a little while. Have a little look around London. Woke up Sunday morning. Went training. And then we got on a flight at 7 in the evening. We arrived here about four in the afternoon yesterday. Got to the hotel. Had light training. Something to eat. Then went to sleep.  Me: Do you have a problem with the jet lag? Rio: Yeah, I do, to be honest with you. Not a problem but it does take me a couple of days to get into the right mode. Me: How much of a distraction, then, is it for you to come to a tournament on the other side of the world, with nine hours&apos; time difference, in the middle of the Premier League and the Champions League? Rio: I think you can look at it in two ways: either this is going to be a physically and mentally draining trip or you can say to yourself, listen, all that pressure and intensity of the Premier League, I can shut that down for 10 days and just relax and enjoy playing in this tournament. And I think the latter is the better option. Treat it almost like a holiday. We want to win this tournament, don&apos;t get me wrong. But treat it as a break from the intensity of the Premier League. Me: To some people, both fans and journalists, this tournament seems to represent all that is wrong with the commercial globalisation of the game - it&apos;s distracting and pointless, all about money and sponsorship. Can you understand that dislike and distrust? Rio: Yeah, because they want to keep it as local as possible. But to me it&apos;s like a kid with a toy who doesn&apos;t want to share it. And they don&apos;t want to share it with someone on the other side of the world who they think maybe doesn&apos;t understand it as well as them.  Me: So you see it as a positive thing? Rio: I do, yeah. Because it helps the club grow and generate more money so then they can go out and buy the best players in the world... Me: (interrupting) Yeah, I know, you&apos;ve often spoken of Maradona as a hero, and for George, initially, it was watching Cristiano Ronaldo that got him hooked on Manchester United. But at the same time you&apos;ve also spoken about the lack of opportunities for kids growing up in, say, Peckham or Dewsbury. And you&apos;ve got involved with the government to try to change this. But I&apos;m wondering if you then think there should be a limit on foreign players in the English game? Rio: Yeah, but I don&apos;t know how you could do it. But I do think the English game, or anywhere in the world, their game is going to suffer if foreign players keep coming into it. I think the problem is when you see on the bench and in the stands foreign players sitting there and then there&apos;s, like, five or six young [English] players who, if those foreign guys weren&apos;t there, they could be on that bench or in the stands waiting to get into the squad. So that&apos;s when it becomes a problem. But when you&apos;ve got the likes of [Gianfranco] Zola, or [Eric] Cantona, or [Thierry] Henry playing in the Premier League, these guys bring something very special to the game and the younger players can only learn from them. But if they just come over to be fringe players, that&apos;s when it&apos;s a problem. But how you sort it out, I don&apos;t know. Me: Can you foresee a time when a team such as Huddersfield will cease to be? Rio: Well, it&apos;s happening already. I think it&apos;s not long before you&apos;ll see a club go under.  Me: Do you think that the bigger clubs have a responsibility? Or do you think it&apos;s every man for themselves? Rio: I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s a tricky question. I think it should be down to the Premier League, rather than the individual clubs. Because who knows if the clubs can help out? Sometimes these clubs have their big names, but they&apos;re not as cash-rich as they appear. Me: Going back to the fans, in your book you talk a lot about your encounters with fans - both good and bad - and this relationship, between the players and the fans, is obviously something that fascinates you and something you&apos;ve thought about a lot. Do you think it&apos;s a relationship that has changed irrevocably?  Rio: I just think that in today&apos;s game there is a little bit of resentment in the way the fans support the players now. Yeah, they love the players but there&apos;s that bit of resentment in the backs of their throats - they&apos;re earning all this money and the players aren&apos;t as close to the fans as they were in the past. But sometimes I think the fans and the media guys need to take a step back and think to themselves, well, if this player does come into the local pub and have a drink like they used to and mingle with us, then someone is going to say something; and, two, you&apos;ve got someone with a cameraphone sitting there, taking pictures of every sip of drink you take; and, three, you&apos;ve got someone with a dictaphone trying to listen to your conversation. And then you&apos;ve got someone trying to put a bird on your lap. So it&apos;s a never-ending scenario of shenanigans that can go on. And these things do go on. It&apos;s a fact. I mean, I&apos;ll go sit in a pub. I don&apos;t mind. But there&apos;s other players that can&apos;t do it. That won&apos;t do it. Today&apos;s football is different football. There&apos;s so much to worry about.  Me: In the book you make the point that if the clubs were more open, the fans might feel less distant... Rio: Yeah, at West Ham the fans used to come in and watch the training. And I enjoyed that. I think it&apos;s good. But then the Sky Sports thing that happened with John Hartson and Eyal Berkovic put that to bed [the players, then at West Ham, were caught on camera punching and kicking each other in a training session]. So that just tells you it&apos;s a different day we&apos;re living in. And that&apos;s why the fans feel more distant from the players. And then the resentment comes from that. And so it&apos;s a Catch-22 situation.  Me: Finally, about fathers and sons: what dreams do you have for your own boys? Rio: Footballers. Definitely. If my kids could be footballers, that would just be the best thing in the world for me. Seriously. I&apos;d just love it... Me: Really? All the things you&apos;ve been through. All the things you&apos;ve seen. The good and the bad. You&apos;d still want them to be footballers? Rio: Yeah, I&apos;d never change it. I always dreamed of being a footballer. I never ever thought of anything else. And if I had a dream again, it&apos;d be football. Simple as that. On this note, the interview ends and we go back out into the corridor to do some photos. These involve George having Rio sign his Manchester United ball, while I look on with my Town scarf. These done, Jeremy and I begin packing our stuff. George, though, is not putting his ball or my pen away because he&apos;s noticed that the players are beginning to appear for their lunch in the room next door. And now walking down the corridor, all on his own, is Wayne Rooney. As Wayne sees George with his ball and his pen, Wayne slows. George stays rooted to the spot, mute. Wayne smiles. George stays rooted to the spot. Wayne walks on for his lunch.  I&apos;m thinking, perhaps my plan was quite cunning after all. But Jeremy shouts, &quot;Just ask them, George, they&apos;ll sign your ball.&quot; So as Rafael and Anderson appear, George asks them to sign. And they do. Willingly. And so do Patrice Evra and Carlos Tevez and Ji-Sung Park. But it&apos;s at this point I hear the words, &quot;What&apos;s that boy doing here with that ball?&quot; There are two of Manchester United&apos;s own security staff standing over George now. I go over and say, &quot;He&apos;s just been interviewing Rio Ferdinand for the Observer and, seeing as he&apos;s here, he&apos;s just trying to get a few other players to sign his ball.&quot; &quot;Well, he really shouldn&apos;t be here,&quot; says one of them. &quot;This place is not open to the public. It&apos;s a place where the players won&apos;t be bothered.&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; I say. &quot;I understand. We&apos;ll just get off.&quot; But then the other guy says, &quot;Well, he&apos;s doing no harm. Sit him down over there and I&apos;ll ask the players as they come past, if they mind signing.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the first guy. &quot;He just shouldn&apos;t be here.&quot; &quot;They won&apos;t mind, just one kid with his ball.&quot; &quot;But they might...&quot; &quot;Actually, I think we should just go,&quot; I say, and so we leave. However, this last conversation stays with me. There was no menace in it whatsoever. But there was a great deal of confusion, even in the heart of the biggest, richest football club in the world; a desire to do the right thing (letting a kid get his ball signed) and a paranoia of doing the wrong thing (upsetting the players, or possibly Fifa). And it&apos;s something that doesn&apos;t go away...  3) The terriers bite back We get a taxi to the Todoroki stadium, home of the J-League side Kawasaki Frontale. It is here that Manchester United will have a training session in preparation for Thursday&apos;s Club World Cup semi-final against Gamba Osaka. We have been told that it will be open to the press for the first 15 minutes and to the public for the entire two hours. George is desperate to see Ronaldo and Dimitar Berbatov train, and Jeremy is desperate to get a picture of George watching them. I&apos;ve got mixed feelings again. But, anyway, it turns out we have all been misinformed, because earlier today it was decided to make this a closed session. However, there are still plenty of press and 14 fans waiting to watch the team bus arrive and 50 police and Fifa security to make sure that these 14 fans don&apos;t storm the barricades. I&apos;m all for calling it a day but George and Jeremy want to wait for the team bus, and so we do.  It&apos;s while we are waiting that something very strange happens. Out of nowhere, an old woman appears with a Yorkshire terrier. This has got to be a sign. One of those moments when the future bleeds back into the present - a portent of things to come, of the day when Huddersfield Town are here as the champions of Europe and the Todoroki stadium is awash with blue and white stripes and terrier dogs. But just as I&apos;m trying to convince Jeremy to immortalise this moment in pictures, who should arrive but the Red Devils. Ronaldo is sat at the back of the bus and, as it pulls in, he stares at the 14 fans and George. According to George, he winks at him. &quot;He saw me!&quot; says George. &quot;He looked at me and he winked.&quot; &quot;You might be right,&quot; I say. &quot;He likes to wink. It might even be a nervous tic.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says George. &quot;He saw me and he winked.&quot; &quot;Great,&quot; I say. &quot;Shall we get off home, then?&quot; But George and Jeremy fancy having a wander round the stadium to see if we can get a glimpse of the training session. As we trek off, we have our second encounter of the day with security. This time it&apos;s a very young Japanese guy in an ill-fitting yellow Fifa coat. George is standing on a wall trying to peer into the stadium. I&apos;m not that happy about this, either. But the youth from Fifa isn&apos;t worried about George falling off. He&apos;s worried about George seeing something.  &quot;You mustn&apos;t look,&quot; he says, in Japanese. &quot;It&apos;s forbidden to look.&quot; &quot;How can it be forbidden to look?&quot; I ask. &quot;Fifa say you mustn&apos;t look.&quot; &quot;But they are his eyes.&quot; &quot;Well, he mustn&apos;t use them to look at Manchester United.&quot; This is something I&apos;ve been thinking for some time, so I get George down and off we set again round the stadium. At the back, Jeremy finds a crack in some doors where you can actually get a good view of the training. George peers through and is mesmerised. But now the youth in the yellow Fifa jacket is back and this time he&apos;s threatening to call the real police.  But then, for the second time tonight, a beautiful and portentous thing happens. As he shepherds us away, the youth from Fifa runs into the woman with her Yorkshire terrier. He begins to tell her that Fifa doesn&apos;t want her to walk her dog near Manchester United&apos;s training session and, at that moment, the terrier bites his ankle and he screams. &quot;If that isn&apos;t an omen, then I don&apos;t know what is,&quot; I tell George. &quot;An omen of what?&quot; &quot;Of the day when Huddersfield Town will be champions of Europe and save the game from Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and all that is bad, greedy, ugly and wrong with what football has become...&quot; &quot;Dream on,&quot; says George. &quot;I will,&quot; I say. &quot;I will...&quot; 4) In the theatre of dreams, Japan stage ...  Two days later, Christmas has come a week early for George. We are travelling to the International Stadium, Yokohama, where tonight Manchester United play Gamba Osaka in the semi-final of the Club World Cup. The tickets for this game are George&apos;s Christmas present (and not a cheap one). But this game is what he&apos;s been waiting for since May, when United won the Champions League and George realised that the new champions of Europe would be coming to Japan.  I had wondered whether, after meeting Ferdinand and having his ball signed, the game itself might be something of an anti-climax. But George has always been more excited about watching the game than meeting the players. This is what he&apos;s really dreamt of - putting on his Man United hat, travelling to a ground, and actually seeing the players play. Not on the telly, in the middle of the night, continents away. Tonight he&apos;s not alone. The Club World Cup may have been called a &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; tournament and it may be taking place in the middle of a recession, but there are just under 70,000 mainly Japanese, mainly United fans here tonight. They are mainly families or couples - the boys in their Rooney shirts and the girls in their Ronaldo ones, holding hands, drawn towards the stadium lights as though to some mass Moonie-Ronaldo wedding. There&apos;s a fair few Ferdinand shirts, too. Still plenty of Beckhams. Even the odd Cantona. But it seems a long way from the Cowshed at Town&apos;s old Leeds Road ground. And it is, obviously. But not far enough for some folk. &quot;I really wish you&apos;d take that scarf off,&quot; says George.  &quot;Never,&quot; I tell him. &quot;No surrender...&quot; But George can&apos;t hear me because we&apos;re now in our seats and a massive roar has just gone up. Manchester United are running out to begin their warm-up. Well, not quite United. That boy Ronaldo leaves it a good minute before he makes his own entrance. Maybe the lad just forgot to take off his watch and had to nip back to the dressing room, but it does look that little bit staged. And if that was his cunning plan, it&apos;s worked better than mine. The noise and the flashes that greet him are deafening and blinding. Almost as blinding as the smile on his face, which lights up the two giant screens and the hearts of all those seated around me. &quot;Ronaldo! Ronaldo!&quot; they scream. &quot;Cristiano! Cristiano!&quot; And like another knife in my heart, I know one of these screams is coming from the mouth of my own son. &quot;You&apos;re wasting your breath,&quot; I say. &quot;He can&apos;t hear you.&quot; &quot;You don&apos;t know that.&quot; &quot;Well, I&apos;m pretty certain his talents don&apos;t extend to his ears,&quot; I say, and it&apos;s at this moment another horrible thought hits me. A very, very horrible thought. &quot;George,&quot; I say. &quot;When - not if - that little winker joins Real Madrid, does that mean you&apos;re going to support them?&quot; &quot;F- off,&quot; says George. &quot;I&apos;m United for ever.&quot; &quot;Thank God for that,&quot; I say, and then can&apos;t believe I have. So I now spend the next 90 minutes crying into my Town scarf and miss what, apparently, was quite a good game: 5-3 to Manchester United, including one from Ronaldo and two from Rooney (and a yellow card). At one point, United are winning 5-1 and George is convinced of victory.  &quot;Huddersfield were once 5-1 up against 10 men with only 30 minutes to go,&quot; I mumble through my tears. &quot;And we lost 7-6.&quot; &quot;Against who?&quot; &quot;Charlton.&quot; &quot;Bobby Charlton?&quot; he laughs. I&apos;m losing and I know it; towards the end of the game, George points at the scoreboard and says, &quot;I wish that clock would stop and this game would never end...&quot;  But I don&apos;t. I just wish that clock would go back, right back, to 1930, when Huddersfield beat Manchester United 6-0 at Old Trafford, or to 1926, when Town became the first English team to win three consecutive league titles and we really were the best team in the world. On the train home, I make my last stand. &quot;Just think,&quot; I say to George. &quot;One day you might be taking your own son to see Town play in the Club World Cup, or whatever it&apos;ll be called then. You might even be playing in it yourself...&quot; &quot;For United?&quot; &quot;No, Town.&quot; &quot;In the Club World Cup?&quot; &quot;Could happen,&quot; I say, &quot;If you practise. We&apos;re only three seasons from Europe.&quot; George looks at me now and again he says, &quot;Dream on.&quot; And again, I will dream on; because Rio Ferdinand dreamt of being a footballer; now Rio dreams his sons will be footballers. I once dreamt of being a footballer; now George dreams of being a footballer. And I dream he&apos;ll be a footballer, too. But for Huddersfield Town. And in a time of different football. In different days. The same dreams, just different teams.

Their support of the Festival and commitment to encourage and promote the country&apos;s great creativity in advertising and communication is fantastic and we look forward to building on this relationship&quot; We held a launch event at the beginning of the year, to tell the industry that we are the official UK representatives and we&apos;re here to support the media and advertising industry.

In a ceremony at the Guardian&apos;s Kings Place offices, the UK&apos;s 2009 Young Lions teams were announced, following a competition to select this year&apos;s up-and-coming creative and media teams. The three teams of two, who were selected from over 40 teams who entered, will now go on to represent the UK in the prestigious worldwide Young Lions competition. GNM is the official UK representative of the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival for the first time this year, with the Young Lions competition being a prominent fixture of the festival. The teams will represent the UK in three different categories: Media, Print and Cyber. Adam Freeman, Commercial Director, GNM, said: &quot;I&apos;m really excited by the quality and standard of our Young Lions this year. It&apos;s great to have the support of the key agencies in the sector, who understand the value of helping their young employees, even in these tough times.&quot; Philip Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, said: &quot;At Cannes we have teams from 50 countries, and each country takes the competitions very seriously. To be a winner, you are not only winning for yourself and your agency, but for your country. There is a real sense of pride in Cannes, and we are delighted that the Guardian has driven forward this competition in the UK, so at last the UK can compete against the best young creatives globally.&quot; The winners are: PrintAidan McClure and Laurent Simon from AMV.BBDOAidan: &quot;The brief we were given from Christian Aid was an extremely challenging one to work on. HIV and poverty are really important issues and we wanted to produce something effective, without being shocking for the sake of being shocking.&quot;Laurent: &quot;Cannes is going to be a great opportunity for us. We learnt a lot from the brief and we&apos;re looking forward to going to Cannes to put what we&apos;ve learnt into practice.&quot; CyberAlex Shapowal and James Hay from Lean Mean Fighting MachineAlex: &quot;The brief we were given from Christian Aid was clear and tight, and we&apos;re extremely excited to have won.&quot;James: &quot;I can&apos;t wait to go to Cannes, it&apos;s going to be an amazing week.&quot; MediaAsher Burrell and Jon Marchant from MediaComAsher: &quot;I didn&apos;t expect to win at all. I&apos;ve always wanted to go to Cannes and it&apos;s going to be brilliant to take part in the competition.&quot;Jon: &quot;It&apos;s going to be great to represent the UK. The brief we were given by Katine was very different to the kind of work we do on a day to day basis, and taking part in this competition has already been beneficial in terms of lending our skills to something that we wouldn&apos;t normally work on.&quot; Wednesday 25 March 2009Entries for Cannes Lions       Entries for Cannes Lions are still open.

Friday 16 January 2009Guardian News and Media named official UK representative for Cannes Lions 2009     Guardian News and Media is the Official UK Representative for the Cannes Lions 2009 Advertising Festival Photograph: guardian.co.uk    Guardian News and Media has been appointed as the new official festival representative to promote Cannes Lions, the most prestigious global annual advertising event, in the United Kingdom. GNM is one of the UK&apos;s most successful and innovative media companies, publishing the Guardian and the Observer, two of the world&apos;s oldest and most highly regarded quality newspapers. Guardian.co.uk is one of the world&apos;s leading news websites. As well as promoting the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival in the UK, GNM&apos;s role as official representative will also include nominating judges, selecting the UK young creative teams to compete at the events and arranging winners&apos; presentations for the industry.  David Gilbertson, CEO of Emap Limited, the owner of Cannes Lions, said: &quot;We are delighted to be bringing the Guardian into the global Cannes Lions family. As the leading daily newspaper in the UK for the media and creative industries, the Guardian is the ideal partner for us to extend the Cannes Lions message still more fully into the UK market and to ensuring the UK is even more strongly represented in the world&apos;s premier advertising festival.&quot; Adam Freeman, commercial director of Guardian News and Media, said: &quot;This is a fantastic association for Guardian News and Media. We very much look forward to our involvement in the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival which celebrates the very best of the industry.&quot; Philip Thomas, CEO of Cannes Lions and the Eurobest Festival, said: &quot;We are delighted to be working with the Guardian, a global brand as is Cannes Lions. We would like to thank Bauer Advertising, previous UK representative, for all their efforts and support during the last couple of years. We now very much look forward to working with GNM as they become the custodian of creativity in the UK.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I think in the short term it&apos;s definitely a positive,&quot; said Kristine Li at KBC Securities in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Credit crunch", "Global recession", "Business", "Japan", "Australia news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T13:55:00Z", "title": "Japan and Australia unveil new schemes to kick-start economies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/03/japan-australia-financial-crisis", "article": "The Bank of Japan is to buy 1tn yen (\u00a37.9bn) of shares owned by struggling banks in an attempt to encourage them to lend and drag the world&apos;s second-biggest economy out of recession. Australia, meanwhile, slashed interest rates by 100 basis points to a record low of 3.25% and boosted its stimulus package to more than A$42bn (\u00a318.8bn). In a move not seen since the end of Japan&apos;s last recession four years ago, the central bank will buy up shares in troubled financial institutions through to April next year and hold on to them until the end of March 2012. Massive losses on the stock exchange have forced some of the country&apos;s biggest banks to cut earnings forecasts and rein in lending just as corporate borrowers go in search of extra cash towards the end of the financial year. The central bank has responded by lowering interest rates to just above zero and buying up corporate debt from banks. The latest move is designed to thaw the lending freeze and prevent the economy from tumbling over the edge of the abyss, officials said. The bank&apos;s governor, Masaaki Shira\u00adkawa, told reporters: &quot;While Japanese financial institutions have reduced their stockholdings since the early 2000s, their third-quarter financial statements have reported massive realised and unrealised losses. This measure is intended as a safety net to stabilise financial markets. It is always advisable to prepare for the worst-case scenario.&quot; A disastrous year for the Nikkei benchmark index has hit the balance sheets of the biggest banks, such as Mizuho Financial Group, which last week reported net losses of \u00a550.6bn for the April-December period and slashed its full-year net profit forecast by 60%. During the BoJ&apos;s last share-buying effort, which ended in 2004, its \u00a52tn purchase of shares in commercial banks was credited with shoring up lenders saddled with bad debts after another Nikkei meltdown. Analysts welcomed today&apos;s decision, but were still concerned about the state of the commercial banks&apos; balance sheets. &quot;I think in the short term it&apos;s definitely a positive,&quot; said Kristine Li at KBC Securities in Tokyo. &quot;It takes some pressure from the rapidly falling market and the impact on their earnings as well as their capital. &quot;As of September, the major banks had \u00a513tn in stocks. \u00a51tn takes some pressure off, but it may not be enough to solve the whole problem.&quot; The Australian government said it would spend A$42bn on schools, housing and infrastructure and make cash payments to low and middle-income earners. Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, said: &quot;This plan today, as part of a broad strategy on which we embarked last year, provides a basis to see Australia through this economic crisis.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["How the other openers did Luck By Chance, 50 screens, \u00a373,822The Broken, 8 screens, \u00a311,365Barry Lyndon (reissue), 1 screen, \u00a36,066Victory, 15 screens, \u00a34,855Tokyo Sonata, 3 screens, \u00a33,787JCVD, 1 screen, \u00a31,292"], "tags": ["Kate Winslet", "Danny Boyle", "Leonardo DiCaprio", "Sam Mendes", "Stephen Daldry", "Oscars", "Weather", "Oscars 2009", "Revolutionary Road"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T17:15:36Z", "title": "Kate Winslet factor boosts Revolutionary Road and The Reader at UK box office", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/feb/03/katewinslet-danny-boyle", "article": "Now in the fourth week of its run, Slumdog Millionaire is finally showing signs of slowing down \u2013 albeit not by much. After successive weekend increases of 44% and 7%, Danny Boyle&apos;s multiple Oscar nominee retained its No 1 position but its haul eased by 16% to \u00a32.36m, boosting its total to \u00a314.22m. Although the buzz is still high on the title, it has now been seen by a sizeable chunk of its core audience. Future success will be driven by its ability to a) generate repeat viewings and b) reach that large but hard-to-motivate hinterland that only comes out very rarely for huge word-of-mouth hits such as The Full Monty. Winning major prizes at the Baftas on Sunday, and the Oscars two weeks later, will assist that latter goal. Like many films in the market, Slumdog&apos;s Sunday takings were hit by adverse weather conditions. The grosses for 1 February were 25% down on the previous Sunday, whereas receipts for Friday and Saturday, before the snow arrived, were just 10% down on the corresponding period.  Last week we speculated that the huge success of Slumdog was making it tougher for rival awards contenders to attract audiences, with soft openings for Frost/Nixon and Milk, and hefty declines for titles such as The Wrestler. Now, a clearer picture is emerging. A \u00a31.01m opening and \u00a34,022 screen average for Revolutionary Road proves that films pitching to an upscale audience can still succeed amid today&apos;s competitive field, as long as they have strong audience appeal. Boasting such talents as Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and director Sam Mendes, as well as impeccable visuals, Revolutionary Road shrugged off such handicaps as the absence of Oscar nominations for best picture and best actress for Winslet to nab the No 3 position. In fact, given the huge amount of press coverage associating the words &quot;Winslet&quot; and &quot;Oscar&quot;, it&apos;s questionable that audiences realise she was not nominated for an Academy Award for this picture. Meanwhile the &quot;Kate factor&quot; may be behind a very slim weekend decline of just 3% for The Reader, which has now taken a healthy \u00a33.87m since its 2 January opening. With best picture nominations from both Bafta and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, it&apos;s by no means over for Stephen Daldry&apos;s literary adaptation. Oscar contenders that have not benefited from similar levels of press coverage are not showing the market traction their distributors would wish for. Milk dipped 34%, which is not too bad, but fellow best picture Oscar nominee Frost/Nixon followed a weak opening with a 42% weekend-to-weekend decline, and The Wrestler dropped by another 43%. While all these films are suffering from the awards-related release-date pileup, they are experiencing varying degrees of luck when it comes to cutting through the clutter to engage audiences&apos; attentions, and thus hold screens and showtimes. (For context, Valkyrie, which is No 2 on the chart, dropped 30%, and My Bloody Valentine in fourth position, still performing superbly in just over 100 3-D sites, eased down by 22%.) In a relatively light week for new releases, the second-highest new entry was Nick and Norah&apos;s Infinite Playlist. The indie comedy managed an unspectacular \u00a3398,000 from 252 screens \u2013 way below the debuts of more mainstream contenders such as Juno (\u00a32m) and Superbad (\u00a31.48m), which both featured Nick and Norah star Michael Cera. A more flattering comparison is Garden State, as long as you overlook that quirky rom-com&apos;s limited screen count: it opened in December 2004 on \u00a3128,000 from 48 cinemas.

But in the case of Aristide Maillol&apos;s model Dina Vierny, who has died aged 89, she genuinely was his muse, not his mistress. She met him in 1934, when she was 15 and he was 73, and inspired a fresh direction in his sculpture - most evident in The River, one cast of which is on display in the Tuileries gardens in Paris, while another sprawls on the ledge of a pond in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Her death breaks the living link through Maillol with the Nabis, a short-lived group of 19th-century artists inspired by Gauguin&apos;s Tahiti paintings that included Pierre Bonnard and \u00c9douard Vuillard as well as Maillol. She was, besides, a remarkable woman in her own right. Her attributes were perhaps best caught by Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, not yet Picasso&apos;s partner, who met Vierny at Picasso&apos;s Paris studio in 1945. Maillol had died the previous year in a car accident, and yet Vierny had blossomed. &quot;Her bearing was regal,&quot; said Gilot. &quot;More than a muse, she was a priestess of art.&quot; As for Picasso, Gilot wrotes in amusement: &quot;He was deferential and attentive... as if beguiled by her charm and mastery. If he had not been afraid of being pursued by Maillol&apos;s ghost [Picasso was notably superstitious], he might have expressed his admiration more openly.&quot; And Gilot said of herself: &quot;I would have loved to befriend Dina, but her triumphant femininity made me shy.&quot; All of this goes some way to explaining how this young, untutored immigrant model for a sculptor of nothing but female nudes was able to tackle the legendary Andr\u00e9 Malraux, by 1965 De Gaulle&apos;s minister of culture, and persuade him to take a gift of 18 of Maillol&apos;s sculptures and put them on permanent display in the Tuileries - thus fulfilling, in her role as an executor of Maillol&apos;s will, the sculptor&apos;s dying wish. Vierny was born in Chisinau, the capital of Bessarabia (now Moldova). Her father knew Trotsky, but made no attempt to hide his own social-democratic inclinations, and by 1925 it became apparent that the new Russian hegemony was not good for their health. They fled from Odessa in Ukraine and fetched up in Paris without a rouble in their pockets. However, they survived, and Dina, a dutiful student, seemed destined for a conventional career until Jean-Claude Dondel - later one of the four architects of the Palais de Tokyo - met her and wrote to his friend Maillol, saying that she was a walking Maillol sculpture. He persuaded her to visit Maillol&apos;s Paris studio. There was a double irony. Firstly, Maillol&apos;s ideal was not a Jew from the Soviet Union, but the typical peasant girl of Banyuls, his Catalan home town close to the border with Spain. Secondly, the sculptor felt no need to acquire a model. In a journal entry, Gide reported Maillol saying: &quot;A model! A model! What the hell would I do with a model? When I need to verify something, I go and find my wife in the kitchen, I lift up her chemise, and I have the marble.&quot; But Vierny&apos;s figure was a revelation; broad hips, big thighs, high breasts. By 1934, when they met, Maillol&apos;s career was running out of steam. All his work, whether war memorials, monuments to heroes, allegorical figures for city centres, consisted almost without exception of female nudes. The massive dignity of the calm, Mediterranean classicism that came easily to Maillol, a reaction against the vivid movement of Rodin&apos;s work, was beginning to bore the public. Vierny&apos;s dynamic personality changed all this and inspired the approach that produced The River, a figure with the usual Maillol characteristics - the fully rounded and hollowed-out forms - but in vivid action, sprawling full length, Vierny&apos;s wavy hair a metaphor for the running water. During the second world war, Vierny helped European intellectuals, including a son of Thomas Mann, to avoid the Nazis by escaping to Spain along a rocky, tortuous path through the Pyrenees shown to her by Maillol. She was arrested on suspicion and then sprung by a lawyer paid by Maillol, whereupon she departed for Nice with letters of introduction to Matisse and Bonnard, suggesting they should &quot;borrow&quot; her. She was only one of a bevy of Matisse models, but the admiration between the artist and Vierny was mutual, and although she had to remain still when she modelled for his drawings, he allowed her to talk. By contrast, Bonnard, living at nearby Le Cannet, instructed her to strip off but not to pose, and to forget that he was there. &quot;He didn&apos;t want me to keep still,&quot; said Vierny. &quot;What he needed was movement. He asked me to &apos;live&apos; in front of him. He wanted both presence and absence.&quot; Bonnard&apos;s 1941 painting Le Grand Nu Sombre was the fruit of this association. With Maillol, Bonnard and Matisse all dead within a few years of the war&apos;s end, Vierny set up her own well-regarded art gallery where, as well as her collection of modern, western art and temporary shows, she exhibited the work of dissident Soviet artists. But she continued to carry a torch for Maillol and established the Dina Vierny Foundation, which led to the creation in 1995 of the Fondation Dina Vierny-Mus\u00e9e Maillol in the left-bank rue de Grenelle. Maillol&apos;s former home in the family vineyard above Banyuls is now another Maillol museum.  The two sons who survive her, Olivier and Bertrand Lorquin, run the Paris museum, but Maillol&apos;s great monument, the Tuileries gardens display, immortalises her as well. \u2022 Dina Vierny, artist&apos;s model and art dealer, born 25 January 1919; died 21 January 2009"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;[We] will not be able to accept any proposal that would prohibit Japan from continuing its research whaling,&quot; Ishiba told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Iceland", "Environment", "World news", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Europe", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-04T14:57:42Z", "title": "Iceland's new government says it may revoke an earlier decision to increase whaling quota", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/04/iceland-whaling-quota", "article": "Iceland&apos;s new government may revoke a controversial decision taken last week to increase the country&apos;s whaling quota more than sixfold. Finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, who is also the fisheries minister, told a news conference yesterday: &quot;We agreed in a government meeting this morning to send a formal warning out to those with vested interests in whaling, saying that the recent decision of the ex-minister of fisheries about increasing the whaling quota for the next five years is now being reconsidered.&quot; He added: &quot;We intend to make a policy statement about this issue in a few days.&quot; Iceland&apos;s previous prime minister, Geir Haarde, stepped down on 26 January after civil unrest following the collapse of the country&apos;s currency and banking system. The news came as Japan rejected as &quot;unacceptable&quot; a proposal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to scale back its whaling activities to its territorial waters. The announcement by the Icelandic government comes just a week after the outgoing government announced it would dramatically increase Iceland&apos;s quota, set in 2008 at 38 minke whales and zero fin whale. Iceland resumed commercial whaling in 2006, despite an international moratorium put in place in 1986 to protect the species from extinction. Sigfusson also announced he would revise the country&apos;s official whaling policy, raising expectations that he could put an end to the controversial activity. The party he leads, the Left-Greens, is against whaling. However there is currently no majority in parliament in favour of such a move. &quot;It is heartening that the minister is reviewing this decision,&quot; said Willie Mackenzie, oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK. &quot;The previous decision was clearly provocative.&quot; Meanwhile in Japan, fisheries minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed as &quot;unacceptable&quot; an IWC proposal suggesting the Asian nation scale back whale hunting in the Antarctic Ocean over the next five years. &quot;[We] will not be able to accept any proposal that would prohibit Japan from continuing its research whaling,&quot; Ishiba told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday. A deal would have allowed Japan to conduct commercial hunting in its territorial waters in exchange for phasing out what is describes as whale hunting for research purposes in the Antarctic Ocean. Japan kills more than 800 whales a year, officially for scientific reasons - although a large number of whale steaks are found in fish markets every year. &quot;This shows that the pro-whaling nations led by Japan are not prepared to compromise,&quot; said Mackenzie, who also condemned the IWC plan as it would have allowed Japan to conduct commercial whale hunting."}, {"sentences": ["It was the latest in a string of cases in Japan in which patients were denied treatment, underscoring the country&apos;s healthcare problems, which include a shortage of doctors.Associated Press in Tokyo"], "tags": ["World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-05T00:01:00Z", "title": "World news in brief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/05/somali-pirates-sudan", "article": "Pirates &apos;to be paid $3.2m ransom for weapons ship&apos; Somali pirates have been paid a $3.2m ransom for the release of a Ukrainian ship carrying 33 Soviet-era tanks.

And today it culminated in a series of arrests in what could be the biggest investment scam in Japanese history. Kazutsugi Nami, the chairman of L&amp;G, which stands for Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, a bankrupt bedding supplier, and 21 other executives are suspected of defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors of at least $1.4bn (\u00a31bn) over the past eight years. In return for their money, Nami promised investors cash returns of 36% a year plus their original investment. Those who paid at least \u00a5100,000 (\u00a3770) also received an equivalent sum in Enten - or Paradise Yen - a virtual currency Nami claimed would become legal tender in a post-recession era in which he would be &quot;world famous&quot;. Until that day arrived, members of the scheme were invited to part with their Enten, which was wired to their mobile phones, on anything from vegetables and clothes to jewellery and immune system-boosting futons, on L&amp;G&apos;s online bazaar. Moments before his arrest in front of the TV cameras, Nami was unrepentant as he held court over breakfast in a restaurant near his Tokyo office. &quot;Please shoot the face of the biggest conman in history,&quot; he said, sipping from a glass of beer at 5.30am. &quot;Time will tell if I&apos;m a conman or a swindler. I&apos;m leading 50,000 people. Can they charge a company this big with fraud?&quot; Shortly before being led away by police, he was asked if he felt sorry for his cheated investors. &quot;No. I have put my life at stake,&quot; he said. &quot;Why do I have to apologise? I&apos;m the poorest victim. Nobody lost more than I did. You should be aware that high returns come with a high risk.&quot; In happier times the 75-year-old businessman enjoyed cult-like status among investors; this week the media is calling him Japan&apos;s version of the alleged US fraudster Bernard Madoff. Nami and his associates are accused of pocketing at least \u00a5126bn from 37,000 investors, although some reports put the sum as high as \u00a5226bn. That would make the alleged scam the biggest since Toyota Shoji conned thousands of investors out of \u00a5202.5bn to buy gold bars in the late 1980s. The L&amp;G scheme began to fall apart in early 2007 when it started paying dividends in Enten instead of cash, and then refused to allow investors to cancel their membership. By September that year the company had sacked most of its staff and filed for bankruptcy with debts estimated at \u00a542.3bn. According to media accounts, Nami has a penchant for improbable business schemes and self-aggrandizement. In 2005 he set up a research institute called the Akari Laboratory whose mission, it said, was to revitalize local economies. As vice president of a car parts dealer in the 1970s, he drew 250,000 people into a pyramid scheme involving exhaust pipes, and set up another company that sold stones that, it falsely claimed, could purify tap water. According to lawyers representing hundreds of investors, one woman lost \u00a5100m to the scam. In an interview with the Jiji Press, a 70-year-old woman who lost \u00a52m said of her involvement with L&amp;G: &quot;I had fun and a lively life ... I was stupid. But it&apos;s my fault as I was greedy.&quot; In a rambling, barely coherent blogpost last week, Nami claimed he was being persecuted by the police. &quot;They told me they would arrest me without fanfare, so why are all the newspaper saying I&apos;ll be arrested within the week? If that happens, it means the police lied to me,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Even if I say I didn&apos;t do anything wrong, they&apos;ll just use circumstantial evidence to find me guilty.&quot; Likening himself to the powerful 16th century warlord Oda Nobunaga, Nami predicted countries around the world would adopt the Enten in a matter of years. &quot;I will start shining and become world famous. I will certainly move the world.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Director Simon McBurney&apos;s love affair with Japan produced a terrific show for Complicite in The Elephant Vanishes, a collaboration with Tokyo&apos;s Setagaya Public Theatre."], "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Complicite"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-06T00:39:49Z", "title": "Theatre review: Shun-kin / Barbican, London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/06/review-shunkin-barbican", "article": "Director Simon McBurney&apos;s love affair with Japan produced a terrific show for Complicite in The Elephant Vanishes, a collaboration with Tokyo&apos;s Setagaya Public Theatre.

The latter endures intense mental and physical cruelty before mutilating himself for love. There are clearly cultural differences operating here, because what the Japanese admire as devotion and passion, we would probably call domestic violence and send for the social services. As you would expect from McBurney, there is plenty in this two hours without interval that is meltingly beautiful; its stillness, the way it plays with light and shadow, and, best of all, the work of the acclaimed puppet company Blind Summit, who magically dissolve the barriers between the wooden-jointed and the human so you cannot tell one from the other. The evening is as delicate as one of Shun-kin&apos;s own feet. But what is missing is the excitement you so often get from a Complicite show, the feeling that you are watching a piece that was made with all synapses firing and blood pumping, something multilayered that makes unexpected connections for both head and heart. This is much more like looking at a strange, beautiful and very expensive object behind glass in a museum. You admire it, but you don&apos;t know what it is actually for. Not only does it feel useless, some of the devices utilised - rolling bodies, integration of film and live action, actors playing trees - have been used by McBurney before to better effect.

The firm&apos;s forecast for the full year through to the end of March comes only a year after it raked in profits of \u00a51.72 trillion. Toyota&apos;s misery was compounded when Moody&apos;s removed its top credit rating, describing its outlook as &quot;negative&quot;. The decision, Moody&apos;s said, &quot;had been driven by the significantly impaired state of profitability at Toyota, due in turn to the severe nature of market conditions surrounding the global auto industry.&quot; The downgrade, from AAA to AA1, could mean Toyota having to pay higher borrowing costs. The Japanese electronics maker Sharp added to the problems facing the world&apos;s second biggest economy when it said today it was cutting 1,500 contract workers by the end of March. Sharp, a leading maker of flat-panel TVs, also forecast a net loss of \u00a5100bn in the current fiscal year ending March 2009, marking its first full-year loss since 1950. Toyota&apos;s profits have been hit by weak exports to the key US and European markets, and the rapid appreciation of the yen, which last year rose 23% against the dollar and 29% against the euro. Despite overtaking General Motors to become the world&apos;s biggest carmaker by sales last year, Toyota said it had suffered a \u00a5164.7bn net loss in the October to December quarter, after a \u00a5458.6bn profit the same time last year. Sales during the third quarter plunged 28.4% to \u00a54.8tn. It now expects an operating loss - its first for more than 70 years - of \u00a5450bn compared with a \u00a5150bn loss predicted a little over a month ago. &quot;The sales environment has worsened dramatically in the past month and a half in the main markets of Japan, North America and Europe,&quot; Mitsuo Kinoshita, Toyota&apos;s executive vice president, told reporters. Earlier, Kinoshita said the firm was &quot;thoroughly reviewing our entire business to reduce costs across the board. We are aiming to implement a more effective cost structure in the areas of research and development, production and sales operations&quot;. Toyota, along with other major auto firms, has slashed production and announced layoffs at plants around the world in attempt to save money. But weak sales data for last month suggested even harsher reductions in output could be on the way. Toyota&apos;s sales in the United States, its biggest market, fell 34% in January and 23% in Japan. Industry analysts warned of even tougher times ahead for Toyota. &quot;The \u00a5300bn expansion in the losses shows the extraordinary conditions [Toyota] is facing,&quot; said Koji Endo at Credit Suisse Securities in Tokyo. &quot;Toyota&apos;s fixed costs haven&apos;t been reduced.

As the steam rises from myriad holes in the ground, the air is filled with the unmistakable stench of sulphur. The pong is inescapable - it hangs on your clothes for days - but the volcanically heated water that creates it is the lifeblood of this spa town 90 miles northeast of Tokyo. As Japan seeks new ways to honour its Kyoto protocol commitments on CO2, Kusatsu&apos;s bathers are up in arms over plans to tap into rich reservoirs of geothermal energy, a move they say threatens their inalienable right to soak in the restorative waters of a natural spa. In April a government panel of industry experts and academics is expected to call for substantial investment in geothermal plants for the first time in more than two decades. The envisioned new generation of power plants will tap into Japan&apos;s vast supply of heated water and steam, nestling deep below ground and sustained by the country&apos;s 108 active volcanoes. The result, the government says, will be an inexhaustible supply of cheap, clean energy that will also ease the country&apos;s $183bn a year dependence on Middle East oil. Geothermal developers insist that power plants and Japan&apos;s thousands of spas - or onsen - can happily coexist. But the 7,400 people of Kusatsu, more than 90% of whom depend on the tourist trade for their living, are not convinced. The fear that energy development will rob the town of its precious supply of hot, mineral-rich water has propelled them to the forefront of the anti-geothermal movement. Their nemesis is the nearby village of Tsumagoi, whose mayor has proposed the construction of a geothermal plant 4km from its nervous neighbour.  &quot;It is one thing to achieve global standards on the environment, but does that mean we have to destroy thousands of years of culture to achieve it?&quot; says Kusatsu&apos;s mayor, Takashi Nakazawa. &quot;We are representing every threatened onsen in Japan. There are thousands of other places they could build a geothermal plant. We are very lucky to have this natural resource and we want to use it to bring more people to our town, not throw it away.&quot; Kusatsu&apos;s revered hot springs are fed by water resting deep underground and kept at a piping-hot 54C by the 2,160-metre volcano Mount Shirane. The water, which gushes out of the ground at a rate of 34,000 litres a minute, is then cooled for the benefit of the three million bathers who visit the town every year. Unlike many other spas, the water rises to the surface naturally and is used to heat schools, homes and roads during the town&apos;s bitterly cold winters.  The spa was discovered 1,800 years ago, according to local legend, and by the Edo era the shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune had Kusatsu water delivered to the capital.  Though faced with centuries of tradition and legions of irate bathers, Japan&apos;s power companies view geothermal power as a potential bonanza at a time when plans to dramatically increase nuclear power have fallen foul of accidents and opposition from towns near the proposed sites of new reactors. Japan&apos;s 18 geothermal plants account for a mere 0.2% of total electricity output, according to the trade and industry ministry. But scientists believe the sector&apos;s share could rise significantly if the envisaged plants are built. Critics say Kusatsu&apos;s businesses are guilty of squandering much of the potential energy, lost when the water is allowed to cool before being released into dozens of bathhouses and ryokan inns. &quot;In Japan, the steam used in geothermal power generation is turned to water and returned underground,&quot; Yuzuru Ashida, a professor at Kyoto University who has advised the Tsumagoi town government, told the Yomiuri Shimbun. &quot;There is no scientific proof that geothermal power generation negatively impacts hot springs.&quot; After failing to secure government subsidies last year, Tsumagoi has put its plans on hold. But with official enthusiasm for geothermal power about to reach boiling point, the residents of Kusatsu say the battle to save the historic waters is far from over."}, {"sentences": ["Marie and Jamie Dean from Hackney in east London rented an apartment during a trip to Tokyo over Christmas.", "British Airways currently offers courier tickets on flights to Tokyo and Bangkok (the latter is only available until this spring)."], "tags": ["Budget travel", "Self-catering", "Travel", "United States holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "New York holidays", "Paris holidays", "London holidays", "Rome holidays", "Miami holidays", "Venice holidays", "Stockholm holidays", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "Budapest holidays"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-07T00:01:00Z", "title": "10 money-saving travel tips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/07/budget-travel-guide-credit-crunch", "article": "1. Book an apartment You might have to make your own bed, but at least you can lie in as long as you like. Increasingly, savvy travellers looking to offset the falling value of sterling are increasingly considering a holiday apartment rather than a hotel.  The economic slowdown has also seen a torrent of properties originally bought as investments or second homes flood on to the holiday lettings market. And many of the established websites specialising in holiday apartments have upgraded their offerings in recent months, presenting potential renters with the range of accommodation and level of functionality they&apos;ve come to expect when searching for hotels. In short, there&apos;s never been a better time to rent a holiday apartment. Kate Stinchcombe of holidaylettings.co.uk says it has witnessed almost 50% growth in the amount of properties listed on its website in the past year, with the UK in particular seeing an astonishing 73% increase, resulting in a classic buyer&apos;s market. &quot;Many are finding that they need to lower their prices to attract potential renters,&quot; adds Carol Mendelsohn, editor of slowtrav.com, which advocates living like a local on holiday. Finding a suitable apartment is easy, she says, as several websites are searchable by region and price and, increasingly, the big sites contain reviews written by recent visitors.  Marie and Jamie Dean from Hackney in east London rented an apartment during a trip to Tokyo over Christmas. Through the Japan Stay Club (japanstayclub.com) they found a third-storey apartment in a residential block in Ebisu for \u00a3600pw (including a &quot;hidden&quot; cleaning service charge), a quiet neighbourhood just two subway stops away from glamorous Shibuya Crossing. Staying in an apartment saved them money not only on accommodation, but also on overall living costs.  &quot;We ate out quite a lot,&quot; says Marie, &quot;but enjoyed being able to cook our own meals, too, making the most of trips to local markets and food halls.&quot;  Staying in an apartment also allowed their trip to alternate between &quot;one day exploring and the next day chilling&quot;, a godsend after a 14-hour flight, and gave them more space to relax and get a feel for neighbourhood. They say you do have to think carefully about the area you choose - hotels tend to be near transport connections, nightlife etc, though not all flats will be - but they would definitely do it again. Another tip worth bearing in mind is to use a site with a rental guarantee that will reimburse you should anything go wrong with the booking.  The downside of renting an apartment, particularly for those looking for city breaks, is that some owners still insist on a minimum of one-week rentals.

Ask for a no-frills alternative Tour operators are taking a leaf out of the supermarkets&apos; book by introducing value-brand holidays. Adventure operator Explore (0844 499 0901, explore.co.uk), for example, has launched 13 Back to Basics trips, where &quot;luxuries&quot; have been stripped back to make the holidays more affordable. Its Spirit of the Incas tour for \u00a31,595pp follows almost exactly the same itinerary (Cusco, Lake Titicaca and a train ride to Machu Picchu) as its existing Sacred Land of the Incas tour, which starts from \u00a32,195pp.  The \u00a3600 difference is due to more basic accommodation, use of local transport and because meals and some excursions are not included. In a similar move, Tribes (01728 685 971, tribes.co.uk) is launching a range of value holidays called Down to Earth (down-to-earth-holidays.com, will go live on 16 Feb), such as a week&apos;s Golden Triangle tour in India for \u00a3580pp (exc flights), using homestays instead of hotels.  3. Haggle for a hotel  Hotel rates are notoriously blurry. The rack rate quoted on a website is not necessarily the lowest rate available, so it is always worth contacting a hotel directly to ask what their best price is, and then asking whether that really is their best offer. In other words, you should haggle. We contacted several hotels in New York and each was prepared to offer deals that were significantly lower than the listed internet price. The W Hotel chain was prepared to shave 25% off one price - \u00a3360 down to \u00a3270 for two nights - citing a special offer that wasn&apos;t listed on the net. Even better, the Dylan Hotel (dylanhotel.com) in midtown Manhattan, offered us two nights for \u00a3245, when the listed price was \u00a3467. We found it helps if you are flexible with dates or have the nerve to book the hotel close to your departure.  4. Take a package Only lazy, unadventurous types who can&apos;t be faffed to make their own holidays go for packages, right? Wrong. Conventional wisdom used to dictate that DIY holidays always came in cheaper, but with operators desperate to get bums on seats, there are some startlingly cheap package deals out there - especially if you&apos;re looking to book last-minute. The mercurial &quot;I&apos;ll go anywhere&quot; function on Lastminute .com&apos;s holidays section is currently churning out some crackers; when we looked, there were seven days&apos; B&amp;B in Gambia from \u00a3399pp (departing 20 Feb), five-star all-inclusive Nile tours in Egypt from \u00a3529pp (23 Feb), and half-board Goa beach breaks (6 March) from \u00a3409pp, all including flights. On expedia.co.uk (0871 226 0808), deals include seven nights&apos; B&amp;B in Cape Town for \u00a3625pp at the four-star St George&apos;s Hotel , including Qatar Airways flights with from Heathrow via Doha, departing 23 Feb. 5. Join the club A number of websites collate the cream of the crop, and then fix deals with the hotels to ensure the best prices. I-escape.com, for example, is a collection of guest houses and boutique hotels around the world with honest reviews that lay out pros and cons. It&apos;s worth keeping an eye on its special-offer section. At the moment the Hotel Salvia in Soller, Mallorca, is on sale for \u20ac125 per night, a 50% reduction (valid 1 March - 15 May). Designhotels.com has 176 properties on its books and promises to match the price of a hotel  if you find it cheaper elsewhere within 24 hours. You don&apos;t have to join, but membership is free and entitles you to discounts. The hotels on mrandmrs smith.com tend to be pricey, but basic membership, at \u00a315 a year, means you hear about timely offers. Currently it has a two-nights&apos; B&amp;B-for-the-price-of-one offer at Seaham Hall, County Durham, for \u00a3360pp. Travel Offers (travel-offers.co.uk) charges \u00a344.95 to sign up, but members pay only for dinner and breakfast (ie the room is thrown in free) at more than 350 good UK hotels. Other sites worth bookmarking are: travelintelligence.com, a site founded by travel writers, among them AA Gill, and the American-based tablethotels.com. 6. Swap your home  Since the economy started to pinch, home-exchange sites have been doing a roaring trade. This is where holidaymakers swap homes (and often cars, sometimes even friends) with people in their destination-of-choice for a fixed period. Obviously, this saves heaps on accommodation. For example, if you live in Liverpool and want to go to New York for a week in April, you look for New Yorkers who want to visit Liverpool around that time, and get chatting. With the recent peak in membership, there are lots of new locations popping up day by day.  \u2022 homelink.org.uk. 7. Camp in the sun Camping is a great budget option as long as the sun shines. For guaranteed dry weather, you have to go further afield. A new website, goglamping.net from the same stable as holidaypad.net, is a great place to start. It features luxury sites cherrypicked from across the globe, including a desert campsite run by a nomadic family near Ouarzazate in Morocco (\u20ac28pp pn half board), pavilion tents with en-suite bathrooms and four-poster beds by the beach in Goa (\u00a3252 per tent per week, sleeps up to 6), and eco tents in the Australian outback (from A$87/\u00a341 pp pn).  8. Go all-inclusive It&apos;s 11am, it must be water polo ... Believe it or not, it is possible to stay in an all-inclusive that doesn&apos;t involve being frog-marched to the pool for fun games, all-you-can-eat buffets and the feeling that you&apos;re actually imprisoned on holiday. Upmarket operator Carrier (0161-491 7650, carrier.co.uk) has seven nights at the Sani Beach Club in Halkidiki, for \u00a3875pp including all meals at any of the Sani Resort&apos;s restaurants, unlimited premium-brand drinks, British Airways flights from Gatwick and transfers. Captivating Cuba (08444 129917, captivatingcuba.com) is offering seven nights at the five-star adult-only Hotel Melia Las Americas in Varadero for \u00a3875pp (saving \u00a3175pp) with Virgin flights from Gatwick, transfers and Visa (valid for departures 3 May-28 June).  9. Live it up in Vegas  There aren&apos;t many things falling as fast as sterling, but according to hotels.com, accommodation prices in Sin City has dropped by 20% in a year as Americans tighten their belts. The three-star Stratosphere Tower on The Strip has dropped to an average of \u00a330 a night (hotels.com), Virgin (virginholidays.co.uk) has four nights inc flights for \u00a3515pp at the 3.5 star Excalibur Hotel and Casino before 28 Feb (online only), while Best at Las Vegas (bestatlasvegasholidays.co.uk) has five nights for the price of four until autumn. Three-star Circus Circus is currently \u00a3425 inc flights before 31 March, so you will arrive with a healthy wallet, even if you don&apos;t leave with one.  10. Become a courier Courier flights - where you get a reduced price ticket in return for assisting in the delivery of a package to a destination - are not as common as they once were, but nor have they disappeared altogether. British Airways currently offers courier tickets on flights to Tokyo and Bangkok (the latter is only available until this spring). Travel writer Gemma Exley has booked a trip to Japan for April - peak season - for \u00a3320, when the normal online fare for the same flight was \u00a3910. &quot;As there&apos;s only one courier flight to each destination per day (only Tues to Sun for Bangkok), my friend is flying out on another ticket 24 hours later,&quot; she says. &quot;But since no responsibilities are required on the return leg, we can travel back together.&quot; As for those responsibilities, you don&apos;t come into contact with the package, but on arrival, you are required to collect a loading note which you must then hand to customs officials. Availability was plentiful at the time of writing - even for flights this month. \u2022 For more information call British Airways World Cargo on 0870 320 0301"}, {"sentences": ["On the world stage of graphic novels, America&apos;s biggest convention in San Diego doesn&apos;t come close and only Tokyo hosts anything larger than the Angoul\u00eame International Comics festival, now in its 36th year, held during the last weekend in January."], "tags": ["Peter Carey", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-07T00:01:00Z", "title": "The week in books: Australia's rights wars; comic books in France; and booming libraries", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/07/week-in-books-peter-carey-gravett-alison-flood", "article": "\u2022 My writing life has been made possible by the Australian publishers who accepted my work when it was rejected in London and New York, who believed in a literature that would define Australia for Australians and represent us to the world. All my novels, including the two that went on to win the Booker prize, were first published in Australia by an Australian publisher. I am now read in 25 languages only because of an autonomous publishing market and industry. Australia was not always thus. Early mercantile life was dominated by importers, distributors and retailers. To anyone still thinking in this colonial way, there will be nothing strange about the present proposal to eliminate territorial copyright and with it the discrete Australian market. What matters, if you are a colonial trader, is that you get the goods cheaper, and you do not weigh, not for a second, the damage to any local culture. If you are a true colonial you will not imagine your colony might even have a culture. You would assume that any indigenous books, for instance, would be inferior to those produced at &quot;home&quot;. So if, as a result of parallel importation, Australian publishers have their roles reduced to that of distributors in a global corporate chain, that will seem the natural order of things. When culture has no value, a lot of weird things start to look sensible.  Perhaps not everyone has noticed how many Australian writers there are. Our writers get more column inches in the United States than even the most craven of our prime ministers, and represent us as a sophisticated nation in every corner of the world.  In the current international climate where both publishers and retailers are in crisis, when executives are questioning the business models that seemed so attractive in the late 20th century, parallel importation introduces Australia to a complicated and dangerous game. This is no longer a simple colonial equation. Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble are closing stores in the United States. The international publishing corporations (that is, the owners of most &quot;Australian&quot; publishers) are in crisis. Most of the great individualistic publishing figures are dead and gone. The executives, newly arrived in publishing from finance or &quot;content control entities&quot;, have one abiding interest in literature - to save their corporation. When Australia obligingly donates its market to their balance sheet, they will take notice, although we can be sure that they will not ask themselves &quot;how can we give those folks down under cheaper books?&quot; It is more likely to be &quot;how can we sew this market up?&quot; Even as they fly back and forth reporting to London and New York, Australian publishers are aware of the cultural importance of their work at home. They know this &quot;market&quot; has a different character, a different history, a different language, and they fight to make sure a unique literature can be born and breathe, even in an age of value-free globalisation. As long as we have a territorial copyright, our publishers have a commercial argument to support Australian literature. They will battle for the sake of our readers and our writers, even if their owners have no personal commitment to the strange loves and needs of Australian readers, or the cultural integrity and future of the Australian nation. Take copyright away from them, and they no longer have a commercial leg to stand on. And then? Then the global companies will decide that their Australian offices will be much more profitable as distributors of product than publishers of books. If this sounds creepily colonial, it is because it is. If there is a global market in the English language, no one wants to bleed to death in a cost-cutting war. The efficient publisher therefore signs up the bestselling writers with international contracts. Once this is done there will be no competition between the US and Australia and Britain to provide product. And writers will sign these global contracts - they will have no option. Imagine the next John Grisham. Parallel importation eliminates his discrete Australian market. Once he could have sold it. Now he won&apos;t be able to. If he wishes to regain what has been stolen, he can only sign up internationally.  The same applies to all Australian writers who publish internationally, and there are a lot of them. If they have supported Australian publishers all their lives, they will now have to rethink who they sign with. As for the coming generation of writers, they will be starved. The generation after will be killed before it is even born. And the Australian subsidiaries of international publishers? I can&apos;t see what they have done to be punished, to have their editorial staff reduced to nothing, to become marketers and publicists for Paris Hilton. Will the Paris Hilton book be cheaper? Perhaps. But why would a global corporation need to cut its profits if it controlled all the prices in the English-speaking world? Or should we introduce a global retailer into the equation, a new species that can swim in acid, who can devour our indigenous retailers, scare the global publishers to death, mug them, bash them, rob them blind? Or should we put a very, very high value on ourselves and who we are? After all, we do already have a lot to be ashamed of in our history. We already have enough to rectify, to compensate, to restore. Let us not add the abandonment of a unique literary culture to this humiliating list.Peter Carey \u2022 Angoul\u00eame, a modest city in the Charente region of southwest France, is synonymous with comics, like Glyndebourne for opera or Hay- on-Wye for books. On the world stage of graphic novels, America&apos;s biggest convention in San Diego doesn&apos;t come close and only Tokyo hosts anything larger than the Angoul\u00eame International Comics festival, now in its 36th year, held during the last weekend in January. This was my 24th trip in 25 years, and I still regret missing that one year. Bandes dessin\u00e9es in France are an art form, &quot;the ninth art&quot;, based in the order of their recognition, after film (seventh) and television (eighth). It is also an extraordinarily booming sector of publishing. In 2008, 4,746 titles were put out by 265 publishers, an increase of 10% over 2007 and triple the total for the year 2000. Some are worried by this &quot;surproduction&quot;, which can prevent all but the strongest sellers from enjoying more than a week or two of face-out shelf-life. Others suggest that &quot;BD&quot; may weather the credit crunch better than most sectors because comics are often not some casual consumer purchase, but a passion. Little kids and grown-up kids were wearing long, bright orange furry ears, which made perfect earmuffs, to celebrate 50 years of Bill &amp; Boule, beloved tales of a boy and his devoted dog. Others were sporting little hotel groom&apos;s hats of red cardboard based on Spirou, 70 last year. Almost every shop window had a cut-out character, comic album or poster on display. As night fell, the Gothic fa\u00e7ade of the town hall came alive, illuminated by an animated projection showing a mischievous little wildcat, the festival&apos;s &quot;fauve&quot; mascot, scurrying from window to window, trailed by a flyer saucer. The whole city embraces the festival, from huge tents or &quot;bulles&quot; for publishers to exhibitions from as far afield as Korea and South Africa in the streets, in the cathedral, the Paper Museum and the \u00a39m national comics centre (Mitterrand&apos;s grandest arts project outside of Paris, opened in 1990).  Posy Simmonds&apos;s Tamara Drewe, serialised in these pages, was chosen as one of the &quot;Five Essential Fauves&quot; of the year, but the prestigious &quot;Fauve d&apos;Or&quot; went to a darkly scurrilous retelling of Pinocchio by the Frenchman Winshluss, alias Vincent Paronnaud, the co-director, with Marjane Satrapi, of the animated version of Persepolis. Later this June, Angoul\u00eame opens a grand new Museum of Bande Dessin\u00e9e, while in Belgium Herg\u00e9 is honoured with a one-man museum of his own. As Tintin turns 80 and Asterix reaches 50, the status and vigour of comics across the Channel show no signs of diminishing.Paul Gravett \u2022 If there&apos;s one part of the books world doing well in the recession, it is libraries. Early reports suggest that visits are up in the last few months, with a string of innovative campaigns aiming to draw even more borrowers through the doors. In Devon, libraries have been running a &quot;buy none, get eight free&quot; campaign to entice readers, while in Brighton &amp; Hove they&apos;re about to launch a marketing campaign based on supermarket price comparison adverts, pointing out that while the latest bestsellers might cost \u00a310 or more in shops, they&apos;re free from libraries. Norfolk has just launched a &quot;balance the books&quot; campaign, running advertising on buses and local radio stations, informing families they could save more than \u00a350 a month by swapping buying habits for borrowing habits.Alison Flood"}, {"sentences": ["We did have screens to surround the bed at night, though.&quot; Jamil Jivanjee, a freelance theatre producer living in London, travelled as a courier  &quot;I travelled to Tokyo last summer as a courier after reading about the possibility on the Japanese National Tourist Office website.", "&quot;I wasn&apos;t given anything to carry on the flight but when I arrived in Tokyo I had to meet a representative from a cargo company.", "British Airways is planning to stop courier flights to Bangkok at the end of March but is still going to be running them to Tokyo.&quot; \u2022 Courier flights with British Airways: 0870 320 0301; ba.com"], "tags": ["Budget travel", "Flights", "Hotels", "Travel", "Recycling", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-08T00:01:00Z", "title": "Seasoned budget travellers reveal the secret of cheap trips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/08/budget-travel-cheap-shoestring-sarah-turner-hotels-flights-holiday-trip", "article": "Railway communications officer John Till and his wife Ann paid for business class flights back from Atlanta by recycling rubbish through a scheme run by Tesco &quot;My lightbulb moment came when I was filling the car with petrol and noticed that the recycling machine at our local Tesco was offering Clubcard points.

When I suggested it to Ann, she wanted to do it too. If anything, she was keener than I was - she&apos;s the more frugal one of us.  &quot;We collected rubbish from around Petersfield over a three-month period almost every evening, depending on the weather. I&apos;m not sure that I would have done it for any holiday but this was for our honeymoon and that was a big motivation.  &quot;The process was quite simple: we got loyalty points for recycling in the form of vouchers, which we converted into British Airways Air Miles, and booked our tickets.  &quot;It was very easy to do and only took a couple of weeks after we&apos;d received the voucher.

You&apos;re doing things for the first time and it feels more adventurous.  &quot;I&apos;ve been on several recce trips for Wild Frontiers, including the Chandrabhaga Camel Fair Horse Trek in Rajasthan, which I went on last year.

It&apos;s a hotel that also has an art gallery and they&apos;d created a replica hotel room on the ground floor as an installation. The only thing we had to do was to be in the room between 4.30pm and 7.30pm, which suited us fine as that&apos;s usually the time you want to head back to where you&apos;re staying for a rest.  &quot;We spent five days in the lap of luxury at an exclusive hotel for free - I estimate that we saved at least $500 each. Maids came in each morning just like in any normal hotel room. The only difference was that our room was on the ground floor and had two glass walls. For about 15 minutes each day we&apos;d be aware of the people outside the hotel, but we soon forgot about them and just behaved normally. We did have screens to surround the bed at night, though.&quot; Jamil Jivanjee, a freelance theatre producer living in London, travelled as a courier  &quot;I travelled to Tokyo last summer as a courier after reading about the possibility on the Japanese National Tourist Office website. I paid \u00a3310 for my return flight and probably saved about \u00a3600 on the usual fare. It was much like any other form of travelling. I paid for my ticket over the phone, checked in online and chose my seat like any other traveller. Even my luggage allowance was the same as that of any other passenger in economy.  &quot;I wasn&apos;t given anything to carry on the flight but when I arrived in Tokyo I had to meet a representative from a cargo company. However, that only took about five minutes. &quot;The only difference to a normal ticket is that, as a courier, you can&apos;t change the date of your outbound flight, although you can alter the date of the return leg for about \u00a350. Another difference is that if you have to cancel your flight you&apos;ll lose all your money. You have to be at least 18 years old and dress fairly smartly.  &quot;I&apos;d do it again but courier flights are becoming harder to track down.

Isn&apos;t this 1955 play more vital than the revered Death of a Salesman? It x-rays postwar America: in chronicling the lives of longshoreman and illegal immigrants, it shows a country alternately shielding and repulsing the incomers who are its foundation. Its formal invention gives the passionate action unexpected edge and variety: this tale of a man&apos;s overwhelming love for his niece is framed by a chorus, a lawyer played by Allan Corduner with both assurance and perturbation.  Best of all, it has at its centre an oddball - a man whose behaviour is atrocious but whose heart is open; for whom you feel even as you want to kick him. Ken Stott embodies him with stumpy magnificence, gradually becoming more hunched and fiery-eyed. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio gives his torn wife both delicacy and determination. As the beguiling young woman, Hayley Atwell puts in her best stage performance yet. Played against Christopher Oram&apos;s glowering, angled design, the action has the momentum of a thriller.  The Japanese writer Jun&apos;ichiro Tanizaki wrote of a life before electric light and western habits, when darkness was thought of as beautiful and women blackened their teeth to have less white in their face. In Shun-kin, Complicite&apos;s Simon McBurney and Tokyo&apos;s Setagaya Public Theatre evoke that world. Light glows softly in a small area; noise is amplified so crisply that the swish of a screen sounds like a glacier. Tanizaki&apos;s pseudo-documentary about a blind musician who bullies and enthrals her servant lover is summoned with paper larks who flutter skywards, a misty skyscape and a puppet doll who turns into a real fleshy actress. An evening which is in turn rapt and bewilderingly violent. Nothing is rapt, everything fleshy in Nick Bagnall&apos;s period-precise production of Entertaining Mr Sloane, Joe Orton&apos;s brilliant and brutal play. At its most uncomfortable, the experience of watching this is like being cornered in the Gargoyle club, listening to unrelenting innuendo and casual misogyny: some of the men are venal, some are pathetic; only the woman is both venal and pathetic. At its best, it offers the wonderful Imelda Staunton: saucy, cosy and vicious, knitting on the sofa in a see-through negligee.

That&apos;s the idea which propels Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik&apos;s musical Spring Awakening. It&apos;s a notion most strongly pitched in the opening sequences where groups of niminy-piminy turn-of-the-last-century German youths and youthesses suddenly drop their cover and reveal their inner selves in song. There are the girls in droopy combis, black stockings, baggy florals and wire specs. There are the boys in their plus-fours, scrawling Latin on their slates. Furrowed with sexual anxiety and ignorance, all are constrained by parental uptightness. They look as if a wintry bit of lieder might be too much for them. Until the moment each of them reaches inside their buttoned-up bodice or jacket, takes out a mike and rips into the 21st century. &quot;Mama Who Bore Me,&quot; snarl the girls. The boys yell about &quot;The Bitch of Living&quot;. Spring Awakening is already a phenomenon. It is that now rare thing, a musical which sprang neither from a movie, a jukebox or a telly series, and which isn&apos;t built around a star. Steven Sater&apos;s book and lyrics are based on Frank Wedekind&apos;s much banned and censored play of 1891, in which the suppression of teenage erotic desire leads to beatings, abortion and suicide. All the adult parts are taken by the able Sian Thomas and Richard Cordery, who perform a series of starchy caricatures. They are caught up in a tide of bendy, explosive, exuberantly fed-up youth played by a cast of unknown 16 to 24-year-olds; out of 17 actors, 14 are here making their professional debut. The youthful attack and freshness they bring to Spring Awakening gives the show a claim to be the Hair of its day. As does the actual hair they display: not since - well, Hairspray - has a musical been so forward with its follicles. There&apos;s a pate sleeked down so smoothly that it might have been varnished, and pairs of plaits so tight that you can almost feel the faces between them being stretched. One boy looks like Eraserhead in a wind tunnel, another sports two plump top-knots, in the style of the Duchess in Alice in Wonderland. This is a show in which the characters look weirder than their music sounds. Michael Mayer&apos;s staging of Spring Awakening has already been a hit on Broadway, where the show closed last month after a two-year run. By the end of this year productions will have opened in Japanese in Tokyo, in Korean in Seoul, in German in Vienna and, probably, in Spanish or Portuguese in South America. At the enterprising Lyric Hammersmith, where previews sold out, the run has already been extended thanks to advance gossip on the internet. Talks about a transfer are in progress; it seems almost certain that an enthusiastic teenage audience will sweep the show into the West End. It will be welcome there; it will deliver a small jolt to the gargantuan and the synthetic. Nevertheless, Spring Awakening is not one of the truly innovative musicals to open in London in the last 10 years. It doesn&apos;t have the heart of Billy Elliot or the heartlessness of Shockheaded Peter; it doesn&apos;t have the guts of Jerry Springer - the Opera. It never really delivers on the promise of its opening scene. Sheik&apos;s music has distinctive passages - moments when it seizes the stage with rock, or sweetens into ballad, and one striking episode of strangeness called &quot;Blue Wind&quot; - but for the most part it&apos;s pleasantly boisterous rather than rough, wistful rather than grief-laden, and nowhere disturbed enough to carry the shock of the action. An onstage band - keyboard, guitar and drums augmented by strings - suggests the possibility of intensity, intimacy and precision, in the manner of the satiric cabaret in which Wedekind himself appeared. No such luck. Sater&apos;s lyrics - which include a chorus that runs &quot;bla bla bla bla bla bla bla&quot; - do some enjoyable rabble-rousing in a number called &quot;Totally F***ed&quot; but elsewhere are constantly slipping into the soupy: there&apos;s even a song called &quot;I Believe&quot; - surely we&apos;ve heard that before? Jaunty and nice to be around, this Spring Awakening is nothing like as frightening or as sexually suggestive as the play on which it is based. Wedekind&apos;s drama still reads disruptively. It runs the gamut from frankness to concealment. There is onstage beating of girl by boy and off-stage beating of girl by father; there&apos;s a wanking contest, with lots of chaps standing around to see who can hit a coin. There are quite a few driftings off into asterisks when &quot;things&quot; are too mysterious or too exciting to be put into words. There is also a multitude of symbolic swellings and swoonings: stars shoot and wand-like plants burgeon. The whole world is pulsing away. In Sater and Sheik&apos;s musical the asterisk is a rare entity. You get not only the wank and spank but one bare bum, several expletives and a first half that ends in mid-orgasm. You also get a sugaring over of some of the more troubling aspects of the original. A sexual encounter which is tantamount to rape in Wedekind is turned into a spoonily romantic coupling. The ambiguously dark ending is tidied up and made more wholesome: even if Wedekind&apos;s ghost and graveyard are a spook too far, do we have to end with the implanted uplift of a song promising summer blooms? Vox pop: wake up call or a big yawn?Members of the audience tell us what they thought ... James Barker, 32, architectPossibly the most tortuous few hours of my life.

Altermodernism, he calls it, with no attempt at seductive poetry.  It is worth paying attention to Nicolas Bourriaud if you are a watcher on the art promontory. He co-founded the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, which trumps our ICA by being both suave and exciting as a venue for experimental art. And he came up with practically the only substantial theory of art in recent years - relational aesthetics, in which art is what you might call user-friendly, creating environments and experiences that are open to all kinds of human relationships rather than just the conventional one-to-one encounter of person with object. Think of Felix Gonzalez-Torres&apos;s heaps of take-away sweeties or Carsten H\u00f6ller&apos;s Tate Modern slides. Compared with other French theorists, or indeed theorist-curators, Bourriaud is not especially hard to follow and never too lofty to cite actual examples. The whole of this show, for instance, plays out his latest notion through the work of 28 artists and some very concentrated wall-texts. The artists are invited to disagree with him (there is sporadic dissent in the catalogue) and precisely the same conditions hold for the public. Altermodernism, if I understand it, is international art that never quite touches down but keeps on moving through places and ideas, made by artists connected across the globe rather than grouped around any central hub such as New York or London. You might take the worldwide web as a model and think in terms of hyperlinks, continuous updates and cultural hybrids. It is most definitely postcolonial, transitional and to some extent provisional, but what it is not, I don&apos;t think, is anything as grand, or significant, as a movement. Bourriaud is not wrong, it seems to me, to find affinities among the artists represented. English artist Darren Almond has been orbiting the world taking long-exposure photographs of the full moon, in this case over China. German artist Franz Ackermann never stops travelling and some of his wall-sized collages of semi-abstract fragments were actually made in transit.  Almond&apos;s photographs are as beautiful as the watercolour scrolls they echo. There the connection ends. Ackermann&apos;s paintings, knee-deep in semiotics - signage, tourism, satnav graphics etc - are teeth-grittingly awful. Katie Paterson&apos;s map of many thousands of dead stars is a futile attempt to commemorate the history of the universe, obsolete the moment it was made since so many stars have since died. Compared to the astronomical knowledge it represents, the map is visually a dead bore.  Walead Beshty&apos;s glass boxes, incessantly Fed-Exed across the globe, aim to record a trajectory through the &quot;non-places&quot; within international air-space, each box &quot;sculpted&quot; by the journey. Translation: they got broken in transit.  I couldn&apos;t even begin to express the inanity of Simon Starling&apos;s latest project, involving a desk designed but never made by Francis Bacon for Australian writer Patrick White, except to say that, with his addiction to pointless projects, Starling is unlikely ever to be superseded as the least interesting of all Turner Prize-winning artists.  Bourriaud talks a lot about time and space, referring to them as the last terra incognita for art. In fact, he just means history and geography and it wouldn&apos;t be hard to come up with a long list of successful art-explorers from the past. But again, one sees certain links between artists.  Olivia Plender stumbles across a breakaway sect from the scouting movement in the 1920s. She tells the story of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift in words and pictures for idiots, parodying the way we narrate history. (Although her observations of modern times, intercut, are worryingly simple-minded). Matthew Darbyshire notices similarities between state-sponsored architecture of the past and present - between the socialist realist Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw and Will Alsop&apos;s arrogantly whimsical contemporary arts centre, the Public, in West Bromwich. Astute and satirical ideas in the catalogue, alas, translate into nothing more than pastiche decor juxtaposed in the gallery. In fact, the more one considers the art as opposed to the ideas the worse this show seems. There are good things here, notably Marcus Coates&apos;s gentle film in which the artist, accoutred with stuffed animal heads, solicits a question about youth violence from an Israeli mayor which he then pretends to answer, shamanically, on behalf of the animal world with a long-winded but beautifully shrewd parable about plovers. And it is great to see new work by Tacita Dean in the form of one-frame films, ghostly visions of shipwrecks, explosions and inexplicable phenomena entirely conveyed through enlarged photographs inscribed with evocative script directions. But Dean, with her poet&apos;s imagination, has no more connection with altermodernism than with the YBAs, the artists who just happen to be her contemporaries. And I have no idea why Gustav Metzger, now in his eighties, is represented here with the kind of liquid-crystal light show he used to create for Cream concerts at the Roundhouse, other than the fact that, since his flight from the Nazis in the 1940s, the German-born artist has been stateless. Metzger&apos;s projections are monotonous but sensual, at least, compared to so much else here: scatological videos, half-baked observations, stream-of-consciousness performances. It is a dull show in the end, with few exceptions, just as Altermodernism itself is not a very thrilling definition, or redefinition, of where art may be heading.  It is by no means certain, in any case, that any theory of art that can be made to stretch all the way from Tacita Dean to Franz Ackermann is of much ultimate value. Altermodernism does not work as an idea so much as a web of observations, a web with a weaver at its centre. The real hyperlink here is not the art, but Bourriaud himself."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo was found to be the fourth most expensive city to buy property in, followed by Hong Kong, New York, Paris, Singapore, Rome and Mumbai."], "tags": ["UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-09T00:01:00Z", "title": "UK news in brief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/feb/09/news-uk", "article": "Database to track all travel in and out of UK International travellers could have their records tracked and stored in a government database in an effort to fight crime, illegal immigration and terrorism.

For those reasons, of course, a Complicite show is hotly anticipated. But Shun-kin, the company&apos;s latest offering at the Barbican, an international collaboration created with Japanese actors from Tokyo&apos;s Setogaya Theatre, is a problem \u2013 and the critics are divided. For the Telegraph, it was a two-hour interval-less torture; for the Times, a four-star &quot;fascinatingly ambiguous piece&quot;. The Observer called it a &quot;rapt&quot; evening, while the Independent waspishly dismissed it as &quot;not so much cutting-edge as rusty razors.&quot; So what on earth to say? Don&apos;t panic. Start with the story, plus some brainy analysis, like the Sunday Times does. &quot;Superficially,&quot; you begin, &quot;it describes a sadomasochistic relationship between the lovely Shun-kin, a dominant, blind player of an evocative stringed instrument, the shamisen, and her submissive servant lover, who blinds himself in an ultimate act of love. Yet, just as the performance has several narrators, and several actors to play the key roles, so there are several layers of meaning and feeling, as the frame shifts between a noisy, apparently heartless modern Japan and the pre-western values of Shun-kin.&quot; Now rely a little on the Independent on Sunday to flesh out the aesthetic of the show. &quot;McBurney&apos;s adaptation,&quot; you spout, creates a sense of mystery &quot;by leaving some things in the dark. Surrounded by an ocean of black, often lit only by candles, Shun-kin remains impenetrable: a porcelain mask which you never quite get behind; a gorgeous trailing kimono that opens, in one scene, to reveal emptiness.&quot; Anyone could make those observations, though, so you need to throw in bit of international theatre savvy. &quot;There&apos;s a touch of noh and kabuki in McBurney&apos;s staging, with lots of stylised gesture, mime and the use of puppets to depict the horrid little blind girl who squawks malevolently at everyone who comes within her orbit,&quot; you say with an air of eastern mystery, sneakily stealing from the Telegraph. (Don&apos;t feel that you have to diss the show as that paper does by calling it &quot;Jackanory for grown-ups&quot;, or damning McBurney with a double-edged compliment by saying &quot;even geniuses have their off days and this is one of them.&quot;) Better to declare that you are impressed by the show, which is &quot;finely staged by McBurney&quot; (Times). Recall the &quot;poles for swaying trees, paper for birds, and so on&quot; and then enigmatically reveal the coup de theatre, in which &quot;Shun-kin herself begins as a puppet with a shrill, brattish voice, even has voracious sex with Sasuke in that guise, and then morphs into an actress with an almost more mask-like face.&quot; Let that image sink in before you pose the big question: &quot;That&apos;s a magical transformation [but] are people like her fully human?&quot; End with an air of dreamy distance and profound understanding. This work is &quot;meltingly beautiful&quot;, you say, making use of the positive aspects of the Guardian&apos;s two-star review. The show&apos;s &quot;stillness, the way it plays with light and shadow, and, best of all, the work of the acclaimed puppet company Blind Summit, who magically dissolve the barriers between the wooden-jointed and the human so you cannot tell one from the other,&quot; eclipse for you the criticism that the show&apos;s &quot;whole technique is one of illustrating a story rather than inhabiting it&quot; (Independent).

The lineup: Dylan Rou (guitar, vocals), Ted Feldman (guitar), Val Loper (bass), TJ Orscher (drums). The background: There&apos;s no need for an indie landfill in NYC just yet: Bear Hands are yet another good Brooklyn band, if not quite a great one. They&apos;re too derivative for that, too recognisably the sum of their parts. Of the area&apos;s myriad scenes and sounds, they don&apos;t do white disco a la Boy Crisis but their basslines are subtly propulsive, they&apos;re rather more earthbound than the cosmic-pop of MGMT, even if there is a haziness to their music that you could probably describe as psychedelic, and they&apos;re not exactly Afropop although their new single What a Drag does feature a high-life-ish guitar sound and nimble percussion. You might even be able to dance to it, as long as you don&apos;t find the cryptic lyric \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m dreaming of your goddamn long nails&quot; \u2013 too off-putting. They&apos;re a bit folky and a bit funky: they&apos;re quite hard to place or get a handle on, possibly one of the reasons why, unlike their Brooklyn peers, with whom they&apos;ve toured (notably MGMT and VW), they haven&apos;t yet been picked up by the press over here. Actually, they&apos;re originally from Connecticut, where they formed in 2006 and where guitarist Ted Feldman still attends Wesleyan University (former alma mater of the MGMT boys). If anything, they remind us of Pavement, the kings of US alt rock and masters of the ironic shambles. Despite Dylan Rou&apos;s vocals \u2013 like many current indie frontmen, US and UK, he does that thing of sounding simultaneously barely-bothered and urgent/anxious \u2013 and the close-to-collapse playing of the band, you get the impression the sloppy amateurism is a cover for, or comment on, something or other: there are seriously intelligent minds at work here, even if it&apos;s difficult to work out what it is because you can hardly make out what Rou is singing (we like the reference to &quot;peace in the Middle East&quot; during Long Lean Queen, though). And when they rise to the occasion, as they do on single B-side Can&apos;t Stick &apos;Em, with its cross-rhythms and changes of pace, you barely notice their instrumental limitations. Bear Hands were recently named by Alternative Press one of the Top 100 Bands of 2008, and they are touring here next week with two more highly-touted American \u2013 though not Brooklyn \u2013 outfits, Hockey and Passion Pit. And that could be their undoing: they&apos;re one of many, and they don&apos;t quite stand out, they don&apos;t astonish. But there are, to be fair, moments in their repertoire when they do shamble towards glory. The buzz: &quot;Bear Hands make aptly grizzly indie-rock growls, resembling a hungover, vicious Cold War.&quot; The truth: They maybe need to fix on a sound before we can get a fix on them. Most likely to: Give you cuticle-related nightmares. Least likely to: Bring peace to the Middle East. What to buy: What a Drag is released by Too Pure on 2 March.

Like the movies, these sales required a certain suspension of disbelief. The record-breaking prices seemed unsustainable, and yet still they came. Only five months ago, Damien Hirst put 223 new works up for auction at Sotheby&apos;s and made himself \u00a395m. Had his Beautiful Inside My Head Forever sale taken place 48 hours later, he might not have got away with it. Since then, the price of art has fallen off a cliff. Last week&apos;s auctions, the first conceived during the global financial crisis, unfolded more like made-for-TV dramas. They were lower budget but more honest, less spectacular but somehow more real. At Sotheby&apos;s on Tuesday last week, there were empty seats. People often come to watch as well as to buy, but here was a sign that spending is declining even as a spectator sport. An area at the back that was standing-room-only last year was now seated, and spaciously so. The previously seething, bitchy press pen was roomy and congenial. With only 29 impressionist and modern works set to go under the hammer, roughly half the boom-time norm, Sotheby&apos;s sale had been dramatically downsized. Josh Baer, a dealer, had flown in from New York anyway. &quot;I bet it will be over in 45 minutes,&quot; he said as Henry Wyndham, the auctioneer and chairman of Sotheby&apos;s, announced the first lot. During the boom, an evening sale could take two hours - soaring prices take longer to reach. Not long ago, many people felt the headlines commanded by high prices were damaging to the perception of art. Who cared what critics or curators thought, or what artists were trying to create, when works by Hirst and Koons and Freud were selling for jaw-dropping sums? Now the market is faltering, the same people are hoping for a correction that looks beyond price to the value bestowed on an artist by, say, museum retrospectives and writers. But in the auction room, money still talks. As Baer predicted, the sale took just 46 minutes. Twenty-two of the 29 lots sold, bringing in a total of \u00a332.6m - a respectable outcome in the circumstances, but well below the \u00a3116m total of the equivalent sale last year. Despite the lower prices, the bidders behaved as they always have. Abigail Asher, a New York consultant, acquired a Ren\u00e9 Magritte by snapping her fingers at Wyndham, as if he were a busboy in a French bistro. Jos\u00e9 Mugrabi, a dealer said to own 800 Warhols, sat in the fourth row in a blue baseball cap, and casually bought a Juan Mir\u00f3. The bidding on one lot did feel like a throwback to the blockbuster boom: Edgar Degas&apos;s Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans, a bronze sculpture with a real tutu in an edition of 27. John Madejski, the owner of Reading Football club, had bought the Degas five years ago for a flat \u00a35m. Wyndham opened the bidding at \u00a37.6m, and three telephone bidders took the price up and up. Just before bringing down his hammer, Wyndham joked: &quot;Anyone interested ... at \u00a311.8m?&quot; The total price, with buyer&apos;s premium, was \u00a313.3m. There was a round of applause as the bronze teenager went to an anonymous bidder on the phone with Yasuaki Ishizaka, managing director of Sotheby&apos;s Tokyo office. Sotheby&apos;s Alexander Platon explained this jump in price by saying: &quot;The masterpiece market didn&apos;t exist in 2004.&quot; In the run-up to the sale, he said, Degas&apos;s dancer &quot;had made a lot of private trips to people&apos;s living rooms&quot;. As we left the auction house, Baer offered an alternative explanation: &quot;Art collectors are not rational,&quot; he said. &quot;Even they would admit that.&quot; The following evening, Christie&apos;s held their impressionist and modern sale. With 47 lots, it was a more lively affair, lasting 64 minutes and bringing in \u00a363.4m - almost a million a minute. Christie&apos;s chairman, Ed Dolman, described it as &quot;reassuring&quot;, while Thomas Seydoux, Christie&apos;s co-head of impressionist and modern art, explained with some glee: &quot;The pound dropping was super, super helpful.&quot; Seating at an auction, as at a fashion show, is no arbitrary matter. It is the brutal means by which the auction house tells the world what it thinks of you: only the most powerful players score an aisle seat in the first 12 rows. Laurence Graff, the world&apos;s foremost diamond dealer, is one of these. Two months ago, he spent \u00a316m on a diamond at Christie&apos;s. Last week, he acquired sculptures by Henry Moore and Alberto Giacometti. After the sale, I asked Graff why the economic turmoil wasn&apos;t curbing his spending. &quot;Cash is rotting,&quot; he said. &quot;Anything in banks could get lost. Many are afraid to get involved in complicated financial instruments. So clever people are investing in solid assets like serious art.&quot; Two of the night&apos;s most successful lots were consigned by a &quot;private European&quot; rumoured to be a Turkish banker based in Switzerland. Claude Monet&apos;s Dans la Prairie, an image of the artist&apos;s wife in a meadow, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&apos;s L&apos;Abandon (Les Deux Amies), a picture of two women on a bed in a brothel, went for \u00a311.2m and \u00a36.2m respectively. The Turkish collector&apos;s other four consignments didn&apos;t fare so well: a Paul Gauguin landscape sold for under the low estimate, while his Renoir, Bonnard and a less exciting Monet didn&apos;t sell at all.  It could be that the market is seeing a shift in taste, away from chocolate box images to more edgy art. Renoirs and Pissarros failed to find buyers last week, while paintings that sold above their high estimates included a mother with cross-eyed child by Amedeo Modigliani and a corpse-like androgyne by Gustav Klimt. Gone are the decorators and speculators, who threw money at unthreatening, commercial paintings in easy-to-install sizes; in their place are art lovers who enjoy thought-provoking work at lower prices. At Sotheby&apos;s contemporary art auction last Thursday, you could hear laughter as dealers and collectors took their seats. They appeared relieved by the success of the Christie&apos;s sale the night before. Mark Vanmoerkerke, a Belgian collector who usually bids on the telephone, had decided to attend for a change, explaining: &quot;I wanted to sniff, smell, or should I say taste the mood of the market.&quot; (Collectors often liken art market calibrating to wine tasting.) With only 27 lots, the contemporary sale took just 41 minutes, the fastest yet, and 92% of the lots were sold, an indicator that the market hadn&apos;t seized up. But the auction brought in only \u00a317m - a fifth of last year&apos;s February total. In 2007 and 2008, auction revenue on postwar and contemporary art exceeded that of impressionist and modern for the first time. This is unlikely to happen in 2009, as collectors return to the safe haven of dead artists. Indeed, Sotheby&apos;s lost money on Bridget Riley&apos;s 1974 Gala, a wave painting with a wonderfully trippy optical effect. The auction house had guaranteed the consignor an undisclosed sum rumoured to be \u00a31m. On the night, it sold for only \u00a3735,650 with fees; Sotheby&apos;s will have to make up the difference. One piece that bucked the general downward trend was Anish Kapoor&apos;s 1996 Untitled concave mirror. It exceeded its high estimate, selling for \u00a3982,000. Nicholas Logsdail, the owner of Lisson Gallery, which has represented Kapoor for 27 years, explained: &quot;His work has appeal in the far east, the Middle East, and in the traditional European and American markets.&quot; As for the current market, Logsdail said: &quot;It&apos;s more stable in a funny way, because it&apos;s not dominated by herd instincts and speculative money.&quot; But if it is more stable, it has also shrunk dramatically - and the art world is contracting as a result. Sotheby&apos;s and Christie&apos;s have announced lay-offs; many commercial galleries are pruning staff and extending the duration of their shows. Art students who graduate this summer will find it hard to get jobs as installers or assistants, let alone get representation from a gallery. By 2010, fewer people will be able to refer to themselves unapologetically, unreservedly, as artists. The drama of the auction room, whether a humdrum soap or the white-knuckle thriller of 2008, is part of art&apos;s lifeblood. \u2022 Sarah Thornton is the author of Seven Days in the Art World, published by Granta \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 13 January 2009.

The first has a French refinery with American builders who are employing Italian sub-contractors; the other is a German project with French builders who have sub-contracted to two Spanish firms. Most of the frustrated British workers meanwhile offer their skills through another American firm, and there are Polish and Portuguese workers in the mix too.

The Northern Echo  explained that he had hired a fancy dress outfit based on Boss Hogg, the greedy local council official in the 1980s TV series Dukes of Hazzard who represents all seven deadly sins. Scott gave a reading from Richard III (&quot;Now is the winter of our discontent \u2026&quot;) before going inside to watch the law dawdle on its way. His solicitor left everyone guessing over the eventual plea of guilty or not, saying only: &quot;The defendant does not agree with everything that has been said from a factual point of view, but now is not the time to raise it.&quot; Afterward, Scott invited researchers inside the limo to meet his blonde researcher and told them that his plight resembled Hamlet&apos;s.

After one prolonged game of hide-and-seek, one man held officers at bay with a freshly-boiled kettle, though he eventually agreed to come quietly. The one who most nearly got away was a woman who dived into a cupboard and hid herself under a pile of clothes and shoes. Unfortunately for her, there was no connection between Mytholmroyd and Narnia. Supt Stan Bates concluded the operation by warning stoutly: &quot;These people need to know we are coming after them and if we haven&apos;t caught up with them yet, it is only a matter of time.&quot; James Earls doesn&apos;t know whether to be angry or flattered according to the Blackpool Gazette  which reports how he was asked for ID at the local Tesco&apos;s to prove that he was old enough to buy a pouch of rolling tobacco. This was odd, because he is 59 and uses a Zimmer; indeed you can look at him yourself courtesy of the Gazette and make up your own mind about the sanity of the request. You naturally suspect some hidden angle to a tale like this to emerge, but there doesn&apos;t seem to be one in Earls&apos;s case. Challenged by the Gazette, Tesco&apos;s spokesman says: &quot;The store has introduced a policy, on a trial basis, to require ID from all customers wishing to buy age-restricted products to help prevent under-age sales.&quot; What are elderly people supposed to do, asks Earls&apos;s comparatively youthful friend Patricia Ritchie, 39, who eventually had to buy the baccy for him. Only one option, guys. Brandish the bus pass. The housing market is torpid but South Shields has stirred a bit of activity by marketing a new line of &quot;upside-down houses&quot; in Amytis Gardens, an impressively eruditely-named street. Amytis was a fifth century BC Persian princess described by ancient Greek historians as the most beautiful and licentious woman in Asia, although they are silent on whether she visited South Shields. If she had done, she would have made for the ground floor in Amytis Gardens, because that&apos;s where this new style of terrace house has the bedrooms. The rest of life goes on upstairs, with big windows, lots of light and nice views. The Shields Gazette reports that the Gardens&apos; actual gardens are laid out on top of the houses&apos; garages, so everything is topsy-turvy. The first show houses had 250 visitors over the weekend and the scheme&apos;s sales manager Sarah Jobling says that they were &quot;thrilled&quot;. Moving up the hype gears, she added: &quot;A lot of South Shields people have said it is exactly what South Shields has been waiting for.&quot; But she might have misheard them talking wistfully about the chances of Amytis calling by. The latest unemployment figures are all the more shocking when they come down to localities. The Grimsby Telegraph calculates that 4,891 people in north east Lincolnshire are now jobless, compared to 1,426 a year ago. That&apos;s an increase of 243%. The paper doesn&apos;t believe in being glum, though, and it runs the news alongside a traditional media punfest about chips which are &quot;battering the credit crunch as the staple diet of Grimsby-area people&quot;. To mark National Chip Week, which I hope you will celebrate yourself in a modest way, the paper is inviting nominations for the port&apos;s &quot;coveted award of Perfect Portion 2009&quot;. Reader reaction in these interactive days isn&apos;t initially encouraging. The promo article has three responses, two of them from the same chap who says gravely: &quot;Readers should be aware that a &apos;chip&apos; diet should not be the staple diet as inferred by the Telegraph. All things in moderation, but this article suggests that unhealthy eating option is the option when in recession.&quot; Martin Wainwright recommends: not chips, then, though if you do get some for Valentines or whatever, remember to have some scraps. Because they&apos;re free, most Northern chip shops pretend to forget and make you ask twice, but they&apos;re worth any amount of humiliation.

Significantly, they were the hands of a writer who wrote by hand, words which touched people unknown to her.  For her previous book, Women, Leibovitz had included a portrait of her own mother, unusually unsmiling and staring straight into the camera. Her parents hadn&apos;t liked the photograph, but I find it a powerful and revealing &quot;interior&quot; portrait. Sontag had reminded the photographer that her mother was the first woman she knew - a statement obvious but profound; the skin-to-skin relationship between mother and child is the first connection with another being, a woman, the mother. I had mused on mother-daughter relationships often during the three long years I sat beside hospital beds and care-home armchairs, as my own mother grappled with the closing down of her life. She died a year ago: sweetly and softly, while sitting in a chair in the lounge of her residential care home just after the tea trolley has passed by. A quiet and mundane departure, as she wanted; a few minutes earlier, she&apos;d dispatched my sister, Alison, to her room to check if she needed more tights. It&apos;s perhaps too easy to interpret that as an unconscious attempt to protect her daughter from witnessing the moment. Mum needed to die; she was exhausted by the strokes and falls and leg ulcers - and what was barely acknowledged by the professionals, depression and a kind of existential angst which crushed her gregarious, optimistic personality from the day she arrived, unexpectedly, in the residential care home. Many fellow residents accepted their one-way ticket and some lived in demented denial, but others, like Mum, suffered terribly. &quot;Depression in an old person? I&apos;ve never heard of that before,&quot; laughed one of the usually helpful carers, when I suggested the reason for her newly withdrawn behaviour. One afternoon, as she dozed on her bed, the GP told Alison and me that Mum had very little time left and we needed to discuss end-of-life plans with her. I am convinced that she overheard the sentence. From then, she retreated, simply closed her eyes and shut down, lying in bed for days, reluctantly accepting sips of water and fortified drinks, but never speaking or opening her eyes. We kept watch and waited for her &quot;to go&quot;. And in the hours I spent alone with her, I studied her face, held her hand, made distracting notes, thought of photographing her, talked to her. Then, out of the blue, one morning, a carer phoned to say that she was eating Weetabix in the dining room and smiling. I decided that she&apos;d probably, unconsciously, been processing then accepting the news of her fate, on her terms, and the only way she could in such a public space was to cut out. Decisions made, she woke, bright and friendly and hungry and decided to go to the end exuding joyfulness. But the doctor then prescribed antidepressants to make sure the mood lasted, and she smiled so blissfully and was so sensually alert (even with one blind eye, two deaf ears and two semi-paralysed hands) to the pleasures of birds and colours, my latest jewellery and news from friends, that I wondered if they were trying her on ecstasy. Though still physically dependent, she&apos;d taken back control of herself. And sometimes it almost felt like she was now mothering us again. The last time I saw my mother, she was waving goodbye to me across the lounge as I left. She had asked when I would be back and I said, &quot;Two weeks&quot;- the longest gap I&apos;d left it in months, and instead of a look of disappointment, she grinned and said, &quot;Oh that&apos;s good.&quot; I bent and kissed her and she pinned me with her still dazzling blue eyes. Her stiff &quot;good&quot; arm stretched into an awkward wave as she mimed kisses to me, but, as I turned to go, she instructed me softly, &quot;Kiss me!&quot; and I turned back. &quot;I&apos;ve already kissed you, Mum, but I&apos;ll gladly kiss you again,&quot; and did, holding her hand. Ten days later, I arrived in that same lounge, four hours after her death. She was in her bedroom and I was faced by a scene I&apos;d envisioned so often, seen generically in films and read in books. I&apos;d imagined it peopled by the ones now standing around her bed - except my sister, who had found her &quot;asleep&quot; in her chair, had gone home by then for relief. Confusingly, this stage set of her room had somehow changed: my brother and sister-in-law stood mute, two of the kindest carers wept, and Mum lay partly under the covers, her hands exposed. She was wearing the sea-green dress and blue cardie embroidered with flowers that she died in, and which we decided without argument to bury her in. My mother&apos;s face resembled the one we&apos;d sat next to and stared at during the long days when we expected death: the same hollow and closed eyes, relaxed brow and folded hands. I was temporarily deceived into almost nudging her awake, but something unimaginably primal and complex in my brain had kicked in: this is the real thing, I thought, she&apos;s dead. Of course, it took only a split second in that room to know that truth, but not to really know it. Suddenly my voice took on an alien life of its own and filled the room with howls. I leant over her but felt a forcefield around her; she was in a different realm from us now, one I didn&apos;t understand. We were here, she was here, but where was she? I&apos;d missed that moment of transference I&apos;d so badly wanted to witness - her &quot;passing&quot;, but, for the first time, understood how that word is so apt. The others discreetly left the room to wait for me. In the car on the way from the station, I had checked my camera was charged. I&apos;d discussed with my friend Anne, several times in recent weeks, the fact that I wanted to photograph my mother in death. I couldn&apos;t articulate why, but our conversations gave me permission regardless. Now, sitting beside her, stroking her silky white hair, kissing her forehead, I pulled the camera out of my bag. She wouldn&apos;t have liked it; she&apos;d probably find it obscene, and certainly wouldn&apos;t have understood. But how could I have explained when I didn&apos;t know why I felt the need to do this? I kissed her forehead, moist and cool, and then, bizarrely, thought of the organic procedures of death; the internal factory that would now be working overtime to effect total shutdown. I sniffed her forehead, curious to know the smell of death but, thankfully, smelt only her hair, the smell she stored inside the hats and scarves she left behind, and which I now wear. I got off the bed, took out the camera and stood up, looking over my shoulders towards the closed door, as if about to commit an obscene act. I was nervous a carer might come in and find me in flagrante. I moved close to her, talking as I clicked, standing over her face. And then I stood up and stared at her hands: they were what I most wanted to preserve. I took one in my own, trying to warm it with my breath like I did when we&apos;d sat close together, talking. It always reminded me of calming a frightened bird. During her last years, Mum had started taking my arm to cross a road, grabbing my hand like a child, and eventually, when sitting close, letting me hold hers in my own. Her fingers were small and pointed and would have been elegant if they hadn&apos;t served years of domestic drudgery. She did housework until her last day in her own home, and in this final place, the hands grew smooth and beautiful, but increasingly useless. One day, I found her wearing nail polish and asked if she had a date; she giggled and splayed her fingers like a teenager, regarding them with detached amusement. Like Susan Sontag, and just as incongruously, she was buried with polished nails. I took the shot of her hand and threw the camera into my bag and sat down again, stroking her. But I was agitated now, I felt tainted: I&apos;d got what I wanted from her without understanding what I would do with the images, or why I wanted them. At that last sight of my mother, I remember fearing that my photographs were voyeuristic; had I behaved like a Weegee? But I shoved such thoughts from my mind and turned and kissed her goodbye for the last time.  Liebovitz had said she had to do it... &quot;It&apos;s what I do.&quot; Maybe wanting to photograph my mother was partly to defy the taboo in our culture against making death part of life. The notoriously sentimental Victorians were surprisingly unsqueamish about it. Early on, they harnessed photography to &quot;postmortem photographs&quot; of their dead children and babies, who were laid out wearing beautiful robes and surrounded by flowers, for the photographer to immortalise their short lives. Cards bearing the photograph of the child apparently sleeping were kept on mantelpieces and sent to relatives unable to make the funeral, aids to help deal with grief in a society not given to emotional expression. During the last year, I&apos;ve wondered about that need to hold on to something of my mother in death, and am now deeply comforted by having the images I shot without realising what I was doing. They are possibly more precious than the material things, and even more than the family snaps of her smiling at birthdays and weddings or chatting with her friend Kath in her beloved garden. What I possess are photographic memento mori, and as I look into her death face on my computer screen, I treasure the power of photographs to transmit a three-dimensional reality which genuinely conveys her. I can feel the textures and contours of her face and hands, their bones and scars, her history, and the silkiness of her whispy hair. Then one night, streaming through the internet while I wrote this story, I found a moving letter, written in 1870, by parishoner Flora A Windeyer to Revd John Blomfield on the death of her child: &quot;What a comfort it is to possess the image of those who are removed from our sight. We may raise an image of them in our minds but that has not the tangibility of one we can see with our bodily eyes.&quot;  Nine months after my mother&apos;s death, I walked into a gallery in Amsterdam called FOAM, and was greeted by a poster for an exhibition by the Japanese photographer Miyako Ishiuchi, intriguingly titled Mother&apos;s. A winter-sun-filled room contained large, mostly black-and-white prints of Miyako&apos;s late mother&apos;s intimate clothing and possessions, and close-ups of her skin and one breast. A detached, artful outpouring of memory, it overwhelmed me with its familiarity. Tears flowed and I was transfixed by the correspondence of her transfer of grief on to ordinary items - petticoats, bloomer knickers, lipsticks - with mine. The lacy, black underwear hung limply and transparent against the light, while the white cotton, thin-strapped vest of my mother&apos;s, held up, reveals the slight billowing of the fabric created by her breasts, like the mould for a cast of her small torso.  Back in England, I spoke to Miyako over the phone in Tokyo and through a translator. I needed to know why she made these movingly poetic images. In the background, I could hear her side of the dialogue in Japanese - a dark, sharp voice punctuated by occasional laughter. Miyako explained that she chose to photograph whatever was nearest to her mother&apos;s skin: &quot;Skin is the physical boundary between the inner world and the world itself, the first object to communicate with the outside world. I only photographed her alive skin,&quot; she said.&quot;When she died, I was in such grief because she died suddenly, that I didn&apos;t think of photographing her then.&quot; The naked breast, she revealed, was taken before her mother died so, unlike my mother, hers knew she was being photographed in this intimate way - and knew the images would be on public display. &quot;She quite understood what I was doing because I explained it to her. Before then, she was very reluctant to expose her skin, but when I asked to photograph it &apos;for a work of art&apos;, she said yes. Not because it would be a work of art but because it would be the work of her daughter.&quot; When her mother died, Miyako&apos;s instant need was to get rid of all her things, but instead she began photographing them. &quot;I was overwhelmed by the thought that a part of my mother - her undergarments - were equal to her skin. Her belongings were her. By photographing them, I wanted to objectify them, to get rid of the grief and the emotion.&quot; Several friends and I agree that we keep certain objects for the memories and stories they store, but Miyako&apos;s relationship with her mother hadn&apos;t been close, and her mother&apos;s possessions didn&apos;t evoke personal memories. But through photographing them she found she could communicate with her through them - and they now reside in a box at home. I noted how Miyako refers to the possessions she photographed as objets, elevating them to art objects, a way of detaching from them. I can&apos;t do that with the vest; I can&apos;t throw it away nor can I frame the photograph. Perhaps, with time, it will lose its potency - like the smell on the pillow where a lover had slept. My friend Krysia keeps her mother&apos;s hairband and says she cries when she wears it because she can still smell her hair on it. &quot;I don&apos;t wear it often,&quot; she says, &quot;because it could lose her smell.&quot; Miyako sees her saved items as indicative of &quot;an accumulation of time&quot;. She sees in them &quot;a decay and deterioration which matches the deceased. They spent time with my mother and I see them as representations of her lost past.&quot; In complete contrast are those friends of mine who reject inanimate mementos for objects with life and futures. My sister, for example, transplanted Mum&apos;s beloved fuschia into her own garden and was thrilled at last year&apos;s seemingly symbolic frenzy of flowers. In Italy, Krysia transplanted her mother&apos;s wild geraniums from Kent, and, in Brighton, I cosset my mother&apos;s like pets. But inanimate objects can also symbolise the future. My friend Melissa&apos;s mother left her silk neglig\u00e9e for her daughter&apos;s wedding and now it&apos;s waiting in a box for her girls&apos;. &quot;But,&quot; she confesses, &quot;when I see Sarah [her daughter] cooking us all breakfastwearing the dressing-gown my mother died in, I feel overwhelmed.&quot;  After Mum died, my sister, brother and I chose things of hers we wanted to keep. I&apos;d always loved her mossy-green Kangol beret with a small bow on the brim, and wore it to her funeral. I also keep her small brown suitcase, which I call &quot;The Room of her Own&quot;, because it contains clues to a life she rarely shared with us. Inside the lid she had written, in 1939, her maiden name and the address of her then fianc\u00e9 Sonny&apos;s family. In that year she joined the army, found freedom, and ended the engagement. Inside are her birth certificate, her army tie, Sonny&apos;s present of an autograph book containing loving epithets. The case reinvents my mother as a stranger - a single, free, adventurous woman moving around England during the war, having a fianc\u00e9 I know nothing of, and not yet aware of her future husband. Tantalisingly mysterious, it&apos;s truly her room. In my quest for stories from friends and family, I mostly heard about the potent objects which work like African fetishes for those of us left motherless. Most surprising were the two abstract mementos which carry as much - conceivably more - potency, maybe because they exist only in internal, private memories.  My school friend Sheila, whose mother was a kind presence during my school days, clings to a memory which she says is &quot;more consoling than anything I&apos;ve saved of hers in a box. Before she lost consciousness, she took my hand in both of hers and turned it round, and looked at it, and then stroked the palm. At that point, she couldn&apos;t really speak any more. When we left, I blew kisses and she raised her hand to me and blew them to me. She never opened her eyes to me again. Like your mother,&quot; she added, &quot;she wasn&apos;t able to be emotionally demonstrative; she&apos;d never done that to me before. I think it was a very generous way of saying goodbye.&quot; My sister-in-law, Jeanette, who doesn&apos;t easily talk at an emotional level, sent me an email which brought me to helpless tears. &quot;I couldn&apos;t really find any material things that really mean much about my life with my mother,&quot; she wrote, &quot;but what I do have is her last breath. At that moment, I felt how her life and mine were one, and why she was the person she was, how she felt, how she hurt and how she so loved life. I realised in that last moment what immortality really was and my mother gave me that.&quot; I set out to write this story partly because I was moved and inspired by Annie Leibovitz&apos;s photographs of her dead lover, and partly after the surprise discovery of Miyako Ishiuchi&apos;s work. Both these discoveries have helped me reconsider my own exploitation of photography and objects intimate with my mother as part of the process of grieving, and also made me curious about how women close to me have handled the loss of their mothers.  I wore my mum&apos;s hat today."}, {"sentences": ["I bought them in Tokyo - I often travel there for work."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-16T00:01:00Z", "title": "The close-up: Elizabeth Lau, fashion designer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/16/close-up-fashion-elizabeth-lau", "article": "   Elizabeth Lau. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/Guardian    Are you wearing one of your own designs? Yes, I am, I get to wear them first. The belt doesn&apos;t come with the dress - I don&apos;t remember where it was from. I&apos;ve had it for so long, which is why it&apos;s a little bit tatty. The leggings are from Topshop; the shoes are from Helmut Lang and are about 10 years old. When I first bought them, everyone thought I was a bit strange because they look a bit punky, but they are really in now. Describe your style. I am a magpie and I don&apos;t like doing one whole look. I used to buy real statement pieces in the past, but when I took them home I realised that I didn&apos;t have anything else that matched them in my wardrobe. Now I end up wearing a lot of my own designs.  Tell me about your accessories. The cuff is from a car boot sale and the bracelet is by a jewellery designer friend - I bought it wholesale price. The ice-cream earrings that I am wearing are not a pair; I always wear mismatched earrings. I bought them in Tokyo - I often travel there for work. Have you always worn your hair long? For the last 10 years I have. As a child I always had a bob. I&apos;m 33 now but my hair is usually similar to this because it&apos;s really straight, so I have to work with its texture. On what occasion did you look your best? On my wedding day. I wore one of my own designs but I had it made up in couture lace - I got it wholesale price, so it wasn&apos;t super-expensive. It was a really simple sundress shape because we got married on a beach. Can people tell that you are a designer because of the way you dress? No. When I worked in Hong Kong, people would say that I didn&apos;t look like a designer because there is a stereotypical designer look there - all black with thick-rimmed glasses. But here people in the fashion industry dress individually, so I don&apos;t think there is a particular dress code. Have you ever been misjudged because of something you&apos;ve worn? I&apos;ve had people think that I am really young and refuse to sell me alcohol. Recently, when Marks &amp; Spencer had a &quot;dinner for a tenner&quot; offer, I was asked for ID before I could buy the wine and I didn&apos;t have any on me. At the time I got annoyed, but when I got home, I was pleased. Is shopping too much like work for you, or is it still pleasurable? It is a little bit like work but I do still enjoy it. I love window-shopping - designing every day, I can get bored of looking at my own clothes. I am quite sensible about shopping - if I do spend more money it will be on a bag or shoes that I will wear a lot. What is the most expensive thing you have ever bought? A pair of YSL boots for \u00a3480. I had seen them in a department store loads of times. I went home and thought about it, then went back and bought them. That was five years ago, but I still wear them. What about your posh watch. Is it a Rolex? Yes. It was a present when I was at art school. We had a foreign princess in our class and she bought one each for the whole class at Christmas. I can&apos;t tell you who she is. There were about 20 of us.  The teachers got ones with diamonds in. It sounds so OTT that I am embarrassed to tell people. I was totally gobsmacked.

Nakagawa \u2013 who is known to enjoy a drink \u2013 denied he was drunk when he addressed the Japanese press on Saturday. He instead blamed his bumbling and at times incomprehensible performance on an overdose of cold medicine. Despite his denials, those who have seen footage of the press conference, repeated all day on Japanese TV, agree he had the glassy eyes and sweaty complexion of a man who had enjoyed a few glasses of Chianti too many courtesy of his Italian hosts. &quot;It is true that I didn&apos;t conduct myself properly, and I feel I must set the record straight,&quot; the 55-year-old Nakagawa told reporters in Tokyo. He admitted drinking on the flight from Tokyo to Rome on Friday, but insisted he had no more than a sip of wine at an official lunch the following day. &quot;I did not drink a glassful,&quot; he said. &quot;I\u00a0had a cold. Honestly, the cold medicine kicked in too much,&quot; he added, before sniffing loudly to prove his point. Early today, Nakagawa, announced he would step down because of health problems but said he will stay on until parliament approves a supplementary budget, probably in April. &quot;I apologise for causing such a big fuss,&quot; Nakagawa said. &quot;I plan to submit a formal resignation as soon the budget and related legislation are passed by the lower house.&quot; Failure to act could have irreparably harmed Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is battling record low poll ratings and must call an election by the autumn. Opposition leaders had also called for \u00adNakagawa&apos;s immediate dismissal. &quot;It is embarrassing,&quot; Yukio Hatoyama, the secretary general of the Democratic party of Japan, said. &quot;This has sent the wrong message to the entire world, and he should be sacked immediately. He has damaged the national interest.&quot; Nakagawa&apos;s appearance in Rome was punctuated by long pauses, garbled sentences and an apparently overwhelming desire for 40 winks. &quot;The G7 meetings ... which were officially held today ... started last night,&quot; he told bemused members of the Japanese press corps. &quot;Something like a joint statement was issued,&quot; he added, before making a mess of a question about monetary policy that had been directed at a visibly dismayed Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa. &quot;Interest rates, er, set by the Bank of Japan, are going up from zero to 0.25%,&quot; he said. In fact, the bank lowered rates to 0.1% in December. Reports said Nakagawa had nodded off during a conference with G7 colleagues and appeared well refreshed during talks with the Russian finance minister, Alexei Kudrin. The chief cabinet secretary, Takeo Kawamura, insisted Nakagawa had not been drunk. &quot;He told me he had caught a cold because of his busy schedule ahead of the G7 meeting, so I told him to take better care of himself,&quot; he said. But other Liberal Democratic party colleagues hinted that the hapless finance minister had been under the influence of more than cold medicine. &quot;He loves to drink, so I once told him to be careful about his drinking,&quot; Yoshio Mori, a former prime minister, said in a TV interview. In Nagatacho, the heart of Japanese political power, tales abound of Nakagawa&apos;s capacity for alcohol. He was criticised for being drunk during the 2000 election campaign, and derided for talking about &quot;expenditure&quot; when he meant &quot;revenue&quot; in an address to parliament last month. His conduct at the G7 meeting could not have come at a worse time for Aso, whose poor handling of the economic crisis has seen his personal approval ratings sink to below 10%. The size of the task facing Japan was underlined today when new figures showed its economy had shrunk at the fastest rate since the 1974 oil shock and was heading for its deepest recession since the end of the war."}, {"sentences": ["At Food One supermarket in Fujisawa, a commuter town south of Tokyo, shoppers queue along the aisles waiting to unload baskets piled high with groceries.", "&quot;One thing we&apos;ve learned over the past six months is that just because things are bad doesn&apos;t mean they can&apos;t get any worse,&quot; says Richard Jerram, chief Japan economist at Macquarie Securities In Tokyo."], "tags": ["Global recession", "Japan", "Global economy", "Currencies", "International trade", "Business", "World news", "Financial crisis", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-16T15:44:56Z", "title": "Japan-recession", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/16/japanese-economy", "article": "Judging by the fevered spending spree under way at one suburban Japanese mall over the weekend, it would be easy to think that the world&apos;s second biggest economy is the victim of a phantom recession. At Food One supermarket in Fujisawa, a commuter town south of Tokyo, shoppers queue along the aisles waiting to unload baskets piled high with groceries. At nearby Uniqlo, the clothing retailer&apos;s Spring collection flies off the shelves; McDonald&apos;s employees struggle to keep up with orders for double quarter pounders with cheese.But this flurry of activity conceals a deep-seated malaise. Japan&apos;s shoppers are spending, but only on the cheapest necessities. The country&apos;s usually prodigious consumers are saving for a rainy day now that, after several years of growth, Japan is careering towards the deepest recession in its postwar history. That grim reality was underlined today with the news that the economy shrank 3.3% from October to December last year, its worst performance since the oil crisis of 1974. Many economists now expect it to remain in the doldrums until 2010. Japan&apos;s GDP has fallen for three quarters in a row at an annualised rate of 12.7%, the decline in Japanese GDP was three times that of the US during the same quarter. The US contracted by 1% during the same quarter and the eurozone by 1.5%. Described somewhat nonchalantly as the &quot;Lehman shokku&quot; (or shock) only a few months ago, the global crisis has left the Japanese confronting an uncomfortable truth: that everyone is an investment banker now. The Nikkei stock market average has shed 32% since September and exports are in the deep freeze. In December unemployment rose to 3.9%, its sharpest rise for 40 years, household sentiment is near a 26-year low while exporters, rocked by plunging global demand, have slashed jobs and production targets. Wholesale prices fell 0.2% in the year to January \u2013 their first drop for five years. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of the economy, fell 0.4% between October and December, and the Bank of Japan [BoJ] is warning of a two-year battle with deflation. Bankruptcies are up 16% from last year, with total debts among failed firms reaching \u00a5839bn (\u00a36.4bn). Those that have survived the onslaught are predicting an 83% fall in profits this year and a slew of redundancies: Nissan, Panasonic, Pioneer and NEC have announced a combined 65,000 job cuts in the past month alone. &quot;There is no doubt that this is the worst economic crisis of the postwar era,&quot; the economic and fiscal policy minister, Kaoru Yosano, said yesterday, adding that the collapse of car, machinery and IT exports had &quot;battered&quot; the economy. Though its banks are in comparatively good shape after an enforced house-cleaning earlier this decade, Japan&apos;s huge industrial base has left it hopelessly exposed to the fallout from the US financial crisis. While Japan&apos;s leaders boast that their country will be the first to emerge into the post-recession sunlight, it is likely to fall longer and harder than any of the G7 countries except Britain, according to the International Monetary Fund. The BoJ&apos;s chief economist, Kazuo Momma, warned that, even after last quarter&apos;s miserable performance, &quot;We have to consider the possibility that there could be an even greater decline between January and March.&quot; Some analysts share his pessimism. &quot;One thing we&apos;ve learned over the past six months is that just because things are bad doesn&apos;t mean they can&apos;t get any worse,&quot; says Richard Jerram, chief Japan economist at Macquarie Securities In Tokyo. &quot;The Japanese consumer has gone into a state of panic, and people have decided that they want to avoid any major expenditure. There has been a sentiment shock.&quot; Having seen how Japan&apos;s refusal to heed the warnings 20 years ago led to a &quot;lost decade&quot; of stagnation, the US response has been quick by comparison. But in a week when the Congress passed a $789bn (\u00a3550bn) stimulus package, Japan&apos;s response has been rendered impotent by political gridlock and poor leadership. Even as a resurgent opposition stalls the passage of an existing \u00a510tn stimulus package, the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso, is mulling \u00a520tn in additional spending. Few believe the measures, including a one-off handout of \u00a512,000 for each \u00adcitizen, will kick-start flat consumer spending or bring Aso the boost he needs before a general election that must be held by September. Monetary measures have proved just as ineffective, despite a return to ultra-low interest rates and the BoJ&apos;s offer to buy up corporate debt and shares held by banks to ease the credit flow to vulnerable companies. Even Yosano appeared to concede that the government had run out of responses to the crisis. &quot;The situation is rapidly changing, due to factors beyond the Japanese government&apos;s control,&quot; he said. Jerram agrees. &quot;The government will work within all of the old reference points,&quot; he said, &quot;and whatever it decides to do will probably be insufficient and way too late. The government is in a hole but it&apos;s not prepared to consider anything wild and ambitious. &quot;It is just sitting tight and waiting for the situation in the US to improve. That is not economic policy it is economic fatalism. And it is a pretty bad way to run an economy. Japan needs to think the unthinkable but this is not a system that lends itself to change.&quot; On top of the collapse in demand for exports, Japan&apos;s other great nemesis is the inexorable rise of the yen against other major currencies. Despite exporters&apos; calls for intervention to rein in the yen, the finance \u00administer, Shoichi Nakagawa, did not raise the issue with other G7 leaders in Rome last weekend, confining himself to the safe ground of condemning the &quot;absolute evil&quot; of protectionism. But resistance to foreign exchange intervention \u2013 flooding the money \u00admarkets with yen \u2013 may crumble if, as many experts believe, the dollar sinks much further. &quot;It is hard to tell when intervention will begin, but any development that takes the yen close to the 80-85 mark against the dollar before the end of this fiscal year will trigger immediate action,&quot; says Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Japan Barclays Capital. &quot;As long as the issue is the quantity of yen in the money markets and not interest rates, then it&apos;s the finance ministry&apos;s duty to act.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Clinton will meet families of several Japanese nationals who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 80s, an issue Tokyo views with more urgency than even the communist state&apos;s nuclear ambitions.", "Clinton&apos;s arrival in Tokyo came hours after Japan reported its economy had shrunk in the last quarter at its fastest rate since the 1974 oil shock.", "&quot;The global economic crisis is the backdrop against which this visit takes place,&quot; she told reporters en route to \u00adTokyo, where she will meet the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso and the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone."], "tags": ["US news", "Japan", "China", "World news", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Hillary Clinton", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-16T19:26:00Z", "title": "Clinton issues warning on North Korea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/16/clinton-japan-visit", "article": "Hillary Clinton arrived in Asia on her first overseas trip as US secretary of state today as North Korea prepared to test a ballistic missile which is believed to have sufficient range to reach US territory. In a move that looked set to heighten rather than defuse tensions between the two countries, the Pyongyang regime announced it would launch a missile, widely though to to be the Taepodong-2, from a base on its east coast. Before leaving Washington on Sunday, Clinton had said the United States is willing to normalise ties with North Korea and help rebuild its economy if it abandons its nuclear weapons. On the first day of her trip, which began in Japan today, Clinton said: &quot;My goal is the denuclearisation of North Korea and that means a verifiably complete accounting of whatever programmes they had and the removal of reprocessed plutonium.&quot; Later, she warned North Korea against following through on a threatened missile launch, saying it would damage its prospects for improved relations with the United States and the world. Without prompting, she told reporters at a joint news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone that such a move would jeopardise the Obama administration&apos;s willingness to work for better ties with Pyongyang. &quot;The possible missile launch that North Korea is talking about would be very unhelpful in moving our relationship forward,&quot; she said, adding that if Pyongyang wants to end its isolation it also has to fulfill unmet denuclearization pledges made during the Bush administration. &quot;The decision as to whether North Korea will cooperate in the six-party talks, end provocative language and actions is up to them and we are watching very closely,&quot; Clinton said, referring to the six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons. &quot;If North Korea abides by the obligations it has already entered into and verifiably and completely eliminates its nuclear program, then there will be a reciprocal response certainly from the United States,&quot; she said. &quot;It is truly up to the North Koreans.&quot; Analysts and government officials in the region have feared that North Korea may launch a long-range missile to help make its nuclear program a top foreign policy issue for President Barack Obama. North Korea has also threatened a naval clash with South Korea on their disputed western sea border. &quot;One will come to know later what will be launched,&quot; the North&apos;s state-run news agency, KCNA, said, referring to recent news reports in the region that North Korean engineers have been assembling the 105ft rocket. By visiting Asia first, Clinton has broken with a long tradition among new secretaries of state of visiting Europe or the Middle East first, a move seen as an acknowledgement of China&apos;s growing status as an economic and military power. Part of her visit to Japan is intended to reassure her hosts that Japan will not be bypassed diplomatically as the Obama attempts to win Chinese co-operation on trade, the environment and regional security. Clinton will meet families of several Japanese nationals who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 80s, an issue Tokyo views with more urgency than even the communist state&apos;s nuclear ambitions. The US angered Japan last year by removing North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism without consulting its ally. Japan has made resolving the abduction a part of any nuclear deal. Clinton&apos;s arrival in Tokyo came hours after Japan reported its economy had shrunk in the last quarter at its fastest rate since the 1974 oil shock. &quot;The global economic crisis is the backdrop against which this visit takes place,&quot; she told reporters en route to \u00adTokyo, where she will meet the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso and the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone. In a sign of Aso&apos;s precarious grip on power, Clinton will also hold brief talks with the leader of the main opposition party, Ichiro Ozawa. A year after her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, apologised for crimes committed by US military personnel in Japan, Clinton will sign a deal to relocate 8,000 marines from the southern island of Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam. But she is also expected to reiterate Washington&apos;s commitment to its military alliances with Japan and South Korea, which together host tens of thousands of US troops. &quot;We have and continue to support a policy of extended deterrence that provides protection as part of our alliance with Japan,&quot; Clinton said last week. &quot;It remains as strong as it has ever been, we are absolutely committed to it.&quot; While participating in a purification rite and welcoming ceremony at a Shinto shrine to Emperor Meiji today, she said its message of &quot;balance and harmony&quot; would set the tone for the Obama administration&apos;s foreign policy, especially in tough economic times. &quot;It&apos;s not only a good concept for religious shrines, it&apos;s a good concept for America&apos;s role in the world,&quot; she told about 200 embassy employees afterward. &quot;We need to be looking to create more balance, more harmony. We&apos;re going to reaching out to friends and allies like our hosts here in Japan.&quot; Clinton, who said last year that &quot;our relationship with China will be the most important bilateral relationship in the world this century,&quot; faces a potentially difficult meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing. The US hopes to persuade China, the world&apos;s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, to support new attempts to cut carbon emissions, and to take a lead in restructuring the global financial system. The US is China&apos;s biggest export market and China is the largest holder of US treasury bonds.

Yesterday, Japan reported its economy had shrunk in the last quarter at its fastest rate since the 1974 oil shock and was heading for its deepest recession since the war. Clinton called for coordinated efforts to overcome the global economic crisis. &quot;As the first and second economies in the world we understand those responsibilities,&quot; she said, adding that countries should also &quot;ensure our economies work for our own citizens&quot;. Aso, whose approval ratings are the second lowest of any Japanese leader, was dealt another blow today when his finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, said he would resign after giving a press conference in Rome at the weekend while apparently drunk. Nakagawa, who faced censure motions in parliament over his embarrassing performance, insisted he had been suffering the effects of a large dose of cold medicine mixed with a &quot;sip&quot; of wine. Earlier, Clinton and Nakasone signed an agreement to transfer 8,000 US marines based on the southern island of Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014. The deal is intended to reduce the military footprint on Okinawa, home to the bulk of US bases in Japan.

Asian Kung-Fu Generation Not for nothing were Ajikan (as they&apos;re known for short) chosen to tour with Weezer when they came to Japan late last year; they are the US rockers&apos; Asian counterpart. Melodic guitar pop infused with the angst and emotion of a teenager experiencing their first taste of unrequited love, they echo Cuomo and co right down to lead singer Masafumi Goto&apos;s geekier-than-thou glasses. The only difference is that where Weezer seem to be getting progressively worse, Ajikan just keep getting better and better. * Tuck in!"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s true that we are pursuing several potential buyers,&quot; the Honda spokesman, Hiroyuki Murase, said in Tokyo, although he declined to name interested parties."], "tags": ["Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport", "Virgin Group", "Richard Branson"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-19T21:18:26Z", "title": "Motor racing: Richard Branson's rescue bid for the Honda formula one team is still in the balance", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/19/honda-motor-racing-formula-one", "article": "Honda&apos;s formula one team could be closed within a couple of weeks unless negotiations to find a buyer are completed within days. That was the stark warning from the Japanese car manufacturer yesterday as speculation continued over whether Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin group might make a bid for the Brackley-based team, thus saving 700 jobs there and guaranteeing the formula one futures of Jenson Button and Bruno Senna. &quot;It&apos;s true that we are pursuing several potential buyers,&quot; the Honda spokesman, Hiroyuki Murase, said in Tokyo, although he declined to name interested parties. &quot;But the team may still have to be disbanded if the negotiations fail.&quot; Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial right holder, said that he is keen for Branson to make a bid. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to Richard&apos;s people about it. He would love to do it,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d like it very much. It would be super. We&apos;re working to try to make it happen.&quot; However, Ecclestone added that the team&apos;s future is on a knife edge. &quot;I have no idea which way it will go. I wouldn&apos;t bet on it either way,&quot; he said. Honda decided to put its underperforming team up for sale at the start of December as a result of the global economic recession. The company, which has a major UK manufacturing plant in Swindon, felt it could no longer justify the expense at a time it was putting a large proportion of its global labour force on short-time working. It has long been understood that Honda would be prepared to make a significant contribution to the team&apos;s running costs in 2009 should any buyer be prepared to take it off their hands, reasoning that this would be a cheaper means of winding it down than funding the redundancy bill for the workforce. Honda withdrew its own V8 formula one engines from the Brackley premises in Northamptonshire within days of announcing it would be withdrawing from formula one. There was never any prospect of the company permitting any buyer to use them, but Mercedes-Benz has stepped forward and said it will lease engines on a commercial basis to any new owner who saves the team. The final deadline falls early next week. There might be a couple of days&apos; grace if developments are moving in a positive direction, but any further delays would make it almost impossible for the team to make the first grand prix of the season, in Australia on 29 March."}, {"sentences": ["It also leaves out Elizabeth Taylor (born and raised in London, albeit with American parents); plus the sisters Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland, who took great pride in their English heritage and their English voice and manners, but were actually born in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Oscars", "Danny Boyle", "Kate Winslet", "Film", "Awards and prizes", "Culture", "Oscars 2009", "John Schlesinger"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-20T00:01:00Z", "title": "David Thomson on why the Oscars have always been in love with Britain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/20/oscars-britain-kate-winslet-olivier-kingsley-christie-day-lewis-lean-mirren-mendes", "article": "When it comes to patriotic flag-waving and Oscar time, Slumdog Millionaire is as British as its young male star, Dev Patel, who hadn&apos;t been to India until the actual shooting of the movie. If Danny Boyle&apos;s film does win the best picture Oscar on Sunday night, it will join this list of British winners: Hamlet (as played by Laurence Olivier); The Bridge on the River Kwai (the subject, the director and most of the actors were British - only the money was American); Lawrence of Arabia (another binational project); Tom Jones; A Man for All Seasons (American money again, but British nobility); Oliver!; Chariots of Fire; Gandhi; The English Patient; and Shakespeare in Love. Eleven winners since 1927-8 begins to tell the story - that Oscar is an Anglophile and always has been. Indeed, the pattern is all the more striking if you look at the best actor category, where British actors have won in American pictures. The roll of honour there is golden, from George Arliss in Disraeli and Charles Laughton in The Private Life of Henry VIII to Daniel Day-Lewis for My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood. That&apos;s 16 victories, to which we ought to add the roster of British actors who received honorary Oscars when the Academy realised belatedly that they had been forgotten: Bob Hope (come on - he was born in Eltham!); Jon Whitely (for his juvenile performance in The Little Kidnappers); Stan Laurel; someone named Cary Grant; Charles Chaplin; Olivier (&quot;for the full body of his work&quot;); Guinness (again); Peter O&apos;Toole. If Richard Burton had lived, surely he would have been added to that list - he was nominated and lost seven times, once as supporting actor and six times as a lead. Go to the category of best actress and there are another 11 wins starting with Vivien Leigh in Gone With the Wind, and finishing with Helen Mirren in The Queen. (Though there&apos;s no Judi Dench: four times nominated as leading actress, she has had only one win - in support.) It also leaves out Elizabeth Taylor (born and raised in London, albeit with American parents); plus the sisters Joan Fontaine and Olivia de Havilland, who took great pride in their English heritage and their English voice and manners, but were actually born in Tokyo. And don&apos;t forget the honorary Oscar for Deborah Kerr, who was nominated six times without winning. Add in the fact that most Americans believe Audrey Hepburn was British.  British supporting actors have won that Oscar 12 times since 1936. For supporting actresses, the number is 10. And it doesn&apos;t stop there. If we look at directors, there are 10 more winners, including David Lean for Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia, Tony Richardson for Tom Jones and John Schlesinger for Midnight Cowboy. And in this category we have to leave space for the honorary Oscar to Alfred Hitchcock (not even nominated for Notorious, Vertigo or North by Northwest!). What does all this mean? Well, first of all, it means the legend of meagre opportunities for film-making in Britain has not really deterred Britons from making movies. You can argue that this has made for a lack of movies on &quot;British&quot; subjects over the years, but in truth (and especially if one includes the force of television), then Britain has enjoyed a far more searching study of itself on screen than has America. Time and again British films on the small and large screen have unpeeled British realities, with pain, insight and criticism. America lacks that perspective because its movie output has preferred to celebrate the American legend, a thing that is now so far from the truth as to begin to explain the abyss opening up at the feet of Americans. Two British directors are nominated this year and Sam Mendes could easily have been a third with Revolutionary Road - a near-classic American novel that no American director was ever able to get mounted. And don&apos;t forget that my list below includes nothing for Michael Powell (though The Red Shoes was nominated for best picture), for Robert Hamer (Kind Hearts and Coronets got no nominations) or for Terence Davies. Still, it seems churlish for the British to complain too much, or to fail to notice that there is a British Society within the Academy just as much as Hollywood itself has always been wide open to British talent, charm and society. When the American picture business dreamed up the idea of an Academy - to restore prestige in a time of many scandals and to stave off trade union interference - they were not thinking on the lines of a Greek academy so much as a British club. That is why once upon a time, and still today, in attitudes to acting the Academy retains enormous faith in British eloquence, stylish manners and the overall assumption that sounding British is a measure of class or villainy. That approach took a beating from the overall intrusion of American voices, uncouthness and naturalism that came with the Actors Studio in the late 1940s. There is a stronger American idiom in acting these days (Sean Penn, Johnny Depp, Denzel Washington, Tommy Lee Jones). But in the days when the Academy was founded (roughly at the coming of sound) acting British was a sign of refinement and value. That&apos;s what helped Ronald Colman and Cary Grant to their success. That&apos;s why the De Havilland sisters liked to pass as English. And it&apos;s part of the Wasp-like tone that attached to Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis and even Meryl Streep, to say nothing of stock players who either were English or took pains to have an English style: Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, Sydney Greenstreet, George Sanders. There&apos;s still one more area in which Britain has come to have a fair share at the Oscars, and this marks a major shift in film-making. In the first 20 or so years of Oscar, the craft awards (everything from writing to editing) were monopolised by Hollywood professionals. A breakthrough in that respect occurred at the end of the second world war when British directors of photography suddenly began to pick up prizes. The look of the David Lean Dickens films, and of the movies made by Powell and Emeric Pressburger led the way. Jack Cardiff won the Oscar for colour cinematography on Black Narcissus in 1947 and in the same year Guy Green took the black-and-white prize for Lean&apos;s Great Expectations. That was the beginning of a surge in recognition: Freddie Francis won for Sons and Lovers and Freddie Young for Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. There could be another climax in that trend this year. Roger Deakins is now regarded as one of the top cinematographers in the world. He has eight nominations - not bad for a cameraman born in Torquay two years after Cardiff and Green won their Oscars. I could tell similar stories in most of the other crafts. Since 1945, the Brits have dominated the screenwriting awards. In the 10 writing nominations this year, five go to Brits. The lesson is clear: you can&apos;t make a great American movie without hiring British.

You realise what it&apos;s like to come from a poor country, which for most British people is a new experience and one we had better get used to. When I first went to Japan, I noticed how on the Tokyo subway people would see there was an empty seat next to me, then veer away and stand instead. It might have been just me, but many Japanese people feel we are in some ways inferior to them, and worse, we stink, owing to our consumption of dairy products. It&apos;s a form of racism, and it&apos;s a very useful revelation when it&apos;s applied to us whites. In the same way, in Switzerland you realise you just can&apos;t afford things or, if you want to keep up appearances, you have to do it in a cautious, sparing fashion. Thanks to the collapse in the pound, basic foods cost twice what we pay.  This week we were told that we had the costliest train fares in Europe, yet in Switzerland I handed over more than \u00a313 for a 12-mile each way return ticket. Even Richard Branson hasn&apos;t dared try that (though frequent travellers in Switzerland can buy, for a hefty sum, a pass that gives them half-price travel.) \u2022 My ticket was to Gstaad (you pronounce it &apos;Shtard, with just a tiny pause before the &quot;s&quot;, like an undetectable glottal stop). I&apos;d been asked to meet pupils at Le Rosey, one of those fabulously expensive chalet schools, where the principal, Rob Gray, is an Englishman and a Guardian reader. I have never been anywhere - including Bond Street, the richest parts of Manhattan, Palm Beach - where so much wealth seems to hang in the air, like the mist and snow. It looks sensational (apart from the breathtakingly vulgar Palace hotel, which is perched high over the town, like Cinderella&apos;s castle in Disneyland).  We tend to think of Swiss chalets as being like something out of Heidi, small, cosy and basic. In Gstaad they have chalets literally as big as stately homes, on four or five storeys, containing swimming pools, gyms, and vast reception rooms. The biggest, occupied by film stars, royalty and a certain type of entrepreneur, can cost \u00a330m. The town has its own airstrip, which means that the ultra-rich are more likely to be stopped from travelling by the weather; nothing ever holds up the trains on Swiss railways. I walked down the main drag, lined with incredibly expensive shops and restaurants charging for a starter a sum that would buy you a three-course lunch in the West End of London these days. The freezing cold of the morning had been replaced by slightly milder weather, so the locals walked with their minks open and flapping, like Tyneside girls on a Friday night out. Rob kindly took a group of us to the Park, the second priciest hotel and more tasteful than the Palace. Here a steak cost \u00a339, garnished with a little spinach, though chips were extra. \u2022 If you have that system on your car CD/radio that interrupts to bring you local traffic reports, you&apos;ll know how infuriating it is when - having imparted the news about bottlenecks on the motorway or a burst water main - it doesn&apos;t go back to your CD or the station you were listening to. Actually, you can usually return to Radio 4 or whatever by punching a button, but if it&apos;s a CD you have to grind your teeth while listening to some maniac blather on.  &quot;We&apos;re back, with the big, big sound of Radio Borchester, and this is Steve Bumphrey bringing you the big, big hits and all your latest news. So, Coldplay didn&apos;t win anything at the Brits! Huh? What was that all about? Sorry, boys, but at Radio Borchester we&apos;re right behind you, so here&apos;s your latest big, big hit! And stay tuned for news of Borchester flower show, brought to you by the lovely Tracey! Whey-hey!&quot; You feel inclined to stop the car and hurl the thing out. The other day I met a friend of a friend who works in local radio and she told me that the technology varies. But in some stations, the presenter has to push a fader to send you back to what you were listening to, and the suspicion is that some don&apos;t bother.  Their ego is so huge (usually in inverse proportion to the size of the audience) that they think we&apos;d prefer to listen to them. And some of them must have that sneaking hope that one day the controller of Radio 1, or the boss of Capital, will hear and say, &quot;heavens, he&apos;s brilliant, let&apos;s find his name and see if we can sign him ... &quot; \u2022 Fresh proof that much environmentalism is fundamentally religious, the equivalent of taking a tin of beans to Harvest Festival in the hope of ending world hunger or, as David Mackay puts it in his new book Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air, like baling out the Titanic with a teaspoon. For instance, &quot;switching off your phone charger for a day is used up in one second of car driving&quot;. Switching it off for a year saves the energy it takes to run a single hot bath.  Obviously, having a solar panel to run your toaster or separating the green glass from the brown is absurd when the Chinese are still building new coal-fired power stations. It is simply a gesture of piety to the green gods.  The cathedrals of this new religion are wind turbines. Like thousands of distressed people throughout the country, George Kelsall, of Littleborough, Lancashire, is fighting against the threat of these pointless monstrosities: a company wants to build a dozen, each 410ft high, on the open moors between his town, Rochdale, and Todmorden. The public inquiry opened this week. We must all wish his campaign luck. \u2022 New style of false modesty in round robin letters. This from the West Country: &quot;We&apos;re not going to boast about Sarah&apos;s A-level results, but we&apos;ll leave you to guess.

He had come to teach English as a foreign language, but he did not know a word of Japanese. He was 27.  For the first year, he did nothing but teach during the day and write at night. He&apos;d finished a book before, the &quot;great Manchester student novel&quot;, when he had been at the polytechnic there, but it had been rejected by every publisher in The Writers&apos; and Artists&apos; Yearbook (not just rejected; he got letters that said: &quot;Please do not send us anything again&quot;). He&apos;d given up for a while, tried a few scripts that did not get anywhere, been on the dole. John Major did for him in England. 1992 - it seemed like a good time to get out. He went first to Istanbul for a couple of years, teaching, because it was cheap and you only needed a degree.  By the time he took the job in Tokyo, he says, he was writing mostly out of frustration and entirely for himself; he therefore wrote about what he knew: West Yorkshire, where he grew up. He was a devoted reader of two kinds of novel: the narcotic American crime books of James Ellroy and the blunt factory realism of Alan Sillitoe and Stan Barstow (who came from his hometown of Ossett). That first book, Nineteen Seventy Four, dark with child murder and police corruption, full of Saturday Night and Sunday Morning grit, conceived in Tokyo, was intended as a curious hybrid, what you might call &quot;Dewsbury noir&quot;.  At the time, Peace didn&apos;t fancy any more rejection letters but eventually, on a visit, his dad - always his best reader - encouraged him to send it out. He found an agent in Tokyo and a publisher in London and for a long while afterwards only ever looked back - three more Yorkshire novels followed in succession, making up the Red Riding quartet, haunted by the story of the Ripper. After that, a novel about the miners&apos; strike, GB84, and another, &quot;for light relief&quot;, about Brian Clough and his 44 days as manager of Leeds, The Damned Utd, which became a wonderful word-of-mouth bestseller.  All that industry in exile is now coming even more fully to life back at home. 2009 threatens to be Peace&apos;s year. Next month, Channel 4 is headlining with Red Riding, a trilogy of films based on the early Yorkshire books, starring Sean Bean. A perfectly pitched film of The Damned Utd follows, written by Peter Morgan (of The Queen) and featuring another uncanny piece of impressionism by Michael Sheen, this time as Brian Clough (&quot;Now then, young man...&apos;). In August, Peace will publish the second of his crime novels about his adoptive city after the war, sequel to the acclaimed Tokyo Year Zero. He is, suddenly, somewhat to his surprise and amusement, a multimedia event. I meet him on a crossroads near his office in Bunkyo, a strangely Francophile corner of the city, all low-rise housing, patissiers, prix fixe menus, sushi cafes and as many bikes as cars. Peace has not gone native. He wears the big, black overcoat and Yorkshire vowels of his youth. In his office - neat, Tokyo-cramped, piled high with books and CDs - we take off our English boots, put on Japanese slippers, drink tea and talk about Premier League football and Tokyo politics, about Harold Wilson and Noh drama, about recessions and reconstructions and crimes that won&apos;t go away - the strange mix of influences that have made up his writing life. There is an awful lot of estrangement in Peace&apos;s books. I wonder, to start with, if he feels any more at home here than he did when he arrived? &quot;It comes and goes really,&quot; he says, &quot;that sense of home. And I think it is more to do with me than with the place. I have a Japanese wife now and two children here, but I wouldn&apos;t say I thought of it as home and, to be perfectly honest, we are currently thinking of moving - to bankrupt Britain.&quot; He hadn&apos;t foreseen that. When he felt he had got Yorkshire out of his system as a writer, after Cloughie, he embarked on a trilogy of Tokyo books partly, he says, in an effort finally to locate himself here. He is pretty fluent in the spoken language, but he does not read or write it well. He thought that by doing all the research some of those barriers might come down; in a sense, though, he feels the two books he has now written have pushed him further away. It&apos;s like that clich\u00e9: we spend the first 40 years of our lives trying to escape from where we started out and the next 40 trying to get back there.  &quot;What fills me with horror lately,&quot; he says, suddenly, &quot;is the thought of growing old and dying in a Japanese hospital. In a way, because I am writing here and writing in English, I feel more disconnect than ever. When I first came, I was teaching and meeting Japanese people every day. Now, apart from my wife and my mother-in-law, I don&apos;t necessarily do that. I have Japanese friends, but not that many.&quot; Some of these anxieties seem embedded in Peace&apos;s new novel, Tokyo Occupied City, which I have read in manuscript. Like Tokyo Year Zero, it is concerned with a true crime that occurred in the years immediately after the Second World War, in the rubble of defeat - in this case the fatal poisoning of the employees of a bank during a robbery. Nearly 60 years on, it is a crime that continues to divide opinion in Japan; the man who was convicted of it, an artist named Hirasawa, was never executed and after 19 appeals his family are still fighting to clear his name. Like all Peace&apos;s books, though, the crime itself is really an occasion for getting under the skin of the past, for examining the extreme psychology of a particular time and place. He is, you might say - though not to him - a Blairite novelist: tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.  His novels are always claustrophobic places; they put you in the heads of characters - whether detectives, journalists or football managers - visited by nightmares, undone by doubt and despair. He works by repetition and obsession, hammering home fears. Tokyo Occupied City, told in 12 overlapping voices, begins, pointedly, in the head of a writer. &quot;In the Occupied City,&quot; it starts, &quot;you are a writer and you are running. In the wintertime, papers in your arms, through this January night, down these Tokyo streets, you are running from the scene of the crime; from the snow and from the mud, from the bank and from the bodies; running from the scene of the crime and from the words of the book; words that first enticed and entranced you, then deceived and defeated you, and now have left you in-snared and in-prisoned.&quot; It sounds, I suggest, a bit like autobiography ...  &quot;The thing is,&quot; he says, &quot;in an earlier draft, that voice was a particular Japanese writer, a character, but I changed it. My editor said he preferred it how it was: &apos;People are just going to think it is you now.&apos; But I said, &apos;Well - it is me.&apos;&quot; It&apos;s a curious idea, that of a writer running away from what he knows, a crime writer fleeing the scene of the crime, but it fits. It seems to me Peace&apos;s books have followed a particular trajectory; they have become more and more troubled by their subject matter. When he started out, I suggest to him, he appeared quite enthralled by the culture of violent crime - it is not called the Red Riding Quartet for nothing. Now - and this is where some of the tension of the later books comes in - he hardly seems to be able to look. He agrees, up to a point. &quot;In 1974, there was certainly a bit of a revelling in the noir-ness of the violence,&quot; he suggests. &quot;That&apos;s why I am a bit ambivalent about that book now. It is clearly the work, looking back, of quite a troubled and solitary man.&quot; He laughs. &quot;The more you write about crime though, particularly when you are looking at real-life events as I have been, you&apos;d have to be an emotional cripple not to begin to dwell on the suffering and pain it causes. I&apos;ve grown up through the books in a way. It&apos;s a clich\u00e9, but I do think, in my case, that has come of having children. I wrote child murders in that first book, but it is something I think I would find impossible to do now.&quot; The paranoia of the writer at the opening of Tokyo Occupied City talks to those fears. It is, even by Peace&apos;s compulsive standards, a tortured narrative, structured around an old Shinto tradition of storytelling. Each voice in the book tells its tale and then snuffs out a candle. By the end, you are left in darkness.  Part of the book dwells on some of the wartime atrocities of the Japanese, particularly the &quot;medical experiments&quot; performed on prisoners by the notorious Unit 731. Peace is a painstaking researcher - &quot;If I say it rained in Tokyo on a particular day in 1950, then it did&quot; - and spent weeks reading the Soviet court transcripts of these horrific crimes. He couldn&apos;t cope with it. &quot;All the detail of live dissections, infecting prisoners with syphilis and forcing them to have sex. It was endless. Page after page. It came to the point where I had to stop. I was dreaming about it or I would be on the train and I couldn&apos;t shake the thoughts.&quot; Like his writer, he had to run away from what he knew. &quot;It was like self-preservation.&quot;  Where does he think he gets that impulse, the need to look at the worst? He casts around a bit in his childhood. His parents were both primary school teachers, he went to Batley Grammar. Who knows? &quot;Partly it was Yorkshire. Looking back, it often seemed tinged with violence to me somehow. It&apos;s quite a hard place, I suppose, and for a while I was the kind of person who was beaten up a lot. Just in pubs and wherever. And usually it was brought on by the fact that I&apos;d insist on having the last word on any subject. Then further back there was all the Ripper stuff. I remember saying in an interview once that I used to worry that my dad was the Yorkshire Ripper. That is true, but only in the way that everybody feared their father was. That was the effect it had. What I was trying to convey was the level of paranoia it created.&quot;  To start with, Peace relieved his angst in a band he likes to think sounded like a cross between the Fall and the Birthday Party. He wrote the lyrics and screamed them, at local pubs and miners&apos; benefit gigs. &quot;And then there was an obsession with Joy Division, and all that, dead poets. My dad once pointed out to me that all the writers I admired had killed themselves. He was right.&quot; In a sense, moving to Tokyo seemed to lock him into some of that gothic sensibility, at least in his work. He&apos;s charming, modest and relaxed in conversation, a good listener, but he describes himself as obsessive in some respects also. &quot;If I like a certain writer or a band, you know, I definitely have to know and probably own everything they have done.&quot; That kind of obsessive tendency seems to inflect his writing in different ways. At times, he gets so entranced by the rhythm of a paragraph or the cadence of a phrase that he seems to want to keep turning it over, endlessly. It&apos;s hypnotic, crafted and sometimes alarming. I wonder if, to begin with, he thinks the style had anything to do with his day job, parsing sentences for uncomprehending Japanese students? &quot;Friends have said that. I don&apos;t know. My wife isn&apos;t a fluent English speaker. Perhaps that has made a difference to how I write. What I do know is I walk round this room and say everything out loud over and over to get it right. Or sometimes I&apos;ll get a kind of obsession where you will have to have in a sentence the first word as six letters, the second as five, the third as four and so on. Mad stuff. That became a problem. If you look in Tokyo Occupied City, there are bits that are left over from the months I was doing that. Balancing the number of words in a line.&quot; Those months, he suggests, coincided with a period of depression that began around the time he turned 40, two years ago. &quot;There were things going on at home, problems with being in Japan. But it was the writing really. One of the points I reached was a sense that language had no meaning.&quot; He laughs now. &quot;That was quite disturbing.&quot; In the end he wrote his way out of it, tried on different voices. &quot;If I had been in Britain, I would have sought some help, but that wasn&apos;t an option here.&quot;  His books often use the second person as a form of address, his voices prefer to call themselves &quot;you&quot; rather than &quot;I&quot;; it is the voice, he says, he feels most comfortable with, implying as it does a fractured sense of self and an incantatory, prayer-like quality. The more Peace explains this the more you begin to see how these fractures, which give you both the unhinged internal monologue of Brian Clough and that of a hard-boiled 1950s Tokyo cop, might have been borne out of various expatriate alienations. I ask at one point what his wife makes of his books, but he says she has never read any of them. &quot;It, the writing, just seems to happen in another world, in a way. I don&apos;t encourage her to read them for that reason.&quot;  Peace is, I imagine, something of a curiosity to the Japanese, writing as he does from within. Tokyo Year Zero did well here and was shortlisted for a big prize despite the fact that it raked over uncomfortable history. &quot;There is,&quot; he notes, &quot;for obvious reasons not too much interest in the 20th century for most people here.&quot; His books are becoming an argument against that forgetting. He has become fascinated, he says, with Shinto ideas of life and after-life, the immanence of ghosts in a place. His home is in the east end of the city in an area that was flattened by the 1923 earthquakes and then bombed out of existence in 1945. &quot;Up until the war,&quot; he says, &quot;it was crisscrossed with canals which were filled in with the ash of the buildings and with the bodies of the dead. Most of the people who were killed were heaped into piles and used as landfill. You are always conscious of that.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Or at least I am.&quot; Just occasionally he gets a more pointed history lesson in one of his local bars. &quot;A few times I have had blokes come up to me and say, &apos;What are you doing drinking in a place where 100,000 died?&apos; People always assume you are American.&quot; Whether he leaves or not tends to depend, he says, on the size of the person doing the asking. It must seem odd, I suggest, to feel anonymous here while his work is doing wonders back home. &quot;I get emails from friends saying that,&quot; he says, &quot;but none of it seems real to me here.&quot; He is, though, going to try living in Yorkshire again over the summer with the family, to see how they get on. &quot;I left in the last recession, we might as well be back for this one.&quot; He grins. One thing is certain, whether he stays or not: in the coming months, on TV and on the big screen and in all good bookshops, Peace will certainly be with you.  \u2022 The Red Riding trilogy starts on Channel 4 on 5 March.

Exactly how hard depends on what the club&apos;s medical staff advise over the next 24 hours, but the worst-case scenario is that Ferguson will have to play either Darren Fletcher or Michael Carrick as an emergency centre-back in Manchester United&apos;s biggest game of the season to date. Ferguson&apos;s jubilation after United won their 10th league game in succession, against Blackburn Rovers on Saturday, was tempered by what happened in the 55th minute, when Jonny Evans, the club&apos;s talented Irish centre-half, felt his ankle buckle. He lasted another six minutes but could barely jog by the time he was \u00adsubstituted and the early diagnosis was not \u00adencouraging. Evans had damaged \u00adligaments, aggravating an old injury that had seen him sidelined for a month. A gloomy Ferguson rated the defender&apos;s chances of being involved at San Siro as &quot;very, very doubtful&quot;. The manager spoke in suitably sombre tones because the timing of Evans&apos;s injury could hardly have been worse. Rio \u00adFerdinand is the only centre-half at the club who is not injured or suspended. &quot;I just hope we can get two centre-backs out because at this moment it&apos;s very doubtful,&quot; said Ferguson. &quot;We don&apos;t have [Nemanja] Vidic, we don&apos;t have Gary Neville and we don&apos;t have Wes Brown. I just hope we can get John O&apos;Shea \u00adavailable. &quot;But we&apos;re having a nightmare with defenders this season. Gary, Wes and John all missed the Blackburn game and now Evans has done his ankle. Hopefully we can patch up\u00a0a defence but it does leave us very, very short.&quot; His best hope is O&apos;Shea, who will have extensive treatment to ascertain whether he can play despite a heel problem. Failing that, Ferguson will have to find a partner for Ferdinand from elsewhere in the team. Fletcher, who has filled in as an emergency right-back before, would be an obvious candidate and the 6ft 2in \u00adCarrick is another option. Either choice would constitute a \u00adsignificant gamble but the manager could be faced with little other option if O&apos;Shea, who is currently rated at 50-50 to play, does not improve sufficiently. Neville has been suffering from a virus as well as a muscle strain in his lower leg and Ferguson said the former England international would not return to the squad until the Carling Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley on Sunday. Brown&apos;s luckless run of injuries continued in training earlier this month when he broke a metatarsal, meaning a spell of four to six weeks out, and Vidic is serving a one-match suspension. His absence deprives his manager of a defender whom he has already nominated as a candidate for player of the season. The Serb would naturally have been given the job of marking Zlatan Ibrahimovic \u2013 the player whom the Internazionale manager, Jose Mourinho, said recently was better than Cristiano Ronaldo. But Vidic is being punished for a red card in the final of the World Club Cup in Tokyo in December, when he elbowed Claudio Bieler, a striker with the Ecuadorian side Liga De Quito. The absence of a player of Vidic&apos;s importance was always likely to be a setback but Evans has been so impressive as United&apos;s third-choice centre-half this season that Ferguson must now regret playing him on Saturday. The idea was to give Evans and \u00adFerdinand some time playing alongside each other but Ferguson acknowledged there was an element of risk and it backfired in almost freakish circumstances when Evans went to take a free-kick from deep inside his own half. &quot;I kicked the ground just as I was \u00adtrying to make a long ball,&quot; Evans said. &quot;It&apos;s a recurrence of the ankle injury I had before. It&apos;s a bit tender and sore and I really don&apos;t know if I will be OK for \u00adTuesday. The doctors have said they will see in the morning.&quot; O&apos;Shea, who has played well recently as a full-back but is essentially fifth choice at centre-half, had been lined up to play on the right of defence. Ferguson may now have little choice other than to involve Rafael Da Silva, despite misgivings about the 18-year-old&apos;s lack of experience. The Brazilian&apos;s twin, Fabio, and the 19-year-old Richard Eckersley are also included in United&apos;s Champions League squad and they will be the only recognised defenders on the bench. Four other young players \u2013 David Gray, Danny Simpson, Craig Cathcart and James Chester \u2013 are currently out on loan at other clubs."}, {"sentences": ["This time around it&apos;s the turn of Sanaa, a Tokyo practice founded by Kazuyo Sejima (48) and Ryue Nishizawa (38) in 1995."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Serpentine pavilion"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-24T09:34:13Z", "title": "Serpentine turns to Japanese architects for 2009 pavilion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/24/serpentine-japanese-architect-pavilion", "article": "The most inspiring, and beautiful, of the Serpentine Gallery summer pavilions to date was designed by the Japanese architect, Toyo Ito, with Cecil Balmond, the Sri Lankan-born structural engineer. Seven years on, the Serpentine has gone to Japan again to find its architects. This time around it&apos;s the turn of Sanaa, a Tokyo practice founded by Kazuyo Sejima (48) and Ryue Nishizawa (38) in 1995. Like Ito, Sanaa&apos;s work is ethereal, exquisite, translucent and testing. Very quietly, very gently, Sejima and Nishizawa, have pushed the boundaries of contemporary architecture. It might be a little corny to say they have done so in a Zen-like fashion, and yet their buildings, interiors, installations, furniture and other designs have been remarkably calm and quieting, objects for contemplation as well as buildings and designs with a practical purpose. Quite what Sanaa will do for the Serpentine and Kensington Gardens remains to be seen, but if their best known building to date, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, completed four years ago, is anything to go by, it will be sculptural, peaceful and gently haunting. Haunting, that is, not in the sense of disturbing, but in a way that will very probably remain in visitors&apos; memories long after it&apos;s be disassembled, sold and re-erected somewhere else in the world as several of the Serpentine pavilions have been over the past decade. The New Museum of Contemporary Art is one of the most striking buildings on Manhattan&apos;s boisterous skyline. It rises like some shimmering stack of half-open, half-closed drawers among the city&apos;s spires, and yet, although an undeniably strong composition, it&apos;s as gentle as a spring breeze. To make large-scale structures so seemingly weightless, as if consisting more of air and light than steel and glass, takes both imagination and a truly refined skill. As for smaller buildings, including a number of fine houses in Japan, Sanaa has the knack of shaping structures that really do resemble \u2013 in the very best sense \u2013 fine card or paper models. These can seem improbably delicate, and even when chastely minimal, very beautiful indeed. Both architects are self-effacing, modest and highly talented. To be asked to design their first building in Britain at a time of recession may seem something of a thankless task, yet there are many of us hoping that when the economic going gets good again, the next generation of architecture will be more like Sanaa&apos;s than Shanghai&apos;s, Dubai&apos;s or Stratford&apos;s \u2013 east London, that is. Even if it isn&apos;t, Sanaa and the Serpentine Gallery are very likely to shape a special place in Kensington Gardens that, like Ito&apos;s pavilion, we will dream about happily even when it&apos;s long vanished into the architectural ether. We will, of course, show you the design for the 2009 Serpentine summer pavilion as soon as we are able to."}, {"sentences": ["Still, secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s response, when asked in Tokyo about the embarrassing resignation, signalled a US willingness to stand by Japan regardless of political or economic turmoil: &quot;I think that the resilience of the Japanese people and the Japanese government is what&apos;s important here.&quot; Aso&apos;s visit, while symbolically important, might be overshadowed as Obama presses a series of politically sensitive economic initiatives; Aso comes to Washington on the day of Obama&apos;s first address to a joint session of Congress.", "Some in Tokyo are worried about increasing US cooperation with, and dependence on, China on a host of diplomatic, economic and military matters.", "Clinton&apos;s decision to make Tokyo her first destination as secretary of state, as well as Aso&apos;s early White House visit, are important signals from the Obama administration.", "Japan still remembers that Clinton&apos;s husband, former President Bill Clinton, bypassed Tokyo during a trip to China in 1998.", "Clinton met with the families of kidnapped Japanese during her visit to Tokyo and pledged to give the matter a high priority in stalled disarmament talks with North Korea."], "tags": ["Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "Japan", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "US economy", "US economic growth and recession", "Business", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-24T17:49:59Z", "title": "Japan's prime minister Taro Aso visits Barack Obama", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/24/barack-obama-taro-aso-japan-pm", "article": "Barack Obama today told Taro Aso, Japan&apos;s prime minister, that his nation was the cornerstone US security policy in east Asia and to America&apos;s links to the world economy. The Japanese leader was the first foreign leader to visit Obama at the White House, and the president said that was a testament to the importance both countries place in their mutual ties. &quot;It&apos;s a testimony to the strong partnership between the United States and Japan,&quot; Obama said, sitting at Aso&apos;s side in the Oval Office. The Japanese leader said only the United States and Japan enjoyed sufficient economic strength to effect changes in the global economic recession. The two leaders face starkly different political fortunes: While Obama enjoys worldwide popularity; Aso is struggling to stay in power. In selecting Aso as the first foreign leader to visit the Obama White House, however, the new administration is interested less in giving him a boost than in sending a message that Japan - a sometimes-neglected ally - remains a vital partner in addressing global economic and security crises. Japan, which has the world&apos;s second-largest economy, trails only China as the largest foreign holder of US treasury bonds, holdings that help finance the ever-growing US budget deficit. Japan also is the linchpin of US security efforts in Asia, hosting about 50,000 US military personnel and working with the United States and three other countries to press an increasingly hostile North Korea to give up its nuclear bombs. Washington&apos;s invitation to Aso, who arrived on Monday night, was a broad signal &quot;to the Japanese political establishment that the Obama administration is going to work with whoever is there,&quot; said Michael Auslin, a Japan specialist with the American Enterprise Institute think tank. &quot;If we continue to wait for the next Koizumi, the next strong leader, we&apos;re going to be waiting forever,&quot; Auslin said. Since popular former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi left office in 2006, he has been followed by a series of ineffectual leaders. Aso, of late, has faced single-digit approval ratings, appeals from his own party to resign and the worst Japanese recession in 50 years. His administration reached a low point last week when his finance minister stepped down after appearing to be drunk during a world finance ministers&apos; meeting. Still, secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s response, when asked in Tokyo about the embarrassing resignation, signalled a US willingness to stand by Japan regardless of political or economic turmoil: &quot;I think that the resilience of the Japanese people and the Japanese government is what&apos;s important here.&quot; Aso&apos;s visit, while symbolically important, might be overshadowed as Obama presses a series of politically sensitive economic initiatives; Aso comes to Washington on the day of Obama&apos;s first address to a joint session of Congress. Japan has been looking for US reassurance about its place as the top US ally in Asia. Some in Tokyo are worried about increasing US cooperation with, and dependence on, China on a host of diplomatic, economic and military matters. Clinton&apos;s decision to make Tokyo her first destination as secretary of state, as well as Aso&apos;s early White House visit, are important signals from the Obama administration. Japan still remembers that Clinton&apos;s husband, former President Bill Clinton, bypassed Tokyo during a trip to China in 1998. &quot;The sentiment in Japan is quite delicate right now in terms of what place it holds in US priorities,&quot; said John Park, a senior researcher at the United States Institute of Peace. Secretary of state Clinton has also sought to soothe Japanese anger over the Bush administration&apos;s handling of North Korea&apos;s abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and &apos;80s. The United States, despite vehement public and private Japanese protestations, removed North Korea last year from a US terrorism blacklist, which Japan felt was one of the few levers negotiators had with the North on the abduction question. Clinton met with the families of kidnapped Japanese during her visit to Tokyo and pledged to give the matter a high priority in stalled disarmament talks with North Korea."}, {"sentences": ["It&apos;s an attempt to find a way back into some very painful and important things that our parents&apos; generation had to face.&quot; There are limits, however, as Finley explains: &quot;At one point, there was a chance for Doctor Atomic to go to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Opera"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-25T00:01:00Z", "title": "Martin Kettle interviews Gerald Finley about bringing 'Doctor Atomic' to life", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/25/dr-atomic", "article": "Gerald Finley draws his jacket around him as we sit in a drafty room at Abbey Road studios and thinks hard. The Canadian baritone debuts tonight as J Robert Oppenheimer, pioneer of the atomic bomb, in the British premiere of John Adams&apos;s opera Doctor Atomic. Surely, I have just said, an opera about developing the atomic bomb is a step too far? How can even the most powerful music or the most imaginative staging avoid making such an epochal subject banal? &quot;Look,&quot; says Finley, who finds himself much in demand these days, having one of the most mellifluous baritones on the circuit. &quot;I understand about the banality point. I was involved in a performance at Auschwitz to mark the 60th anniversary and it was almost too much to bear. Yet music is a soothing way of dealing with the immense and the painful. It can be a way of expressing pain and communicating something unspoken. I think that even the atomic bomb and its effects are part of that.&quot; The opera tells the story, and reflects on the dilemmas, of the scientists who worked in secret at Los Alamos in the New Mexico desert during the second world war to devise the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Finley plays the role - which he has taken in every performance since the work&apos;s 2005 world premiere in San Francisco - of the project&apos;s brilliant and haunted scientific director. It was Oppenheimer who, as he watched the first successful test of the bomb, famously found himself recalling words of Hindu scripture from the Bhagavad Gita: &quot;Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.&quot;  Later, he would be hounded from scientific office for his belief that atomic energy research should be shared internationally. The opera deals only with the work at Los Alamos leading up to the first test. &quot;At the beginning,&quot; says Finley, &quot;there is this immense enthusiasm among the scientists: every day new formulae, great excitement. The scientists were absolutely determined about the moral right they believed they had to defeat the tyranny of Germany. It was an industrial project with fantastic physics and huge conviction.&quot; At the heart of the opera is Oppenheimer&apos;s doubt about what the team is about to let loose on the world. &quot;It is like a Greek tragedy,&quot; says Finley. &quot;The characters do not understand the whole picture, but the audience knows the outcome, knows the repercussions, knows that nuclear strength is still something that dominates our lives. They know what happened to Oppenheimer, too, about the relationships, the betrayals. But Oppenheimer doesn&apos;t know these things. It is very important for me not to show him displaying regret or vulnerability based on later knowledge. He is opening a door to the unknown. That&apos;s fundamental.&quot; Like all operas dealing with historical events, Doctor Atomic has to balance the need to tell a story with the operatic imperative for characters to reflect on what happens to them. &quot;Great characters in history have great dilemmas,&quot; says Finley. &quot;And Oppenheimer was an epic example. He had an immensely rich intellectual and meditative life. He knew what he wanted for Los Alamos and he knew that the free world might depend on whether or not he did a good job. That&apos;s why the soliloquy is such a necessary mode for him. Without it, the opera would simply be a documentary. It is far more interesting for me - and, I think and hope, for the audience - to see the dilemmas the characters face.&quot; Finley&apos;s father was wounded during the landings in 1944. &quot;He found it very difficult to talk about it. He wouldn&apos;t glorify it. His great phrase was &apos;Respect reticence.&apos;&quot; But Finley believes that, as our distance from those times increases, it is possible to see even that sort of subject operatically. &quot;It&apos;s not an attempt to represent the entire story, and it shouldn&apos;t be judged on that. It&apos;s an attempt to find a way back into some very painful and important things that our parents&apos; generation had to face.&quot; There are limits, however, as Finley explains: &quot;At one point, there was a chance for Doctor Atomic to go to Tokyo. That would have been incredible. But I&apos;m not sure anyone is ready for that yet.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Gordon Brown had hoped to win the race to be the first foreign leader invited to Barack Obama&apos;s White House, but yesterday that honour went to the man from Tokyo."], "tags": ["Gordon Brown", "Labour", "Foreign policy", "US foreign policy", "Obama administration", "World news", "UK news", "Politics", "US politics"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-25T00:01:00Z", "title": "Jonathan Freedland: The sagging Brown image can only benefit from a shot of Obama botox", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/25/brown-obama-global-economy", "article": "In the end the Japanese prime minister got in just ahead of him. Gordon Brown had hoped to win the race to be the first foreign leader invited to Barack Obama&apos;s White House, but yesterday that honour went to the man from Tokyo. At least when Brown sits down with the new president next Monday, Brown can take comfort in the fact that he beat Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - though he will surely be irritated that it was a grinning Tony Blair who nudged in front of them all last month.  Still, the meeting is in the diary - and boy, does Brown need it. Yesterday&apos;s Guardian poll found Labour deep in the doldrums, 12 points behind the Conservatives with the prime minister&apos;s personal standing even lower. His only consolation is that the desperate state of the economy makes it a surprise that the crater is not deeper still.  So the sagging Brown image can only benefit from a sharp injection of Obama botox. The US president is currently the most popular figure in the world - with the kids from Slumdog Millionaire a distant second - and looking like his friend is what every politician wants. He is the unBush: where W damaged everyone who stood near him, Blair especially, Obama exercises the reverse polarity, sending waves of magical energy towards all who come near.  At least that&apos;s what Brown hopes. He&apos;ll want his Washington visit to project the persona on which he&apos;s staking his political survival: the global man of substance, active, even frenetic, in his efforts to steer Britain through the current economic storm. The rose-tinted view of yesterday&apos;s survey - in which the Tories were at 42% rather than the high 40s reached by New Labour in the mid-1990s - is that David Cameron has still failed to close the deal with the British voter. The subliminal message Brown hopes to reiterate as he stands at Obama&apos;s side is a variation on the one that worked so well for him last autumn: leave this to the grown ups - it&apos;s no time for a novice.  That much will be achieved with the photo-op. What of the substance: what should Brown say to Obama?  The economy will dominate, not least because Brown won his coveted early meeting as the chair of April&apos;s G20 summit. The prime minister has long dreamed that the London gathering might birth a second Bretton Woods, allowing him to be present at the creation of a new global financial architecture, with himself in the role of master builder. The notion that 24 hours in Docklands could complete such a task is clearly absurd: Bretton Woods was the fruit of more than three years&apos; work. Still, you have to start some time, and planning now for the global economy that will remain after the current fire has burned out is surely sensible.  But Brown should use his time in Washington to do more than tee up the G20. He should make a bolder proposal, suggesting to Obama that they learn from the experience of their predecessors fighting the so-called war on terror - emulating what Bush and Blair got right, avoiding what they did wrong.  In this war against economic horror, Brown and Obama should vow to stand shoulder to shoulder, co-ordinating their actions, even announcing moves jointly. Whether proposing a cap on bonuses to bailed-out fat cats or a fresh injection of capital to ailing banks, London and Washington could act in sync.  It&apos;s obvious why such symbiosis would help Brown. For as long as the Obama honeymoon lasts, and the polls going into last night&apos;s joint session of Congress suggest the president&apos;s numbers are holding remarkably strong, there is no political cover more effective than Obama. The four most effective words in politics right now are &quot;Obama&apos;s doing it too,&quot; lending instant legitimacy to any policy.  But the help would not be one way. For now, most Americans don&apos;t blame Obama for the economic turmoil: they know he inherited the mess from Bush. But patience is not infinite. The $800bn stimulus bill has Obama&apos;s name on it: if it doesn&apos;t bring results, the blame will be his. Against that backdrop, Obama will be eager to say he&apos;s not acting alone but as part of a global effort to beat back a global menace. It helped Bush to be able to point to international allies when he was fighting al-Qaida, and it will help Obama to do the same in his war on the credit crunch.  The &quot;special partnership&quot; between Britain and America, as the White House has apparently renamed it - perhaps to break from the cold war resonances of &quot;special relationship&quot;, perhaps to convey activity and purpose - could embark on any number of shared moves. Brown has talked of creating an international college of supervisors, to end the anomaly of financial institutions that operate globally being regulated locally. Such a body could make it harder for companies or banks to dodge taxes or regulation by simply hopping from one jurisdiction to another: they would be under a single watchful eye.  Or the two leaders might impose the long-demanded Tobin tax, levying a tiny percentage of every foreign exchange transaction. Such a move would raise tens of billions - enough, say, to pay for Brown&apos;s treasured ambition of ensuring every child in the world goes to school. Companies have always threatened to relocate should any government dare raise a Tobin tax. But if the two great financial centres, Britain and the US, were to move together, the corporations would struggle to find anywhere to go. What&apos;s more, Berlin and Paris would rapidly follow suit.  Which brings us to one of the lessons in how not to do it bequeathed by the Bush-Blair era. Those two acted alone; Blair promised to be a bridge between Europe and the US, but the bridge broke under the strain, especially over Iraq. It has to be different this time. In the election campaign Obama spoke warmly of European unity: he believes it helps America when Europe acts together. So it is not just co-ordinated economic action between the US and Britain that Brown should be advocating next week, but between the US and Europe. Such a step would be both politically helpful and correct. The crisis is global; it requires a global response - one every bit as focused and co-ordinated as a coalition fighting a war.  Of course, there will be much more on the Brown-Obama agenda. The prime minister should welcome the promise to close Guant\u00e1namo, but register alarm that the new administration appears to be maintaining the old Bush line on detention camps elsewhere, arguing just last week that prisoners held at Bagram air base in Afghanistan have no constitutional rights. Brown ought to remind Obama of his own rhetoric, that America&apos;s power comes when it&apos;s seen as a beacon of light, not skulking in the illegal dark. The pair will need to talk about Afghanistan and Pakistan, with Brown insisting that continued support in the former will only come for a new plan, not for sending troops to fight in what even Nato military commanders now admit is a &quot;strategic stalemate&quot;. And that&apos;s before they&apos;ve got to climate change, Iran or Israel-Palestine.  Tony Blair&apos;s relationship with an American president destroyed his premiership. Gordon Brown should head to Washington next week believing that a genuine partnership with a new president might just save his. freedland@theguardian.com"}, {"sentences": ["The knock-on effects of that are being felt in Tokyo and Hamburg.", "But nothing Tokyo did got to the heart of the crisis, which was that land prices continued to fall year after year, creating fresh losses for the financial system as quickly as the last batch of toxic waste was cleared up."], "tags": ["Global recession", "Japan", "International trade", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-25T15:50:05Z", "title": "Larry Elliott: Japan's trade figures signal depression", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/25/larry-elliott-depression-japan", "article": "Anybody who doubts that the global economy is facing its most serious downturn since the 1930s should take a squint at the latest trade figures from Japan. Exports in January were 46% lower in January than they were a year ago \u2013 a phenomenal drop for a country that is so heavily dependent on sales of its industrial products overseas. Japan has got used to economic setbacks over the past two decades: it has been in and out of recession on a regular basis. But make no mistake, this drop in exports does not mean recession: it means depression. In the circumstances, comments by analysts that the data was &quot;not good&quot; and &quot;seriously bad&quot; were somewhat otiose. The Office for National Statistics confirmed today that the UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the final three months of 2008 and is on course for an annual decline in GDP this year of between 2.5% and 3%. But in Japan, things are much, much worse. Maya Bhandar at Lombard Street Research, says that the economy is contracting at an annualised rate of 14-15% in the current quarter. Strong exports have tended to disguise the weakness of Japanese domestic consumption in recent years: now that prop has been kicked away, growth is plummeting. Why is this happening? Quite simply, the great engine of globalisation has gone into reverse. During the long boom, the US acted as the consumer of last resort: it sucked in exports from China and Japan. As China industrialised, it needed high-grade investment goods from Germany, and as prosperity spread in the world&apos;s most populous country, there was strong demand for Japanese electronics, cars and consumer gizmos. Now that America has stopped spending, Chinese factories have closed. The knock-on effects of that are being felt in Tokyo and Hamburg. In Japan, all the main industries are reporting decreases in exports of more than 40%. The big car companies \u2013 Toyota, Nissan and Honda \u2013 are really feeling the pinch: overseas sales by the transport equipment sector were down almost 54% on a year ago. What&apos;s more, car sales are slumping everywhere: J\u00adapanese exports to North America, Europe and the rest of Asia were all down by more than 50%. The assumption, since the financial crisis began in the summer of 2007, has been that lessons have been learnt from the Japanese experience in the 1990s. Much comfort was taken from the fact that Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, had produced an erudite paper on how to avoid the deflationary problems \u00adsuffered by the world&apos;s second biggest economy. As things stand, that optimism is starting to look a tad misplaced. It is not just that the generalised falls in industrial production over the past few months has been far worse than \u00adanything experienced by Japan in the 1990s; it is also that policymakers \u2013 including Bernanke \u2013 do not seem to have fully assimilated the lessons of the Japanese experience. Japan&apos;s problem in the 1990s was not that the government failed to act: there were any number of emergency packages and bail-outs for the stricken banks. But nothing Tokyo did got to the heart of the crisis, which was that land prices continued to fall year after year, creating fresh losses for the financial system as quickly as the last batch of toxic waste was cleared up. Something similar is happening now to Wall Street banks. With real-estate prices in freefall, the losses just continue to mount and the pressure on the banks remains acute."}, {"sentences": ["After a short while I simply forgot that one of them wasn&apos;t there but in another part of the building (he could have been in Tokyo), just being beamed in for the occasion."], "tags": ["Technology", "Research and development", "Twitter"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-26T00:08:30Z", "title": "Holograms: coming soon to your front room?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/feb/26/holograms", "article": "I&apos;ve done some daft things in my time, but inter\u00adviewing someone who wasn&apos;t there for the best part of an hour must be in a class of its own. The person in question, Ian O&apos;Connell, director of London-based Musion, wasn&apos;t \u00adinvisible. I could follow his every movement, gesture and eye motions: it was just that he himself was somewhere else. I was chatting to one of his company&apos;s products, or maybe I should say non-products: a hologram. Up until that moment, I had seen holograms as a bit of technology freakshow used by the likes of Madonna, David Beckham and the Gorillaz band as one-off stunts, but not something that could go mainstream and become part of our daily lives. Now I am not so sure. I was sitting a few yards from a stage on which were O&apos;Connell and Lenny McKinlay, global account director of \u00adMasergy UK, which provides the ultra-fast fibre-optic infrastructure that enables holograms to come from far away without getting the lag you see on television when someone is being interviewed abroad by satellite. After a short while I simply forgot that one of them wasn&apos;t there but in another part of the building (he could have been in Tokyo), just being beamed in for the occasion. And looking back on it, I am not completely sure which was the hologram and which wasn&apos;t \u2013 so it passes a Turing test of sorts for authenticity. It was an even more immersive experience than Telepresence, the high-definition video conferencing that impressed me last year. You don&apos;t appear to be talking through a screen, though there is a thin, almost invisible foil that enables the reproduction of high-definition video that audiences imagine to be real. Shortly before the interview, I was shown a demo of a &quot;pre-loaded&quot; hologram of a dancer that was in even better definition. It was simply a knockout. O&apos;Connell says that pretty soon &quot;live&quot; holograms will be as good as that. At the moment, cost is a big barrier because a projector, the main item, costs an arm and a leg, but within five years, he claims, it could come down to a more affordable \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000 \u2013 hopefully propelling the product from a business conferencing market to a front room near you. If you have a space that is 10 feet high and 10 feet across \u2013 possibly a conservatory that could be converted for evening use \u2013 then the mind boggles at the possibilities. Friends and relatives abroad, or your Twitter friends, could be as if in your front room. The Royal Shakespeare Company could perform near-live for you \u2013 and, of course, the one certainty is the sex industry, always a pioneer of new technology, will go ballistic about it. Institutions such as the BBC are already exploring the prospects for distance learning, which could also involve universities beaming their lecturers into your home. Prison visits could be done remotely and eventually it may provide a sort of virtual afterlife if anyone decided to leave behind a pre-loaded hologram, possibly linked to a computer program using artificial intelligence to &quot;converse&quot; with relatives. Students at Central St Martins art college in London are being given an opportunity to experiment with art in a hologrammic space and have already turned out some impressive works. To the mobile phone companies&apos; definition of 3G \u2013 games, girls and gambling \u2013 could be added a fourth &quot;g&quot;, God, as the new technology would enable America&apos;s stable of evangelists, and any other public speakers, to address meetings around the world without leaving their well-clad homes. What price confessions at home? Before leaving Musion&apos;s offices in London, a listed building near the BBC&apos;s headquarters, I asked if I could do a hologrammic handshake. The result can be seen here and it is not immediately obvious which is the hologram. I know, but only because I wrote it down at the time. All of which is beginning to make virtual worlds such as Second Life seem a bit like the Lego of old. victorkeegan.com"}, {"sentences": ["The verdict: Fail  5: Tokyo Story (1953) Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s masterpiece tells the story of two elderly parents who travel to Tokyo to visit their adult children who, apart from one, all turn out to be too busy to spend time with them."], "tags": ["Film", "Equality", "Women", "Culture", "Society", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-02-27T00:01:00Z", "title": "Is cinema just the ultimate boys' club, asks Bibi van der Zee", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/27/sexism-equality-hollywood", "article": "Hollywood is monstrously, demonstrably sexist. It&apos;s sexist in a way that must make industries like construction and engineering take off their hard-hats and whistle with admiration. According to the Celluloid Ceiling review, of the top 250 films of 2007, women made up just 15% of key behind-the-scenes roles. They were just 6% of the directors, and just 2% of cinematographers. In front of the camera things appear to be slightly better: you can see women, they&apos;re all over the place. But actually, with all those male directors, directing films about men, the women really don&apos;t get much of a look in. Of the 6,833 speaking characters in the films nominated for the best picture Oscar between 1977 and 2006, only 27.3% were female (only one woman director has ever been nominated for an Oscar: Sofia Coppola, in 2003, the same year that Fernando Meirelles was nominated for City of God without his female co-director, Katia Lund).  In Alison Bechdel&apos;s cartoon strip Dykes to Watch Out For, the character Mo explains that she only watches films in which 1) there are two female characters, who 2) have a conversation which is 3) not about men. To test the feminist credentials of the movie canon, we applied the Mo Movie Measure to Sight and Sound&apos;s all-time top 10 films. In order for the film to get a full pass, we ruled the women&apos;s conversation must be integral to the plot. Otherwise a film would be counted as just squeaking through. So how did they fare?  10: Singin&apos; in the Rain (1952) This is one of those films - a love story with a feisty heroine who&apos;s more than a pretty face - that you&apos;d imagine would walk (or tapdance) it. But no. Women are used as props, and although it&apos;s supposed to be a love story, the relationship between best friends Gene Kelly and Donald O&apos;Connor gets far more screen time. Female star Deborah Reynolds later said that making this film and childbirth were the two most difficult experiences of her life, and Kelly admitted he was surprised she was still talking to him.  The verdict: Squeaks through 9: 8\u00bd (1963) Fellini&apos;s film belongs in the (large) movie subgenre of &quot;man obsessing about destiny, the meaning of life and mortality&quot;. So it&apos;s quite hard for the women to get a word in edgeways, but they do, during Marcello Mastroianni&apos;s dreams and nightmares. I nearly disqualified it again, because so many of their conversations are - naturally - about him, but there are a couple of fragments where women think about something other than Mastroianni. The verdict: Pass  8: Sunrise (1927) That Sunrise is a silent film poses an obstacle, but we put it to the test anyway. The underlying principle is clear, and besides, some of those intertitles must consist of dialogue between someone and someone else. Friedrich Murnau&apos;s haunting film tells the story of a married man seduced by an evil city woman who persuades him to murder his wife. But just as he is about to carry out the deed, remorse strikes him: instead their love is renewed and they spend a miraculous day together. Given that, for almost the entire film, the young couple are centre stage, it&apos;s hard for the wife to find a moment for a quick chat with anyone else. There is an early conversation between two old gossiping ladies, but it&apos;s about the couple.  The verdict: Squeaks through 7: Battleship Potemkin (1925) Another silent film, and, moreover, one in which a large portion of the action takes place on a battleship. My heart, I must admit, did sink. But once the action moves to Odessa, the women are every bit as involved in the revolutionary fervour of Russia in 1917 as the men. They&apos;re giving rousing speeches, they&apos;re urging action, and they&apos;re the ones who decide to try to talk to the Cossacks. Although it is the sailors who begin the action, you could argue on a viewing of this film that it was women who broadened out the revolution. The central humanity of the movie - its lack of glitter, its depiction of historic events as a scramble, a panic, rather than as choreographed heroism - depends, I think, on these desperate, shabby women. The verdict: Pass 6: 2001: Space Odyssey (1968) There&apos;s not a lot of talking. And much of Stanley Kubrick&apos;s film takes place on a spaceship staffed entirely by men. In fact, almost the only women are carrying trays of food and wearing tight skirts. In a film that takes on the entire span of human civilisation, it&apos;s irritating that women turn out to have been so irrelevant to the whole enterprise.  The verdict: Fail  5: Tokyo Story (1953) Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s masterpiece tells the story of two elderly parents who travel to Tokyo to visit their adult children who, apart from one, all turn out to be too busy to spend time with them. The parents remain smiling to the end, even as they sadly pack to go home. It sounds so slight, but actually this film is monumental, with vast tectonic shifts of love and disappointment moving beneath its serene camera shots. The women are as real, as vital, as the men, and one of the most moving scenes in the film is between the mother, Noriko (played by the luminous Setsuko Hara), the one daughter-in-law who is truly kind, and her young relative Kyoko, who asks her passionately: &quot;Isn&apos;t life disappointing?&quot; &quot;Yes it is,&quot; replies Noriko, but with such an extraordinary, angelic smile that the bitterness and sweetness, the umami of life is perfectly captured.  The verdict: Pass  4: The Godfather/The Godfather: Part II (1972 and 1974) Given that these movies are preoccupied with power, what do the women get to do? Be mothers, have kids, be cried on occasionally. (The women in Part II have stronger roles, but they are still peripheral to Al Pacino&apos;s Michael Corleone.) These are men&apos;s films, but the role of Kay Corleone (Diane Keaton) provides a strong female counterpart, even if much of her strength is a direct reaction to how appalling Michael becomes.  The verdict: Squeaks through  3: La R\u00e8gle du Jeu (1939) My favourite line belongs to Robert de la Cheyniest (Marcel Dalio), the aristocrat whose wife, Christine, is the centre of the upstairs-downstairs love and confusion at the heart of the film. &quot;Je souffre, et j&apos;ai horreur de \u00e7a,&quot; he says (I suffer, and I have a horror of that), a neat example of the banter that is used in this film to mask the darker realities of the heart. Christine and her maid (and friend) have several conversations, not always about men. Another film with a clear eye on humanity.  The verdict: Pass 2: Vertigo (1958) Alfred Hitchcock bullied Kim Novak into structured suits and tightly pulled-back hair on the set of Vertigo; perhaps his domination is what leads to her nervy, edgy performance. The interesting thing is that, despite the fact that this film is obsessively, pathologically focused on a woman, it is also claustrophobically tied to the viewpoint of a man: neither Scottie (James Stewart) nor the Kim Novak character get much of a chance to talk to anyone else at all. It&apos;s the one film on the list that would almost fail the Mo Movie Measure if it applied to men instead.  The verdict: Fail 1: Citizen Kane (1941) The absolute classic Film About Being a Man. Don&apos;t tell me this is about humanity. As you would expect in a film of this nature, the women are once again marginal. The only moment Citizen Kane even comes close to passing the MMM is when Kane is standing between his wife and his mistress, but of course, they don&apos;t start a conversation about the newspaper industry, and the moment is lost.  The verdict: Fail \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 3 March 2009.

The surprise move, which leaves Stringer firmly in control as Sony braces itself for its first operating loss for 14 years, mirrors executive shake-ups at other major corporations hit hard by the collapse in global demand for cars and consumer electronics. Stringer, the 67-year-old Welshman who already holds the positions of chief executive and chairman, said the reorganisation &quot;is designed to transform Sony into a more innovative, integrated and agile global company with its next generation of leadership firmly in place&quot;. Today&apos;s shake-up will consolidate Stringer&apos;s position as the firm attempts to ride out the financial storm. Chubachi will become vice-chairman from 1 April, Sony said in a statement. It claimed the changes would &quot;fundamentally reorganise the company&apos;s games and electronics business to improve profitability and strengthen competitiveness in the midst of the continued global economic crisis&quot;. Stringer announced the creation of two new business groups, headed by younger executives, to break down the &quot;silos&quot; that have prevented full integration of the company&apos;s hardware and software, and to devise &quot;cool new products&quot; that will appeal to digital-savvy young people around the world. &quot;[The changes] will now make it possible for all of Sony&apos;s parts to work together to assume a position of worldwide leadership and, together, achieve great things,&quot; he said. Analysts said the personnel changes were another sign of Stringer&apos;s growing impatience with the slow pace of change at Sony, where, he complained recently, &quot;there is still a lot of the old and not enough of the new&quot;. Nobuo Kurahashi, at Mizuho Investors Securities in Tokyo, said: &quot;It is a positive sign of how Sony is frantically moving forward toward change, including structural changes, especially in its TV and other electronics businesses.&quot; Since achieving record profits in 2007, Sony has become the victim of the global economic crisis and fierce competition, Stringer said at a hastily arranged press conference. Though he oversaw dramatic improvements in the electronics business in 2007, Chubachi is believed to represent a traditionalist faction at Sony that has hampered Stringer&apos;s radical cost-cutting efforts since he became the firm&apos;s first foreign head in 2005. The changes follow rumours of discord between Stringer and other executives over Sony&apos;s direction amid plunging earnings and thousands of layoffs. The firm behind PlayStation game consoles, Bravia flat-screen TVs and Cyber-shot digital cameras has been forced to shed 8,000 of 185,000 regular jobs worldwide and close about 10% of its 57 factories, as well as laying off 8,000 temporary workers. Sony said last month it expected an operating loss \u2013 its first for 14 years \u2013 of 260bn yen (\u00a31.9bn) for the financial year ending in March. A year earlier it was celebrating an apparent return to financial health under Stringer, with profits of \u00a5475.3bn. Today&apos;s announcement underlined the size of the task facing Sony and other manufacturers, coming after reports that Japan&apos;s factory output fell by a record 10% in January. The government said this week that exports had fallen by a record 46% over the last 12 months. Stringer, who has waived his bonus and will not receive a salary increase despite his additional role, defended his decision not to appoint a new president. &quot;This is a crisis \u2013 that&apos;s why I want to reduce layers,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d like to eliminate bureaucracy for a change. &quot;This is about as excited as I&apos;ve been for some months so don&apos;t try to put a bureaucratic layer between [the four new executives] and me. It&apos;s not going to happen \u2026 until I leave.&quot; Sony is one of several Japanese firms to have announced management reshuffles amid a collapse in sales and earnings. Toyota, which is expected to register its first annual net loss since 1950, named Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the firm&apos;s founder, as its new president.

Swerve right? Or think about it and die.&quot; This from the German scientist who must decide whether or not to arm Hitler with nuclear weapons. For Jonah Lehrer, it was a decision about Cheerios that inspired this book. He wanted to know what was happening inside his brain as he agonised between Apple Cinnamon and Honey Nut. The result is a tour de force of limpid writing, well-marshalled anecdotes and conclusions that overthrow conventional wisdom. This book could change the way you think about thinking. Lehrer thrusts us into the here and now from his opening sentence: &quot;I was flying a Boeing 737 into Tokyo Narita International Airport when the left engine caught on fire.&quot; He is, the narrative reveals, merely pitting his wits against a flight simulator. But along with making the difference between a safe landing and death, we will learn that the interplay between pilot and instruments is the key to understanding the three pounds of flesh between our ears. Plato thought of the mind as a chariot pulled by two horses. The rational brain is the charioteer, using his whip to keep control; one horse is well behaved, but the other is unruly and represents our negative, destructive emotions. Descartes, similarly, saw a division between a holy soul capable of reason and a fleshy body full of &quot;mechanical passions&quot;. From Bacon to Comte, Jefferson to Kant, reason was privileged over emotion. Freud appeared to seal the deal: the rational ego&apos;s mission is to restrain the animal instincts of the id. But armed with 21st-century neuroscience, Lehrer believes such dichotomies are not only false but destructive. He has a different metaphor: the brain as cockpit of an aeroplane. The pilot represents our rational prefrontal cortex, monitoring screens, arbitrating in conflicts, intervening when the unexpected happens. The vast array of onboard computers represents our &quot;emotional brain&quot;, evolved over millions of years; it processes gigantic amounts of information beneath the conscious level, sometimes making up our mind before we know it ourselves. We make bad decisions if we rely too much on one part of the brain at the expense of the other. Lehrer nimbly demonstrates how &quot;thinking too much&quot; can cause sopranos to lose their mojo, golfers to &quot;choke&quot; at the final hole and shoppers to get misled by irrelevant variables when choosing strawberry jam. Even when buying a house, Lehrer argues, it&apos;s better to trust our &quot;gut&quot; instinct - the emotional brain is able to process millions of bits of data simultaneously - than let clumsy reason cloud the issue by overanalysing. At other times, however, when playing poker, we are emotionally programmed to discern patterns and assume we are &quot;on a roll&quot;, creating a false sense of certainty. At moments like this, our reasonable prefrontal cortex should step in. Contrary to expectation, it is the mundane problems of everyday life that are best suited to the conscious brain, while more complex decisions require the processing powers of the emotional brain, &quot;the supercomputer of the mind&quot;. There is little doubt that Lehrer is a materialist. He tells the story of a patient who had a small tumour cut out of his cortex and lost the power of decision, causing his life to fall apart through procrastination. There is no room for a ghost in this machine. It follows that one day it may be possible to build a computer indistinguishable from the human brain. Lehrer claims that, above all, he wants us to think about thinking. It&apos;s an end he achieves magnificently."}, {"sentences": ["As the remaining carnival confetti was cleared from the narrow, labyrinthine streets of Venice last week, residents emerged here and there from behind closed doors to watch bleary-eyed revellers stream down the Strada Nuova on their way back to Milan, London, Tokyo and beyond."], "tags": ["Italy", "Venice holidays", "Travel", "World news", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-01T00:01:00Z", "title": "Who now can stop the slow death of Venice?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/01/venice-population-exodus-tourism", "article": "As the remaining carnival confetti was cleared from the narrow, labyrinthine streets of Venice last week, residents emerged here and there from behind closed doors to watch bleary-eyed revellers stream down the Strada Nuova on their way back to Milan, London, Tokyo and beyond.

The deal has a whiff of double standards, critics argued, since the city has been sending out &quot;decorum&quot; patrols to stop tourists picnicking in St Mark&apos;s Square and dropping Coke cans in canals. But Cacciari again pleaded poverty, arguing: &quot;We need a financial strategy to save our cultural heritage.&quot; And then there are the growing number of Venetians such as Matteo Secchi, the combative son of a Venetian wine merchant, who has been totting up some alarming numbers of his own. Every week Secchi heads to the town hall to check on the number of residents in Venice. Almost every week that number is lower than the week before. Armed with the latest grim statistics, Secchi updates the electronic board he has erected in a shop window near the Rialto bridge. Venice, as a lived-in city, is dying. A population which peaked at 164,000 in 1931 is now hovering at around 60,000. Since about 20 million tourists pour in each year - 55,000 a day - it&apos;s a safe bet that most days there are now more tourists than locals in Venice. &quot;The number of locals has dropped 600 since we started counting last March and we are set to go under the psychological 60,000 barrier in May,&quot; said Secchi, who heads a residents&apos; group, Venessia.com, which is planning a procession to mark the occasion. &quot;We will hold the funeral of Venice and take a coffin down to the town hall,&quot; he said. Secchi and the 600 members of Venessia.com did not stay at home during the carnival, but organised their own protest party for residents by the Rialto, dressing up as American Indians. &quot;Tourists were welcome, but the point was to show we feel like we are living on a reserve,&quot; said Secchi. Leaflets in five languages said: &quot;Our cultural identity is at risk of dissolving if Venice becomes a theme park - we Venetians will not surrender!&quot; Co-hosting the party was Venice&apos;s second new activist group, 40xVenezia, which has been battling against the creeping colonisation of houses and apartments by bed-and-breakfasts and rental agencies, which push up rents and property prices beyond the reach of locals. &quot;We believe 1,000 homes were lost between about 2002 and 2007, and we have been kicking up a stink about a new proposal to allow hotels in Venice - a very powerful lobby - to turn more houses into tourist-based accommodation, which would be devastating,&quot; said activist and lawyer Francesco Versace. By the time the bed-and-breakfasts arrived in Venice, thousands of locals had already packed up and left. The exodus became marked in the 1970s and 1980s, when Venetians, exasperated by the aftermath of the floods of 1966, fled towards the promise of a house on the mainland with a garden and a car in the garage. The jobs, too, were migrating to the mainland. As the old industries on the Venetian island of Guideca, notably the manufacture of watches and components for bombs, died out, the new place to look for work was in the chemical factories around the mainland town of Mestre nearby. When the February carnival tradition was revived in the 1970s, in the hope of attracting tourists in greater numbers, many locals thought of it as a last hurrah for the old city. Former Venetians now living in Mestre still recall the 70s carnivals as a kind of collective goodbye party. Enrico Crosara, 40, would love to join his mates in Mestre, but as a baker working in Via Garibaldi, close to the walls of the old shipyards, his early shifts rule out the long ride in from the mainland. So he stays in a city whose habits he no longer recognises. &quot;It&apos;s like a curfew after dark, there is just nothing to do,&quot; he said. He remembers the area bursting with life and a sense of community when he was a child. Now the doors are bolted and white sheets flap from occasional washing lines like flags of surrender. Next door, at the association for second world war partisans, Renzo Fa\u00e8, 65, is yelling down the phone in Venetian dialect, giving an elderly local tips on how to fill in his pension form. &quot;This used to be a very tight community,&quot; he said, after putting the phone down. &quot;Locals would take their honeymoon near St Mark&apos;s Square, less than a mile away.&quot; Matteo Secchi passed this way as a child, en route from his home sestiere, or neighbourhood, of Cannaregio, to see Venezia play football at the stadium built at the tip of the city. &quot;Back then, visiting fans used to come in by boat under escort and there were always plans to play pirate and board them by force,&quot; he said. &quot;After games we would play against neighbouring squares or just gossip. In such a small place news travelled fast, so I would walk down to the bridge and everyone would know what I had been up to!&quot; Today Venezia football club has dropped from Serie A to Italy&apos;s third division, a decline bemoaned by the men who gathered last week at a backstreet supporters&apos; club for a 50-cent, mid-morning glass of red wine. &quot;Membership here has halved to 111 since the 1970s and those left are all old,&quot; said bar worker Rosa Ferruccio. Across from Crosara&apos;s bakery there has been a church since the 14th century, when Venice&apos;s empire spanned the Mediterranean and the local population was already close to 150,000. Today the cavernous interior of the church of San Francesco Di Paola, complete with a Giandomenico Tiepolo painting, draws as few as eight worshippers to mass. &quot;We did get 150 in for Ash Wednesday,&quot; said priest Don Giuseppe Faustini, &quot;and we do fill up for funerals.&quot; The city&apos;s predicament is compounded by the fact that even the death of Venice is taking place somewhere else, according to Ernesto Fabris, a local stonemason. Fabris is one of six remaining gravestone specialists whose workshops are tucked away down the narrow streets opposite the island of San Michele, Venice&apos;s cemetery. &quot;There used to be a lot more of us tagiapiere round here,&quot; he said, &quot;but annual deaths in the Lagoon are now just 1,200 a year, 30% down on 20 years ago.&quot; As he spoke he watched his brother rub gold leaf into the lettering on the headstone for a recently deceased gondolier, one of the few trades still on the up. Fabris also battles costs and delays his mainland competitors do not face. With a small, dusty storage space down at the end of a dark, fetid alley, he cannot order stone in bulk. &quot;One tonne of white marble cut into 40 slabs that we ordered recently took four men two days to wheel, slab by slab, from the quay to the lock-up,&quot; he said. As the local population dwindles, the tourists are slowly killing off the same Venice street life that they dream of witnessing close up, said postwoman Orietta Sinibaldi, 50. Sinibaldi works around Salizada San Francesco, where a cluster of neighbourhood shops huddle inches from St Mark&apos;s, protected by a network of back streets that has apparently left traditional lifestyles intact. &quot;It may look that way, but even here the tourists have cut into a space in which Venetians used to live,&quot; she said. The &quot;decorum&quot; patrols that sometimes pounce on tourists should they dare to eat a sandwich in the street are an attempt by the authorities to address some residents&apos; complaints without scaring away the city&apos;s principal source of income.  &quot;Tourism is the biggest business in town, and the key is decorum,&quot; insisted tourism assessor Augusto Saladori. But Michela Scibilia, a graphic designer who moved to Venice 22 years ago, said Saladori was missing the point. &quot;This town needs the kind of tourists the Biennale and the film festival bring, not necessarily rich, but certainly not the huge groups that follow raised umbrellas. The city was sold off cheap to the hoteliers, water taxi operators and shopkeepers, who got the chance to make money, and now Venice has the mass tourism it deserves,&quot; she said. Scibilia, 43, a mother of two, is one of the 1,500 members involved in the lively debate on 40xVenezia&apos;s forum, which includes academics, architects, lawyers and priests. The group has revived neighbourhood festivals and gathered signatures to keep the local maternity ward open. It is now campaigning against the garish display that Venice plans to take to the Shanghai Expo in 2010, complete with a water-filled canal. &quot;It looks like the fake Venice in Las Vegas,&quot; said Scibilia. &quot;If you promote the city like this to millions of potential Chinese tourists they will come and just object to the smell of the canals and the fact there is nowhere to pee.&quot; Working out of a restored palazzo with its own boat moored by the back door, Scibilia represents a new generation of Venetians who have settled to find a quality of life absent in Italy&apos;s car-clogged towns.  &quot;I met four people I needed to see this morning walking to school. Where else can I have a village life in an international city?&quot; she said. For those bucking the trend by moving in, the internet is proving crucial. Once a week Scibilia orders vegetables from an Excel file emailed by the vegetable-growers on the lagoon island of St Erasmus and joins a queue on the quayside to pick up her order when the boat comes in. &quot;This does not have to be a city stuck in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;When experts dream up perfect cities, without cars and liveable, it&apos;s Venice.&quot; But back in Via Garibaldi, a filled-in canal which is the nearest Venice has to a high street, a handful of shoppers tightened their coats against the cold last week as they passed the numerous boarded-up shop fronts.  Watching them from the till at the bakery, Enrico Crosara&apos;s mother Angela said she was not so sure Venice was set for a rebound. &quot;Ten years ago there were four of us behind the counter and the queues stretched out the door on a Saturday morning,&quot; she said. &quot;Now there are two of us and we spend most of the time staring out the window.&quot; A short history of Venice \u2022 Attila the Hun invades northern Italy in AD452, razing the great Roman city of Aquileia and causing its population to flee to the small islands in the lagoon.  \u2022 Pope Gregory II encourages Italian cities to claim independence from the Byzantine emperor. Venice&apos;s council elects its first doge or leader, Orso Ipato, in 726.  \u2022 With trading ports at the mercy of Norman raiding parties, the Byzantine emperor offers Venetians free trading rights throughout the empire from 1081 in return for naval assistance. Venice expands its control over the Adriatic. \u2022 The fourth crusade of 1202 comes under Doge Enrico Dandolo&apos;s control. He leads a conquest of the Dalmatian coast and then Constantinople, sacking the city in 1204 and taking charge of the eastern Mediterranean.  \u2022 Four wars with Genoa from 1255 for control of the Mediterranean end with the surrender of the Genoan fleet in 1380. Venice also enters the battle for mainland power, taking Treviso&apos;s territories from Milan in 1329. \u2022 Pope Julius II forms the League of Cambrai in 1508 to halt Venice&apos;s increasing expansion. Venice&apos;s mercenary army is routed by French forces, losing many of its mainland cities. The next two centuries see the Ottoman empire take control of the Mediterranean from Venice, ending with their capture of Morea in 1714. \u2022 The Great Council of Venice dissolves the 1,070-year-old republic in 1797, surrendering to Napoleon&apos;s army. Napoleon loots the city, then signs Venice over to Austrian control.  \u2022 The great floods of 1966 wreak havoc on the city. An international campaign to restore the city begins.

The piece I&apos;m playing has a celebratory feel, with a punchy finale. But, despite six weeks of practising, my violin is screeching like the soundtrack to the shower scene in Psycho. I&apos;m also struggling to keep time. The conductor, Tan Dun, composer of the music to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is waving his baton at me - but I can hardly make him out. I am not, however, in some fancy rehearsal space in front of a panel of scary judges. I&apos;m in my spare room in front of a bookcase, eyes glued to my laptop. On the screen, Tan Dun is in full flow, but he&apos;s so small it&apos;s almost impossible to follow. Meanwhile, a digital camera is recording every painful note of my audition, every beat that passes in carefully counted silence, every creak (I discover later) of my floorboards.  I hit the finale and that&apos;s it. My ordeal is over. All I need to do now is upload the recording and I will be considered for the YouTube Symphony Orchestra. Showing that even music auditions have now gone digital, the site has launched what it is calling the world&apos;s first &quot;collaborative orchestra&quot;, an ensemble of musicians from all over the planet gathered through cyberspace.  Between the start of December and the end of January, more than 3,000 players from 70 countries, myself included, posted auditions on the YouTube Symphony Orchestra site, having first downloaded the set score. The winning 80, chosen by judges and a public vote, will be announced this week. Next month, they will travel to New York&apos;s Carnegie Hall, all expenses paid, to form a global orchestra that will attend workshops and perform live at a three-day &quot;summit&quot;. Will my scratchings make it in? Could I be on my way to Carnegie Hall to take part in musical history? Tan Dun - a Chinese composer based in New York, who won an Oscar for Crouching Tiger and was official composer to the Beijing Olympics - wrote the audition piece especially for YouTube. As its name suggests, Eroica: Internet Symphony No 1 pays homage to Beethoven&apos;s third. But, characteristically, Tan Dun also pays homage to the car repair shop he stumbled upon one day while in Beijing for the games: played properly, the piece opens with the sound of hammers striking the metal rims of car wheels.  &quot;I always aim for a balance between things that are a little familiar and a little more challenging,&quot; he says. &quot;So I meld contemporary classical music with street noises, automobiles, metal sounds, percussion - to seduce young people into loving the music.&quot; I can certainly vouch for how tricky his Eroica is, or at least the violin part. As well as finding Tan Dun hard to see on my laptop, I couldn&apos;t cope with the speed: Eroica reaches its climax at a bow-blurring 180 beats per minute. But perhaps I shouldn&apos;t feel so bad. When the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) recorded the work, they needed several takes as well.  I put both complaints to Tan Dun, hoping for some sympathy. Instead, he simply says I should have made his image bigger, adding that the accelerando is in there because the symphony was written not &quot;for a regular high-school orchestra, but for the best young players in the world&quot;. Ouch! He does have a point, though, given the quality of musicianship (and, in many cases, dress sense) displayed by my rivals, whose auditions I have pored over on YouTube with a mixture of envy and awe. Many show a mastery of the staccato bowing style the piece requires. This largely defeated me. OK, it completely defeated me. And most entrants keep time effortlessly.  So will Tan Dun let me through if I buy him dinner at a restaurant of his choosing? &quot;That&apos;s a very fresh question!&quot; he says. &quot;If you were any good at the violin, I should be paying you to be in this.&quot; Although the standard among the YouTube auditions is far from universally high, only a curmudgeon would be unmoved by the sense of longing that spills out from these videos. Here are people from all over the world, performing in their barren living spaces, framed by a dusty pot plant, some with kids screaming in the background, clearly giving it their all in the hope of finally being heard and appreciated for their musicianship. To bolster proceedings, the Carnegie event will be led by Michael Tilson Thomas, composer and music director of the San Francisco Symphony. The project appealed to his love of experimenting with new technology. As a young musician, he was nurtured by face-to-face collaborations in California with the likes of Copland, Stockhausen and Stravinsky. Today, he has taken the teacher-pupil relationship into new territory. At the New World Symphony, his academy for young players in Miami, Tilson Thomas uses the web to bring his students into contact with maestros in Vienna, Moscow and Hong Kong. &quot;There&apos;s no enormous subtlety or delicacy to the sound or images being used by YouTube,&quot; he says, &quot;but in terms of a basic message, this is very powerful.&quot; He hopes the 80 finalists who make it to the Carnegie will include those from cultures and regions with no direct links to western classical music, such as the Middle East and Asia.  He is currently devising an eclectic programme - Bach, Brahms, Boulez, Reich - for the concert cycle. So could Tilson Thomas get me into the final 80 for the big day? Name any bottle of wine, I tell him, any malt whisky. After a brief pause, he politely informs me that he is not a judge and so, regrettably, can&apos;t help. Preparing for my audition forced me to confront my painfully stop-start relationship with the violin. For much of my childhood, I honoured the daily (and almost religious) observance of practising: scales first, finger-twisting Kreutzer studies to follow, solo repertoire to finish. It was a brutal ritual, and one that I now inflict on my own son and daughter. I clawed my way up through the eight grades, always falling shy of those distinctions, and rose through perseverance rather than natural talent to become leader of the school orchestra. The pinnacle was Mahler&apos;s violin concerto, which I played with my university&apos;s (second) orchestra. Although I was not the soloist, the event was so spirited and soaring, it somehow made sense of the gruelling treadmill that preceded it. And then it all fell off a cliff. For many years, I barely played. Only recently, and patchily, has chamber music returned to my life.  Then came my YouTube audition. I may not be the best advert for the quality of musical performance the project aspires to, but, over six weeks, the battle I waged with Tan Dun&apos;s Eroica brought meaning back to my playing. This, surely, is also the point of the entire project. The trouble with practising Beethoven in the spare bedroom, you see, is the lack of connection. No one is listening; no one is accompanying. It&apos;s an intellectual yet lifeless exercise, like learning a language you will never speak. Through YouTube, that social link is partially revived. I may be practising Tan Dun in the spare bedroom, but I can feel all those other frustrated musicians doing likewise, in cities and suburbs from Alabama to Tokyo.  As it was, I fell at the first hurdle, rejected early on by judges from the LSO. Their loss, I say. But there is still one way my contribution could go further. YouTube has promised to turn a selection of entries into a digital mash-up performance of Eroica. I&apos;m hoping they include me. I&apos;d like to be able to say I was there, a member of the world&apos;s first truly global cyber-orchestra. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 5 March 2009. Our writer&apos;s fond recollection of having played a Mahler violin concerto at university was mistaken; Mahler never composed a violin concerto."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I remember him buying me a pint of Guinness after the marathon at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "National newspapers", "Media", "The Guardian"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-04T00:40:00Z", "title": "Athletics: Lord Sebastian Coe leads tributes to the Guardian's John Rodda, doyen of athletics correspondents", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/04/lord-sebastian-coe-tributes-john-rodda", "article": "Lord Sebastian Coe led the tributes last night to the former Guardian athletics correspondent John Rodda, who has died after a long illness. Rodda covered nine Olympic Games for the Guardian from 1960-1992 and was unrivalled in the field for his knowledge of athletics and sports politics. He was 78. Rodda wrote a history of the Olympic Games with Lord Killanin, the president of the International Olympic Committee from 1972-80, and was a member of the IOC press commission, on which he served for 18 years. &quot;It&apos;s a great sadness that John won&apos;t be there to see the 2012 Games,&quot; said Coe, a former Olympic gold medallist who is chairman of the London 2012 organising committee. &quot;He will be there in spirit ... but we won&apos;t have the pleasure of seeing him, peering at us over those glasses. &quot;He was, quite simply, the doyen of athletics writers. I first met him when I was 18 at a junior northern squad meeting. The thing about John was that he absolutely loved athletics. He had an absolute passion for it. We also shared a love of boxing \u2013 he was a great boxing writer, too \u2013 and from that moment we shared many great conversations about the two sports. &quot;He was also very influential on the International Olympic Committee, very close to Lord Killanin, and he was one of the people who opened that world up to me. I was the first athlete to address the IOC and he was very helpful to me in that. When the sports minister, Neil Macfarlane, asked me in 1984 to chair a commission on how we could improve our Olympic performance, I agreed on the basis that I could have whoever I wanted on the panel. John was the first person I asked to join me. &quot;In 1985 the report was due in and John and I were still working furiously on drafts three hours before I was due to run in the Golden Mile in Oslo. I left him tapping away and went to race. Steve Cram ran a 1500 metres from another planet and took my world record and John reported my demise with a pure professionalism, not mentioning what we had been up to hours earlier.&quot; Cram paid tribute to Rodda&apos;s approach to his job. &quot;John was one of the elder statesman of athletics journalism,&quot; he said. &quot;He very much typified the old tradition of values and respect when it came to those he wrote about. An incredibly knowledgeable man who was very much respected by his peers and athletes alike as well as a real gent. However, John was never frightened to ask the difficult questions. I&apos;ll remember fondly the days in the mid-eighties when, as athletes, we could enjoy the company of journalists, and John was certainly one of those.&quot; In 1988 Rodda won the British sports journalism award for sports reporter of the year. Alan Pascoe, a 4x400m silver medallist at the 1972 Olympics, recalled the depth of Rodda&apos;s knowledge. &quot;John was a consummate sports journalist who had as deep a knowledge of athletics and sports politics as anyone I&apos;ve ever met,&quot; Pascoe said. &quot;In the days when athletes had a group of journalists who travelled everywhere with the British team, John was always there with us and was always a genuine help, often telling us information about opponents we knew little about.&quot; Rodda&apos;s personable manner was also recalled by Ron Hill, a former world record holder over 25km. &quot;John was a great man,&quot; he said. &quot;I remember him buying me a pint of Guinness after the marathon at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. I was very thirsty after that run and I thought it a very nice gesture. That sums up the camaraderie of those days, you don&apos;t get that any more between athletes and journalists. He represents a long gone era that I regret has passed. He was to my mind one of the great writers on athletics. We don&apos;t have his like around these days.&quot;Brendan Foster, an Olympic bronze medallist in 1976 and now a BBC commentator, said Rodda would be &quot;sadly missed&quot;. &quot;I thought he was a great journalist who had a deep knowledge of athletics, in particular the Olympics. He was always fair and impartial, and brought the understanding of our sport to a generation of readers.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Towa Tei Along with Fantastic Plastic Machine, Towa Tei&apos;s merging of jazz, house, pop and electro helped ignite the 1990s Tokyo dance scene that came to be known as Shibuya-kei, a sound that&apos;s today as synonymous with the metropolis as the neon skylines and its futuristic fashions."], "tags": ["Music", "Electronic music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-04T12:21:37Z", "title": "Turning Japanese: The Tokyo dance hit list", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/04/turning-japanese-dance-electro", "article": "Following last week&apos;s expos\u00e9 of Japan&apos;s guitar-hugging glitterati, this week our attentions turn to those at the forefront of the dance and electronic scene.

The lack of latency (lag as he called it) was because his interviewee was in the same building, not far from him. Had he been in Tokyo, for example, there would inevitably have been some lag. No one, and no technology we can conceive of yet, can outstrip the speed of light.

This is Technology Guardian \u2013 we can handle the details.Colin Hall Dundee \u2022 I am intrigued by the use of the term &quot;hologram&quot; to refer to the Musion projection system. My understanding is that the system consists of a high-definition image from a projector that is bounced off a screen and is finally displayed on a virtually transparent plastic film. This is fundamentally the same as the Pepper&apos;s Ghost effect first demonstrated in the mid 19th century. Whilst the effect is undoubtedly impressive, it is no more a hologram than is the reflection of a television screen in a window.Kit Lane, Derby Games revivalContrary to Alexander Gambotto-Burke&apos;s piece, it&apos;s really not that rare for characters to revive instantly after dying in games (Everyone&apos;s a winner in games&apos; open world, 26 February).

I think the reason many sites do not display properly with Firefox is that they are designed to work with IE, and also if you try Firefox after using IE you may have to install such things as Flash player manually. The thing about Firefox (and Opera) is that they are W3 compliant and will render the test page found at webstandards.org/action/acid2 correctly whereas IE6 mangles it. I have managed to create XHTML1.0 Strict validated pages that Firefox/Opera rendered correctly but IE6/7 failed to draw borders round table cells, see a &lt;small&gt; tag and render text across a cell spanning four others correctly.John Greaves London Email us at tech@theguardian.com"}, {"sentences": ["A 39-year-old worker received slight burns in the fire, which was quickly put out and did not cause a radiation leak, according to Tokyo Electric Power.", "The plant, in Niigata prefecture north-west of Tokyo, was shut down indefinitely after a magnitude 6.8 earthquake caused a fire and radiation leaks in July 2007.", "Japan&apos;s nuclear safety watchdog ordered Tokyo Electric to improve safety after another fire last December, but earlier this year the government approved the restarting of the No 7 reactor \u2013 the newest and least damaged of the nuclear generators \u2013 after deeming it safe.", "&quot;However, our view that safety at the No 7 reactor is restored remains unchanged.&quot; Tokyo Electric needs the approval of the prefectural government and local residents before it can restart the reactor."], "tags": ["Japan", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-05T11:42:25Z", "title": "New fire at quake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/05/japan-nuclear-power-fire", "article": "The immediate future of the world&apos;s biggest nuclear power station was in doubt today after its eighth fire since it was closed almost two years ago by an earthquake.

Police yesterday raided the offices of Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), and arrested his secretary, Takanori Okubo, on suspicion of receiving \u00a521m from Nishimatsu, a construction firm, between 2003 and 2006. The alleged donations violate laws banning companies from bankrolling individual politicians. Ozawa has been widely tipped to replace Japan&apos;s unpopular prime minister, Taro Aso, in a general election which must be held by the autumn. Aso, whose finance minister resigned last month after appearing to be drunk at a G8 press conference, is battling plunging approval ratings amid mounting criticism of his handling of the economic crisis. A recent opinion poll by the Mainichi newspaper put support for Aso at just 8%, while 25% of voters said they wanted Ozawa to be the country&apos;s next leader. Ozawa, 66, denied the funding allegations and said he had no intention of resigning. &quot;I have done nothing to be ashamed of, and the actions of my secretary were carried out properly in accordance with the political funding law,&quot; he told reporters last night. &quot;Therefore, it is not a matter of me doing this or that.&quot; But the pressure on him to stand down before he does irreparable damage to his party was expected to intensify after reports today claimed that his support group, Rikuzankai, had received as much as \u00a5300m from Nishimatsu over 10 years. The Kyodo news agency cited unnamed sources as saying that Nishimatsu gave Ozawa the money in the hope of securing contracts for public works projects in his political power base in northern Japan. Though the allegations centre on his secretary, prosecutors may also question Ozawa, dealing a further blow to his reputation just months before polling day. &quot;This unprecedented investigation comes just as we are preparing for a lower house election,&quot; he said. &quot;The authorities are using their power in a politically and legally unfair manner.&quot; It is not clear how much political capital Aso will gain from Ozawa&apos;s predicament given that a wider investigation into political funding could reveal widespread abuse among MPs across the political spectrum. But some analysts believe that even if Ozawa is exonerated, the political mud has already begun to stick. Television news shows have focused on his past life as an LDP politician who rose through the party ranks as the protege of Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister who was arrested in 1976 and later convicted of taking bribes from the Lockheed aircraft company. Ozawa was also close to Shin Kanemaru, one of the LDP&apos;s most influential postwar power brokers, who resigned in disgrace in 1992 after another bribery scandal. Go Ito, a politics professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, said Ozawa should follow his mentor&apos;s example. &quot;I think it&apos;s clear that Ozawa&apos;s secretary had a relationship with Nishimatsu that goes beyond what you would call appropriate,&quot; he said. &quot;The DPJ&apos;s reputation and policy platform is at stake, so the most efficient way to deal with this would be for him to go now.&quot; Ozawa, a capricious character with a preference for backroom deals rather than open debate, has never enjoyed the full backing of his party, a broad coalition whose members range from centre-left liberals to rightwing hawks. Potential successors include Yukio Hatoyama, the party&apos;s secretary general, who described the investigation as &quot;extremely peculiar&quot;. He said in a statement: &quot;President Ozawa has long kept extremely detailed records of political donations, and has faithfully fulfilled his accountability obligations.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;We need to learn from that and do it better in the future.&quot; King&apos;s blueprint was the result of three months&apos; intensive activity at the Bank and the Treasury, with officials seeking advice from Tokyo and analysing the lessons of the US experiment with quantitative easing in the Great Depression."], "tags": ["Recession", "Interest rates", "Credit crunch", "Bank of England", "Alistair Darling"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-05T21:13:35Z", "title": "Government begins 'printing money'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/05/recession-credit-crunch", "article": "The Bank of England today announced unprecedented steps to prevent the deepest slump since the 1930s when it unveiled plans to inject up to \u00a375bn into the economy over the next three months.

The big news from Trinidad is that England are giving Amjad Khan his debut in a five-man attack. Email your thoughts on the match, the horrific attacks on the Sri Lankan team, and anything else you fancy to Lawrence Booth, who will be here from 1.30pm.  Preamble: Afternoon all. Lawrence here. Well, who would have thought this, eh? After winning 13 of their previous 16 Tests against West Indies, England find themselves needing victory in Trinidad just to square the series and retain the Wisden Trophy that has been theirs since 2000. Were we wrong to expect an England win in advance? Two wins out of 30 for West Indies going into the series appeared to suggest not. But Ramnaresh Sarwan has gone beyond the realms of revelation and England&apos;s bowlers have looked flatter than the pitches which greeted them in Antigua and Barbados. It&apos;s crazy to think this series could be won and lost because of two hours of madness in Jamaica. But, hey, that&apos;s Test cricket. Forgot to say, on my way in to work today I saw Will Self at Vauxhall (following on from spotting Rory McGrath during the fourth Test). Just like to keep you posted...  England have recalled Monty Panesar as part of a five-man attack That Here&apos;s the team in full: 1 Andrew Strauss, 2 Alastair Cook, 3 Owais Shah, 4 Kevin Pietersen, 5 Paul Collingwood, 6 Matt Prior (wk), 7 Stuart Broad, 8 Graeme Swann, 9 James Anderson, 10 Amjad Khan, 11 Monty Panesar.  The toss: Strauss calls heads. It is heads. And England will bat - for the fifth time out of five in this series. Good start. Before I forget, this means Ravi Bopara has been left out after making a hundred in Barbados. On the basis that they want to give Owais Shah a run at No3, that makes sense. I&apos;m a bit uneasy about Matt Prior as high as No6, but I guess England don&apos;t want to be left short of bowlers as they were in Barbados, where Ryan Sidebottom wasn&apos;t fit.  West Indies are without Jerome Taylor, who is injured, and they&apos;re playing the extra batsman in Lendl Simmons, who made 280-odd in a tour match against England earlier in the trip. Lionel Baker comes in and Sulieman Benn misses out. West Indies will bat very deep indeed (Denesh Ramdin is at No8) but could be short on bowling. You can tell which team is trying to win this game and which is trying to avoid losing it.  Interesting: The Queen&apos;s Park Oval isn&apos;t renowned for helping spinners, which may explain why Benn has been given the heave-ho. But England, having refused to pick two twirlers on the flat ones in Antigua and Barbados, have finally yielded on a pitch that may not be ideal. Like Duncan Fletcher I&apos;m not sure about Broad at No7 and Swann at 8 - especially if the ball really does seam around. Never has a solid opening partnership been more crucial than it is today (to indulge in a spot of hyperbole). &quot;I see your Rory McGrath and Will Self and raise you Pamela Anderson who I saw while I was out on a date last night,&quot; says Will Cook. &quot;Not sure if pointing to Ms Anderson and saying &quot;look Pamela Anderson&quot; to my date was a wise idea or not. Guess I&apos;ll find out if she emails me today.&quot;  Amjad Khan &quot;We hope it&apos;s not another Darren Pattinson,&quot; says Bob Willis cheerfully. Charlotte Rich, meanwhile, has other concerns. &quot;Young Mr Khan looks more like a ballet dancer than a bowler in that picture of him. Do you think this means we can expect a dying swan if the match does not go well? Though of course that&apos;s a woman&apos;s part, and I wouldn&apos;t like to imply he is effeminate before the game&apos;s even started...&quot;  Most importantly of all Gary Naylor is not sure. &quot;Hmm\u2026 Amjad Khan. I wonder what Kabir Ali (younger, but with almost twice as many first-class wickets at a much superior average and strike rate) thinks of that selection. Hoggy too. Darren Pattinson Mark II if you ask me.&quot; And we do, Gary. We do!  Five bowlers or four? George Young sums up what I feel. &quot;So on a flat wicket, we played four bowlers, yet on a result wicket we&apos;re playing five bowlers? That sounds like the selection policy of a team that knows what it&apos;s doing and where it&apos;s going.&quot;  More celebs &quot;Gyles Brandreth, on the E8 bus, on Wednesday night, confused about where Brentford station was,&quot; says Mike Rogers with a triumphant flourish.  Pitch news: Nasser says it&apos;s &quot;very, very dry - no dampness at all&quot;. He thinks cracks may open up as the game progresses, but that the pitch will be slow and low. Isn&apos;t that the modern template for Caribbean pitches? Anyway, sounds like it was better to win the toss than lose it.  Grim news: &quot;James Whitaker is on the radio again,&quot; says Will Horwood. &quot;And has just said &apos;Going forward&apos; again. I was hoping Boycott would come on and give him some forthright advice, along the lines of &apos;do one&apos;.&quot;  Willis reckons this is a &quot;pretty weak-looking West Indian attack&quot;, and you have to agree. They&apos;ve got three quicks, of which one - Baker - is playing his second Test, and what else? Some left-arm filth from Ryan Hinds and Brendan Nash, plus Sarwan&apos;s ropey leggies. &quot;Trevor Brooking, near Tottenham Court Road last week,&quot; says David Spring, tossing his chips on the table. &quot;He looked like he&apos;s been lunching well recently.&quot;  1st over: England 3-0 (Strauss 1, Cook 2) Right, here goes, and Strauss immediately tucks a loosener from Fidel Edwards to long leg for a single. These two have been among the few bright spots for England on this tour: three hundreds and a ninety between them, even if the runs did come on flatties. Cook gets going with a firm push for two off his hip and Edwards is taking a while to find his rhythm. &quot;Ellen MacArthur, this morning, getting off the train at Waterloo and going down to the tube,&quot; says Lawrence Aggleton. &quot;Suffice to say I don&apos;t think she was trying to break the Waterloo-Bank speed record.&quot;  2nd over: England 11-0 (Strauss 9, Cook 2) Daren Powell is a lucky man. Had Taylor not picked up an injury, he would almost certainly have been left out here: his five wickets in the series have cost 67 each, and Strauss duly cuts his first ball for four. That should do Powell&apos;s fragile confidence the world of good, and Strauss repeats the dose off the last ball of the over. Poor. &quot;Just to put this Test into Ashes context,&quot; says Alex Webster, &quot;Australia are currently 259 for 2, sorry make that 259 for 3, with a 20-year-old in only his second Test having scored a blistering hundred against supposedly the best attack in world cricket. But hey, I&apos;m sure Amjad Khan will do fine.&quot;  3rd over: England 14-0 (Strauss 11, Cook 3) Gayle is dispensing with his short leg already: an indication of a lack of bounce, perhaps. Because if you&apos;re not going to have a man there for Edwards - the most hostile bowler on either side in this series - you&apos;re not going to have one for anyone. There are three slips, though, as Edwards settles into a better line to Strauss, who gets into line himself to punch two runs to the off-side of the stumps. Nice shot. &quot;Boycott just claimed that he tries to think what the listeners are thinking,&quot; says El Rose. &quot;I guarantee he does not have the self-awareness to be thinking what I thought.&quot;  4th over: England 18-0 (Strauss 11, Cook 7) West Indies can&apos;t afford Powell to have another off-day because their only other seamer beyond the new-ball pair is the inexperienced Baker. Cozier is already talking about &quot;ominous signs&quot;, which may be the weary voice of a long-suffering Windies follower. Or it may be the truth, at which point Cook slashes the last ball of the over - a dross-like half-tracker - over the slips for four. &quot;I don&apos;t like this famous-person spotting game,&quot; says Ian Palmer. &quot;I live in London village and there are never ever any here so I can&apos;t contribute. I did used to deliver a paper to Roy Walker once though \u2013 he lives in Lytham don&apos;t you know.&quot;  5th over: England 19-0 (Strauss 12, Cook 7) Strauss looks to be in positive mood again, as he was in Antigua (169) and Barbados (142), and tucks a single off his legs as Edwards strays once more. No alarms yet for England, despite Cook&apos;s nibble at a wide one that barely bounces above ankle height. Don&apos;t say we&apos;re in for another bore draw. Please don&apos;t say it. &quot;I see Eastenders&apos; Dr Legg on a pretty much daily basis on the bus,&quot; brags Andy Gledhill. &quot;He has very hairy ears - beat that!&quot; I think we may struggle.  6th over: England 22-0 (Strauss 13, Cook 9) Strauss nudges Powell in front of point for a quick single and you get the strange feeling West Indies are already on the defensive. One team is desperate for victory; the other petrified of defeat. It&apos;s like the resistible force versus the moveable object as Cook cover-drives for two. &quot;A couple of weeks ago I sat two feet away from Kiefer Sutherland in a curry house,&quot; says Garreth Rule. &quot;Quite a disconcerting experience knowing that if he was Jack Bauer he could have tortured me with nothing but the mango chutney and naan bread.&quot; I dare say.  7th over: England 22-0 (Strauss 13, Cook 9) &quot;What&apos;s less than nothing?&quot; muses Michael Holding. &quot;Whatever it is, it&apos;s in this pitch.&quot; That&apos;s enough for Beefy to use his first &quot;strange&quot; of the day, and he&apos;s talking - needless to say - about West Indies&apos; selection of three bowlers. Back at the ranch it&apos;s Edwards to Strauss - or maybe to Ramdin, who does very well to prevent four leg-side byes. The camera zooms in on Sulieman Benn, left out here and now sitting by himself by an advertising hoarding. He looks very sombre indeed. A maiden. &quot;I saw Zach Dingle from Emmerdale in a mini market in Corfu,&quot; says David Smeath, in no way scraping the barrel. &quot;He was buying breakfast cereal.&quot;  WICKET! Cook c Ramdin b Powell 12 (26-1) A good ball that. Cook is squared up by one that leaves him and Powell can hardly believe it. Nor can I. &quot;Hey, Kiefer Sutherland and Dr Legg get a mention?&quot; rages Thomas Carver. &quot;I sat next to KEANU REEVES.&quot; Oh really?  8th over: England 26-1 (Strauss 14, Shah 0) I know it&apos;s unfair to say Owais Shah is under pressure, but I just don&apos;t think he&apos;s the answer to the No3 conundrum. Anyway, better give the bloke a chance, I guess. &quot;I walked square into Jordan&apos;s assets on the streets of Brighton a few weeks ago,&quot; says Alasdair Thompson. &quot;Luckily there were no injuries due to the cushioned impact.&quot;  9th over: England 27-1 (Strauss 15, Shah 0) Strauss pushes Edwards for a rapid single to mid-on, and Shah is looking as anxious as ever. He thinks briefly about going after a widish awayswinger from Edwards, then remembers he qould quite like to play in the Ashes. &quot;After never seeing anyone famous despite working in South Ken, I managed on the same day last week to spot both foodie enthusiast and cheffy type Nigel Slater and everyone&apos;s favorite bow tie wearing fertility expert Lord Robert Winston,&quot; says Anna Seddon. &quot;He was having a coffee in my work canteen. He&apos;s very smiley\u2026&quot;  10th over: England 32-1 (Strauss 20, Shah 0) Powell overpitches and Strauss eases him to mid-off&apos;s left for four, before adding a single to mid-on next ball. He&apos;s looking the mood again. What a series he&apos;s had since Jamaica. &quot;I saw Kiefer Sutherland in a newsagents near Soho a month or so back,&quot; says Elizabeth Connor. &quot;My friend was jabbering excitedly while I said too loudly as we left &quot;that bloke looks really like Jack Bauer&quot; before a second glance showed me how firmly my foot was in my mouth. He just seemed faintly amused.&quot; He&apos;s clearly the man of the moment.  11th over: England 33-1 (Strauss 21, Shah 0) Edwards (5-1-8-0) is replaced by Lionel Baker, the 24-year-old from Montserrat playing in his second Test (he took 0 for 85 in the first, against New Zealand at Dunedin in December). He&apos;s got a slightly disjointed action - mechanical, almost - and Holding describes him as &quot;military medium&quot;. Strauss has a brief look, then nudges his fifth ball to midwicket for a single. &quot;In the 10 months that I&apos;ve been in London I&apos;ve seen Lucy Liu taking tea at the Wolseley, Ralph Fiennes enjoying dinner with a mystery brunette at St John (we both had the grouse, though he wasn&apos;t tearing into it with his bare hands as I would have expected), and David Walliams in worse seats than mine at Bill Bailey&apos;s Tinselworm,&quot; says Liz Campbell. &quot;On a cricketing note, I also once saw Shane Warne at a Coldplay concert. I had better seats than Shane Warne too, although he got invited backstage.&quot;  12th over: England 34-1 (Strauss 22, Shah 0) Strauss pulls Powell for a single, although that ball hardly got up at all. And then Shah edges just in front of Gayle at first slip. Holding and Botham point out immediately that the slips are standing too far back. Signs of improvement here by Powell. Good on him. &quot;I saw Alice Cooper in Montreal the other day,&quot; says Alex McGillivray. &quot;The guy is minuscule.&quot;  13th over: England 39-1 (Strauss 27, Shah 0) Baker strays onto Strauss&apos;s pads and the England captain barely needs a first invitation, let alone a second: four through square-leg. Strauss follows that with another push for one to the left of mid-on, and it&apos;s important here that England - their keeper batting at No6 - get to lunch without further damage. Shah is denied a shackles-breaker by some smart fielding at mid-on and then he tries to hit a cover-drive too hard. Calm, Owais, calm! &quot;I saw John Torode in Balham Waitrose a couple of weeks ago,&quot; says Susan Perry. &quot;I can&apos;t say I was impressed by the contents of his basket!&quot;  14th over: England 40-1 (Strauss 28, Shah 0) Powell resumes after the first drinks break of the day and Strauss is watchful. Since Shah is yet to score at the other end (off 12 balls), the skip may be feeling the responsibility. A long single to deep cover spoils the potential maiden. &quot;My mum just had the parents of Gavin from Gavin and Stacey round for dinner,&quot; says Sam Lister. &quot;They used to go to school together. Apparently he&apos;s going to be in a new film called Two Lesbians and a Vampire. My mum asked what it was about.&quot;  15th over: England 42-1 (Strauss 30, Shah 0) Strauss drives Baker through extra cover for two, even if it was slightly on the up. The slight element of risk suggests Strauss is not going to look any horses in the mouth, gift or otherwise. He&apos;s in danger of setting the tone for the third Test in succession. &quot;I don&apos;t want to blow all the other entries out the water,&quot; says Zadok Prescott, &quot;but I went to a supper-party which Daniel Beddingfield gate-crashed.&quot; I&apos;m reeling.  16th over: England 42-1 (Strauss 30, Shah 0) Shah finally has the strike. He&apos;s been in since the eighth over and hardly had a sniff. Powell nips one back into his pads, but umpire Tiffin says not out and rightly so: that was going over the top. Shah is getting twitchy now, and pulls a length ball to short midwicket as if to prove the point. &quot;Balham Waitrose?? Coldplay concert? South Ken? Grouse?? What on earth is going on here?&quot; exclaims Adam White. &quot;Surely Guardian readers must have spotted someone famous in the working men&apos;s of late?&quot; Y&apos;reckon?  17th over: England 44-1 (Strauss 31, Shah 1) Strauss works Baker for a quick single and then Shah, in his utter desperation to score a run after 19 dot balls drops it into the off-side and sets off, despite the fact the ball was played straight to Ryan Hinds. Strauss reacts hesitantly - and would have been run out if Hinds&apos; under-arm had hit. Tsk. &quot;I met someone called Gordon Bennett earlier,&quot; points out Ian Palmer.  18th over: England 57-1 (Strauss 35, Shah 9) Shah celebrates almost running out his captain with a gorgeous straight-drive for four off Powell followed by a flashing drive through extra-cover for four more. Poor ball in truth, but you&apos;ve still got to hit &apos;em. A leg-bye follows, before Strauss works two runs off his hip. They&apos;re starting to enjoy Powell now, and Strauss picks up a couple more as I write those very words: 13 off the over. Here&apos;s Sam Hedges: &quot;2002. M1 services (northbound). Charlie Dimmock.&quot;  19th over: England 57-1 (Strauss 35, Shah 9) Shah gets hold of a square-cut off Baker, but it&apos;s straight to Hinds at point. Half an hour to go before lunch now and England won&apos;t be unhappy with their morning&apos;s work thus far. &quot;Never mind meeting famous people, sharing a name with the current Sports Personality of the Year is getting rather tiresome,&quot; says Chris Hoy. &quot;No I won&apos;t get &apos;on my bike&apos;.&quot;  20th over: England 57-1 (Strauss 35, Shah 9) It&apos;s Brendan Nash - on the opening morning of a Test for goodness&apos; sake. Still, as I&apos;ve said before, he&apos;s reasonably accurate and you sure as hell don&apos;t want to get out to him. Strauss duly digs out a yorker with an almost-sheepish grin. The other five deliveries are all greeted by firm drives which are intercepted by one of the several hundred off-side fielders. Another maiden. &quot;I arrived at Robertsbridge Station on the afternoon of the McCartney divorce, only to notice that my fellow disembarking passengers included\u2026 HMM herself, still in that grismal comedy jester suit,&quot; says Juliet Harris. &quot;Just goes to show, even the super-rich need the train to take the strain at times...&quot;  21st over: England 63-1 (Strauss 35, Shah 15) Shah ends the mini-drought with an uppish cut for four off Baker. That could have gone anywhere; fortunately for Shah it flew between gully and point. The next shot is a better one: two off his pads between midwicket and mid-on. &quot;Stepping outside London for a minute, if I may, years ago I saw David Starkey having a nose around the new Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh,&quot; says Matthew Boynton in Tokyo. &quot;This was shortly after he had dismissed all Scottish history as an irrelevence. I longed to shake him by the hand but was far too star-struck.&quot;  22nd over: England 63-1 (Strauss 35, Shah 15) Nash continues. Imagine if Nash bowled to himself. Paint-drying and grass-growing would give the spectacle a run for its money. Strauss gets hold of another meaty off-drive, but Gayle knows where to place his fielders when this guy&apos;s bowling: in a little ring on the off-side. Another Nash maiden. &quot;I shared several JDs &amp; cokes with none other than Lemmy (of Motorhead fame) at a bar in Soho,&quot; says Mark Francome. &quot;What a gregarious gent he is.&quot;  23rd over: England 63-1 (Strauss 35, Shah 15) Shah ushers an inswinger from Baker over his stumps - a brave leave. Australia, meanwhile, have closed the first day of the second Test at Durban on 303 for 4 (hundreds for both openers, Phil Hughes and Simon Katich). As things stand, they&apos;re favourites for the Ashes. Another maiden. &quot;Having lost my job in the credit crunch I have come out to the French Alps for the season,&quot; says Alex Campbell. &quot;Retirement is fantastic: I have just come in from an epic day&apos;s powder skiing to turn on the first day&apos;s play, every ball of which I intend to watch. This is not altogether dissimilar from what I hope heaven might be like.&quot; One problem: Nash is bowling.  24th over: England 69-1 (Strauss 40, Shah 16) Nash finally loses his line and Strauss is more than grateful to whip him through midwicket for four. Nash lets out an anguished cry: normally he can locate pff-stump at 70mph in his sleep. A thick inside edge then yields a single to square-leg, but Shah keeps the strike with a work to wide mid-on. &quot;I met Sean Bean in a pub in Sheffield and let&apos;s just say his good looks are let down by his personality,&quot; says Paula Finn.  25th over: England 70-1 (Strauss 40, Shah 17) Gayle brings himself on to relieve Baker (a not untidy 7-2-16-0) with 10 minutes to go before lunch, but Shah can&apos;t get him away until he drives the fifth ball to long-on for a single. &quot;Can we bin all the celeb spot stuff and get back to the important issues of the day?&quot; says Simon Thomas. &quot;Did Will Cook&apos;s date of last night (way down the bottom before play started) email him today? Does he need any help/encouragement?&quot;  26th over: England 72-1 (Strauss 41, Shah 18) Nash to Shah, who resists a couple of tempters outside off before nudging a single to square-leg. England are in danger of drying up here: not what they need in a game they must win. &quot;To follow up on the recent post on Sean Bean,&quot; says Simon Maddan, &quot;I saw him at the Lord&apos;s Test against New Zealand last year getting the beers in and he was on cracking form.&quot; Never let it be said we don&apos;t aim for balance at the Guardian.  27th over: England 74-1 (Strauss 42, Shah 19) Strauss tucks Gayle behind square on the leg-side for a single before Shah returns the favour. There&apos;s a bit of rain in the distance beyond the hills, but no threat to the Queen&apos;s Park Oval yet. There&apos;ll be time for one more over before lunch. &quot;While working as a Saturday deli assistant in the now closed Safeways in Ealing I had the misfortune of meet Jim Davidson,&quot; says Elisha Peters. &quot;He filmed us eating different foods from around Europe and made his usual comments. Alas the programme never aired.&quot;  28th over: England 74-1 (Strauss 42, Shah 19) Ryan Hinds will bowl the last over before lunch and Shah is unlikely to have a wild wipe now. An inevitable maiden and that&apos;s it for the morning. It&apos;s been increasingly turgid stuff but England will probably take that. Before I disappear for 40 minutes, one final email... &quot;After a reunion with some Uni mates in the North East,&quot; says Shane Lawlor, &quot;I was getting the train back to London and ended up sitting opposite Paul Collingwood, until he got kicked out of the seat by some other passenger somewhere near York and had to stand all the way to London. He was very open and honest with his answers.&quot;  LUNCH  Right, the players are about to emerge. I&apos;m very grateful for all the celeb tales, but I&apos;d like us to change tack between now and tea. Following on from this article in today&apos;s G2 about the death of the lunch, I want to hear your credit-crunch woes: how exactly have you been saving money?  29th over: England 76-1 (Strauss 44, Shah 19) Edwards resumes the attack after lunch and England need to crack on here. Bob Willis has just conjectured that the sluggish surface combined with the fact that the Windies have chosen only three front-line bowlers suggests they came into this game with a draw in mind. If that&apos;s the case I hope England make them pay for their negativity as Strauss works a couple through midwicket. &quot;Being a postgraduate student, my money woes are less connected with the credit crunch than with the complete absence of state funding,&quot; says Will Horwood, &quot;but in order to save money I&apos;ve ceased shopping in Costcutter, which is very misleadingly named...&quot;  30th over: England 76-1 (Strauss 44, Shah 19) John Matthews writes in to explain in great detail why I should have referred to the &quot;recession&quot; rather than the &quot;credit crunch&quot;. I stand corrected. West Indies, meanwhile, have shown their intent by beginning with Nash at the other end from Edwards. Oh good grief. They&apos;ve done England like a kipper here: there&apos;s no life in this pitch at all. A maiden to Shah. &quot;My credit-crunch-busting tip?&quot; asks Paul Franklin, completely ignoring John Matthews. &quot;Buying &apos;sweetened multigrain hoops&apos; rather than Cheerios. I can get through 6 or 7 bowls of the stuff while watching a day&apos;s cricket and have been very impressed with the quality of the much cheaper imitation.&quot;  31st over: England 78-1 (Strauss 45, Shah 19) Edwards is bowling wide of off-stump to Strauss, who just can&apos;t time the ball on this strip. There&apos;s no pace and no bounce, and the ball just dribbles off the toe-end. A big no-ball adds a welcome single to the otherwise static scoreboard and Beefy isn&apos;t happy with the state of the pitch. I guess you could say that West Indies haven&apos;t won a series for so long they&apos;ll try anything to end the sequence. Would England really have behaved any differently? Strauss is doing his best to get it away, but not a lot is happening until he drives the final ball down the ground for a single. &quot;I have saved my money by taking a two week holiday to the Philippines,&quot; says Brough Cooper. &quot;It didn&apos;t work!&quot;  32nd over: England 80-1 (Strauss 47, Shah 19) Meaningless stat of the day: Nash&apos;s first ball in that over was the four-millionth delivery in Test cricket. Has it come to this? Strauss does his best to distract from the anoraks by whipping Nash through midwicket for two - and is then almost run out as he sets off for a single to short third man. Devon Smith fields superbly, but then misses with a shy at all three stumps with Strauss stranded. &quot;I only buy beer that&apos;s on special offer AND I now make my lunch,&quot; says Lucy Morris. &quot;Do I get a medal?&quot;  33rd over: England 81-1 (Strauss 47, Shah 19) Edwards oversteps again, which is good because Shah is showing little inclination to get after him. He&apos;s played out a fair few maidens. &quot;Paul Franklin is right to substitute cereal for all meals in the day in a bid to save money,&quot; says Andrew Kelly. &quot;Shake things up though by mixing and matching. Weetabix and Crunchy Nut corn flakes (replace with supermarket own brands) go well together.&quot;  34th over: England 82-1 (Strauss 48, Shah 19) Strauss drives Nash to deep cover for a single, which is the signal for Shah to fail to emerge from his shell at all. Gaaaaah! Five dot balls of mind-numbing predictability. &quot;I listen to the radio, and every time Boycott mentions how in his day they had uncovered pitches, I put 2p in a jar,&quot; cackles Erik Petersen. &quot;I am now worth \u00a31.8m.&quot;  35th over: England 83-1 (Strauss 48, Shah 19) Strauss helps Edwards round the corner for a single. Daryl Harper isn&apos;t sure whether he hit it, so he asks Strauss. Being an honest sort, Strauss says no, at which point Harper signals a leg-bye. Lovely. Shah hasn&apos;t scored since lunch and at this rate I&apos;m beginning to doubt whether he&apos;ll score before tea. &quot;To correct John Matthews,&quot; says Alex Campbell, &quot;I lost my job more as a result of the dislocation in credit markets (the &quot;crunch&quot;) than from the recession which it preceded and helped cause. I&apos;m not grumbling though, as I never used to be able to watch this much Test-match cricket.&quot;  36th over: England 84-1 (Strauss 49, Shah 19) At least Strauss is putting bat to ball: there&apos;s another single to extra cover off Nash. This is awful from Shah, just awful. He just can&apos;t get Nash away. &quot;I realised it was getting serious yesterday when I deliberately bought a bottle of single malt just because it was a five-pounds-off deal,&quot; whimpers John Starbuck. &quot;Of course, I&apos;m also saving money by not subscribing to Sky. Lots of people must be listening to TMS and reading the OBO too.&quot;  37th over: England 86-1 (Strauss 49, Shah 19) Strauss is having a go at a couple of wide ones from Edwards, but the only additions to this increasingly grim England effort is another no-ball followed by an off-side wide. That wide sums up the Windies approach: utterly negative. They&apos;re playing for the draw already. Dismal. &quot;Six of us would normally go for three days but through a combination of cost, demand and organisational shambles I have saved a small fortune by only managing to get two tickets for day at an Ashes Test,&quot; says Christopher Stanwell.  38th over: England 90-1 (Strauss 49, Shah 23) Thirty-eight minutes after lunch, Shah scores his first runs of the session, hammering Nash past mid-off for four. But he does not seem to have the ability - on this pitch at least - to manoeuvre the ball for singles. For a bloke who opens the face of the blade as a matter of course, this seems odd. &quot;I have managed to save us a lot of money by accidentally arranging our summer holiday in such a way that we can not go the Test against Australia at The Oval,&quot; says Eva Maaten. &quot;Since we live in Brussels that is a substantial saving... it didn&apos;t make my husband very happy, though \u2013 nor myself when I found out what I had done...  39th over: England 91-1 (Strauss 50, Shah 23) Gayle replaces Edwards, whose spell of 10-2-15-0 does not tell half the picture. Anyway, Strauss drags him to long-on for the single that brings up another half-century - it&apos;s not his most fluent of the series, but this pitch is something else. Shah, needless to say, can make nothing of the rest of the over. &quot;Sadly I find that buying bottled beer in Germany with a deposit of 25 cents and returning the bottles in Luxembourg collecting a deposit of 30 cents helps,&quot; admits Stephen Nye, our most ingenious tight-wad yet.  40th over: England 98-1 (Strauss 57, Shah 23) Strauss shows the way forward by using his feet to Nash and helping his stock ball through midwicket for four. That&apos;s more like it! A bit of initiative. And then Strauss edges just in front of Gayle at slip and away for two. Signs that the England captain has decided to step on it. He&apos;s certainly not getting much help from his mate at the other end. A chop for one to deepish cover keeps Strauss the strike. &quot;Excellent \u2013 and apologies to you \u2013 the pot is duly stirred,&quot; says John Matthews. &quot;I can only be grateful to Alex Campbell for knowing the difference between the two, and of course for him any money saving is due to the crunch. But for most it&apos;s the recession. I claim not that people are financially unaffected by the crunch, just that we should have some idea of how our own finances work and which bits might be squished by the crunch and which squeezed by the recession. Still, any correction missiles are welcomed.&quot; Ye gads.  41st over: England 102-1 (Strauss 60, Shah 24) Strauss gets away with an attempted turn to leg off Gayle which ends with the ball looping just wide of the sub fielder Dwayne Bravo at short midwicket. That would have been an unworthy end. Shah, meanwhile, dusts off his second scoring shot in 50 minutes since lunch with a push down the ground for a single to bring up England&apos;s 100, at which point Strauss digs out a quicker ball past slip for two. &quot;I find you save on water bills if you only flush the toilet when it&apos;s completely full,&quot; says James Andrews.  42nd over: England 104-1 (Strauss 61, Shah 25) OK, so West Indies have made it fairly clear they have no interest in winning this game and shame on them. But are England good enough to force the pace? The evidence so far suggests not - a state of affairs for which Shah is a lot more culpable than Strauss. Nash continues, an emblem of West Indies&apos; limited intentions, and Shah tucks him behind square-leg for a rare single. Strauss chops another to deep point and Nash has now bowled more overs than anyone today. &quot;Top tip,&quot; says Ed Genochio. &quot;Cut out the milk on your Weetabix - use water instead. You get used to it.&quot;  43rd over: England 115-1 (Strauss 67, Shah 27) Shah sweeps Gayle for a single before Shah adds a couple of leg-byes, then chops a single into the covers off a no-ball. A couple of singles follow, and then Strauss sweeps very fine for four: 11 off the over is much better. &quot;Do you think that Strauss and Shah are feeling inhibited because England have only picked five front-line batmen, which puts extra pressure on each one of them to perform?&quot; asks Andy Leal. Possibly. I think the pitch and the negative line bowled by West Indies&apos; bowlers has had just as much to do with it. Not to mention Shah&apos;s own caution. To think England have left out a centurion to accommodate him.  44th over: England 119-1 (Strauss 70, Shah 28) Shah turns Nash to long leg for a single with a well-timed flick of the wrists, and Strauss provides a mirror-image, except he collects two as Ramdin has to make up for the lack of a fielder behind square on the leg-side to field the ball himself. But there are signs that these two are starting to get the hang of conditions. And that&apos;ll be drinks: England have added 45 runs since lunch, of which Shah has contributed nine. &quot;I see the recession as the perfect excuse for us more frugal chaps to &quot;trade down&quot; (I believe this is the correct management speak),&quot; says Nick Hughes. &quot;I&apos;m off on a date tonight and whereas I&apos;d usually dust off the Top Man two-piece and Eternity For Men, tonight it&apos;s comfy slacks, Hi Tecs and Slazenger Sport all the way. Just hope I can locate that Prezzo voucher in time.&quot; She&apos;s a lucky girl, whoever she is.  45th over: England 122-1 (Strauss 72, Shah 29) Baker replaces Gayle, heaven be praised, and he&apos;s cut straight away for a single by Strauss. It&apos;s time for Shah to move through the gears now after clogging up one end for most of his innings and he starts the second half of the day by tucking Baker behind square-leg for a single. Strauss then pushes a single down the ground, but Shah is going nowhere. He&apos;s saved by Simmons&apos;s fumble at mid-on, which allows Strauss to trot through for a single. That was Strauss&apos;s call. &quot;James Andrews (41st over) makes an excellent point,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;In the 150,000-strong hippie commune that I accidentally live in, it&apos;s called, &apos;If it&apos;s yellow, let it mellow; if it&apos;s brown, flush it down.&apos;&quot; Delightful.  46th over: England 127-1 (Strauss 77, Shah 29) Strauss cuts Nash for four then whacks a high and wide full-toss straight to the man at deep cover. That should have been a no-ball: it arrived at Strauss well above waist height. He eventually makes do with a single to midwicket. &quot;Many thanks to John Matthews for his gracious response,&quot; says Alex Campbell. &quot;If he needs any help where he works I would be delighted to send him my CV. I qualified as a lawyer in 2004 and I was awarded the CFA charter in 2008. If I end up working for him, then I think you, Lawrence, may earn a finder&apos;s fee.&quot; You know where to find me.  47th over: England 132-1 (Strauss 82, Shah 29) Hats off to Strauss today. The conditions are awful and West Indies&apos; approach depressingly negative, but he keeps looking for the scoring opportunity. It&apos;s almost been a one-man job today - and there&apos;s four more, courtesy of a glorious cut off Baker. He then keeps the strike with a dab into the covers. Hell, it&apos;s as if he&apos;s decided that if a job&apos;s worth doing properly, do it yourself. &quot;My grasp of economics is admittedly shaky,&quot; says Rob Jackson, &quot;but surely were we all to cover our cornflakes in water then we would remain in a permanent state of calcium deficient recession. Much like blocking out on the first day of a Test match you need to win. How about some examples of leading from the front and blowing copious amounts of cash on unnecessary goods or services?&quot;  47.2 overs: England 133-1 (Strauss 83, Shah 29 retired hurt) Nash is still bowling and he&apos;s into his 14th over now - a period of time I will never be able to claw back. Strauss cuts for a single to move to within 17 of a fifth Test century in 11 proper innings (that 7 not out at the Sir Viv doesn&apos;t count). And now play is held up because Shah is suffering from an old ailment: cramp. It&apos;s happened to him on his Test debut in Mumbai in 2006 and it&apos;s haunted him from time to time. He&apos;s in real pain as the physio grapples with his digits. There&apos;s plenty of orange liquid being consumed now as well. But Shah is retiring hurt after scoring 29 off 115 balls... &quot;Flushing toilets is a waste of money,&quot; says Chris Brock. &quot;Simply use a bag and at the end of the week \u2013 hey presto \u2013 your own ready-made fertiliser. Which you can either sell on or use to cultivate your own vegetable garden.&quot;  48th over: England 133-1 (Strauss 83, Pietersen 0) It feels harsh to say it when Shah is having trouble with his fingers, but England&apos;s best hope of scoring at a decent rate at both ends was to get him off the pitch. Kevin Pietersen is the ideal replacement - and his first task is to deal with Nash&apos;s 70mph dobbers. Then Nash goes up for a huge lbw shout - and Tiffin raises his finger. Terrible decision - it pitched outside leg, and Pietersen rightly refers it. Not out. Poor Nash - he was cock-a-hoop. Radio contact is broken between Aleem Dar and Tiffin, so Dar leaves his TV box and signals with his arms. That was mildly farcical, but at least they arrived at the obviously correct decision. &quot;Is it not remarkably irresponsible of you to be publishing OBOers tips for scrimping and saving? I thought it was our duty to go out and spend our way back to a liquid financial state?&quot; asks Si Williams. &quot;I for one will be doing my bit towards kickstarting the economy this weekend by combining a frivolous trip to Big Town for a 1920s silent film and an overpriced meal with some posh foreign stagger juice. I&apos;ll probably take the train too, that&apos;ll inject a bit more cash into the system. And maybe leave the TV on standby. And the front door open, help yourselves while I&apos;m out, gives me an excuse to buy more clutter for the house. Getting all misty-eyed with patriotism just thinking about it...&quot;  49th over: England 134-1 (Strauss 84, Pietersen 0) That last over went on for 12 minutes, what with Shah&apos;s cramps and Tiffin&apos;s inability to do a spot of simple geometry. Yep, it&apos;s a slow old day, which is just how West Indies, their stall set for a draw, like it. Baker to Strauss, who was on a bit of a roll before those two interruptions, but almost has to play himself again with less than half an hour to go before tea. It&apos;s going to be a two-and-a-half-hour final session as Strauss drives for a gentle single to deep cover. &quot;To be honest I haven&apos;t noticed the recession at all,&quot; says Jonny Martin. &quot;I always run out of money about halfway through the pay month anyway, so running out a few days earlier doesn&apos;t really make a difference.&quot;  50th over: England 143-1 (Strauss 85, Pietersen 8) Strauss is the only player so far to have got to grips with this pitch, unless you include Nash and his tedious dobbers. Strauss eases him to deep cover for another single, at which point Pietersen calls into my question the claim of my previous sentence by hammering four runs off the back foot through extra cover and then driving the next ball down the ground for four more. &quot;Isn&apos;t it a bit embarassing getting cramp at this level?&quot; asks Andrew Sanderson. Part of the problem, I think, is that Shah grips the bat so tightly, which may be a reflection of his anxiety. Have a look at his stance at the crease: it&apos;s incredibly rigid, a bit like Alan Ross&apos;s description of Derek Randall poised to swoop in the covers.  51st over: England 147-1 (Strauss 87, Pietersen 9) Baker oversteps and Strauss helps the errant delivery to fine leg for a single, before Pietersen eases another to deep cover. Strauss keeps the strike with one more. I&apos;m hungry. &quot;Economics makes my head hurt,&quot; says Paul Franklin. &quot;When times were good we spent, and borrowed to spend too much, and lived too much of the good life, so bad times came. Now that there are bad times we have to spend more than we have to get ourselves back to the good times. However, when the good times roll round again we have to be responsible and not borrow and spend too much, to avoid going back to bad times when we would have to spend and borrow. Is that right? Then what&apos;s the point of the good times, if we can&apos;t live a little? Like I said, it makes my head hurt.&quot;  52nd over: England 150-1 (Strauss 89, Pietersen 10) Can Strauss reach three figures before tea? It&apos;s the kind of sad little question that is keeping me going on the day West Indies decided to try not to win a five-day match before the toss had even been made. People will say a series win will help the game in the Caribbean, but not if this is how they go about it. I don&apos;t know about you, but I wouldn&apos;t pay to watch 16 overs from the dreary Nash. Three singles bring up the 150. &quot;Turn off the heating and sit at the computer wrapped in a duvet with feet on a hot-water bottle,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;This has the added attraction of danger.&quot;  53rd over: England 151-1 (Strauss 90, Pietersen 10) Strauss enters the nineties with a dab for one to deep backward point off Baker, who has done his best on a pitch not designed for bowlers. Or, for that matter, batsmen, spectators and OBO writers. Is thoughtfulness dead? &quot;I got my girlfriend pregnant,&quot; says Rich Gee, &quot;although not saving money in the long term, the short term benefits have huge savings, we&apos;ve halved our weekly alcohol, mayonnaise, mackerel, shellfish bills in one easy cut back. It&apos;s just a shame she didn&apos;t smoke...&quot; Outrageous.  54th over: England 152-1 (Strauss 91, Pietersen 10) Hinds is back in the attack in place of the dreadful Nash, whose spell of 16-3-47-0 was one of the most dispiriting things I&apos;ve seen for a long time. Strauss cuts for an easy single and Pietersen props forward dutifully. &quot;The point of the good times,&quot; says Chris Coles, &quot;is so we can be told how bad we have been during the good times, so that&apos;s why we&apos;re back in the bad times. It&apos;s quite simple...&quot;  55th over: England 156-1 (Strauss 95, Pietersen 10) Gayle to Strauss, who sweeps fine for four. &quot;In answer to Paul Franklin in over 51,&quot; says Tom Lawrence, &quot;I get the feeling economists would rather that times were neither good nor bad but sort of eternally mediocre. A bit like the England cricket team, bad-dum-tsssh.&quot;  WICKET! Pietersen b Hinds 10 (156-2) Well, well, well. The ball after being beaten outside off, Pietersen plays outside the line of an arm-ball and is bowled neck and crop. Hinds collapses to the floor as if he&apos;s won the lottery and England still have work to do. &quot;I say good for the Windies,&quot; says Vivek Bakshi. &quot;They decided before the toss they wanted to win the series which is surely the point. I don&apos;t see too much wrong with that, even if it is torture to watch.&quot; I think the final clause of your own argument sums up mine.  55.3 overs: England 156-2 (Strauss 95) In fact, that&apos;s tea. What a way to end a bizarre session, in which England scored 82 runs in 27.3 overs and lost Owais Shah to cramp and Pietersen to another left-arm pie-thrower. Yuvraj Singh, I&apos;m looking at you. See you at 7pm for the final session.  TEA  56th over: England 159-2 (Strauss 95, Collingwood 3) Shah is clearly still suffering with cramp because it&apos;s Paul Collingwood who accompanies Strauss to the middle after tea for the last three balls of Ryan Hinds&apos;s over. And he whips the third of them, a low full-toss, wide of mid-on for three.  57th over: England 163-2 (Strauss 95, Collingwood 7) Amusingly, replays suggest the ball which got Pietersen may just have been a no-ball from Hinds. Can you imagine if he&apos;d referred it with the stumps splayed. Powell to Collingwood, who whips him through midwicket for two, before tucking a single through square-leg: he&apos;s had three gimmes to get him going, although he would have been awarded two runs for that second stroke had Strauss not failed to ground his bat properly when turning for the first. Well spotted Daryl Harper. It all means Collingwood is still on strike, but Powell&apos;s line is terrible and that&apos;s another easy leg-side single. Strauss then misses a pull, Powell appeals, Harper says no and Gayle wants a referral. It&apos;s way too high and hit him outside the line of off-stump. What a waste of a referral by Gayle. &quot;I&apos;m a primary school teacher and my special lady friend is a midwife,&quot; says Tom van der Gucht, &quot;so as long as people are having babies and those babies grow up and go to school then we shouldn&apos;t be worried about losing our jobs during the recession. Personally I&apos;m more worried about that Clive Owen film, Children of men, coming true, if that happens then we&apos;re boned!&quot;  58th over: England 169-2 (Strauss 98, Collingwood 9) Did I say way too high? Hawkeye has it clipping the top of off-bail, but it still struck Strauss outside the line. So I was half-right. A few singles and a scampered two to Strauss off that Hinds over. &quot;Surely with the referral system in place, the non-striker should be watching out for this sort of thing?&quot; says Paul Franklin of the Hinds possible-no-ball that got Pietersen. It raises an interesting question. But surely the TV umpire should review every dismissal just in case the bowler has overstepped and the on-field umpire has missed it. I can&apos;t imagine batsmen would be too happy to be constantly watching the front foot all the time.  59th over: England 177-2 (Strauss 98, Collingwood 17) Another delay, this time because the rotating sightscreen is stuck on its big red advert. Oh for goodness&apos; sake. The maintenance man calls for help on his walkie-talkie and another, equally clueless, fella wanders over to discuss the problem. Yes, gents, it&apos;s still red. This farce lasts several minutes before someone has the bright idea of moving the sightscreen out of harm&apos;s way while stewards manually rotate each individual panel so that its white side is showing instead. Groan. The over finally gets under way with Powell bowling to Collingwood, who duly helps a low full-toss down the ground for four. Two balls later Powell offers Colly yet another freebie, this time straying on to leg: four more through square-leg. Dismal stuff from Powell. Really dismal. &quot;Blimey Lawrence, you&apos;re doing all three sessions today?&quot; says Tom Lawrence. &quot;And such an interesting day&apos;s play for you too. What a sentence. Mind you, here&apos;s me listening to TMS and reading you and I&apos;m not even getting paid.&quot; My heart bleeds.  60th over: England 182-2 (Strauss 99, Collingwood 21) Strauss moves to 99 with a single to long-on off Hinds, at which point Collingwood uses his feet to lift him over wide mid-on for four. Trademark stuff. &quot;Perhaps the ICC could trial some sort of alarm system that goes off when a bowler oversteps,&quot; suggests Eddy Nason. &quot;There will be a lot of them going cheap from Woolies these days. Plus, an ink pellet exploding over the bowler would soon put a stop to needless no-balls.&quot;  61st over: England 183-2 (Strauss 100, Collingwood 21) Gayle to Strauss, who reaches his third century in successive Tests with a very quick single to cover. It&apos;s his 17th in all (to go with 15 fifties: hell of a conversion rate) and it&apos;s taken 186 balls - pretty decent on this sluggish pitch. What an example from the captain! The next stoppage comes when Shivnarine Chanderpaul hobbles off after fielding that ball. Hmm, interesting: will he need to bat with a runner? &quot;I&apos;ve just got home from work,&quot; announces Andrew Stopforth, which explains his next question. &quot;Are we still doing celeb spotting? I need to apologize to Dermot O&apos;Leary for the &quot;Don&apos;t I know you?&quot; look as I emerged from the showers in a Brixton sports centre last night. Poor Dermot.&quot;  62nd over: England 189-2 (Strauss 106, Collingwood 21) Strauss is now joint-ninth on the list of English centurions with Denis Compton - and he needed 18 fewer Test matches than Compo to reach the 17 mark. Vaughan and Gower are on 18, Hutton on 19 - and Strauss celebrates with a glorious lofted extra-cover drive for four off Hinds. Superb! &quot;Never mind the namby-pambying around,&quot; roars Richard Norris. &quot;How about a strategically placed landmine just over the mark on the popping crease?&quot;  63rd over: England 191-2 (Strauss 107, Collingwood 22) Collingwood and Strauss exchange singles off Gayle, who then appeals optimistically for lbw against Collingwood. That one probably did too much, which isn&apos;t an accusation you usually make against Gayle. &quot;Aren&apos;t stuck scoreboards one of the things that makes cricket worthwhile, like fat prop forwards in Rugby Union and wrestlers with names like &quot;Billy Two Rivers&quot;?&quot; wonders Fred Lane in Stockholm. Er, no.  64th over: England 192-2 (Strauss 108, Collingwood 22) Hinds is over the wicket now to the left-handed Strauss, who tucks him to midwicket for a single. It&apos;s been an almighty effort from Strauss, who has had a lot to contend with since taking over the captaincy. &quot;Will Chanderpaul need a runner?&quot; says Jonny Sultoon before answering the question I excitedly posed moments ago. &quot;Probably not - what&apos;s the point when his team needs a draw. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s quite capable of a 140-ball 0*.&quot;  65th over: England 196-2 (Strauss 110, Collingwood 24) It&apos;s all spin now. You&apos;ve never got the sense today that West Indies are trying to do anything but contain England. I&apos;m hoping, for the sake of the game, that their policy backfires. The batsmen milk four singles off Gayle. &quot;Harper and Tiffin!&quot; exclaims Paul Franklin, doing a passable impression of Bob Willis. &quot;I thought Tiffin was weeded out ages ago when the elite panel came in. In fact this is the worst umpiring duo since the elite panel was introduced. Aleem Dar, a genuinely good umpire, is third umpire. Disappointing.&quot; Except that the TV umpire is growing in importance. Remember Harper&apos;s effort in the box in Barbados?  66th over: England 199-2 (Strauss 111, Collingwood 26) Beefy has just berated Nasser for describing the sight of Chanderpaul hobbling off as &quot;good&quot;. &quot;That&apos;s a terrible thing to say,&quot; says Beefy, suddenly coming over all new man. Get real, Beefy: you thought exactly the same thing. There are singles all over the place now and these two stroll through for three of the blighters. &quot;Have we finally found a player who can handle both the captaincy and scoring runs?&quot; wonders Alex McGillivray.  67th over: England 201-2 (Strauss 112, Collingwood 27) Two singles off another tidy but mundane Gayle over. &quot;It is indeed a commendable effort by Strauss,&quot; says Mac Millings, &quot;which makes it all the sadder that, when he scores no runs against the Australians this summer, a lot of people, forgetting context, will just criticise him for making all his recent runs against second-rate attacks.&quot;  68th over: England 204-2 (Strauss 114, Collingwood 28) Strauss sweeps for a single to register his 1,000 runs as England captain - and at an average of 66! Hinds beats Collingwood outside off - perhaps this pitch will help England&apos;s spinners after all. &quot;You can&apos;t beat whiskey and Twiglets for a nice meal in the evening,&quot; says Adrian Bridgeman. &quot;(And no, you don&apos;t dunk the Twiglets into the whiskey. That would be weird.)&quot;  69th over: England 207-2 (Strauss 116, Collingwood 29) It&apos;s all singles and spinners at the moment: the definitive OBO writer&apos;s nightmare. Three off that over from Gayle, the second of which brings up a steady 50 stand. &quot;Why, oh why, oh why wasn&apos;t Strauss made the captain in Australia?&quot; aks Ross Moulden. &quot;The added responsibility clearly does wonders for his game.&quot; Hindsight, eh? Although Strauss did get a few bad decisions in that series which not even the captaincy would have prevented.  70th over: England 208-2 (Strauss 117, Collingwood 29) Strauss top-edges a sweep off Hinds but the ball lands safely at short fine-leg: one run. Nasser is worried that the way he settled for a single suggests he&apos;s feeling the heat, literally rather than metaphorically. And now Hinds rips one past Collingwood&apos;s outside edge. Swann and Panesar lick their lips. &quot;Those chaps at TMS, Lawrence, are getting worried about the weather,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;It seems there are clouds coming up against the wind. Not sure what this means. Surely clouds can only move in the direction of the prevailing wind? Or is this all part of our new lives in credit-lunch-crunch world, where even the forces of nature work against the norm?&quot;  71st over: England 209-2 (Strauss 118, Collingwood 29) Collingwood grinned when that ball beat him: I think England have realised they have picked the team to exploit this surface. It&apos;s slow and low, sure, but the spinners are already making the ball grip and go through the top. Strauss prevents a Gayle maiden with a push to long-on to keep the strike.  72nd over: England 212-2 (Strauss 119, Collingwood 31) These two are whizzing through the overs now as Collingwood works Hinds to square-leg and hares back for a second. &quot;Regarding Strauss, are we looking at a potential all time great?&quot; asks Prithvi Raj Krishna. &quot;This guy has 17 hundreds and by the time he retires which is hopefully five or six years away he would have amassed 27-30 hundreds and 8,500-10,000 runs probably at an average of 44-48. That would place him just below G, Boycott in the order. So certainly by English standards he can termed as godlike...&quot;  73rd over: England 216-2 (Strauss 121, Collingwood 33) West Indies are just hurrying through to the second new ball here, although the way they&apos;ve approached this game, they&apos;ll probably chuck it to Brendan Nash and Lionel Baker. The first three balls of Gayle&apos;s over are knocked for simple singles and this game has resembled pat-a-cake for quite a while now.  74th over: England 216-2 (Strauss 121, Collingwood 33) Hinds continues after the day&apos;s final drinks break and he gets away with a couple of short balls outside off, mainly because Collingwood is through the shot too early. A rare maiden on this day of nudges and nurdles. &quot;Echoing the remark of Tom Lawrence (over 59), I am also worried about you doing such a long stint in the Guardian office,&quot; says Eva Maaten. &quot;Are you sure you (or rather the Guardian) are not in breach of EU working hour regulations? After all, these laws exist to protect you against yourself, you know!&quot; All I can say is: my right wrist is hurting.  75th over: England 218-2 (Strauss 122, Collingwood 34) It&apos;s not been a thrilling day, has it? Just 21 fours so far and none for quite a while as Gayle is worked for a couple of singles. &quot;So Shah plays at No3 and scratches around ineffectually, then has to go off,&quot; says James Wrout. &quot;He&apos;ll be back to bat at 5 or 6 and look majestic - just to prove a point to the selectors. It&apos;s all a cunning ruse I tell you!&quot;  76th over: England 219-2 (Strauss 122, Collingwood 35) Ramdin is congratulating every Hinds pie as if he&apos;s serving up caviar and lobster. It&apos;s not quite &quot;bowling Shane&quot; or &quot;shabash Mushy&quot; but it&apos;s not far behind. One off the over. &quot;Hindsight&apos;s wonderful, yes,&quot; says Ross Moulden, &quot;but even at the time Strauss had scored two hundreds and a fifty in four Tests as captain. It seemed clear then that he performed well as captain. I&apos;m pretty sure losing it set his game back a lot.&quot;  77th over: England 224-2 (Strauss 125, Collingwood 37) If you&apos;re tireed of my ramblings, why not read our very own Vic Marks on today&apos;s play. He&apos;s actually out there in Trinidad, so is rather better placed than I am to assess the action. Collingwood nudges Gayle to leg for a single before Strauss drives for one more. Strauss then late-chops for... two! Shock, horror, etc.  78th over: England 227-2 (Strauss 126, Collingwood 38) Another Hinds over so tedious that I can&apos;t even begin to tell you who dabbed what single where. &quot;Never mind where Strauss will be in terms of all time greatness, what about where Collingwood will be?&quot; asks Tom van der Gucht. &quot;The best-ever all-round stats from an ODI, an Ashes Test double-hundred scored in Australia, a county championship medal with Durham, one-time holder of the most wickets in Twenty20 internationals and an Ashes winners medal! Yet he&apos;s still one of the most poorly regarded players who has turned out for England during the past ten years. What else does the chap have to do to gain some credit?&quot;  79th over: England 229-2 (Strauss 127, Collingwood 39) Will West Indies take the second new ball? No signs of Edwards warming up just yet. That really will prove, as if proof were needed, that West Indies have no intention of trying to win this game. Two singles off Gayle&apos;s latest underwhelming over.  80th over: England 232-2 (Strauss 128, Collingwood 41) Let&apos;s not forget Collingwood here. He&apos;s averaging 60 in this series and has kept his captain strike-rotating company in the way Shah failed to do earlier. Three singles off Hinds&apos; over - and the second new ball is now due should Gayle want it. &quot;The decision not to make Strauss skipper for the last Ashes was one of the stupidest of many the England selectors have made in the last few years, and it&apos;s a mark of the guy&apos;s character that after having his confidence shattered and getting dropped, he went away, worked on his game, and has now returned to be the cricketer we all knew he could be,&quot; says Steve Anthony. &quot;Forget Bell. Strauss is the one who&apos;ll go on to make 9,000+ Test runs at 45 with 30-odd tons. Can Bell go away and work on his game and come back in a similar fashion?&quot;  81st over: England 237-2 (Strauss 130, Collingwood 44) Gayle continues with the old ball as Edwards returns to the field after a one-over stint off it. Ramdin is full of the joys of spring behind the stumps, but he&apos;s briefly silenced by a leg-glance for two from Collingwood. He&apos;s hit three fours so far: testimony to his patience and the West Indian approach. Have I mentioned that already? Strauss cuts for two as Nash fails to pick the ball up at backward point: five off the over. &quot;You&apos;ll forgive me not getting too excited about the fact the pitch is spinning, considering that Monty is playing and this is the type of situation where he never fails to let us down,&quot; harrumphs Andy Bradshaw. Yes, but there&apos;s always Swann - England&apos;s leading wicket-taker in this series.  82nd over: England 239-2 (Strauss 131, Collingwood 45) Ian Bishop is bemoaning the lack of &quot;intensity&quot; in the Windies fielders today. Spot on. Two off Hinds&apos; over. &quot;It&apos;s all very well criticising the Windies for not trying to win the game - and it is the first day, and it is tedious Test cricket - but, if this were the final Test of, say, an Ashes series, and England were 1-0 up, surely we&apos;d all be rooting for a series win with no nail-biting?&quot; asks Bradon Smith. Yeah, but the Ashes are different [he squirmed].  83rd over: England 241-2 (Strauss 132, Collingwood 45) Edwards is on, but he&apos;ll be starting with the old ball. &quot;Looks like a dog&apos;s had it,&quot; chuckles Nasser. Not that the Windies are too worried: the old ball may not do as much off the surface or in the air as a new one, but it&apos;s harder for the batsmen to time. Strauss pulls a no-ball for a single. There&apos;s a touch of reverse in that over. Not that Gayle&apos;s too interested...  84th over: England 243-2 (Strauss 133, Collingwood 45) Still no new ball. Hinds continues. Left-arm pies. Ball stops on Collingwood, ball lobs to right of Hinds, but not by much. Too tired to write in proper sentences. Verbs over-rated. And spurious adjectives. Adverbs definitely.  85th over: England 249-2 (Strauss 134, Collingwood 50) Six overs to go including this one and England will be delighted if these two are still at the crease come stumps. It will have vindicated their decision to play five batsmen plus Matt Prior, not to mention two front-line spinners to West Indies&apos; none. What must Sulieman Benn be thinking when he sees Hinds and Gayle make the ball go through the top? Meanwhile, Strauss works Edwards for a leg-side single before Collingwood is beaten by a pearler that threatened to swing but instead straightened off the pitch. Collingwood hits back with a square-drive for four. Great response! And there&apos;s the half-century with an open-faced push to deep backward point. &quot;To address seriously Steve Anthony&apos;s point, Lawrence,&quot; begins Clare Davies. &quot;Bell could well spend the next three months getting double-tons for his county and scoring them with a grace and elegance that Strauss will never show. However there is nothing in his career thus far that indicates that he has the strength of mind or character to perform at Strauss&apos;s level.&quot;  86th over: England 253-2 (Strauss 137, Collingwood 51) Strauss collects two with a drive off Hinds that squirts off the outside edge. Four off a quiet over that rather sums up the entire day. &quot;Everybody&apos;s been praising Fidel&apos;s effort this series, and they&apos;re right,&quot; says Bradon Smith. &quot;But what I really like about him is that his aggression is well directed. He doesn&apos;t take a long follow through to the batsmen out of frustration, but rather when he has genuinely beaten them - and then, it is with a grin, rather than with malice.&quot;  87th over: England 255-2 (Strauss 138, Collingwood 52) Two singles off the Edwards over. Hell, I could have written that in advance. &quot;Could I commend Clare Davies for not splitting her infinitive?&quot; says Chris Coles. &quot;A superb effort at this time of night...&quot; Unsplit infinitives are over-rated. Fact.  88th over: England 256-2 (Strauss 138, Collingwood 53) Collingwood works Hinds behind square-leg for a single to bring up a workmanlike 100 stand at a shade more than three an over. &quot;I hate to draw your attention to a typo, but in the 85th over you had the criticism of Ian Bell attributed to Clare Davies,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;That&apos;s not possible: all OBO fans know she is his Mum and would never say anything like that about her Belly-boy. I think you owe her an apology. Or she owes us all one.&quot;  89th over: England 256-2 (Strauss 138, Collingwood 53) Edwards (with the old ball, naturally) to Collingwood as my right hand threatens to do things only Owais Shah could understand. I think my position as an OBO writer has to come under scrutiny after this effort. If I can&apos;t handle a cool air-conditioned office in central London, what hope is there on a sultry, humid overseas stint? Bull and Smyth will be champing at the bit and who can blame them? Reverse-swing for Edwards in that maiden to Collingwood.  90th over: England 258-2 (Strauss 139, Collingwood 54) Hinds will bowl the last over of the day to Strauss, who has been heroic yet again. This was a less fluent effort than the 169 in Antigua and the 142 in Barbados, but that won&apos;t bother him. He has given England a real chance of beating a negative West Indies side who are playing for the draw. Colly&apos;s been pretty damn solid too. Thanks for all your emails and see you tomorrow for the first session. I&apos;ll leave you with this from Keith Hudson. &quot;You may like to know that the Guardian OBO is now one over ahead of the streaming video I am getting in Pennsylvania. How do you do it?&quot; Think of the money you could make...

Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 \u20ac4.9bn Fourteen months ago, the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale shocked the financial world by announcing that a single derivatives trader could have lost almost \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.7bn). J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel was promptly arrested, but it could be another year before any charges are brought. Kerviel was accused of hacking into SocGen&apos;s computer systems to circumvent its internal controls, letting him to run up positions worth \u20ac50bn. The Frenchman, though, has refused to become a scapegoat, claiming that other bank employees are also responsible for its huge loss. An internal inquiry has cast doubt on claims that he acted alone. The scandal turned Kerviel into a 21st-century celebrity, complete with a web-based fan club, branded T-shirts and mugs, and even supportive videos on YouYube. In an interview in January, Kerviel \u2013 who spent 35 days in prison before being released \u2013 compared his time at SocGen to &quot;like playing a video game&quot;. Barings Bank \u2013 \u00a3827m Although only losing a quarter as much money as Kerviel, Nick Leeson is still the most famous &quot;rogue trader&quot; in history Leeson spent almost four years in prison in Singapore before being released in 1999, after bringing down one of the grandest names in British banking. Working in Barings&apos; Singapore office, Leeson dealt in the complex world of derivatives and futures. He was seen as a rising star at the venerable City institution, racking up large profits. But his world fell apart after he began hiding his bad trades in a secret account. These losses grew over several years, forcing him into increasingly desperate but unsuccessful attempts to make the money back. Leeson finally fled in February 1995 after a bet that the Tokyo stockmarket would rise went badly wrong, but was arrested at Frankfurt airport. Barings was later sold to the Dutch banking giant ING for just \u00a31. In the aftermath, Leeson&apos;s managers were criticised for allowing him to settle his own trades \u2013 and thus the opportunity to disguise his actions. When not giving conference and after-dinner speeches, Leeson runs Galway United football club. Allied Irish Bank \u2013 \u00a3697m John Rusnak was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after the Baltimore-based trader ran up trading losses of almost $700m (\u00a3355m). The &quot;regular guy&quot; worked for Allfirst Financial, a division of Allied Irish Bank, dealing on foreign exchanges. Rusnak mainly traded the Japanese yen, running up losses that he hid using fictitious options contracts. Rusnak started concealing his losses in 1997 but was not uncovered until 2002 \u2013 even though some companies already refused to do business with him. By that stage, rather than sticking to his trading limit of $2.5m, Rusnak had secretly bet $7.5bn of AIB&apos;s money on the yen rising against the dollar. At his trial, prosecutors said the false trades had allowed Rusnak to keep receiving salaries and bonuses Daiwa Bank \u2013 $1.1bn Toshihide Iguchi, a senior US executive at Japan&apos;s Daiwa Bank, was imprisoned for four years and fined $2.6m (\u00a31.7m) in 1996 after losing $1.1bn through a decade of unauthorised bond trading. Iguchi confessed in a letter to the bank&apos;s president. Deficiencies in Daiwa&apos;s internal systems allowed him to conceal his losses for 11 years while he tried to trade his way back to profit \u2013 eventually falsifying 30,000 trading slips. In court, he said his life was filled with guilt, fear and deception but in a later interview in prison, Iguchi said he had seen his earlier actions as merely a violation of internal rules. &quot;I think all traders have a tendency to fall into the same trap. You always have a way of recovering the loss,&quot; he told Time magazine. The scandal cost Daiwa dearly. On top of Iguchi&apos;s losses, the bank was forced to stop operating in the US. Sumitomo Corporation \u2013 $2.6bn Yasuo Hamanaka, the chief copper trader at Sumitomo, was dubbed &quot;Mr Five Percent&quot; in recognition of his dominance of the global copper market.

They bided their time, nurtured their ideals and came to prominence in the decades following the second world war. Since then, modern architecture has passed up, down and through many aesthetic \u2013 &quot;form follows fashion&quot; \u2013 and economic hoops. Today, as architects of the global stature of Frank Gehry, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers lay off staff \u2013 half of them, in Gehry&apos;s case \u2013 the mantra ringing through their minds is very probably &quot;form follows finance&quot;. Just look at the extraordinary worldwide construction boom of the past decade. Entire cities \u2013 London, Leeds, downtown Los Angeles, Berlin, Beijing and Shanghai \u2013 have grown, changed shape and shot up into the sky in a gung-ho manner that makes some of them almost unrecognisable from the way they were such a short while ago. As the good times rolled with the madcap antics of international banking and promiscuous credit, the very shape of so much architecture and so many buildings began to change. Out went austere or ascetic minimalism, and in came a kaledeiscopic, cinematic new architecture featuring the fecund talents of the likes of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and Rem Koolhaas, together with a host of younger architects for whom form appeared to follow fancy \u2013 although, in reality, it was following in the wake of a colossal economic boom. Alongside this urgent flowering of sensational new design, came wave after wave of new skyscrapers. Bigger. Faster. Stronger. Shinier. By the time recession hit home late last year, there were plans afoot to hide what remained of the old City of London in a forest of new office towers, supported by both the former mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, and by his successor, Boris Johnson. There were plans to do much the same in Paris, with President Sarkozy actively promoting a new generation of towers for which the word &quot;bling&quot; would be too be too posh by half. Chicago was to have been dominated by a spiral skyscraper designed by the master of urban bling, Santiago Calatrava. And, so it went on. And, now? A break in construction, certainly, but after the deluge? What then? Of course, it&apos;s difficult to be sure of future developments in architecture, and yet there is a tendency for architectural action to be followed by reaction, and reaction by further reaction. The collapse of the British economy at the time of the oil crisis and three-day week of 1973-4, for example, spelled the end of straight-up-and-down modernist design, of public-sector architecture, concrete high-rise estates, concrete low-rise estates and Brutalism. A world that had been led by the heroes of post-war British modernists, among then Erno Goldfinger and Denys Lasdun, seemed to have come to a sudden stop. When the going got good again, postmodern design, all bright colours, visual jokes, architectural puns, allusions, elisions, illusions swept into view. Architects such as Terry Farrell popped up with comic relief in the form of his TV-am studios in Camden Town, or architecture in the guise of a knowing street urchin. Piers Gough and his team at CZWG let rip with zany apartment blocks in London&apos;s up-and-coming Docklands. Even the man who more or less invented architectural postmodernism, Robert &quot;less is a bore&quot; Venturi, was shipped in from the States, with his wife Denise Scott-Brown, to design the controversial new Sainsbury wing of the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square. But, when the economy dipped again at the end of the 1980s, po-mo was out, and a new wave of expressive modernism, the &quot;iconic&quot; architecture, effectively took its place. So what now? Recessions are a time for architects to rethink their game. They need not despair \u2013 but, rather, regroup for the next boom. For a while, I think there may well be a reaction to the fireworks of the past decade. Architects such as the Tokyo practices of Toyo Ito and Sanaa (currently at work on the design of this summer&apos;s Serpentine Gallery pavilion in Kensington Gardens) point to one highly inventive, yet gentle future. Equally, there may well be a return \u2013 up to a point \u2013 in public architecture and design. Indeed, government investment in building might even be necessary to help kick-start the UK economy in the months ahead. Schools. Hospitals. Colleges. Training centres. All of these would require architects to think outside of the &quot;iconic&quot; box. Commercial skyscrapers and big-name museums and galleries have been flashy in recent years to draw maximum attention to themselves and to their promoters. This wouldn&apos;t be necessary, or even desirable, in the case of clinics and schools. A new modesty, then? Yes, for a while. But, when the wheel of fortune turns up again, expect a reaction to the New Modesty. Expect, at the very least, a Modesty Blaze, and then new forms of architecture that those being made redundant from their jobs, and those about to leave architecture school, are only beginning to formulate. And, by the way, applications to British architecture schools have never been higher. Architecture, more than most arts, requires, and even demands, optimism even in the face of the most severe economic downturns. The Empire State building began to rise the very moment Wall Street crashed. Depression has not, after a shaky financial start, hindered its rise into the firmament of all-time architectural wonders."}, {"sentences": ["In August Peace, who lives in Japan, will publish Tokyo Occupied City, the second of his crime novels about his adoptive city after the war and the sequel to the acclaimed Tokyo Year Zero."], "tags": ["Channel 4", "Television industry", "Media", "Television", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Red Riding"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-07T00:01:00Z", "title": "Red Riding hailed as saviour of Channel 4", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/07/red-riding-channel-4", "article": "The first part was watched by only 2.5 million people but it has already been hailed as a return to &quot;event TV&quot;, tipped to dominate the awards season, lauded as a belated attempt to match the ambition and quality of the best US programming and could even become a crucial calling card in Channel 4&apos;s battle for survival.

You don&apos;t order a Martini just for the olive, he implied, and you don&apos;t read a whodunit merely to find out who did it. &quot;The really good mystery,&quot; he continued, &quot;is one you would read even if you knew somebody had torn out the last chapter.&quot; Quite what a crime novel contains, other than &quot;the olive&quot;, varies: it can be anything from one-liners and wisecracks to social commentary and political opinion. In recent years a new fashion has emerged: crime writing has been spliced with travel-writing. Having an exotic backdrop is almost more important than the plot itself. There&apos;s nothing new to crime books being set abroad: think Eric Ambler or Michael Dibdin. But what&apos;s striking is the sheer number of them now being published. If you go into a bookshop looking for a crime novel, it&apos;s actually easier to find one based abroad than in Britain. Many bookshops, like the travel specialist Daunt Books in Marylebone, central London, now sell crime books under country headings alongside the Rough Guides and Lonely Planets. For almost any destination you choose, you&apos;ll find a crime novel. If you&apos;re going to Laos you can pack a Colin Cotterill, whose hero is Laos&apos;s only coroner, Dr Siri Paiboun. If you&apos;re off to Turkey you&apos;ve got a whole range of options: you can pick up a Jason Goodwin, a Barbara Nadel or a Mehmet Murat Somer. As for Italy, there&apos;s Iain Pears, Donna Leon or Magdalen Nabb. &quot;We could quite easily put a table in the shop offering just Tuscan crime,&quot; says the bookshop&apos;s founder, James Daunt.  The appeal of such books is that, as well as a good yarn, they offer the traveller the longed-for &quot;feel&quot; of a country. They serve up digestible slices of culture and history at the same time as giving you the pleasure of an old-fashioned page-turner. The marriage works well because in crime, after all, the backdrop is always one of the lead characters. Ross Macdonald told his readers far more about the underbelly of California than he ever did about Lew Archer. We read Scandinavian crime fiction largely because we&apos;re fascinated by countries simultaneously so similar yet different to ours. And people turn to Alexander McCall Smith or Ian Rankin in part for the same reason others sit on an open-top bus: they want to see the sights and sounds of Botswana or Edinburgh. Add to that the fact that we live in an era of cheap air travel and quick continental breaks, and it&apos;s hardly surprising that there&apos;s a demand for crime set in exotic locations. The ubiquity of these books also says something about market forces. Pete Ayrton, publisher of Serpent&apos;s Tail, which has an enviable crime list, says: &quot;A lot of these writers are good journalists, and in the old days they would have written political novels like Graham Greene. But the bottom has fallen out of that market and so they turn to crime.&quot; Contrary to the stereotype of the writer as the lone crusader with a unique voice, most writers are actually fairly adaptable in their styles. When McCall Smith started enjoying superstar status a few years ago by writing enjoyable and gentle books about Botswana, a lot of hard-up scribes took note. The bottom line is, as they say, that crime pays. If writers want to pay the rent, they have to put a dead body and a detective into their travel books. Crime also pays for publishers because it&apos;s a genre that lends itself to repeats. It offers the possibility of sequels in which the detective is coaxed into case after case, slowly building up a faithful readership. This works in the writer&apos;s favour too. In the old days writers living abroad could only get away with one book about that country. Now they can write a dozen.  Another appeal of the genre for publishers is that it allows them to bring out &quot;foreign&quot; titles without the difficulties and costs of translating a local writer. And it&apos;s this, according to Ayrton, that makes the whole phenomenon slightly dubious: &quot;It&apos;s unfortunate that the success of these books is normally at the expense of the indigenous writers. In Britain we publish very few books in translation, so readers tend to turn to books that have a slightly imperial take on the countries they&apos;re in.&quot; It is, in short, a reflection of our laziness that we read English-speaking writers on foreign countries, rather than the foreigners themselves. The alternative argument is that these books actually whet the appetite for the hard stuff: the indigenous writers. It&apos;s an argument that can be backed up by sales figures. If you take crime fiction set in Japan: David Peace&apos;s Tokyo Year Zero has sold 9,200 copies in this country; Natsuo Kirino&apos;s Out has sold 60,000. Take fiction set in Italy: Donna Leon&apos;s bestseller Friends in High Places has sold 50,000 copies; Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti&apos;s I&apos;m Not Scared has sold 75,000. Of two books set in the Middle East, Rawi Hage&apos;s De Niro&apos;s Game has, so far, outsold Matt Rees&apos;s more recent The Bethlehem Murders. These figures suggest that the British public isn&apos;t only reading the English-language take on foreign countries. Rather than being a reflection of the much-lamented parochialism of British publishing, these foreign-based crime novels could actually be a reflection of our longing to understand &quot;abroad&quot; that bit better. With both Stieg Larsson and Roberto Bola\u00f1o breaking into the top 10 of the hardback fiction lists recently, it might be that our reading tastes are simply becoming more cosmopolitan. In some ways this vogue for exotic crime fiction is a continuation of the Agatha Christie tradition. Although seen as an archetypally English writer, Christie spent many months each year in Syria and Iraq with her archeologist husband. Her most famous novels were set in the sultry heat of the Orient Express or the Nile delta, and she was one of the first writers to dare to introduce a decidedly foreign sleuth.  But in other ways the new trend represents a departure for the genre. Unlike Christie&apos;s novels, these works tend to be discursive and didactic. Often they&apos;re so eager to engage with the geopolitical faultlines of their settings that, instead of showing you the good old mean streets, they give you a tour of the corridors of power. The result is that they can become a bit Tintin-ish, with the hero on first name terms with the Sultan&apos;s mum, and not just solving a mystery but improbably saving the world at the same time. Thus in Jason Goodwin&apos;s The Janissary Tree the detective, Yashim the eunuch, has &quot;10 days to uncover a plot that could bring the Ottoman Empire to its knees&quot;. In Matt Rees&apos;s The Samaritan&apos;s Secret Omar Yussef has to sort out a case by Friday, when the World Bank is going to &quot;cut off all funding to the Palestinians&quot;. In Qiu Xiaolong&apos;s The Mao Case, Inspector Chen&apos;s task is to get behind the &quot;communist-god mask&quot; of Mao. (Resolving a whodunit isn&apos;t enough for Chen; he has to uncover everything about the Cultural Revolution.) The inspector has to become a historian and pseudo-philosopher, the sort of policeman who can casually pick up a tome by a Confucian scholar from the Song dynasty and riff about what it might have meant to Mao. This sometimes makes the books slightly recherch\u00e9, soft-boiled if they&apos;re boiled at all.  The other major difference is that in classic crime fiction the investigator tends to be a bit of an old soak, sinking a gimlet between each phone call. In this reinvention of the genre the investigator tends to be a more sober sort of gourmet, a food rather than a cocktail fetishist. Reflecting the fact that the British are obsessed by recipes these days, these books usually contain endless ingredients and evocations of smells and flavours. Omar Yussef describes &quot;the aroma of walnuts and dates from the ma&apos;amoul shortbread pyramided on wide trays outside a sweetshop&quot;. Yashim the eunuch cooks up Acem Yahnisi, describing in detail the blend of chicken and walnuts and pomegranate juice.  Crime fiction has until now usually been associated with gritty realism. People read it to get outside the bourgeois bubble and rub shoulders with pimps and pushers. They watch The Wire to see the other side of the American dream. But it&apos;s in the nature of the new exotic crime to be more escapist than realist. With the exception of David Peace&apos;s Tokyo Year Zero, these books consciously avoid blood and gore. And as a result the olive tastes a little less bitter than you&apos;ve come to expect. Foreign Sleuths: 5 to read Inspector ChenQiu Xiaolong&apos;s poet-policeman specialises in politically sensitive crime. Death of a Red Heroine (Sceptre) was one of the Wall Street Journal&apos;s top five political novels of all time. Dr Siri PaibounColin Cotterill&apos;s Laotian septuagenarian coroner worships the cinema and has a pleasingly world-weary take on the state of his nation. Try Anarchy and Old Dogs (Quercus).

Yashim TogaluFirst encountered in Jason Goodwin&apos;s The Janissary Tree (Faber), the eunuch Yashim is quick-witted, culturally literate and a dab hand with a skillet. Omar YussefA Palestinian teacher and reformed drinker, Matt Rees&apos;s hero has been the scourge of corruption since The Bethlehem Murders (Atlantic)."}, {"sentences": ["The Congress is organised by a &quot;star alliance&quot; of global universities: Copenhagen, Yale, Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, Tokyo, Peking \u2013 to name some."], "tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Sea level", "Global climate talks"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-09T13:38:09Z", "title": "Climate change sceptics confuse the public by focusing on short-term fluctuations", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/09/climate-change-copenhagen", "article": "As a lead author of the last IPCC report, I find it gratifying that Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg sings the praise of the &quot;careful work&quot; of the &quot;hugely respected&quot; IPCC. However, Lomborg misrepresents what we wrote in the report. It did not conclude that sea level will stay within the bounds of 18-59 cm by 2100. Rather, effects of sliding ice will come on top of this, which are too hard to predict to give an upper limit. So the IPCC forecast is 18-59 cm plus an unknown extra rise. The IPCC report also found that during 1961-2003, sea level has risen 50% faster (1.8 mm/year) than projected by models (1.2 mm/year). This is not a &quot;minority view&quot; but the IPCC&apos;s. In a separate study in Science we further compared projections (which started in 1990) of the previous IPCC report with observed data (up to 2006) and got a similar result.      Graph showing sea level rises     We have updated our study with the latest sea level data up to the end of 2008 (see graph above) \u2014 sea level continues to rise faster than expected with no sign of slowing down. The red curve shows annual sea level since 1970 based on tide gauges (the thick red line is a non-linear trend). The blue curve shows satellite sea level from 1993 to the end of 2008; the thick blue line is the linear trend (3.2 mm/year) over this period. For comparison, the projections of the 2001 IPCC report are shown (dashed lines and grey uncertainty range). Lomborg, maintains that this rise is &quot;better than expected&quot;, pointing to the brief downward blip in 2006 and claiming to see a slowdown since 2005. (Figure updated from Rahmstorf et al, Science 2007) Lomborg argues that 18 years could be too short for a robust trend comparison because of decadal variations in trend \u2013 but the 42-year period analysed by IPCC yields the same result. And it is telling that he then goes on to draw an &quot;inescapable&quot; conclusion about a slow-down of sea level rise from just four years of data. This is another well-worn debating trick: confuse the public about the underlying trend by focusing on short-term fluctuations. It&apos;s like claiming spring won&apos;t come if there is a brief cold snap in April. Why does Lomborg cite the trend since 2005? Last October, he cited that of the previous two years. Why now four years? Because the trend of the past two years (2007-2008) is now + 3.7 mm/year? It is even worse. The trend since the beginning of any year of the data series varies between 1.6 mm/year and 9.0 mm/year, depending on the start year chosen. Using 2005, Lomborg cherry-picked the by far lowest. He&apos;s done this before, see for example his recent claim that the globe is cooling. Finally, Lomborg says that the Copenhagen Climate Congress this week is &quot;an effort by a group of scientists and activists to cast aside the consensus view of thousands of scientists from the IPCC&quot;. Let&apos;s do a fact check. The Congress is organised by a &quot;star alliance&quot; of global universities: Copenhagen, Yale, Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, Tokyo, Peking \u2013 to name some. On the opening day tomorrow, Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC will give a plenary lecture. Science has progressed since the cut-off date for research to be included in the last IPCC report. We have three years of new results to discuss, including new measurements on ice flow and sea level. In total, over 1,600 research papers and posters will be presented by scientists including leading IPCC authors from over 70 countries - the list reads like a &quot;Who&apos;s Who&quot; of climate science. That Lomborg tries to pass off the biggest climate science congress of the year as &quot;political activism of a few&quot; is hilarious. \u2022 Stefan Rahmstorf is a climate scientist and oceanographer at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. He has just published the popular science paperback Our ThreatenedOceans, together with marine biologist Katherine Richardson and will present latest data on sea level rise at the Copenhagen Climate Congress.

Celebration of, and gratitude for, the memory of the good sage and mentor will overcome much of the sadness. All of 57 winters ago a short report of a London midweek rugby match between United Banks and Hampshire was printed in these sports pages \u2013 a freelance commission from a keen young cub on the South London Press and the first 250 words of what would be many millions written by Rodda for this newspaper. To be sure, older readers will recall that some mornings it seemed as if Rodda alone was writing the whole sports section. Though fondly conversant with all games, through his prime John specialised in boxing and athletics; as well, he became fabled for keeping a beady weather-eye on all sporting politics, and his devotion to the purist ideals of the Olympic movement was to make him the most challengingly robust critic of that movement&apos;s oligarchic transgressions. It was an education to hear him prick the pomp and the protocol with the most forensic and well-briefed of inquiries. Next year would have marked Rodda&apos;s half century of reporting the Olympics. He had joined the Guardian full-time in 1959 and within a year, on the sudden death at only 50 of legendary sports editor (and athletics correspondent) Larry Montague, the greenhorn was dispatched to Rome pronto to cover the Games of 1960. Those stirring, colourful &quot;innocent&quot; Games were to remain seminal to him throughout his long career. In Rome, he chronicled the dramatic arrival on the stage of the Africans, by way of the astonishing marathon runner Abebe Bikila. And to the end John would always whoopingly log as his most thrilling and vivid Olympic memory the unbelievable &quot;eruption&quot; down the back-straight of Herb Elliott which laid waste the field in the 1500 metres final: &quot;In a blink a pack of tremendous athletes, each coiled and gathered to win it themselves, became traumatised also-rans: it was unimaginable. Elliott won by a street, in a world record time, and on a cinder track and in heavy leather shoes.&quot; News, of course, was Rodda&apos;s staple. Has any British sportswriter ever produced more three or four-par scoops? The bad guys all feared John. His aldermanic bearing only lent weight to his journalistic rectitude. He was never an in-my-day fogey nor crusty prude. He was inspiriting company at the end of a long day, always first to chortle at recall of his own apocalyptic, but off-beam prognostications in print, like his assured forecast after 1960 that the Olympic 800m for women would cause collapse, distress and even death \u2013 only to have Ann Packer so glisteningly breast the tape at Tokyo in 1964 with a sublime smile on her face. Or after Tokyo, where Lynn Davies and Mary Rand won the respective long jump gold medals, JR forecast the absolute certainty that every excited British child would demand a myriad of long jump pits to be built all over Britain. They weren&apos;t. Likewise, four years later after Dick Fosbury with his back-flip &quot;Flop&quot; won the 1968 high jump title \u2013 &quot;and I demanded that the technique should forthwith be banned because every emulating jumper would unquestionably suffer crippling back injuries. But guess what, in 50 years nobody has.&quot; Rodda witnessed all the figures of Olympic grandeur through half a century and was admired by most of them. John&apos;s final Olympics, his 10th, were at Atlanta in 1996. For half of them, it was a privilege, a luxury, a joy, to be alongside him high in the press tribune and sharing his phone and his wisdom. Same when covering boxing together. By the end, he was disillusioned by the &quot;showbiz&quot; of pro boxing and although he described countless contests by such luminaries of the lore as Muhammad Ali, Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson, always the nonpareil exemplar was his cockney boyhood favourite George Daly of Blackfriars, a seeming journeyman of 150 fights and 31 defeats who John would say, &quot;brought artistry to a genuinely noble sport through balance, nimble feet and the way he mesmerised opponents with the feint&quot;. Once, in the raucous maelstrom of a pre-fight press conference I found myself asking said Ali his technique for outsmarting a southpaw opponent.

As a result, senior editors are being axed, and others have been told to stop acquiring new books and having Martini lunches on the company tab.  More serious still, the books sections of several major newspapers have shut down; reduced coverage of books will likely translate into even fewer sales.

According to some, the only thing left to read in a few years will be raunchy, simplistic e-books.  Could literary culture really be breathing its last? Should readers and writers be running for cover? Of course not. But what, then, will save literature from economic disaster? Simple: independent publishing. Yes, independents \u2013 the ones who struggle to sell enough books to make payroll \u2013 will ensure that engaging, challenging books continue to be produced and consumed.

First of all, there&apos;s the personal care that a writer receives from an indie house. I send an email with an idea or a doubt; two minutes later, my very busy publisher writes me back. I have an issue with some changes to my manuscript or concerns about a foreign licensing deal; we discuss it over orange juice on a Sunday morning.  But this touchy-feeliness is just the icing on the cake. The real virtue of working with an independent publisher is the artistic experimentation they not only allow, but encourage. Akashic&apos;s proclivity for edginess and iconoclasm was apparent every step of the way while I was editing Delhi Noir, an anthology of urban Indian fiction for them, and this tendency is apparent in most of the titles they put out.  Take Abhram Rodriquez&apos;s South by South Bronx. I doubt most big houses could have stomached the book, which delves into a seedy northern New York universe inhabited by brilliant but bitter artists and cops who can&apos;t help but be dirty, because of its amorphous, elusive narrator and unique combination of intellectualism and action. But the novel ended up being a gripping intellectual thriller that raises some incredibly tough and interesting questions about the &quot;war on terror&quot; and right and wrong.  The same mix of readability and provocation is apparent in Europa Editions&apos; list. Europa does the unthinkable in today&apos;s publishing climate: it successfully publishes literature in translation and books that happen to be particularly slim \u2013 works that can be read in a couple of sittings, like Algerian-Italian author Amara Lakhous&apos; Clash of Civilizations, or Belgian author Am\u00e9lie Nothomb&apos;s Tokyo Fianc\u00e9e. Both of these novels use sparse prose and humour to conjure up vivid characters and ask some vital but awkward questions about love and prejudice. If you&apos;ve read this far, you might be thinking: How cute. Independent publishers are kind to their writers, and they put out some decent reads. But such niceties don&apos;t mean much if you can&apos;t pay the bills.  In an ironic twist of our times, however, these perpetually struggling entrepreneurs might just be able to weather the current financial crisis better than their behemoth corporate cousins. Why? They&apos;re used to constantly innovating to generate revenue and to conducting the business of literature on a tight budget. They don&apos;t expect unreasonable profit margins from good books. And when you&apos;re independently owned, you&apos;re somewhat insulated from the machinations of the market.  So when people begin their moaning about the state of the publishing industry, just remember \u2013 good things come in small, independently-owned packages."}, {"sentences": ["Right on cue, the Nikkei benchmark index leapt 4.6% in Tokyo, its biggest gain since the end of January."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Sport", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-11T12:08:00Z", "title": "Japanese baseball fans hope to have lifted 'curse of Colonel Sanders'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/11/colonel-sanders-japan-baseball", "article": "They call it the curse of Colonel Sanders \u2013 not, as you might think, the potentially unpleasant side effects of wolfing down a KFC, but a reference to one of the great sagas of Japan&apos;s national obsession, baseball. In 1985, the last year the Hanshin Tigers, Osaka&apos;s fanatically supported but perennially unsuccessful baseball team, won the league and Japan Series double, delirious fans celebrated by leaping from a bridge into the filthy Dotonbori river. Amid the frenzy, a few well-refreshed supporters uprooted a statue of colonel from outside the nearest Kentucky Fried Chicken and hurled him into the water where he remained, despite several rescue attempts, for almost a quarter of a century. The KFC emblem had been chosen for his resemblance to the team&apos;s star player that year, the bearded, portly American slugger, Randy Bass. But a record streak of last-place finishes, and failure to win a single Japan Series since, convinced superstitious fans that the colonel had placed a curse on their team. Many hope the curse may now be lifted after divers carrying out construction work brought the statue back to the surface, covered in grey sludge, minus his left hand and trademark black-rimmed spectacles. His appearance was greeted with cheers from workers and a large contingent of reporters sent to witness the recovery operation. &quot;It&apos;s only a statue, but I felt as if I was rescuing someone,&quot; one worker said. Yoshio Yoshida, the Tigers&apos; manager in 1985, summed up the mood in Osaka, a once great merchant city that has had precious little to celebrate on the baseball field. &quot;When I heard the statue had been found, I felt that a chapter in history had been closed,&quot; he told the Asahi newspaper. Today, the colonel was in protective custody, but plans are reportedly being hatched to place him in harm&apos;s way again with a move to the Tigers&apos; Koshien stadium home. While the Hanshin faithful are convinced that a Japan Series awaits this year, fans of all teams have a vested interest in a Tigers victory. Their triumph 24 years ago was followed by huge stock market gains and the start of the economic bubble.

Which might be as well. Indeed anyone at work in the light-welterweight division might reach for their P60 if they took a look at this. That&apos;s a guy called Mike Alvarado doing his stuff. It is the most shocking single-punch knockout I have seen since Julian &apos;The Hawk&apos; Jackson, the eye-troubled banger from the Virgin Islands, put Herol Graham to sleep in the fourth round of their fight for the vacant WBC middleweight title in Spain 19 years ago. &apos;Bomber&apos; was never the same again and remains Britain&apos;s best boxer since the war never to win a world title. No argument. Jackson, like a lot of heavy hitters, had a suspect chin and ultimately was found out. Jackson&apos;s sons, Julius and John, incidentally, boxed at the last Olympics. Julius, a light-heavyweight, went out in the first round to Ireland&apos;s Kenny Egan; John reached the second round of the competition, losing to the South Korean welterweight Kim Jung-joo. Each brother has had a pro win. But back to the destroyers. Jackson Snr was stopped five times in his career, including a one-round nightmare against Gerald McClellan in 1994. The power of the G-Man&apos;s punching that night was something to behold. He looked invincible. Jackson went down three times before his seconds had time to rearrange his bucket and stool. It was the American&apos;s penultimate fight, a veritable stroll before the dark night he shared canvas space with Nigel Benn at the Docklands Arena in London during February 1995. McClellan wilted in a fight almost too horrible to recall, not the victim of a single blow but several, perhaps some of them in his previous fights, or even a rumoured extra-curricular fixture in his home town of Freeport, Illinois. We will never know for sure. And no apologies here to remind readers to send Gerald what you can. All of these fighters lived on the edge. Even Graham, although not an out-and-out kayo artist, was a high-risk, free-swinging hitter who had a decent 51% stoppage record in 54 fights, a statistic more impressive when you consider that 16 of his distance bouts came in the learning stage of his career before he won a title. Nobody, though, bought a ticket to watch Graham &quot;bomb&quot; his opponents out; he was instead, said his trainer Brendan Ingle, poetry in motion. But, as the Belfast trainer and wit Eddie Shaw observed famously, &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anyone knocked out by a poem.&quot; Earlier this week Mike Tyson, not for the first time, provided the argument against ring poetry. The fans, he said, come to the fights for one thing: the chance to see something that frightens them, a clean, chilling, no-questions knockout. He certainly provided plenty of soul-shuddering finishes, none more conclusive than the night in 1988 when he took 90 seconds to ruin the career of the linear heavyweight champion Michael Spinks. Both entered the ring unbeaten. They labelled it &quot;Once And For All&quot;. Tyson felled Spinks with a body shot \u2013 then stuck on the chin of a man plainly scared out of his wits a right hand which not only put Spinks over for a full count but sent involuntary spasms through his legs as he lay conquered. Spinks never boxed again. Tyson? Well, he would go on, of course, terrorising here and there with his iron fists, until he too saw his frailties exposed. The reverberations, symbolic and practical, of James &apos;Buster&apos; Douglas&apos;s knockout of Tyson in Tokyo only three fights (one of them a mildly rocky engagement against Frank Bruno) after Iron Mike&apos;s destruction of Spinks linger to this day. It created chaos not only in Tyson&apos;s confused mind but throughout the industry. The first rule of the fight game is: don&apos;t blink. Sheer power does not always prevail; otherwise it would be called mugging rather than boxing. But it is difficult to deny Tyson&apos;s assertion that seeing someone knocked unconscious tugs at the animal core of most of us. Who hit hardest? I think Tyson, because of his speed, followed so closely it hardly matters by the bigger and slower Sonny Liston, Earnie Shavers and George Foreman, among post-war heavyweights. Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis and Max Baer prevailed before that. In all weights, there have been many fearsome hitters, a lot of them in the days when gloves were little more than knuckle protectors, the skinny Welshman Jimmy Wilde the most notable from these islands. He knocked out big guys for fun. This is one of many video collections, a selection limited by access to the film available, of course, but it might nevertheless provide abolitionists with a reminder that their campaign will always have evidence supplied by the sinners. Some kayos have an accidental beauty, as the poor man on the end of his antagonist&apos;s perfect punch surrenders control of his brain and limbs, then floats to earth as if emigrating to a netherworld of quiet distance. When Bundini Brown said Muhammad Ali &quot;floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee&quot;, he could hardly have known how appropriate a description that was of the image we would all be left with from Ali&apos;s eighth-round kayo of George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. Ali&apos;s final hit sent George, all 220lbs of him, fluttering with such incongruous delicacy to the canvas, as if in defiance of gravity, that you had to believe in magic. Alvarado? He fights a victim yet to be named at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on the undercard of Hatton-Pacquiao. And you won&apos;t be watching?

However, after the show, Ajikan&apos;s head honcho, Masafumi Goto, tells me the Takamatsu crowd represent the &quot;pure&quot; Japan. &quot;There&apos;s no difference between a show here and in Tokyo,&quot; he says. &quot;The Tokyo crowds are also from the suburbs and countryside, they just feel ashamed of this when they come into the city, so pretend that they are cool and urban when really they are not.

Japanese band Ajikan on stage Photograph: Alex Hoban/guardian.co.uk    Tonight&apos;s gig is in the 2,000-capacity Kenmin Hall, a seated venue that usually hosts Kabuki theatre and traditional instrumental recitals. The band decided to play here as they are &quot;trying to do things differently&quot; on this tour. But with club and gigging culture still relatively new in Japan, and largely unheard of outside major cities, it is likely that Takamatsu doesn&apos;t have another suitable venue to accommodate Ajikan. The gig itself is an epic spectacle with high production values. The bandplay against a backdrop of a cartoon-rendered electric train, supposedly travelling through Japan to Kamakura. With each song comes a dramatic set change to mark the next &quot;stop&quot; on the journey; painted city skylines give way to isolated island scenes. When a giant red shrine gate is lowered from the ceiling under erratic strobe lights, it appears that we are heading into Spinal Tap territory. From start to finish, it&apos;s monumental fun, even if being seated restricts the audience&apos;s ability to dance. One of the strangest things about going to gigs in Japan is the tendency for artists to engage in lengthy conversations with the audience, turning into MCs. When I ask the band why they do this, they say they have never really thought about it but that &quot;it is a cultural thing \u2013 Japanese people are very shy compared to other Asian countries.

Stern told a meeting of climate change scientists in Copenhagen that the effects of global warming would be worse than he predicted in his seminal 2006 report on the economics of the problem. He said policy-makers needed to think more about the likely impact of severe temperature rises of 6C or more. Speaking after a keynote speech at the conference, Stern said: &quot;Do the politicians understand just how difficult it could be? Just how devastating 4, 5, 6 degrees centigrade would be? I think not yet. Looking back, the Stern review underestimated the risks and underestimated the damage from inaction.&quot; His remarks echo concerns by other scientists at the meeting. Privately, many climate experts and officials say that the European target of limiting world temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels is no longer realistic. Steven Sherwood, a climate researcher at Yale university, will tell the conference later today that warming of 4C or more this century looks &quot;increasingly likely&quot;. Bob Watson, a former head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and chief scientist at the environment department, has already warned that governments need to prepare for a 4C rise. The 2007 report of the IPCC said that average temperatures could rise by up to 6C this century if no action were taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Many scientists say this could be an underestimate, because world emissions have grown faster than expected. According to the 2006 Stern report, a rise of 4C would put between seven million and 300 million more people at risk of coastal flooding each year, there would be a 30-50% reduction in water availability in southern Africa and the Mediterranean, agricultural yields would decline by 15%-35% in Africa, and 20%-50% of animal and plant species would face extinction. Yesterday, scientists announced at the conference that a 4C rise would lead to the loss of 85% of the Amazon rainforest. A 5C rise would mean that major cities such as New York, London and Tokyo would be threatened by a rise in sea levels and increases in ocean acidity would severely disrupt marine ecosystems and fisheries. An increase of more than 5C \u2014 equivalent to the amount of warming that occurred between the last ice age and today \u2014 is, according to the Stern report, &quot;likely to lead to major disruption and large-scale movement of population&quot;.

I&apos;m standing in the check-in queue for Britain&apos;s first long-haul, no-frills flight to Asia, and they are handing out free booze. OK, it&apos;s just a comically small glass of whisky (or sweets for teetotallers), and it&apos;s purely to mark the launch of AirAsia X&apos;s new route from London Stansted to Kuala Lumpur (99 quid one way if you got in early enough) - but still, this is budget travel. We demand to suffer. Thankfully for Tony Fernandes, the businessman behind this new venture, it&apos;s the last freebie we see for the next 13 hours. As we budget guinea-pigs join the queue at check-in, horror stories swirl about non-reclining seats and the lack of legroom. There&apos;s even a suggestion that if you don&apos;t book a meal in advance, you&apos;ll just have to starve. I haven&apos;t, needless to say, booked a meal in advance. Yet check-in is brisk and efficient: six desks are open to take our bags and allocate us - surely some mistake - preassigned seats. I am struck by the predominantly young-European-backpacker feel of my fellow travellers; Fernandes says he sees much of his business coming from budget travellers using the Malaysian capital as a hub for other destinations. Ryan, a 33-year-old electrician standing behind me in the queue, is moving to Melbourne with his girlfriend to start a new life. &quot;I tried to book as soon as I heard about the \u00a399 deal last November,&quot; he says. Sadly he missed out (only about a fifth of travellers, says AirAsia X, will travel for the rock-bottom fare) and had to settle for a - still rather impressive - \u00a3171 one-way fare. A tall chap, Ryan admits he is concerned about the legroom. There is a smattering of older travellers. Middle-aged Phillipe, from France, has gone the whole budget hog by first taking the coach from France to London for this flight, for which he forked out a still reasonable \u20ac260 (\u00a3240). As we prepare to board, a young woman tells her friend on the phone that the plane is a 10-year-old Air Canada Airbus A340-300, leased for one year to AirAsia X to test the viability of the route. Intrigued at this inside knowledge, I quiz her. Zoe turns out to be a 35-year-old social worker for Barnado&apos;s who is heading off for a three-week trip around Asia. She did manage to nab one of the coveted \u00a399 tickets - \u00a3200 for the return trip - but claims it was a lucky accident of timing. Her informant about our plane is Benny from the Netherlands, a self-confessed airline nerd who ferreted out the information about this flight on some obscure airline-nerd website. He says he booked because Air Canada seats have a good reputation among the air-geek fraternity. A breath of hope amid the mounting dread? Joanna, 22, and Veronica, 21, from Copenhagen, have two slightly eccentrically paired concerns. &quot;We&apos;re worried the plane will crash, and the seats will be too small,&quot; says Joanna. Not an issue shared by 24-year-old Norhaizi, who is heading home to Malaysia after four years studying accountancy. &quot;My mum tipped me off about it,&quot; she says. &quot;She said Airbuses are better than Boeings.&quot; Thirtysomething honeymoon couple Alpa and Kamles, meanwhile, have been told that they will be upgraded for the flight as a wedding present. What does that mean, exactly? &quot;Bigger seats, I think,&quot; says Kamles.     Room to stretch out - better than some airlines. Photograph: Maxton Walker    Finally we board, and I&apos;m in for a shock. The legroom is not just OK, it feels rather generous. There are eight seats across the cabin, with two aisles running between the pairs of window seats and a central island of four. Even though the seats are reportedly 15.8in wide, rather than the standard 16in, and the pitch between the rows of seats (the distance between one point on a seat and the identical point on the seat in front) is 30in compared with the usual 32, it doesn&apos;t feel a problem. And yes, contrary to rumour, the seats even recline. Quite a bit. Sitting next to me are a trio of Spaniards, Carlos, Pedro and Katia, who are planning to bum around Thailand, Laos and Vietnam for a few months. They are also impressed. &quot;The backs of the seats are low,&quot; says Katia. &quot;And the stewardesses are sexy,&quot; says Carlos. &quot;Write that down.&quot; But he would like a seat-back DVD player.     Stylish stewardesses. Photograph: Maxton Walker    Perhaps what Carlos means is that the cabin crew don&apos;t exude a budget feel: the stewardesses are dressed in sharp red outfits, the stewards in black with red trim. And they don&apos;t seem particularly harassed by their backpacker charges; when I press my call button, I get a pretty swift response every time. However, I turn down the offer of a \u00a37 comfort kit (blanket, inflatable pillow and eye-cover). This is a budget flight, after all. On the way to the toilet (no charge), I bump into Zoe who, though she has been billeted in a double seat (the flight is only about 90% full), finds herself, to her horror, right next to the toilets. I also come across Ryan the electrician, who is sitting next to an exit door with no seat in front of him and an obscene amount of legroom. He sheepishly admits he forked out &quot;about 20 quid extra&quot; for the seat after looking at a plan of the plane online. And he acquired a free comfort kit from somewhere! Uber-nerd Benny, meanwhile, is a bit disappointed that he has to wait a couple of hours after take-off to get a (\u00a31) bottle of water. Before dinner, I sneak up to &quot;XL&quot; class, as it&apos;s known, right at the front of the plane, to check on the upgraded honeymooners Alpa and Kamles, who are already tucking into their food (there&apos;s a choice of Malaysian or European). It has, at first glance, the feel of a first-class lounge. The seats are gigantic and go virtually flat; and the couple look justifiably pleased with their small coup. Until they learn that an upgrade doesn&apos;t absolve them from paying for stuff just like the rest of us - which leads one to wonder quite what the point of the first-class budget option is.     In-flight dinner for \u00a36 (lager optional). Photograph: Maxton Walker    I have to fork out \u00a36 for dinner - a small portion of chicken and potatoes plus a can of lager. Thankfully, the rumours about having to book food in advance are nonsense - although, oddly, the booze is rather discreetly tucked away deep in the trolley. I actually have to ask if they have any. The Spaniards (high culinary standards) are horrified by the dinner. &quot;It wasn&apos;t hot enough, there was no taste, no bread and I have to cut my chicken with a spoon because there wasn&apos;t a knife,&quot; says Carlos. &quot;And 250ml of wine costs \u20ac5. And there&apos;s no dessert. And the bottled water isn&apos;t even cold.&quot; A trifle harsh, perhaps, but the portions are meagre. An hour after dinner, Pedro cracks and forks out another few euros for a Malaysian pot noodle. Then it&apos;s time for the in-flight entertainment - \u00a36. Rather than seat-back screens, the crew hand out portable media players with preloaded films - a decent selection including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire. There are some takers, but not as many as I would expect. I buy another couple of bottles of water - two more quid - and doze fitfully, thanks to an overhead light that won&apos;t dim properly (are they trying to force me to buy the comfort pack?). Then it&apos;s breakfast - a quiche that, unsurprisingly, goes down badly with the Spaniards - and we&apos;re in Kuala Lumpur ahead of schedule, to be greeted by a throng of Malaysian women in traditional dress and a bevy of photographers snapping away at the bottom of the plane steps. There is even some traditional live music on the way to baggage collection, and passport control is a breeze. I know this is the inaugural flight - but the full rock-star treatment? This doesn&apos;t happen with Ryanair. Even so, electrician Ryan was disappointed with the price and quality of the food, but overall reckoned the flight was great value. Zoe was still rankled by the toilet thing, but had to confess that, overall, she&apos;d been pleasantly surprised. Even Benny, a man who knows his airlines, appeared to have been won over. And the Spaniards? Well, they were still hung up on the food ... although plenty of other passengers just brought their own. So did it feel like a budget flight? No. There was none of that cloying claustrophobia that can leave you gasping for air on a bad short-haul. Even after 13 hours in a relatively crowded part of the plane, I felt pretty relaxed. If passengers really do have less legroom than on standard long-haul flights, it is a convincing illusion to the contrary. And am I dreading the return flight on Sunday? Well, only because 13-hour flights are always pretty grim. Would I recommend it? I have only flown long-haul to Asia once before (Lufthansa to Tokyo) and, for my money, this was a better experience. But everything did go very smoothly, perhaps because it was the inaugural flight. If AirAsia X can keep it up, it is on to something. However, given that the average customer is spending much more than \u00a399, is it really a budget airline at heart? Well, judging by honeymooning Alpa&apos;s experience, yes. &quot;We didn&apos;t have a pen to fill in our immigration form,&quot; she says. &quot;They sold us one for a quid.&quot; Now that would give Michael O&apos;Leary&apos;s heart a warm glow. \u2022 This correction was added on Monday 16 March 2009. AirAsia X is not the first budget long-haul airline to fly from Britain to Asia.

The regime told the International Maritime Organisation that the missile would be launched during daylight between 4 and 8 April, and that its boosters would fall into the Sea of Japan \u2013 about 75 miles (120km) from Japan&apos;s north-west coast \u2013 and the Pacific Ocean. Officials in Tokyo said they reserved the right to destroy any threatening object in mid-flight, despite North Korean warnings that it would consider such a move an act of war. &quot;Under our law, we can intercept any object if it is falling towards Japan, including any attacks on Japan, for our security,&quot; Takeo Kawamura, the chief cabinet secretary, told reporters. Despite repeated assurances from Pyongyang that the rocket is a vital part of North Korea&apos;s space programme, other countries in the region suspect the hardware is a Taepodong-2 ballistic missile. South Korean intelligence has reported a build-up of activity in recent days near the missile&apos;s launch pad at Musudan-ri base on its neighbour&apos;s north-east coast. Any missile launch, even one intended to put a satellite into orbit, would represent a snub to the US administration, which has repeatedly invited the communist state to return to negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Last month the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, urged the north to cancel the launch, which US officials say would be in violation of a 2006 UN security council resolution. The South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement: &quot;If North Korea goes ahead with the launch, we believe there will be discussions and a response by the security council on the violation of the resolution.&quot; The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said a missile or satellite launch would &quot;threaten the peace and stability in the region.&quot; After Japan&apos;s transport ministry ordered airlines and shipping companies operating in the area to take precautionary measures, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways said they would alter flight paths on several European and other routes. Speculation has been mounting for weeks that North Korea was about to put its hitherto unreliable missile technology to the test. The regime suffered a setback in 2006 when a Taepodong-2 missile \u2013 theoretically capable of reaching Alaska \u2013 blew up moments into its flight. Japan has intensified efforts to protect itself against conventional missile attacks since 1998, when the north test-launched a long-range rocket over its territory without warning. In response, Japan and the US have jointly developed a ballistic missile defence system that includes interceptor missiles on board ships and Patriot missiles dotted around Tokyo. But experts believe that a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit may be too high to intercept."}, {"sentences": ["The chef here is Andy Cook, who previously was at Ramsay&apos;s restaurant in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Restaurants", "Gordon Ramsay", "Life and style", "Food & drink"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-13T14:00:00Z", "title": "Jay Rayner reviews Gordon Ramsay at The London, Los Angeles", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/13/gordon-ramsay-los-angeles", "article": "Gordon Ramsay at The LondonWest Hollywood, 1020 North San Vicente Boulevard, LA(001 310 358 7788)Meal for two \u00a3150 It tells you much of what you need to know that in the days following my meal at Gordon Ramsay&apos;s restaurant in Los Angeles I found myself thinking very seriously about how to write an interesting review of a boring experience. And then, as I thought about the meal there - the blah chicken thing with the blah jus and the blah wild mushrooms, the ho-hum pigeon with the, yawn, steamed broccoli - I would doze off only to awake a few days later, my face stuck to the desk, and realise I was no closer to a solution. Gordon Ramsay at The London: a better cure for jet lag than melatonin, if a bit more expensive. I do find it baffling. Let&apos;s be clear. This is not me indulging in a little light tall-poppy-syndrome fun, or at least not just that. Ramsay is a skilled technical French cook. I think he makes great television, and I am lost in admiration for anyone who can run a marathon. Gordon Ramsay Holdings is also exceptionally professional and without doubt has done huge things for the restaurant business in London. The heft and reliability of their gastro pubs stand as a testament to all of that. But at the level at which he plays, that isn&apos;t enough. In interviews he compares himself constantly to the big French boys, Alain Ducasse and Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. In terms of global reach, the comparison is fair. In terms of food it isn&apos;t. Robuchon and Ducasse change their menus. Ramsay is doing the same thing he was doing at Aubergine in the 90s. Sure, the room at the London West Hollywood is funkier and less up itself than the usual high-end &quot;would sir like a hand job?&quot; Ramsay place: shiny, shimmery walls and shiny metal slats over the windows and cosy wavy-backed banquettes. On a weekday night it was doing good business, the hungry and moneyed of Hollywood crowding in for a bit of hot Ramsay action. But, oh look, here comes that damn seafood ravioli of his, a big domed thing with careful pleated edges and a little bisque. Sometimes it&apos;s crab, sometimes it&apos;s lobster (which is what it was when I first ate it at Aubergine, circa 1995). Here it is made with king prawns, but it is exactly the same thing. The chicken and pigeon dishes, for all their artful presentation on oblong plates, stick so resolutely to the protein-jus-vegetable model Auguste Escoffier would doubtless have approved. And that is not a good thing. This is not a plea for innovation for innovation&apos;s sake. But in return for the amount of money you are asked to pay, isn&apos;t it reasonable to hope that there is at work in the kitchen a culinary intelligence which wants to surprise and thrill you, that wants to do more than simply get you to buy into a brand?  Take his signature dessert, the tarte tatin for two, which is on the menu at pretty much every one of his restaurants. It was first created - probably by accident - at the Hotel Tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron in France in 1898. That&apos;s 109 years ago. Ramsay&apos;s crew makes a good one. The pastry is rich and buttery, the caramel sticky, the apples cooked through. But that&apos;s all it is - somebody else&apos;s dish.  It&apos;s not even a reinterpretation of somebody else&apos;s dish. At his pubs that&apos;s exactly the thing. But at the restaurants to which he attaches his name we have the right to expect more - a taste of him - and we don&apos;t get it. Though in Los Angles we do get a taste of something else. The chef here is Andy Cook, who previously was at Ramsay&apos;s restaurant in Tokyo. Weirdly, he has brought with him a bunch of Japanese dishes which sit among all this froufrou Frenchiness with as much grace as a pig in a synagogue. The amuse? An entirely Japanese hot savoury egg custard with mushrooms and an umami glaze. What the hell is it doing there? Slumming it? Among the starters is Japanese eel with deep-fried ginger and an oblong of naked sushi rice. It is a classic nigiri sushi of unagi but a) deconstructed in an unnecessary manner and b) done badly. The skin, which is the highlight of the eel, had been removed, and the rice was stodgy. All it made me think about was the really good unagi I&apos;d eaten at the cheap sushi joints on Melrose Avenue.  And then, as this review was going to print, it was announced that Ramsay was bailing out, selling the restaurant back to the hotel in which it is situated - which tells you absolutely everything you need to know. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk"}, {"sentences": ["In the mid to late 90s, when big name chefs first started cloning themselves \u2013 in Las Vegas, Tokyo and Dubai, among other places \u2013 it was almost always on a consultancy basis.", "Gordon Ramsay and his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, who runs Gordon Ramsay Holdings, signed up to a couple of these deals, in Dubai and Tokyo but eventually concluded it was not in their interests because the return was limited."], "tags": ["Gordon Ramsay", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Chefs", "Television", "Restaurants", "Television & radio", "Los Angeles"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-13T15:00:00Z", "title": "Jay Rayner: Gordon Ramsay's empire building stutters in Los Angeles", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/mar/13/gordon-ramsay-sells-london-la", "article": "Given the constant churn in the restaurant business it&apos;s a surprise it hasn&apos;t happened before: in the time between this Sunday&apos;s restaurant review going to press and it appearing (in print - you can read it here now), the status of the restaurant has completely changed. The venue in question is not my usual sort of place, being a good 6,000 miles from where most of us are located.  I recently had to spend nearly a month in Los Angeles and I thought it presented a great opportunity to review the outpost of the Gordon Ramsay empire located at the London Hotel in West Hollywood. No, very few of us need to know whether it&apos;s worth going there, but I certainly thought there would be interest in me finding out whether it was any cop. (Not really is the answer, as you&apos;ll see.)Except \u2026 it&apos;s not his any more. Or at least, not his in the way it was. Gordon Ramsay Holdings has sold Gordon Ramsay at the London back to the hotel in which it is located. According to reports, business was slow, mostly because Angelinos took exception to the fact that the man whose name is above the door is rarely there.  This makes sense. Angelinos regard celebrity-spotting not as a sport but merely as local colour; they see their town as the place where famous people really live. It&apos;s everywhere else they merely pop up in. The notion therefore, that Ramsay should have regarded Los Angeles as somewhere he could drop into from time to time, would not have played well. For what it&apos;s worth, as I say in the piece, it was rammed the night I was there. Then again it was the Thursday before Oscar week and, as local intelligence has it, if you can&apos;t fill a restaurant then you really are screwed.  Certainly it&apos;s worth looking at what&apos;s happened at The London, West Hollywood because it goes to the very heart of the Ramsay business model. In the mid to late 90s, when big name chefs first started cloning themselves \u2013 in Las Vegas, Tokyo and Dubai, among other places \u2013 it was almost always on a consultancy basis. A big-name hotel would sign up a chef to put their name to a restaurant, in return for a fee and a cut of the take, often of the gross. The chef would guarantee to be on site a few weeks a year and supply a few key personnel, the chef and his deputy in the kitchen, say, the maitre d&apos; and his second out front, and the hotel would handle the rest. The appeal of such a deal is obvious: a guaranteed income, an international profile and almost no exposure to costs. Gordon Ramsay and his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, who runs Gordon Ramsay Holdings, signed up to a couple of these deals, in Dubai and Tokyo but eventually concluded it was not in their interests because the return was limited. Business was so good that they decided it didn&apos;t make sense to let the hotels reap all the rewards. Instead they chose \u2013 bravely, I think - to invest millions, paying for almost all the costs - generally the hotels paid to install the new kitchens on the grounds it would be a resource that would endure for them after Ramsay and co had moved on - and taking home all the revenues. In times of plenty it proved to be a very profitable model indeed, with Gordon Ramsay Holdings posting very healthy profits \u2013 whenever they got round to submitting their accounts. However it takes only a slight downturn in business for things to go the other way (for those with an economics background it&apos;s a classic S curve). Presumably any reports of difficulties that GRH are experiencing are down to this massive cost exposure, through ownership.  And so, in Los Angeles they&apos;ve come up with a solution: swapping from the &apos;own everything&apos; plan to the consultancy plan. It will still be called Gordon Ramsay at the London, but now it&apos;s the hotel&apos;s business and he&apos;s just the hired hand. Apparently the same swap has taken place in Prague where his outpost of Jason Atherton&apos;s restaurant Maze is now in the hands of the hotel. For those of us with an overly-developed interest in these things it is an intriguing development. It will also be interesting to see if any of the other restaurants in his empire go the same way, as the company works to reduce its costs. The truth is that Gordon Ramsay Holdings has proved itself to be brilliant at managing success, but rather less so at managing failure."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;General Kim Jong-il said that the people should also be allowed access to the world&apos;s famous dishes,&quot; the restaurant&apos;s manager, Kim Sang-Soon, was quoted as saying in Choson Sinbo, a Tokyo-based newspaper seen as a mouthpiece for the regime."], "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Travel", "North Korea holidays", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-16T02:32:00Z", "title": "After 10 years of leader's heroic struggle, pizza comes to North Korea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/16/north-korea-pizza", "article": "For millions of undernourished North Koreans, the notion of eating at a restaurant belongs strictly to the world of fantasy. And so there is only the grimmest humour in the news that, for the country&apos;s ruling elite, Pyongyang&apos;s dining options just got a little more impressive: the country now has its first-ever pizzeria. An obsession with pizza stretching back at least 10 years prompted the isolated nation&apos;s dictator, Kim Jong-il, to authorise North Korea&apos;s first Italian restaurant, which opened in December, according to a pro-Pyongyang newspaper published in Japan. &quot;General Kim Jong-il said that the people should also be allowed access to the world&apos;s famous dishes,&quot; the restaurant&apos;s manager, Kim Sang-Soon, was quoted as saying in Choson Sinbo, a Tokyo-based newspaper seen as a mouthpiece for the regime. Those dining at the restaurant are reportedly treated to pizza and pasta made with wheat flour, butter and cheese flown in from Italy. They are also presumably reaping the benefits of a years-long effort by Kim Jong-il to bring the perfect pizza to his famine-plagued totalitarian state. In the late 1990s, he summoned a team of Italian pizza chefs to Pyongyang to instruct army officers. One of the chefs, Ermanno Furlanis, later recounted how the Italians underwent x-rays, brain scans and urine and blood sampling on arrival, before being sequestered in a marble palace. One of the officers Furlanis was training asked him to specify the precise distance at which olives should be spaced on a pizza, he recalled. Kim seems to have taken a personal interest: while the pizza-making sessions were under way, on a ship anchored offshore, he was apparently witnessed arriving to inspect his officers&apos; progress. &quot;I am not in the position to say whether it really was him,&quot; Furlanis later said. &quot;But our chef, who had no reason to fib, was, for the space of several minutes, utterly speechless. He said he felt as if he had seen God, and I still envy him this experience.&quot; The training seems not to have met Kim&apos;s expectations. According to Choson Sinbo, subsequent efforts to reproduce Italian pizza in North Korea were a process of &quot;repeated trial and error&quot;, and last year the dictator sent chefs to Naples and Rome to learn more. Finally satisifed, he authorised the restaurant. North Korea, one of the world&apos;s poorest countries, was hit by devastating famine in the mid-1990s, with up to 2m people dying, primarily from pneumonia, tuberculosis and diarrhoea. But Kim&apos;s passion for fine food is legendary: he is said to be a connoisseur of cognac, French wine, shark-fin soup and sushi. One of his former chefs, writing under a pseudonym, recalled travelling to Iran and Uzbekistan to fetch caviar, flying to Denmark for bacon and China for melons and grapes. He defected, he wrote, by offering to source sea urchins from Japan, from where he never returned. Quoting North Korean defectors, the South Korean news website Daily NK said Kim &quot;does not eat much, but enjoys picking at various kinds of food, as if just to taste&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Hiroshi Kobayashi, of Tokyo University of Science, has been testing cyber-teachers in schools."], "tags": ["Education"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-17T00:01:00Z", "title": "Notebook: March 17 2009", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/17/notebook-education-news", "article": "\u2022 Paul Mackney, who leads the Campaigning Alliance for Lifelong Learning (Call), points out a contrast between the attitudes of the UK government and the new president of the US when it comes to learning languages.

Threats of suspensions sounded among the suspenders and the next day dawned with no sexy underwear in sight. The Shanghai players were oblivious, relaxed by watching the new film Valkyrie, and went on to win 4-1. The incident was minor but it highlights the challenges facing the league to realise the goal of AFC president Mohammad Bin Hamman, who believes it will be competing with its European bigger brother within 10 years. It won&apos;t be easy. The tournament has struggled since its inception in 2003 \u2013 before which it was known as the &quot;Asian Club Championship&quot;. While there are fierce rivalries at national-team level, the arrival of a Saudi club in Tokyo or a Korean side in Dubai means little to many who still have the Uefa version in mind when they talk about the Champions League. It is not all the fans&apos; fault. Some clubs, especially in the Far East, were initially reluctant to put in the time and effort \u2013 and a midweek clash in Asia can cost a great deal of both \u2013 for winning a competition that until this year netted just $600,000. That was for the winners, most others were left out of pocket. Only three years ago, Korea&apos;s Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors even wanted to quit in order to cut costs, but a hefty withdrawal fine blocked the Motors&apos; exit. They stayed, won the whole thing and Hyundai executives were soon drooling over showing their brand at the Fifa Club World Cup, a carrot introduced in 2005. The idea behind it was to make the trophy more attractive to previously lukewarm J-League sides. Urawa Reds were the first team to give it a serious go. The club, one that has excelled at marketing longer than it has on the pitch, regularly attracts 50,000 fans to home games and their win in 2007 gave the ACL the credibility and iconic images it needed. Now the AFC is trying to move the tournament to the next level. First, it has a new format this season: 32 teams in eight groups of four, with east and west Asia separated until the knockout stage and two teams instead of one progressing to the next round. The governing body, tired of the way some clubs operate (expulsions for failing to submit player registrations on time were annual events), has become ruthless. Each league was evaluated on criteria that ranged from the quality of the stadiums and marketing to the proximity of international airports. Japan was the only A-grade student, followed by South Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The &quot;Big Five&quot; were given four spots each (UAE have three plus one qualifier). Australia, Uzbekistan and Qatar have two, with Indonesia allowed one. A club each from Singapore, India, Vietnam and Thailand can try the play-offs. With only 10 out of 46 members having automatic entry, it leaves the European version looking positively egalitarian and, unlike Uefa&apos;s co-efficient ranking, it has little to do with past performances. But for the AFC it creates a core that can drive standards forward. It has started well. This season features the first ever professional league in UAE, and Australia&apos;s A League will expand from eight to 10 teams. Japan, China and Korea have 18, 16 and 15 top-flight teams respectively and are developing extensive lower league networks. In attendance terms, more people are watching the J-league than the Eredivisie, while the Chinese Super League and the K-league outdraw Portugal and Belgium. There is big investment in Uzbekistan and rumours that in Iran some clubs will be moved out of public and into private control. Money also helps encourage the teams and in 2009 the Asian champions will collect around $1.5m. It may be small beer compared to Europe&apos;s offerings, but it is a big step. Asia also boasts a much richer competition than the European version. Only one quarter-finalist from 2005 made it to the knockout stage in 2006 (with the exception of the holders who got a bye \u2013 a practice now rightly abolished). The same happened in 2007 and 2008. Yet this may not help increase interest in the league. For television in Asia, familiarity breeds content as rivalries and stars need to be developed if Europhiles (often dismissive of their local leagues) are to be persuaded that Asia is exciting \u2013 although fortunately time differences mean that televised AFC and Uefa games don&apos;t clash. Gamba Osaka&apos;s win in 2008 helped to put Yasuhito Endo on the map but more of the same is needed, such as expanding representation from the &quot;Big Five&quot; so 2009 stars return in the future. These stars light the way forward and their status will be helped by the start of an intra-continental transfer market. This year has seen most Asian nations adopt the &quot;3 plus 1 rule&quot;. Leagues limit the number of foreign players to three per team, now they can sign one more \u2013 provided he comes from an AFC member. It is early days but Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Australian stars are now moving around Asia. With two Chinese teams losing in Japan last week, Beijing media seized upon the exploits of Li Weifeng. The one-time (literally) Everton defender starred as the K-league&apos;s Suwon thrashed the Japanese champions, Kashima Antlers, 4-1. For the first time in Korea, interest was shown in the western region of the group stage thanks to Fulham&apos;s loan of Seol Ki-hyeon to Saudi Arabia&apos;s Al Hilal. A few world stars who aren&apos;t approaching imminent retirement wouldn&apos;t go amiss either. With oil-rich clubs in the west and eastern outfits with links to big business, the money is potentially there for the right big name. In recent years, however, it just hasn&apos;t happened. Ageing stars such as Gabriel Batistuta and the De Boers liked the sunshine, the gentle schedules, the proximity to Europe and the expat life in the Gulf \u2013 more &quot;professional&quot; regimes may not appeal. It is harder to tempt footballers to the more distant, colder and, both on the pitch and off, more frantic eastern regions. More players are needed and not just for marketing purposes. Asian teams don&apos;t usually have the strength in depth to sustain challenges at home and abroad. When Urawa won in 2007, they promptly collapsed with exhaustion and, over the final five games of the J-League season, lost a 10-point lead and the title. 2006 winners Jeonbuk finished 11th in Korea and Gamba Osaka managed eighth. Japanese clubs are again the favourites, with South Korean teams such as Suwon Bluewings and FC Seoul, the latter coached by Turkey&apos;s 2002 World Cup boss, Senol Gunes, close behind. In the middle of the continent, big-spending, Eto&apos;o-chasing Bunyodkor have the competition&apos;s one world star, Rivaldo, as well as half of the Uzbekistan national team to call on. If gas drives the Central Asian challenge then oil fuels western dreams of a first win since 2005. While the really big names have gone, there is still enough talent to cause problems. Al Jazira and Al Ahli of UAE have Brazilians while Saudi Arabian powerhouses Al Hilal and Al Ittihad have Swedish, Egyptian and Moroccan internationals as well as a wealth of experience winning titles at home and abroad. There is one element to the new format that may backfire on the AFC this season. The Tehran titans Persepolis and Esteghlal regularly attract 70,000-plus crowds. While unlikely on paper, should these rivals, the fiercest in Asia, make the final, both red and blue fans will have to travel all the way to Tokyo for a one-off match in November \u2013 it used to be two-legged. For all the new investment and marketing, therefore, the competition could end in a damp squib. Asian club fans don&apos;t travel overseas in anything approaching large numbers (only Korea&apos;s Seongnam, owned by the wealthy Unification church, AKA &apos;The Moonies&apos;, attract big support in Japan courtesy of local church members \u2013 check out the massed yellow ranks), AFC officials will be praying that a Japanese club makes the final. It may be a mistake to follow Uefa in this aspect but the Asian Champions League is set on shadowing, and one day catching, the giant to the west."}, {"sentences": ["Pyongyang&apos;s relations with Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have become increasingly strained, particularly since the announcement of its plans to launch a satellite next month."], "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-18T10:39:23Z", "title": "North Korea turns down US food aid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/18/north-korea-us-food-aid", "article": "North Korea has rejected an offer of further food aid from the US despite its chronic food shortages, the US state department said today.

Hundreds of thousands died in a famine in the 1990s but, until 2005, the country&apos;s food security had been improving. Meanwhile, Seoul has warned that the future of a joint industrial venture is at risk after North Korea closed the nearby border for four days and left hundreds of South Korean workers stranded. The Kaesong industrial complex is a much-needed source of income for the North. &quot;We are at this point not considering shutting down the Kaesong industrial zone,&quot; Seoul&apos;s unification minister, Hyun In-taek, said today. &quot;But if the North repeats the border traffic suspension after the end of the [military] drills, the government will consider it a very grave situation and will take appropriate measures.&quot; He said he believed the Kaesong situation had &quot;dashed the hopes that the North and the South would embrace each other despite the grave military and security conditions between the two&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["For those already familiar with Lomo  and the current trend for funky cameras with multiple lenses, this also happens to be the Tokyo headquarters of Superheadz, the company responsible for reissuing the technicolor Holgas and retro-style Blackbird, Fly cameras.", "2F, 1-15-12, Jinnan, Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, +81 3 5428 5162, superheadz.com/cabaret 8Bit Cafe 8Bit Cafe in Shinjuku takes the prize for coolest nerd bar in Tokyo.", "Being a Tokyo bar, there&apos;s a standard table fee of 500 yen per person.", "Not bad for a Tokyo theme bar.", "Closed on Tuesdays Cafe Comme Ca      Tokyo cafes serve up some excellent desserts for tea time, but finding the right spot is no easy task.", "The proportions of the tarts are absurd by Tokyo standards and they dwarf all other cake options in the area which are also more expensive.", "Hours: 10am \u2013 8pm     Ninjafllavour's Jon Siegel Photograph: guardian.co.uk    Jon Siegel is an art director residing in Tokyo, Japan.", "He runs a creative agency in Shibuya and spends his free time documenting Tokyo&apos;s oddities, secrets, and culinary wonders which hit the web in the form of his blog ninjaflavour.com"], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Travel websites", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-18T12:20:35Z", "title": "The Been there guest blogspot: Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2009/mar/18/tokyo-japan-blog", "article": "Camera Cabaret In the electronic shops that line the alleyways in Akihabara is a camera store with a difference. Camera Cabaret is filled with all manner of collectibles \u2013 from a film camera with two golden stallions flanking the lens and a giant hand crank to roll the film, to vintage Dianas and Holgas, and novelty keyring cameras. There&apos;s an instore DJ and the shop is staffed by enthusiasts who are passionate about their collection. For those already familiar with Lomo  and the current trend for funky cameras with multiple lenses, this also happens to be the Tokyo headquarters of Superheadz, the company responsible for reissuing the technicolor Holgas and retro-style Blackbird, Fly cameras.

Located on the fifth floor of an old building with no elevator, 8Bit Cafe is not the easiest place to find, but well worth the quest. By the third floor, you&apos;ll start hearing the blips and blops of game music down the stairwell. Once you reach the fifth, you&apos;ll be surrounded by retro Japanese video games, toys, T-shirts and intoxicated college students. There&apos;s a bar counter and a few large tables along with a game area. The drinks menu is extensive. Doctor Mario is one of their signature cocktails - served in a science lab beaker and paired with a test tube containing two little pills. The drink itself is a Doctor Pepper base with a variety of alcohols stirred in; the pills on the other hand, according to the staff, are merely edible.  The real draw is the game area by the entrance. This is where all those memories of being planted in front of a TV with an Nintendo Entertainment System in the 80s flood back, with the added bonus of being old enough to drink. On a quiet night, you won&apos;t have to wait to have a turn. There&apos;s a monitor with an old Famicom (NES) and a Sufami (Super NES) attached to it. Next to that, a bin filled to the brim with games. All the classics are there, Super Mario, Street Fighter 2, Bubble Bobble. There are two controllers and two stools. With such a unique collection of games nostalgia, 8Bit Cafe is almost a required pilgrimage for gamers looking to pay their respects in the motherland of Nintendo. Being a Tokyo bar, there&apos;s a standard table fee of 500 yen per person. Drinks range from 700 yen to 880 yen and a bowl of nuts will run you 500 yen. Not bad for a Tokyo theme bar. There are events from time to time where DJs mix Chiptune, you can check the schedule on their site (Japanese). \u2022 8Bit CafeShinjuku Sanchome Station (Metro), Exit C-5, walk to the right and it&apos;s the Q-Building, 5th floor.

There are dozens of amazing cafes to choose from, and you can easily spend a good 10 minutes deciding between the place that serves zebra chai tea and one that serves blueberry cheesecake donuts. I&apos;ve been searching for the perfect balance of good coffee or tea and big desserts that won&apos;t break the bank for years. And now, finally, it has revealed itself.  Cafe Comme Ca in Shibuya is fairly simple, stark even, and shares the same space as two clothes shops. It specialises in giant tarts loaded with seasonal fresh fruits \u2013 fruit that would cost an arm and a leg at the supermarket - tangy mixed berry tarts to sweet mango tarts laced with custard and cream. There are even tarts without fruit like matcha and adzuki tart. They&apos;re all the same price, 550 yen per slice, and a cup of coffee is only 220 yen (score!). The proportions of the tarts are absurd by Tokyo standards and they dwarf all other cake options in the area which are also more expensive. Definitely a hit if you&apos;re looking to impress someone or just desperate for a fruit fix. \u2022 Cafe Comme Ca, Shibuya Station, Hachiko exit.

Roppongi is a magnet for overseas visitors and the more hedonistic members of Tokyo&apos;s expat community, drawn to its 330 bars and clubs, many of which depend on touts to lure customers with promises of cheap drinks and casual sex. Britain and Australia had already issued gentler warnings about the potential hazards of a boozy night out in Roppongi. The Foreign Office, while pointing out that Japan has a relatively low crime rate, advises British citizens to remain vigilant when visiting Roppongi. &quot;There have been reports of drink-spiking with drugs such as Rohypnol [a date-rape drug],&quot; its website says. &quot;There have also been instances of British citizens arrested following disputes with bar staff and doormen.&quot; Similar warnings were issued in 2004 when four expat businessmen died and 12 other people fell seriously ill after snorting cocaine that Roppongi dealers had secretly mixed with heroin.

Let&apos;s have a look, shall we? For starters, Life in Hansa, the opening track on their Abbey Road-produced debut album of android disco, In the Atmosphere, pays homage to the Hansa studio in Berlin where David Bowie, Brian Eno and Iggy Pop invented the future that BTN currently inhabit. Track two, Low, shares its title with the first album in Bowie&apos;s so-called &quot;Berlin trilogy&quot;. It&apos;s presumably less than coincidental that Secret Garden recalls the title of Eurythmics&apos; Conny Plank-produced debut album, In the Garden. Hero in Tokyo is a nod to Life in Tokyo by their heroes Japan. In fact, we interrupt this fab parlour game to tell you that, when singer Baker and tech whiz Little were part of a techno-producer duo called Lil Devious, they sampled Japan&apos;s Adolescent Sex, prompting Karn to get in touch and invite them to remix his track The Jump \u2013 a Karn/BTN team-up is now on the cards. Where were we? Ah, yes. We were being clever sods and playing spot the influence. Travelogue sounds, let&apos;s be honest, a teensy bit like the title of the Human League&apos;s second album (hint: it was Travelogue). On You Control Me the band make you wonder what direction Joy Division might have taken had Ian Curtis been listening to Giorgio Moroder&apos;s E = MC2 before he died instead of The Idiot, while here and elsewhere Baker does a passable impression of Curtis&apos;s (and Phil Oakey&apos;s) (and Iggy&apos;s) lugubrious baritone. And on Only for Tonight, there are references to &quot;neon glow&quot; that wouldn&apos;t sound out of place on, say, a Kraftwerk song. And so on and on and on, along the autobahn, down the trans-Europe express, through the hall of mirrors, past the showroom dummies, via the electric cafe, into the metropolis...

But how could it not? The past regulatory regime had failed so completely to foresee, let alone prevent, the banking crisis that credible reform had to involve a rush in the opposite direction. Turner&apos;s big ideas were welcome and obvious. Banks will be forced to hold more capital against their trading position to reduce leverage and improve liquidity. Markets are no longer assumed to be rational, so financial institutions will be forced to set aside capital to enable them to ride the inevitable booms and busts - they must act as shock absorbers, rather than shock amplifiers, as Turner put it. Similar thinking is extended to pay and bonuses. Remuneration schemes that are perceived as risky must be backed by more capital - a belated recognition by the Financial Services Authority that high rewards and high risks go hand in hand. The FSA will feel freer to intervene in the affairs of foreign banks operating in the UK; after the disastrous invasion of Icelandic banks, that idea was a no-brainer.  So far, so good. The heaviest weapon the FSA could deploy was capital adequacy and Turner has used it well. Capital is a language banks understand. It forces them to make sober calculations about risk and it changes behaviour: Turner is probably correct in believing that some of the absurdly complex financial instruments will disappear as they are made more expensive to manufacture. There will be squeals that the FSA is undermining the competitiveness of the City, but they can be ignored for now. In the new world of banking, a commitment to sobriety may act as good advertising for London; we shall have to wait and see. So why did the report also feel under-whelming? It was because Turner ducked two big issues and in another contentious area - the separation of casino-style investment banking from utility banking - he took the soft option. The first issue he ducked was the regulation of financial products, specifically mortgages. Should there be a ban on 100% loan-to-value loans? What is an acceptable loan-to-income ratio? Turner promises an assessment later this year. It&apos;s no wonder he&apos;s confused. Ever the technocrat, he seems to be searching for a mechanical formula. Common sense says the answer must, in part, involve the exercise of good judgment on the ground, which is the way mortgages used to be granted. How secure is an individual&apos;s employment prospects? What is their credit history? These considerations can&apos;t be reflected in catch-all mathematical models. On &quot;macro-prudential regulation&quot; - the identification of risks building up in the system - Turner was vague about how the FSA and the Bank of England would co-operate better. Maybe he was simply obeying orders, since Gordon Brown is not about to sanction a radical overhaul of the tripartite system of financial regulation he created. At some point, though, flesh will have to be put on the bones. Then there was Turner&apos;s rejection of a new Glass-Steagall act - the idea of separating &quot;utility&quot; banking from &quot;casino&quot; investment banking. The governor of the Bank of England wants to encourage a debate on the subject; Turner seems to want to close down discussion. &quot;It is certainly not possible to separate casino banking so completely that we can happily let it go bankrupt in crisis,&quot; Turner says. But, come on, tolerating a situation in which a deposit-taking bank can lose a fortune in the casino and then expect a state rescue is absurd. It encourages bad behaviour. Relying on Turner and his successors to patrol the floor of the casino perfectly is asking for trouble. Creating cleaner lines between different forms of banking would seem to be an essential way of building firewalls into the system; it&apos;s feeble to say the task is too tricky. The bottom line? File the Turner review under work-in-progress. Guilt-free gilt policy Yesterday the US Federal Reserve hit the panic button. The printing presses rolled - $300bn will be spent on long-term government securities and a further $850bn on bits of paper issued by the mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The message is clear: the US will do whatever it takes to revive its economy, including a debasement of its currency. The effect on the dollar was electric - it plunged against the euro and the yen. Life for the export-led economies of Germany and Japan is about to get harder. Viewed from the eurozone or Tokyo, the US is indulging in a beggar-thy-neighbour devaluation, knowing that the hands of the European Central Bank are tied since the Germans are hardly likely to sanction the purchase of IOUs issued in Greece.

Led by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners and the Forum for Democracy it was supported by around 170 civil society groups with events from Dublin to Tokyo.  Inevitably this launch and most of the publicised activism occurred outside Burma, with former prisoners and activists rallying concerned folk globally; and inevitably the notion that the petition should be aimed at those who hold the keys to the cells of the more than 2,100 prisoners of conscience is not even considered.  The number of political prisoners \u2013 which has doubled since 2007 \u2013 is perhaps the most debilitating of issues for any chance of reconciliation or democratic progress in Burma; internment, and the fear that this breeds in those not detained, castrates society, depriving it of viable leadership and dialogue and leadership. It eradicates many of the most original and inspiring voices from the nation&apos;s life. Perhaps the most vindictive prosecutions are those carried out against people for helping the victims of cyclone Nargis. Last week Min Thein Tun was sentenced to 17 years in jail for co-ordinating relief via the internet. He will join Eint Khaing Oo, a young award-winning journalist, on the list; her &quot;crime&quot; was the simple act of interviewing a victim.  While democracy is referred to like a brand, its principles \u2013 namely freedom of speech and association \u2013 are feared by the regime, to the extent that even actions that are not conspicuously anti-government in any form are ruthlessly suppressed. Ideas and actions of the slightly humanistic or questioning are painfully at odds with the notions of politics that are held by the junta.  Despite &quot;showboating&quot;, as the journalist Larry Jagan calls government human rights PR, the numbers show no sign of diminishing. The &quot;showboating&quot; incident was a release of more than 6,000 prisoners, of whom a mere 20 or so were political \u2013 and, according to Bo Kyi of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, these had served lengthy sentences already. Indeed, if the release of such a large number of genuine criminals is not bad enough, it has been suggested that the clear-out was to free up cells for incoming politicals.  If that is the case it could well be because of next year&apos;s supposed election. Which is set to be a strange affair, as the constitution on which it is based is a charter that explicitly legitimates military rule, is illegal to campaign against and was &quot;voted&quot; in by a staggering 98% of the vote \u2013 a result that is indicative of the ridiculousness of the whole charade, as the UN constitutional expert Yash Ghai noted: &quot;The cynicism with which the regime held the referendum and manipulated the results was on a par with the cynicism and coercion by which the draft was prepared.&quot; Of the younger groups joining older generations of activists, perhaps most notable is Generation Wave. The youth group has undertaken graffiti and leafleting campaigns, and among its members is the now detained rapper, Zayar Thaw, one of the most popular musicians in Burma and founder of the band Acid. After his trial for &quot;dealing in foreign currency&quot; and belonging to an &quot;illegal organisation&quot; an attempt has been made to arraign the judges before the international criminal court. The rapper was allowed no time in private with legal representatives and prosecution &quot;witnesses&quot; were not cross-examined.  At roughly the same time that Zayar Thaw was receiving his sentence the government slapped a savage 45-year sentence on Zarganar, the renowned satirist. His plight was sealed by a single interview with the foreign press about cyclone Nargis.  In their decades behind bars these political prisoners will face rape and torture and be deprived of food. And many are put in prisons far from their families, who are often their only source of decent nutrition and medicines. The denial of healthcare is routine even to those suffering from conditions such as heart disease. Within the crowded cells reading and writing is forbidden, and news is gleaned from the scraps of old newsprint used in the making of Burmese cigarettes, cheroots. Communication between cells is done through painstaking versions of Morse code. There is very little room to manoeuvre within Burma for activists, yet the immense struggle continues clandestinely \u2013 just this week a campaign to deface banknotes began with slogans inside Burma as a way of supporting the international petition calling for the release of political prisoners."}, {"sentences": ["Seoul, Washington and Tokyo say they believe it will in fact test a long-range ballistic missile in violation of a United Nations security council resolution.", "Japan&apos;s defence minister, Yasukazu Hamada, said today that Tokyo may mobilise a missile shield, moving PAC-3 missiles near the capital further north to protect against fragments that might fall into Japanese territory if the launch fails."], "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-19T09:30:54Z", "title": "North Korean guards detain US journalists near border with China", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/19/north-korea-detain-journalists", "article": "North Korean guards have detained one or more American journalists near the country&apos;s border with China, South Korean media have reported. The news comes amid increasing strains on the peninsula. Pyongyang is angry at Seoul and Washington&apos;s annual joint military drill, while the latter fear the North is planning to launch a ballistic missile next month. South Korean television channel YTV said guards from the North crossed the border into Chinese territory to arrest two US journalists, quoting an official in Seoul. It said the two women, described as Korean-American employees of a California-based online news company, had ignored warnings to stop filming across the Tumen river. The Munhwa Ilbo evening newspaper said guards had detained one US journalist near the Yalu river, along the western part of the border between the two countries, which runs into the Tumen river on the east side. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to comment on this matter because it involves a US citizen, but our government is aware that a US journalist is in detention in the North,&quot; a senior government official told the paper. Another diplomatic source said the US state department would be dealing with the case soon. The foreign ministry in Seoul could not immediately confirm the report. Pyongyang appeared to regard the arrival of the Obama administration as a prospect for improving relations between the two countries. But its announcement that it will launch a satellite between 4 April and 8 April has increased regional strains. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo say they believe it will in fact test a long-range ballistic missile in violation of a United Nations security council resolution. Japan&apos;s defence minister, Yasukazu Hamada, said today that Tokyo may mobilise a missile shield, moving PAC-3 missiles near the capital further north to protect against fragments that might fall into Japanese territory if the launch fails. The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, yesterday urged the North to co-operate with efforts to revive the deadlocked international talks on nuclear disarmament, another of the stumbling blocks in improving relations. The official People&apos;s Daily newspaper said Wen told his counterpart, Kim Yong-il \u2013 no relation of the country&apos;s leader Kim Jong-il \u2013 that China wants to &quot;actively push forward&quot; the six-party negotiations. Kim will today meet China&apos;s president, Hu Jintao, for talks which may include discussion about a possible summit with Kim Jong-il, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said Thursday, citing unnamed sources in Beijing. It said that Chinese leaders had invited Kim to visit, possibly in early April.

You might think so, what with headlines declaring &quot;Disney no Dumbo when it comes to the environment&quot; and sober-minded business journalists reporting their ambitions to be &quot;as green as Jiminy Cricket&quot;. Anyhow, the company with an unerring ability to persuade people to cross oceans to visit its theme park is now taking the well-worn path to corporate environmentalism. Its journey is being charted by Conservation International, one of the world&apos;s largest and most business-friendly environmental organisations. Last week, Disney put out a new corporate sustainability report declaring its intention to reduce water use, cut waste, protect nature, head for zero-carbon emissions at its offices and parks and try to buy green electricity in future. Some eye-catching features include the train at Disneyland in California, which now runs on biodiesel made with used cooking oil from the resort&apos;s restaurants. In case anyone thought this do-goodery would damage the bottom line, CEO Robert Iger promised that the wider purpose was to &quot;make our brands and products more attractive, strengthen our bonds with consumers, make the company a more desirable place to work, and build goodwill in the communities we operate. All of this contributes to shareholder value.&quot; I am not cynical about such motives. Climate change will only be solved when corporations like Disney see that cutting emissions is good for the bottom line. My problem is that Disney&apos;s business model is unchanged. It remains tied to global promotion of trips to its resorts \u2013 just about the most environmentally damaging leisure activity you can imagine. Disney&apos;s announcement says action on climate change is &quot;urgent&quot; and requires &quot;fundamental changes in the way society, including businesses, use natural resources, and Disney is no exception.&quot; Disney are greening some of their activities, but they are not greening their business model. This is greenwash. Let me admit that I have never felt the slightest desire to cross the Atlantic to go and see Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck or any of Walt Disney&apos;s colourful characters. (I was always a Popeye man myself.) But many people have been persuaded that they are. Of the 23 million people who visit Disney&apos;s Florida parks, around four million are non-Americans, mostly from Europe. Around 1.2 million Brits alone visit Florida on holiday each year, the great majority go to Disney. According to the carbon offsetting company Climate Care, the emissions for one person flying from London to Orlando are 1.96 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Multiply that by a million and we are at more or less 2m tonnes of CO2 for British visitors and up to 8m tonnes for Europeans. So that&apos;s about the same as the annual emissions of the 83 million people of Ethiopia \u2013 just to get Europeans to a Disney dream holiday. Many Americans also fly to Disney. Sadly, Disney does not calculate the emissions from people visiting its operations, so this is a guess. But I&apos;d say that in all it could reach 15m tonnes. Disney&apos;s other large parks must have big carbon footprints, too. Ten of the world&apos;s top 25 theme parks bear the Disney name, including all of the top eight, with 104 million visitors a year, according to the Parkworld web site. Disneyland in California attracts 15 million visitors a year, and its two theme parks in Tokyo a combined total of 26 million. Paris Disneyland takes more than 12 million, including two million Brits, probably half of whom fly. A typical flight from the UK (say, Birmingham) to Paris emits 0.13 tonnes of CO2. A lot better than crossing the Atlantic, but still 130,000 tonnes for a million people. You might say this is nothing to do with Disney. It cannot be held responsible for whether and how people visit its hugely popular resorts.

A Seoul-based missionary named the reporters as Laura Ling and Euna Lee from Current TV \u2013 the online media outlet set up by former US vice-president Al Gore. He said he spoke to them on Tuesday morning, hours before they were taken into custody. The news comes amid increasing strains on the peninsula. Pyongyang is angry at Seoul and Washington&apos;s annual joint military drill, while the latter fear the North may be planning to launch a ballistic missile next month. The US state department said it was aware of the reports. &quot;We are working with the Chinese government officials in the area to ascertain the whereabouts of the Americans in question,&quot; press officer Fred Lash said. &quot;We also have been in touch with North Korean authorities to express our concern about the situation.&quot; South Korean television channel YTV said guards from the North crossed the border into Chinese territory to arrest the Korean-Americans, quoting an official in Seoul who added that the women had ignored warnings to stop filming across the Tumen river. A diplomatic source told Reuters the reporters were on the frozen river when detained, adding that it was not clear which side of the border they were on at the time. The Reverend Chun Ki-won of the Seoul-based Durihana Mission told the Associated Press he had learned that North Korean soldiers detained the two women with a guide they had hired in China, but declined to reveal his sources. He later said he had been told that a third American member of the crew, a cameraman, escaped arrest &quot;at the last minute&quot;. Chun said he met the two in Seoul recently as they planned a report on North Korean refugees. They spoke to him by telephone on Tuesday morning to say they were in the Chinese border city of Yanji and were heading toward the Yalu river near the Chinese border city of Dandong, he said. Chun, who helps North Korean refugees seek asylum, added: &quot;I told them very clearly not to go to the border because it&apos;s dangerous.&quot; On Twitter, a user called &quot;lauraling&quot; noted on Saturday that she was at Seoul airport en route to the &quot;China/N Korea border&quot;, joking: &quot;Hoping my kimchee [pickled vegetable] breath will ward off all danger.&quot; Three days earlier, she had written: &quot;Spent the day interviewing young N. Koreans who escaped their country. Too many sad stories.&quot; The foreign ministry in Seoul could not immediately confirm the report. In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said officials were &quot;investigating the issue involving relevant US nationals on the border [with] China&quot;. Pyongyang appeared to regard the arrival of the Obama administration as a prospect for improving relations between the two countries. But its announcement that it will launch a satellite between 4 April and 8 April has increased regional strains. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo say they believe it will in fact test a long-range ballistic missile in violation of a UN security council resolution.

It will be the first time in peacetime the century-old event has not taken place. The biennial event, which was due to be staged in London next summer, has been running since 1903 and has taken place ever since, apart from during the two world wars. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the trade body which organises the two-week show in July, said it had consulted with its members before making the decision. It said it would be inappropriate to expect struggling carmakers to commit themselves to taking part. Some companies employ more than 200 people during the event, incurring considerable hotel bills and other expenses. The total cost of participating in international motor shows can often run into tens of millions of pounds. Planning for them typically starts a year before the event. This is why the Detroit and Geneva motor shows recently took place despite the dire state of the industry, as most companies had already committed to taking part. But other motor shows scheduled to take place over the next 18 months could be scrapped. A spokesman for Oica, the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, which helps organise the calendar of events for the industry, admitted that a number of smaller shows might not take place next year. But he said the &quot;Big Five&quot; \u2013 the showcases in Geneva, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Detroit \u2013 would all go ahead. Paul Everitt, chief executive of the SMMT, said: &quot;It&apos;s obvious that companies&apos; budgets are under pressure and it would be tough for them to make a commitment. We are working in an industry where people have been made redundant and are facing an uncertain future. &quot;It would be inappropriate to then say &apos;We are going to be holding a multimillion-pound event next year&apos; when we don&apos;t know what the economic circumstances will look like.&quot; Carmakers have been savaged by a dramatic slump in sales. Swaths of the industry, especially dealerships and suppliers, have also been starved of credit. The British car industry is in limbo as companies wait to find out who will be eligible for the \u00a32.3bn package of loans and loan guarantees from the government. Companies have to submit projects to develop fuel-efficient technologies to qualify for the financial support, and it will take weeks for them to put together their applications and get a decision."}, {"sentences": ["It was environmental madness: water shipped from a spring in Tennessee to Hollywood, London, Tokyo and other &quot;style centres of the world&quot; to be enjoyed by jet-set hollow-heads."], "tags": ["Pollution", "Water", "Ethical and green living", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-20T13:46:38Z", "title": "Leo Hickman: Why bottled Bling H2O is an eco low", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/mar/20/bling-h2o-bottled-water", "article": "Anyone putting together a time capsule in 2006 need have looked no further than a bottle of Bling H2O as the most apt representation of that year. The world&apos;s most expensive bottle of water was, literally, the high watermark of the kind of conspicuous consumption that prevailed before the credit that allowed such lavish spending was mercilessly crunched a year later. At $55 a bottle, Bling H2O was wrong on so many levels. It was hype personified: Paris Hilton was said to let her dog drink it and yet a blind taste test revealed it was indistinguishable from tap water. It was environmental madness: water shipped from a spring in Tennessee to Hollywood, London, Tokyo and other &quot;style centres of the world&quot; to be enjoyed by jet-set hollow-heads. (The frosted glass bottles, &quot;exquisitely handcrafted with Swarovski crystals&quot;, were labelled, thank goodness, as &quot;reusable&quot;, though.) And, for good measure, it somehow threw in some sexism, too: the marketing of the water featured a naked woman (sorry, she did appear upon closer inspection to be wearing a thong made of crystals) in a rather unlikely pose propping up a bottle between her buttocks and her heel. I present to you - without any need for commentary or adulteration \u2013 the marketing blurb that accompanied BlingH20:  Bling H2O is the inspiration of Kevin G Boyd, Hollywood writer-producer. While working on various studio lots where image is of the utmost importance he noticed that you could tell a lot about a person by the bottled water they carried. In Hollywood it seemed as if people flaunted their bottled water like it was part of their presentation. Whether the bottles had a cool shape or came from an exotic island, none truly made that defining statement. Bling H2O was fashioned to make that defining statement. The mission was to offer a product with an exquisite face to match exquisite taste. The product is strategically positioned to target the expanding super-luxury consumer market. Initially introduced to hand-selected athletes and actors, Bling H2O is now excitedly expanding it&apos;s availability. Bling H2O has been featured at many recent celebrity events including the MTV Video Music Awards and television&apos;s biggest event, The Emmys. Bling H2O is pop-culture in a bottle. But it&apos;s not for everyone, just those that Bling.  I&apos;m convinced that students will be studying and dissecting every sentence of this statement in decades to come. Indeed, we should start printing flyers for distribution with this blurb, but with the heading: &quot;Stay Alert - Let&apos;s Never Allow This to Happen Again.&quot; Even Forbes \u2013 the Heat magazine for millionaires - has gone as far as placing it in its annual &quot;Most Outrageously Priced Items&quot; list. One might have assumed that the economic shakedown would have spelled a watery grave for Bling H20 and all that it represents. But, I now learn that Bling H20 is also available in plastic bottles for a more affordable $20. The only concession to the recession is that they&apos;re marked down from $24 on the Bling H20 website. So, given that new awards are all the rage on this site at the moment, I think this is time to launch yet another: the Wrong On So Many Levels Award, or, if you prefer, the Wrongies.

With his second bite at the grand prix cherry - having raced briefly for Jordan in 2004 - the German proved that you don&apos;t have to be 21 years old to get the paddock&apos;s attention - something he did quite well in the final grand prix of the year, actually, when he inadvertently helped Lewis Hamilton to the drivers&apos; title. How they see themselves  OK, the teething troubles may have lasted a tad longer than anyone expected but they are a cutting-edge high-technology operation which has the potential to deliver grand prix victories. The words laughing stock do not feature but after years of make-or-break seasons, which proved to be anything but, this could be the last chance to prove all that cash has not been squandered. Honest assessment About time they stopped being promising and started delivering. They have stuck with the same driver line-up and don&apos;t want for resources.

The report by London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) looked at 11 major cities on four continents, including London, Tokyo, New York and Rio de Janeiro. It found per capita greenhouse gas emissions for a Londoner in 2004 were the equivalent of 6.2 tonnes of CO2, compared with 11.19 for the UK average. The rural northeast of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, were singled out for having the highest footprints per capita in the UK. In the US, New Yorkers register footprints of 7.1 tonnes each, less than a thrid of the US average of 23.92 tonnes. The use of public transport and denser housing are two of the reasons for urbanites&apos; comparatively low carbon footprints, the authors said, adding that the design of cities significantly affects their residents&apos; emissions. &quot;Tokyo has considerably lower emissions per person than either Beijing or Shanghai and this shows clearly that prosperity does not lead inevitably to greater emissions,&quot; said report author David Dodman. &quot;Well-designed and well-governed cities can combine high living standards with much lower greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;     Greenhouse gas emissions per capita (tonnes of CO2 equivalen). Source: Guardian/IIED    The report coincides with a study published today by the UK&apos;s Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, which called for more spending on parks and trees in cities to create jobs and cut climate change emissions. The IIED is not the first organisation to suggest city living is greener than living in the countryside: last summer the Brookings Institute said residents in US cities had 14% lower footprints than the US average. The authors of this new report, however, admit that assessing emissions is not an exact science because different countries and cities employ different methodologies for counting CO2 emissions, making a precise like-for-like comparison difficult. Most city dwellers&apos; emissions are also still too high to curb climate change, despite being low compared with national averages. &quot;With the exceptions of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, all of the cities surveyed already exceed the per capita \ufb01gure&quot; needed to keep CO2 levels below 450 parts per million, warned Dodman."}, {"sentences": ["The zone will be unveiled at a special meeting of Asian film industry executives and media policymakers from Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore and Macau today at the Hong Kong Filmart conference."], "tags": ["Danny Boyle", "Film", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-23T17:57:07Z", "title": "China plans Shanghai zone where Western film quota to be relaxed", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/23/china-film-quota", "article": "It could spell the beginning of the end for a seven-year-old policy which caps the number of foreign films allowed to screen in China each year at 20.

The &quot;special cultural administrative region&quot; in Shanghai&apos;s Wai Gao Qiao free trade district would be a testing ground for further reform of government policy on foreign imports. The aim is also to boost the number of Chinese films which perform well in western markets, of which there have been only a handful in the past decade. China has adopted a strict quota for film imports since joining the World Trade Organisation in 2002. The government also censors any films which it objects to on cultural grounds, and China&apos;s own output is carefully controlled.

Well, this is the fishy equivalent. In a themed Tokyo restaurant, the angler and writer Charles Rangeley Wilson sits dangling his rod from a model boat. The pond is artificial but the fish are real, and soon he catches a snapper - actually, to be fair, Aki, his translator, does. The fish is whisked away, to be cooked, Charles thinks, while they sing a celebratory song. And then the snapper comes back on a plate. &quot;Oh, it&apos;s sushi,&quot; says Charles.  &quot;I thought they were going to grill it.&quot; The flesh has been removed from both sides of the fish, and lies in thin strips on crushed ice, with pieces of lemon and the carcass of the snapper arranged decoratively beside it.  But there&apos;s another surprise. &quot;Shit, it moved!&quot; says Charles. And he&apos;s not imagining it. The carcass is twitching, waggling its fins and opening and closing its mouth - gasping out its famous last fishy words, perhaps. How is it possible that a fish which has had its flesh removed, and is bent double with a wooden stick through its head, is still alive? Skilful slicing, I imagine. Charles seems a bit shaken. &quot;It seems to me a little cruel,&quot; says Charles. &quot;Yeah, cruel,&quot; echoes Aki, smiling.  &quot;Just do it, just eat, forget about the complicated thing, this is Japan.&quot; By the complicated thing, I think he means the morality of stripping the flesh from a living creature.  This is just one of the extraordinary scenes in Fish! A Japanese Obsession (BBC4), Charles RW&apos;s journey around Japan to get to the bottom of the country&apos;s passion for fish. He meets koi carp worth \u00a350,000 each, and a rock singer who wears a real tuna head on stage (Tuna Turner?). He dives for shellfish with the sea ladies of Ise, and learns how to remove the deadly poison from the delicious fugu fish. And he puts on a panda suit to go paragliding. No, I have no idea what that has to do with fish, either, and nor does he, but it&apos;s lovely - a waving panda flying over the rice paddies. It&apos;s all lovely. I was a pushover because I too have a thing about fish, and although I&apos;ve never been to Japan I&apos;ve always wanted to. It looks beautiful, of course, and Charles brings a nice dry amusement to it all - not mocking, just sometimes a little surprised (it&apos;s a thin line).  Just the one complaint, then: the length. An hour and a half is half an hour too long for a documentary like this - for just about any documentary, in fact. I think its length would have put people off, and that&apos;s a shame because, as I said, it was lovely. And it&apos;s not as if there weren&apos;t bits that couldn&apos;t have been trimmed - Charles&apos;s interviews for an interpreter, for example. Half an hour could have easily been skilfully sliced off without killing it.  In The Great Sperm Race (Channel 4), the story of conception is given a cake with &quot;eat me&quot; written on it, so that individual sperms become the size of human beings and are played by them (and the inside of the vagina is played by a valley in the Canadian Rockies, intriguingly). It&apos;s like that scene from Woody Allen&apos;s Everything You&apos;ve Always Wanted to Know About Sex but drawn out over an hour and without the jokes. Quite informative, but also slightly tiresome and annoying. We&apos;re asked to &quot;think about it from the point of view of the sperm&quot;, but I&apos;m finding that hard because I&apos;m pretty sure sperm don&apos;t have a point of view. Snapper possibly, sperm definitely not - otherwise every male ejaculation would be mass murder on an apocalyptic scale.

He now rates as the second-biggest loser in the book behind favourite My Will, and the gamble shows no sign of subsiding.&quot; That seems crazy to me. War Of Attrition will have at least 11st 6lb and quite possibly 11st 9lb on his back, depending on which horse ends up with top weight. Even a horse in his prime would struggle with that weight, which no horse since Red Rum has lugged to victory in the National. But War Of Attrition&apos;s prime was left behind when he suffered the tendon injury that kept him off the track for 18 months prior to this season. If I were a bookie, I&apos;d be laying him for everything I could take. At the more realistic end of the weights, Character Building has apparently attracted a lot of attention since winning an amateur riders&apos; race at the Cheltenham Festival, and there has been interest from several potential buyers. Still, he looks a tricky ride and the tactics used at Cheltenham, when Jamie Codd held on to him until just about the last possible moment, will be much harder to achieve at Aintree. These look to me like a couple of wrong trees that people are barking up. 1.30pm Another jockey signs up with Roberts Surprising news in this morning&apos;s Racing Post, that Sam Thomas has ditched his agent, Sam Stronge, who is also one of his best friends, and signed up with master-agent Dave Roberts. Thomas gets some good rides from Paul Nicholls but is clearly second fiddle to Ruby Walsh there, while young star Aidan Coleman is taking some of the juicier rides at Venetia Williams&apos; yard, which Thomas used to get. At the Cheltenham Festival, Thomas had only one ride from outside those two yards, so you can see why he wants to do something to broaden his appeal. Incredibly, Roberts now acts for 39 jockeys, if his listing in the Directory of the Turf is accurate. They include the top four jump jockeys this season, Tony McCoy, Richard Johnson, Robert Thornton and Paddy Brennan. That must make it very hard for everyone else. Trainers presumably ring Roberts, asking if one of those four is available, and are told: &quot;No, but you can have x.&quot; On the other hand, would you want to be the 39th-most-popular jockey in Roberts&apos; stable? 2.05pm Hi goofs Your horse in the Grand National is a bit closer to getting a run, as Snoopy Loopy was formally withdrawn this morning. Also, Nozic is an unlikely runner, now that he&apos;s been landed with topweight. One thing to bear in mind is that the order of elimination has not yet been set. If my counting is right, you fancy one of the horses currently set to carry 10st 2lb, but there are five horses on that weight just now. Although they are currently listed in alphabetical order, they won&apos;t be eliminated in that order - it will depend on what their latest Official Rating is when the final field is confirmed next Thursday. In many cases, those ratings have changed since the weights were published in early February. If the cutoff point falls among those five horses on 10st 2lb, the ones that get to run will be the ones with the higher ratings. You can see the latest ratings here but I believe another set of changes will be made over the weekend. 2.20pm He just had to go down and come back Peter Pole, who hacked up on his British debut at Exeter last week, has just done so again at Southwell. A good thing is really a good thing over Southwell&apos;s straightforward fences, on fast ground and with Tony McCoy on board. The money-buyers have been paid at 2-9 and more will be heard of Tim Vaughan&apos;s six-year-old. 2.30pm Grand National eliminations Goofs, I should have said before - if your horse fails to make the cut for the National, your stake will be refunded, so the current price does not have to factor in the possibility that he might get eliminated. Of course, that only works if the horse is still entered at the overnight stage. Infuriatingly, some trainers do withdraw their horse at the overnight stage, even though the beast is almost certain to be eliminated. If that happens, you&apos;ve lost your money. But if you&apos;re only denied a run because the horse doesn&apos;t make the safety limit for the race, you won&apos;t lose a penny - such a bet is void and any bookie will hand you your money back, as will Betfair. 4.15pm Three hit 13-2 winner Nicozetto galloped them into the ground at Sedgefield, which came as no surprise to TheVic, JDK1 or Paddyconsidine, all of whom had that winner. The latter two have made a flying start to the week. Hoofnote: JDK1 had a winner in Song of Praise yesterday and the standings have been altered. 5.25pm Five win with Fujin Wasn&apos;t that the title of something by Enid Blyton? Anyway, five of you found the last winner at Southwell, Fujin Dancer, forecast to be 8-1 this morning but backed down to 4-1 at the off. Richard Fahey&apos;s colt landed the gamble in good style, accelerating right away from the field after the last, appearing to relish the fast ground. In the 4.40, Simple Glory got home in a driving finish at 25-1, untipped by all, alas. Updated standings in tomorrow&apos;s edition of Talking Horses from about 11.30am, with three more races. Tomorrow&apos;s action comes from Taunton, Towcester, Lingfield (ugh) and Kempton."}, {"sentences": ["So this week, Turning Japanese talks to four music-mad youths who live nowhere near Tokyo to find out what role it plays in their life.", "It&apos;s expensive but it was three discs.&quot; With the inflated cost of touring in Japan, few new artists make it outside of Tokyo and Osaka to perform live, while big acts stick to stadiums that smaller places like Kochi can&apos;t accommodate.", "&quot;We have more or less the same access to music as people in Tokyo through our phones and television,&quot; says Kurumi, &quot;and we love it just as much as them, so it&apos;s not so bad."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "World music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-24T16:27:10Z", "title": "Turning Japanese: Teenage kicks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/24/turning-japanese-teenage-kicks", "article": "During the volatile period of adolescence music is like manna from heaven and distracts teenagers from the psychological minefield that is growing up. So this week, Turning Japanese talks to four music-mad youths who live nowhere near Tokyo to find out what role it plays in their life. Aya, Kurumi, Yuiko and Suguru are all 16 and live in Konan city in the Kochi prefecture. It&apos;s a rural haven that is a 12-hour bus ride from the capital down on the sunny south coast. They may be miles away from the cultural heart of the country, but music is still a vital part of their existence. &quot;We could not live without music,&quot; says Yuiko, &quot;we would be depressed without it.&quot; Their favourite bands at the moment are the unfortunately monikered, pretty-boy soft-rockers Flumpool and equally ill-named, but none the less chart-topping, Radwimps. The girls cite the band&apos;s fashion sense and good looks as the main reason for them being deemed cool, and I ask if this is more important than the music itself. My cynicism is met with disagreement. &quot;The total package is important,&quot; Aya admits, but most importantly, &quot;it is the voice that matters. That is the first thing we hear on the television, then after that we find out the name and fall in love with them.&quot; Television has not yet been usurped by the internet as the focal point for teenagers in Japan, and most young people are accustomed to discovering new music through variety shows and commercials than they are from blogs or music magazines, particularly in Japan&apos;s overlooked rural majority. As in other countries, musicians are given a boost when their songs are used in adverts or teen dramas. But when an artist&apos;s appeal is reduced to that of a lifestyle accessory surely it&apos;s rendered throwaway with each passing fad? &quot;I think if I&apos;m honest I would be influenced into liking a brand if I thought the music advertising was cool,&quot; says Suguru. &quot;Also, if I like the brand already, I think I&apos;d be a little more influenced to like the music.&quot; The girls reject this idea: &quot;We know commercials have a big influence on what people like and we do hear new songs that way. But just because we hear a song we like on a Coca-Cola advert, doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re going to start drinking it. We can keep it separate, that&apos;s very important.&quot; Amazingly, the threat of the Illegal Downloading Monster has been kept at bay in Japan. Whereas most British teenagers have sneakily downloaded music from a torrent site, when I ask the four Japanese students about it, they don&apos;t even realise that such a thing is possible. Despite having a vibrant internet culture in the cities, here in the &quot;real&quot; Japan many young people limit their computer time to console gaming. Social networking sites and YouTube are far less prevalent, while peer-to-peer and torrent culture hasn&apos;t reached them. Instead, the mobile phone rules. Boasting techno-gimmickry that makes the iPhone look like a battered slab of rock, in Japan you can use your phone for online gaming, watching TV and even as a credit card. Young people download music directly to their phone from official sources, cutting out the scope for illegality. &quot;It&apos;s easy to download to our phones,&quot; says Aya, &quot;most of us don&apos;t have regular access to a decent computer.&quot; The teenagers explain that CDs are coveted possessions. Physical formats are notoriously expensive, with a new release costing as much as 3000\u00a5 (\u00a321), but rather than the price tag turning people off, the product becomes more desirable. Yuiko explains, &quot;CDs are so expensive, but this makes buying one more special. We save up for the CDs of bands we really love to commemorate.&quot; This is perhaps one reason why discount sales in Japan are less popular than in the UK. Japanese people don&apos;t like to pay less for a product than it is deemed worth, as it suggests inferiority. &quot;This month I bought an Ikimono Gakari DVD,&quot; concludes Yuiko, &quot;it was 10,000\u00a5 (\u00a372). It&apos;s expensive but it was three discs.&quot; With the inflated cost of touring in Japan, few new artists make it outside of Tokyo and Osaka to perform live, while big acts stick to stadiums that smaller places like Kochi can&apos;t accommodate. The students identify the dearth of live venues as the main problem with living in a rural location. &quot;We dream of living in the city,&quot; says Kurumi. It&apos;s not an arrangement that&apos;s likely to change; with Japan&apos;s ageing population there is less of a demand for youth culture in rural areas. But it&apos;s not all bad news. Usually a couple of mid-range touring pop groups make it to places like Kochi during the summer holidays, and the students speak about these times fondly. When I ask them whether they feel they&apos;re missing out from life in the big cities, they think not. &quot;We have more or less the same access to music as people in Tokyo through our phones and television,&quot; says Kurumi, &quot;and we love it just as much as them, so it&apos;s not so bad. However, I would still like to move there.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Speaking to journalists in Tokyo, Ms Hawker&apos;s father, Bill, said: &quot;This is my fifth time in Japan since Lindsay was murdered.", "How many more pleas do we have to make until this evil man is caught?&quot; The body of Ms Hawker, 22, from Brandon, near Coventry, was found in March 2007 buried in a bathtub filled with sand on the balcony of a flat near Tokyo owned by Tatsuya Ichihashi&apos;s family.", "On previous visits to Japan, Ms Hawker&apos;s family have praised police efforts to trace Ichihashi, a horticultural student whose flat in Ichikawa, on the eastern edge of Tokyo, was owned by his wealthy parents, a neurosurgeon and a dentist.", "Rumours circulated that he had disguised himself as a woman or was living among prostitutes in Tokyo&apos;s red-light district, even that he had fled to the Philippines."], "tags": ["Lindsay Hawker", "Japan", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-24T16:33:06Z", "title": "Family of British teacher Lindsay Hawker criticise Japanese police's hunt for Tatsuya Ichihashi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/24/hawker-japan-murder-ichihashi", "article": "The family of Lindsay Hawker, the British teacher murdered in Japan two years ago, today broke their silence and criticised the police&apos;s handling of the hunt for her alleged killer.

How many more pleas do we have to make until this evil man is caught?&quot; The body of Ms Hawker, 22, from Brandon, near Coventry, was found in March 2007 buried in a bathtub filled with sand on the balcony of a flat near Tokyo owned by Tatsuya Ichihashi&apos;s family. She had been suffocated and severely beaten, and her naked body tied up with gardening cord. Ichihashi, 30, whom Hawker had taught English in a nearby cafe hours before her death, evaded nine police officers when they arrived at the flat to question him about her disappearance. Detectives are no closer to finding Ichihashi, who fled barefoot and dropped a rucksack containing clothes and cash after a brief struggle. On previous visits to Japan, Ms Hawker&apos;s family have praised police efforts to trace Ichihashi, a horticultural student whose flat in Ichikawa, on the eastern edge of Tokyo, was owned by his wealthy parents, a neurosurgeon and a dentist. Despite police claims that &quot;the net is closing&quot; on Ichihashi, Ms Hawker&apos;s mother, Julia, said she struggled to understand how the police had allowed him to escape. &quot;Why did nine policemen who went to the apartment wait so long before going in?&quot; she said. &quot;Why and how did they then let a barefoot man escape? And why, two years on, have they still not caught him?&quot; Later Mrs Hawker told the Guardian she had little faith in police claims that they were close to locating Ichihashi: &quot;Despite what they say, they don&apos;t appear to be any closer to finding him.&quot; The family and police believe Ichihashi is alive and in hiding somewhere in Japan. More than 100 officers have followed up 6,000 reported sightings of Ichihashi. Rumours circulated that he had disguised himself as a woman or was living among prostitutes in Tokyo&apos;s red-light district, even that he had fled to the Philippines. In a sign of their desperation, police have released five lifesize cardboard cutouts of Ichihashi featuring a recording of his voice retrieved from his computer. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe it when they told us they had made only five,&quot; Mr Hawker said, gripping the cutout. &quot;You may as well call him the invisible man, because he is invisible to the Japanese police.&quot; The parents, accompanied by their two daughters, Louise and Lisa, said Japan&apos;s national police agency, which has put up a 1m yen (\u00a37,000) reward for information leading to Ichihashi&apos;s arrest, had rejected their offer to raise the amount by more than \u00a365,000. Lisa Hawker, who visited the scene of her sister&apos;s murder for the first time yesterday , said the police&apos;s failure to find Ichihashi &quot;means there is no closure and leaves us angry and frustrated. &quot;I retraced Ichihashi&apos;s steps and couldn&apos;t understand how he escaped. How can he continue to live life as a free man two years after my little sister had her life taken away? It&apos;s not fair.&quot; Ms Hawker had been teaching English at a branch of the Nova English conversation school since October 2006, after graduating from Leeds University earlier the same year. Ichihashi had reportedly spotted her in a bar and later approached her at a railway station near her home, begging her to teach him English."}, {"sentences": ["But Washington, Seoul and Tokyo accuse it of planning a weapons test in breach of a United Nations security council ban."], "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "Nuclear weapons", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-26T06:36:40Z", "title": "North Korea 'days away' from launching missile", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/26/north-korea-missile-launch", "article": "North Korea is days away from the launch of a long-range missile, United States officials have said, heightening concerns about the risks to regional stability. Counter-proliferation and intelligence officials said the country had mounted a rocket on a launch pad and placed together two stages of what will probably be a three-stage device, Reuters reported today. It could be ready to fire as early as the weekend, sooner than expected. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, warned that firing a long-range rocket would be a &quot;provocative act&quot; that would have consequences, while South Korea said it would be &quot;a serious challenge and provocation&quot;, threatening regional stability. Pyongyang has said it plans to launch a communications satellite between 4 and 8 April. But Washington, Seoul and Tokyo accuse it of planning a weapons test in breach of a United Nations security council ban. The launch technology for either scenario is nearly identical. While relations between North and South Korea have deteriorated dramatically since President Lee Myung-bak came to power in Seoul last year and took a tougher stance towards his neighbour, Pyongyang has appeared to be seeking improved relations with the new US administration, drawing back from the denunciations it directed at the former president George Bush. South Korea&apos;s Chosun Ilbo newspaper said today that US spy satellites detected the rocket on the launch pad at the north-eastern Musudan-ri missile base two days ago. &quot;Technically a launch is possible within three to four days,&quot; an unnamed diplomatic source in Seoul told the publication. Seoul&apos;s defence ministry said it could not confirm the rocket&apos;s placement. But spokesman Won Tae-jae said: &quot;We are strongly urging the north to immediately halt [preparations].&quot; Experts believe it is a Taepodong-2 \u2013 the north&apos;s longest range missile. In theory it could carry a warhead as far as Alaska, although a previous test flight failed within seconds of the launch in 2006. A successful test this time would boost domestic morale and be seen as a humiliation for the south, which hopes to launch its own satellite later this year. Pyongyang&apos;s official Korean Central News Agency said Seoul was trying to stop the launch because &quot;it can only be a serious blow to the Lee group, which has been trying to suffocate its compatriots&quot;. North Korea has warned international agencies of the rocket&apos;s planned trajectory, which would take it over Japan, dropping booster stages to the east and west. Officials in northern Japanese coastal cities today began setting up emergency networks and running drills to prepare for falling debris in case the launch fails. The government is preparing an order to deploy a missile shield, including interceptors, to protect against debris. Admiral Timothy Keating, the head of US Pacific Command, has said the US military could, with &quot;high probability&quot;, intercept any missile heading for American territory if ordered to do so. But Pyongyang has said any attempt to shoot down its &quot;for peaceful purpose&quot; satellite would be an act of war and has warned it would quit the stalled six-party aid-for-nuclear-disarmament talks. Discord on the peninsula has been exacerbated by the annual joint military drill by South Korean and US troops, which has been larger than usual. The situation may be further complicated by the north&apos;s detention of two US journalists, who were arrested last week on the Chinese border. They are reportedly under interrogation in Pyongyang."}, {"sentences": ["Watching him squirming at the Wall Street Journal&apos;s business breakfast in New York, as he was grilled by former Times editor Robert Thomson, I was reminded of John Major&apos;s ordeal in Tokyo in 1993.", "In 1993 John Major&apos;s chief tormentor at a Tokyo press conference that became a piece of lobby folklore was the late Gordon Greig, political editor of the Daily Mail, a lobby legend and a much-missed genius."], "tags": ["Kenneth Clarke", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-26T14:01:00Z", "title": "Ken Clarke ought to know better", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/26/bill-blanko-ken-clarke", "article": "Of all people, Ken Clarke really ought to know better. Now up here in the press gallery, we are a pretty thick-skinned bunch. (I suppose our ruddy and leathery complexion can be attributed to a healthy diet of lashings of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon.) Withering barbs against &quot;loathsome&quot; lobby correspondents in the diaries of an old leftie like Chris Mullin (on which I reported last week) are to be expected, I suppose. But for an old political warhorse like Ken to blame his inheritance tax gaffe on &quot;media hysteria&quot; and dismiss it as a &quot;hoo-ha&quot; is very naughty. Mind you, some of us in the lobby regard being accused of &quot;media hysteria&quot; as a badge of honour. We didn&apos;t come into the lobby to do restrained reporting or stop short of hysteria when there&apos;s not much around on a Sunday afternoon and the editor of the day is screaming for a splash. Ken Clarke, though, is a man who has supped ale and claret with lobby correspondents in watering holes from the old Annie&apos;s Bar in the Commons to the Imperial Hotel in Blackpool for nearly 40 years. In the days when you could smoke in bars and restaurants, I have been present many times when he has happily accepted the offer of at least one Montecristo cigar after dinner at party conferences and puffed away as he leaned back in his chair, cigar in one hand, glass in the other and shirt buttons straining to keep his belly button concealed. Perhaps it was under the orders of Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who now leads the Tory spin operation, that Ken toured the TV and radio studios on Wednesday afternoon \u2013 more than 72 hours after his Sunday lunchtime gaffe \u2013 and blamed the &quot;hoo-ha&quot; on political journalists. &quot;I used the word &apos;aspiration&apos; instead of &apos;promise&apos;, and to the chattering classes there is a difference there,&quot; he told the fragrant Emily Maitlis on the BBC. &quot;I think real people are not quite sure what the difference is.&quot; Real people? A bit patronising if you don&apos;t mind me saying so, Ken. And call me old-fashioned (&quot;You&apos;re old-fashioned, Blanko!&quot;) but the last time I looked in a dictionary, (five minutes ago, since you ask) &quot;aspiration&quot; meant &quot;desire, aim or ambition&quot;. &quot;Promise&quot;, on the other hand, means &quot;vow or commitment&quot;. Still not sure what the difference is, Ken? Now while Ken is a wine and cigars man at party conference dinners, and our dour, grumpy prime minister is an orange juice and early-to-bed man, at least Gordon Brown didn&apos;t blame the Mervyn King &quot;hoo-ha&quot; on &quot;media hysteria&quot;. I must say I&apos;m a little surprised that he hasn&apos;t, however. But there&apos;s still time, of course. Morose Mervyn&apos;s demolition of Gordy&apos;s &quot;fiscal stimulus&quot; promise \u2013 or was it an aspiration? \u2013 has turned the PM&apos;s transcontinental pre-G20 junket into a public relations disaster. Watching him squirming at the Wall Street Journal&apos;s business breakfast in New York, as he was grilled by former Times editor Robert Thomson, I was reminded of John Major&apos;s ordeal in Tokyo in 1993. Then, as now, the British prime minister was humiliated abroad by questions about disasters back home. This time, it&apos;s the economy. In 1993, it was Major&apos;s destructive battle with the Maastricht mutineers on the Tory backbenches. The only difference between 1993 and 2009 is that back then it was lobby correspondents travelling with the prime minister who were humiliating him at a press conference. This time it was the extremely polite and rather bookish Wall Street Journal boss and ex-Times editor. In 1993 John Major&apos;s chief tormentor at a Tokyo press conference that became a piece of lobby folklore was the late Gordon Greig, political editor of the Daily Mail, a lobby legend and a much-missed genius. At the end of this week, one of Greig&apos;s successors, the tall, giraffe-like and immaculately groomed Ben Brogan, will have filed his last story as the Mail&apos;s political editor before moving on to a more lofty role at the Daily Telegraph. And who can blame him? Brogan&apos;s successor is to be James Chapman, author of the Mail&apos;s splash about Ken Clarke on Monday \u2013 &quot;Inheritance tax: Tory climbdown. Flagship policy no longer a priority says Ken Clarke&quot; \u2013 which the newly recalled shadow business secretary would no doubt claim was an example of &quot;media hysteria&quot;. Young Chappers, Kensington&apos;s baby-faced assassin of errant and careless politicians, has the promise \u2013 and no doubt the aspiration as well \u2013 to mature (or possibly immature) into the same sort of jaunty, twinkle-eyed mischief-maker as the great Gordon Greig. &quot;G&quot;, as he was known to Daily Mail colleagues, was a great Annie&apos;s Bar drinking companion of Ken Clarke. If he were still around today, &quot;G&quot; would probably have told Ken to stop being so daft and to shut up about &quot;media hysteria&quot;.

You pass these survivors of multiple political experiments, look into their watery eyes, and wonder what you would find inside their heads if you could zoom in. Rana Dasgupta&apos;s first novel Solo provides the most epic, and yet most truthful answer: the 20th century, with all its agonies and its ecstasies.  Ecstasies are admittedly thin on the ground if you happen to be an ordinary Bulgarian like Solo&apos;s protagonist Ulrich. But the agonies are so fascinating that 350 pages later, I felt as vertignious as if I&apos;d been galloping through the wilderness of European history.  Dasgupta, a young British-born Indian based in Delhi, who made his debut with a quirky short-story collection called Tokyo Cancelled, has set his panoramic novel mainly in Bulgaria. The first thing we learn is that Ulrich is nearly 100 years old. He lives in a crummy flat in modern Sofia, a chaotic city filled with television nonsense and noisy cats copulating at night. Ulrich is blind and his life has crumbled away. Neighbours look after his body while his mind wanders across the scenes of his life - and other people&apos;s, not all of whom are real. Part one, Life, is a recollection of Ulrich&apos;s life. Ulrich&apos;s personality is unremarkable, he is an everyman. The first chapters seem emotionally remote, with stilted dialogue, but the story gathers momentum and begins to flower in unexpected ways. We find Ulrich growing up in prosperous but politically unstable turn-of-the-century Sofia. His mother lives in &quot;philharmonic sadness&quot; and his musical leanings are set straight by an authoritarian father who is himself destroyed &quot;by chagrin&quot; in the first world war and the Balkan wars in its wake.  Ulrich&apos;s chemistry studies in 1920s Berlin are interrupted by sudden poverty and he returns home, where his best friend is executed in anti-communist reprisals. His marriage fails and his son is removed from him. Ulrich&apos;s mother, despite being anti-Nazi, is sent to a labour camp by the new communist regime. Dasgupta has a neat way of sketching enormous traumas: &quot;The former villains were cast in bronze and put up in the parks, and all the stories changed.&quot; The thugs who come for his mother &quot;used the time they were waiting to smash the bookshelves&quot;. When his mother returns from the camps, broken, &quot;it came to each of them to wake up, screaming in the night, and these submerged agonies were a form of silent compact&quot;. When Moscow decides that Bulgaria will be &quot;the chemical engine of the socialist countries&quot;, Ulrich is enlisted in the great five-year plan and has no choice but to become a star worker, spending &quot;obscure hours&quot; inside the new engine of this brave new world, until &quot;the rivers ran with mercury and lead, and hummed with radioactivity&quot;. When he retires, he is given a gold watch and sent packing. He sets up a chemical laboratory in his flat, but the police dismantle it. Though &quot;the undead leaders clung to office and alcohol&quot;, the regime collapses, and Ulrich drifts in the lawless &quot;aftertimes&quot; of thuggish opportunism. Then he accidentally blinds himself with acid. &quot;But it is not a despairing conclusion,&quot; Dasgupta concludes with startling optimism, because Ulrich still has his daydreams, and this then takes us to part two where things turn very strange indeed.  In part one, the chapter headings are chemical elements because of Ulrich&apos;s thwarted love of chemistry. Here, they are obscure marine fauna because...well, words like beluga and narwhal sound strange. We are now in Bulgaria and, for some reason, Georgia, and follow the fates of three young people who are not Ulrich&apos;s lost children but might have been. They are three compelling, recognisable products of the post-communist freefall. Boris is born in a dead-end village and raised by a grandmother and gypsy musicians. Feisty Khatuna is determined to rise above the general misery the only way she can - by becoming a gangster businessman&apos;s mistress. Meanwhile, her brother, the poet Irakli, can&apos;t stop himself from falling through the cracks of these &quot;aftertimes&quot; - like so many bright young East Europeans in the 1990s lost to suicide and despair - not because he fails, but because he is tainted by a failed society. His nonsensical poetry is sprinkled through the story for no apparent reason other than to add yet more strangeness.  The three connect in New York, where Boris becomes a musical sensation, and where we are unsurprised to find the old Ulrich walking into their lives. When he meets his first love, a Jewish girl from Berlin long dead in the Holocaust, she points out that this is only a dream. &quot;It&apos;s not only a dream,&quot; Ulrich replies. &quot;There is far more to us than what we live.&quot; Because if we have no dreams of our own, we may well become someone else&apos;s nightmare. We may well not have existed.  Solo is mannered in its strangeness, but utterly unforgettable in its humanity. It hums the inner and outer melodies of a life lived solo, until it becomes a discordant symphony of the human condition. This lifts it from a freak show to the kind of &quot;philharmonic&quot; novel that reminds us why we will always need to tell the extraordinary stories of people&apos;s ordinary lives. So that, like Ulrich, we can sift through those hundred years when &quot;the world itself has become nonsense&quot;, and see more deeply into the &quot;great black ocean of forgotten things&quot;.  \u2022 Kapka Kassabova&apos;s A Street Without a Name is published by Portobello"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I think the fact that they were ninth in the constructors&apos; championship again, and spending \u00a3300m a year, probably meant that it wasn&apos;t good value.&quot; If performance was indeed the deciding factor, a few executives in Tokyo may already be regretting last November&apos;s announcement of their withdrawal."], "tags": ["Formula One", "Brawn", "McLaren", "Red Bull", "Renault", "Sauber", "Toyota", "Williams", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-28T00:05:24Z", "title": "Formula one: Brawn GP are set to muscle in on the sport's top performers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/28/richard-williams-on-brawn-gp-at-australian-grand-prix", "article": "The wrong end of the formula one paddock can be a lonely place. Occupied by the garages and hospitality units of the least successful teams in grand prix racing, it lacks the buzz that surrounds the compounds allocated to competitors at the front of the grid, where the atmosphere of a non-stop garden party attracts the paparazzi. Two hundred yards away, by contrast, the also-rans and no-hopers are accustomed to going about their business largely unobserved. Down at the strugglers&apos; end, anyone who tried to indulge in celebrity gossip would find their conversation drowned by the roar of a giant generator poorly concealed behind a decorated awning. This weekend, however, the wrong end of the paddock is suddenly the place to be. At the end of yesterday&apos;s practice sessions, a gaggle of reporters and onlookers gathered in the autumnal twilight outside the very last garage in the pit lane, waiting to speak to the two drivers, Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button, whose performances in the newest car on the grid threatens to upset the established order in tomorrow&apos;s Australian grand prix. Emblazoned over the garage door, the name Brawn GP indicates the presence of a team rescued at the last minute from the ashes of the Honda grand prix project, a sacrificial victim of the global motor industry&apos;s sudden collapse, although one influential figure does not buy that interpretation. &quot;I think the reason Honda left had nothing to do with the financial crisis,&quot; Bernie Ecclestone said a few days ago. &quot;I think the fact that they were ninth in the constructors&apos; championship again, and spending \u00a3300m a year, probably meant that it wasn&apos;t good value.&quot; If performance was indeed the deciding factor, a few executives in Tokyo may already be regretting last November&apos;s announcement of their withdrawal. Exactly a year earlier they had hired Ross Brawn, the mastermind behind Michael Schumacher&apos;s seven world championships, to pull a floundering team together. And this weekend the 15 months of work that Brawn dedicated to preparing for the 2009 season look like starting to pay off. Yesterday the two cars that now bear his name followed up their eyebrow-raising performances in the final pre-season tests in Spain with impressive displays in free practice for tomorrow&apos;s Australian grand prix. Barrichello and Button finished the day with the second and fifth fastest times in their Mercedes-engined cars, ahead of the Ferraris, the Renaults, the BMWs and the McLarens, and with a suggestion of more to come. &quot;We have a competitive car that&apos;s ready to do very well,&quot; Barrichello said. &quot;I&apos;ve been waiting a long time for a car that can give me such a good feeling. Finally, when I accelerate, I have the feeling of knowing what to expect.&quot; The sense of delight irradiating the Brawn pit is a reminder that three months ago the team was facing the prospect of 700 highly skilled employees being thrown out of their jobs, followed by the sell-off of one of the most advanced research and manufacturing plants in formula one. Instead five top executives, led by Brawn himself, banded together to engineer the team&apos;s survival. They achieved it via a last-minute management buy-out made possible, ironically enough, by Honda, who are providing a \u00a340m subsidy \u2013 which represents a considerable saving over the cost of what would otherwise have been a giant redundancy payout. The drivers are among those accepting pay cuts, in Button&apos;s case measured in millions of pounds, to help keep the team alive. Brawn, who probably never expected to see his name on the nose of a grand prix car, is said to own 51% of the shares in the new enterprise, with the remainder divided between his four colleagues. He is the public face of the team, his reputation acting as a guarantee that this outfit is not in business simply to make up the numbers. He solved the major problem caused by the withdrawal of Honda&apos;s engines by contacting Mercedes and his former colleagues at Ferrari. When it turned out that the German company&apos;s engine would be an easier fit with the newly designed chassis, he signed a deal providing the team with the supply of power plants at a cost of about \u00a38m. Those who have followed Brawn&apos;s career were surprised neither by the pace of the new car \u2013 which turned a wheel for the first time three weeks ago and had only seven days of testing behind it before arriving in Australia \u2013 nor by the reaction of his competitors, who accused him of bending the rules in the design of the car&apos;s diffuser, the element at the rear of the underside which controls the flow of air beneath the car. Two other teams, Williams and Toyota, were said to have willfully misinterpreted the sport&apos;s new set of regulations in a similar way, but on Thursday night the race stewards dismissed objections lodged by Ferrari, Renault and Red Bull, although an appeal against that verdict has already been lodged and will be heard in mid-April. Brawn has often been told that he sails too close to the wind in his ingenious interpretations of the sport&apos;s technical regulations. When his Jaguar XJR-14 won the sports car world championship in 1991, competitors muttered about its design. Three years later, as Benetton&apos;s technical director, he withstood accusation of cheating as he celebrated the first of Schumacher&apos;s world championships. And after they were reunited at Ferrari in 1997, races and championships were won despite claims that certain components and design elements infringed the rules. &quot;He&apos;s a tough opponent, and he&apos;s very capable,&quot; Patrick Head, the veteran director of engineering at Williams, said here yesterday. Williams was the first formula one outfit Brawn joined, back in 1976, as a 22-year-old machinist, operating the little team&apos;s only lathe before graduating to the aerodynamics department, where he helped to assemble their first wind tunnel. Twenty years later, at Benetton, Brawn would quickly become the Williams team&apos;s chief nemesis. &quot;I can&apos;t claim that I thought that one day this guy would have his name over a grand prix team,&quot; Head said, &quot;but he was always an astute character and a great competitor. I&apos;ve always found him honest and straightforward and not a bullshitter, but he&apos;s not averse to using every possible technique to get his way. Now if the Brawn goes out here and makes everybody else look stupid, Ferrari will huff and puff and say the car&apos;s illegal. Nobody likes to be made a fool of.&quot; And no one stands to gain more from the team&apos;s success than the 29-year-old Button, who earned admiration for his loyalty to the team during a couple of troubled seasons and now seems poised to fulfil his early promise. Although clearly delighted by the turn of events, last night he was resisting premature euphoria. &quot;I don&apos;t feel that we&apos;ve got the best out of the car yet,&quot; the British driver said. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of work to do.&quot; Six decades of formula one history separate Ferrari, at the top end of the pit lane, from the team in the most distant garage. For Brawn GP, transformed in the space of a couple of hectic months from candidates for oblivion into genuine contenders, history begins this weekend."}, {"sentences": ["When Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in Tokyo in February of 1990, King, who&apos;d just moved in on Mike, lodged a protest with the WBC, WBA and IBF, claiming Douglas had not beaten the count when knocked down in the eighth round."], "tags": ["Boxing", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympics 2012: boxing", "Team GB", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-28T14:30:29Z", "title": "Kevin Mitchell: British amateur fighters show real promise at the ABA championships", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/mar/28/kevin-mitchell-amateur-boxing-british", "article": "Paul Gallico, a fine writer and a human being of towering vanity, asked Jack Dempsey in 1922 if he could spar with him. Jack obliged and punctured (although not, sadly, with any finality) the pomposity of Paul by knocking him out. &quot;Everything went sort of black,&quot; Gallico wrote later. &quot;I held on to the floor with both hands, because the ring and the audience outside were making a complete clockwise revolution, came to a stop, and went back again counterclockwise.&quot; George Plimpton, another would-be fighter housed inside a writer, picked up on the theme 37 years later and went a few rounds with Archie Moore, who was the world light-heavyweight champion at the time and had knocked out 123 of his 171 victims. George, intellectually self-conscious to an embarrassing degree, prepared for the encounter by giving up smoking and jogging around Central Park in his Paris Review tee-shirt. The Ol&apos; Mongoose caned him with mercy and wished him well in writing his account of the experience for Sports Illustrated. George, a stick-like guy with no appreciable boxing skills, walked away crying and bleeding. Friend and colleague Ian Stafford, a journalist unafraid to push the envelope, sparred with Roy Jones Jnr for a chapter in one of his books a few years ago. He took it more seriously than either Galico or Plimpton, though, training for several weeks at the Peacock Gym in London&apos;s East End before taking on a fighter who was then pound-for-pound the best in the world. The boys at the Peacock called ginger-haired Ian the Red Pecker because of his rather dainty jabbing style - which, unfortunately, he was not able to utilise on the horrible day. Roy, a wicked hitter when he chose to be, took it easy on Staff, who none the less was dizzy for days afterwards. Mostly, civilians choose to try their luck in the ring with professional boxers for reasons closely attached to their overblown egos or the commercial imperatives of promoting a book. They at least come away with an inkling of what it&apos;s like to hit and be hit. But Mark Harnell, a fight fan and web designer, is getting into the ring with the former world cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson at the York Hall in Bethnal Green on 3 April for a much worthier reason. Mark is 35 and has been sparring every day since Christmas to get ready for the event, to raise money for Cancer Research. He had testicular cancer himself four years ago. &quot;It&apos;s pretty intimidating going up against a former world champion,&quot; Harnell says. &quot;And, although he&apos;s been retired for a couple of years, Johnny has been phoning me up every week to tell me how hard he is punching in the gym! But nothing can knock you for six like being told you&apos;ve got cancer, and after battling against it, taking on Nelson should be a walk in the park.&quot; Nice sentiments Mark - just keep your hands up. There was proper boxing at the famous old venue on Thursday night, the London semi-finals of the ABA championships and one young boxer stood out in a strong field. Dudley O&apos;Shaughnessy is a 19-year-old banger from West Ham Amateur Boxing Club and scored his third first-round stoppage in a row. Asked later which hand he put his opponent down with, he said with the sort of humility some writers could learn form, &quot;Not sure. One of these.&quot; Most agreed it was a short right hand and, if he keeps throwing it like this, he will fulfil his ambition of boxing for Great Britain at the London Olympics. &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m aiming for,&quot; he said. &quot;I will be 22 then and hopefully near my best.&apos; On the grounds of modesty alone, he deserves to make it. One man who will be tracking his progress with interest - for the next six months at least - is Kelvyn Travis, who took over from Terry Edwards as the national coach this week. Travis, a former international himself, was in Audley Harrison&apos;s corner at the Sydney Olympics and worked with him again briefly for his fight with the Belfast cab driver Martin Rogan. He is an experienced and knowledgeable trainer with much to offer. I understand, though, that his appointment is temporary, which is ludicrous in a job that demands long-term planning. This is exactly why ambitious young boxers like O&apos;Shaughnessy are driven into the arms of the professional promoters. They should be thankful such a fine talent is committed to the amateur cause. Don King&apos;s latest wheeze - protesting Amir Khan&apos;s cuts stoppage win over Marco Antonio Barrera on the grounds the fight should have been stopped earlier - has a familiar ring. When Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in Tokyo in February of 1990, King, who&apos;d just moved in on Mike, lodged a protest with the WBC, WBA and IBF, claiming Douglas had not beaten the count when knocked down in the eighth round. Indeed, it was a marginal call - and the WBC, run by Don&apos;s mate Jose Sulaiman, were minded to agree with him; the other two organising bodies were not, however, and the WBC backed down. One reason they did was the British Boxing Board of Control threatened to withdraw their affiliation if they took the title away from Douglas. So the result stood. But King may have had money rather than justice on his mind; he was well versed in the old boxing dictum that the real cash to be made in the fight game comes in a rematch after a controversial first fight. He duly pushed for a return encounter and all was set for Tyson and Douglas to go again, in Atlantic City on 18 June that year, until negotiations broke down. Buster went on to defend against Evander Holyfield in October and was knocked out in the third round. Barrera, who lost his WBO No 1 rating when he lost to Khan in Manchester two weeks ago, seems keen to carry on. But a rematch? It wouldn&apos;t draw flies. One fight most fans either side of the Irish Sea would flock to see would be the one Frank Maloney is pushing for between his fine young prospect Rendall Munroe and Ireland&apos;s new WBA super-bantamweight champion Bernard Dunne. The chinny Dunn got up from two knockdowns in the fifth to stop the tough Ricardo Cordoba in the 11th round of their stirring world title fight in Dublin last weekend. Munroe was at ringside and immediately demanded a shot at Dunne. Maloney has offered the champion \u00a3150,000 to defend his title, in London or Dublin. The Leicester bin-man&apos;s reasoning is sound: Dunne was shockingly stopped inside a round by Kiko Martinez in 2007; Munroe has beaten Martinez twice in the past year, most recently last month. But then what of Andy Morris, the only man to beat Munroe, back in 2006? Well, you could carry on like this forever - because Morris subsequently lost twice to John Simpson - whose last loss of five in his career was to the excellent young Paul Appleby. We will get a better line on Appleby&apos;s development when he defends his British featherweight title against the unbeaten Martin Lindsay in Belfast on 25 April."}, {"sentences": ["After five days in Tokyo and Kyoto, riders embark on a self-guided trip across Shikoku Island, where highlights include a challenging ascent of Mount Tsurugi."], "tags": ["Travel", "Hotels", "Japan holidays", "Cycling holidays", "Scotland holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Liverpool holidays", "France holidays", "Family holidays"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z", "title": "Travel news in brief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/mar/29/travel-news-in-brief", "article": "Varsity digs You don&apos;t need to pass the entrance exams to experience life as a student in Oxford or Cambridge.

Quite a big computer screen. I have to say I felt a bit awkward watching The Sex Education Show v Pornography (Channel 4). Imagine if the editor had come round, maybe showing off his new building to someone. &quot;This is the culture hub, where all the highbrow arty stuff happens. That&apos;s the architecture critic over there, polishing his intro on an interview with Zaha Hadid. And there&apos;s the TV critic writing something clever about Mad Men ... except ... anyway, moving along. Make that the ex-TV critic.&quot; Even without the editor about, it was hard to be totally cool about it. The fannies were, quite literally, in your face (willies tonight, I think). Not in a pornographic way, more anatomical. And that&apos;s the point of the show. Britain&apos;s kids are bingeing on porn, and it&apos;s giving them the wrong idea about sex. They think sex means people with perfect breasts and no hair apart from on their heads, going at each like pneumatic drills (doesn&apos;t it?).  Anyway, Anna Richardson wants to put the record straight - tell them about real sex and real bodies. And fair dues to her. I&apos;m just finding it hard to watch it in public. And I would be finding it very difficult if I was a teenager, watching it with my parents on the sofa at home.  But I think today&apos;s teenagers are much less worried about things like that, as well as knowing a lot more about it. Hands up who knows where the clitoris is, Anna asks the children of Sheringham high school. Nick, who looks about 12, knows. &quot;It&apos;s slightly above the labia minora,&quot; he says knowledgeably. They&apos;re beautifully honest too. Lads, hands up who prefers it waxed or shaved (we&apos;re still on fannies)? All the hands go up. &quot;I think it&apos;s better waxed, it makes me feel much more horny,&quot; says one cheeky chap.  When it comes to boobs, none of them - girls or boys - likes any of the real ones on display. They&apos;re too veiny, too droopy, not symmetrical enough. They all prefer the lovely fake ones. It&apos;s a good thing you&apos;re trying to do there, Anna, but it&apos;s not going to be easy.  And though the porn is obviously horrible, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s entirely to blame. People have been fantasising and making bodies perfect for ages. I don&apos;t see any veins, droops or flaps on Botticelli&apos;s Venus or Michelangelo&apos;s David. Hey look, I can do highbrow too, give me my job back.  There&apos;s no unrealistic sex in Japan: A Story of Love and Hate (BBC4). No sex at all in fact, even though Naoki and his girlfriend Yoshei live together in the town of Yamagata, north of Tokyo. The one messy, windowless room they share isn&apos;t exactly conducive to it, and Yoshie&apos;s too tired from her three jobs. They haven&apos;t even spoken for weeks, let alone had sex. Anyway Naoki, who&apos;s 57, can&apos;t any more. &quot;Doesn&apos;t work,&quot; he says, pointing down there. &quot;Broken.&quot; There&apos;s no money for Viagra.  This is a side of Japan you rarely see. Dead poor, for a start, and miserable. A place of stupid rules and intimidation at work (the kind of intimidation that makes your spirit rot, says Naoki), of battling just to stay afloat, of depression and high suicide numbers. Even Sean McAllister, the English filmmaker, is depressed, after struggling for two years in a country he doesn&apos;t understand and which won&apos;t accept him.  Except for the lovely Naoki, a rare maverick, the nail in the Japanese proverb that stands out and should be banged in, but that has somehow escaped the hammer. Once an entrepreneur with a BMW, now a postal worker with nothing, he&apos;s a brilliant character - honest and philosophical, with a lovely, resigned laugh. And this is a brilliant, original film. Man, is it depressing, though.  There is some light, some hope that Naoki and Yoshie won&apos;t be ground down and end up killing themselves, or each other. Naoki agrees to visit Yoshie&apos;s parents for the very first time. Her father, who&apos;s the same age as Naoki, disapproves of him, but he is welcoming, to Sean and his camera as well. The house has windows, there&apos;s beer, talk and laughter. There may even be love later: Sean has brought a packet of Viagra. It&apos;s for Yoshie&apos;s dad, who also suffers from Naoki&apos;s down-there problem, but maybe he&apos;ll share. And then they all go out to a bar, to sing.

Japan&apos;s upper house of parliament unanimously passed a resolution today urging North Korea to scrap its plan, saying it would &quot;damage peace and stability, not only in Japan but also in north-east Asia&quot;. South Korea also planned to dispatch its Aegis-equipped destroyer, according to a Seoul military official who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing department policy. The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said America had no intention of shooting down the missile itself, which satellite photographs show is sitting on a launch-pad in Musudan-ri. Pyongyang says the launch is intended to put a satellite into orbit, but any such ballistic missile testing or development is banned by a 2006 United Nations resolution. Two US warships armed with Aegis anti-ballistic missiles left ports in South Korea yesterday to monitor the launch, which experts say could take place as soon as Saturday.  Japan has positioned its own missile boats in the Sea of Japan and positioned Patriot missile batteries around Tokyo. More US-made Patriot missiles arrived in northern Japan yesterday to be transferred to bases there. Japan previously hinted it might try to shoot down the North Korean missile, but has since said its missile shield is only there if the ICBM disintegrates and debris falls over Japan. If the launch is successful, the Taepodong-2 missile will drop its booster stages to the east and west of Japan as it rises through the atmosphere. Gates told Fox News at the weekend the US did not plan to shoot down the missile. &quot;If we had an aberrant missile, one that looked like it was headed for Hawaii, we might consider it, but I don&apos;t think we have any plans to do anything like that at this point.&quot; As contingency measures were being put in place, the US and Japan spearheaded a diplomatic effort to stop the test. The issue is already casting a shadow over the runup to Thursday&apos;s London summit on the global economy.  Japan&apos;s prime minister, Taro Aso, agreed with Gordon Brown on Sunday that if the launch goes ahead, the UN security council should consider taking action against North Korea. Barack Obama will discuss the issue with his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, on Wednesday. China is seen as having more sway over the regime than any other nation, but Pyongyang has a history of defying Beijing. A Washington thinktank, the Institute for Science and International Security, published commercial satellite photographs which appeared to show that a cover shrouding the missile for the past few days has been removed, leaving it glinting alongside its gantry at the launch site. Launch preparations come with the health of North Korea&apos;s dictator, Kim Jong-il, a source of speculation. There have been reports he has suffered one or two strokes, raising the question of who in Pyongyang is making decisions.  A launch could unravel on-off negotiations over the country&apos;s nuclear programme, under which Pyongyang agreed to dismantle reactors at Yongbyon in return for fuel and other economic aid.  The North Korean foreign ministry said at the weekend that &quot;even a single word critical of the launch&quot; from the security council would be interpreted as &quot;a hostile act&quot;.  &quot;If this is Kim Jong-il&apos;s welcoming present to a new president, launching a missile like this and threatening to have a nuclear test, I think it says a lot about the imperviousness to any kind of diplomatic overtures,&quot; Gates said. But he added that there was no evidence that North Korea had mastered the science to use its plutonium stock to make warheads small enough to fit atop a missile, or reach the US coast with an ICBM."}, {"sentences": ["Increasingly, these institutes that support emerging talent in the banlieues are seeing networking possibilities inside Paris proper, with heavyweight Palais de Tokyo being linked to all of the aforementioned groups, along with the canal-side Point Eph\u00e9m\u00e8re and the Main d&apos;Oeuvres in Saint Ouen."], "tags": ["Paris holidays", "Cultural trips", "France holidays", "Art and design", "Travel", "Art"], "publicationDate": "2009-03-31T10:18:28Z", "title": "Been there guest blogspot: Art in the banlieues of Paris", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2009/mar/26/paris-underground-art-banlieues-blog", "article": "For intrepid art connoisseurs and those who just want to know a little more, our blog IVY Paris covers the underground art scene in the French capital. But here&apos;s the rub: in 2009 there is no real underground art scene in Paris. As much as we Brits and Yanks would love to find some version of our own Hackney or Williamsburg, here there is little need for an underground. With its (champagne) socialist town hall, the city has always provided plenty of funding, space and publicity for the arts, so who needs to be a starving artist?  If you&apos;ve traipsed through the contemporary galleries and experienced the numerous publicly endorsed events you will likely be left feeling a little underwhelmed. There isn&apos;t the competition (and with it perhaps the excitement) of London or New York. Even the famous art squats like Les-Frigos in the 13th arrondissement are now funded by the city. So much for sticking it to the man ...  IVY Paris suggests looking beyond the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (the ring-road that encircles the city) into the great expanses known as &quot;la banlieue&quot;. There&apos;s a thriving arts scene across the highway; on the edge by its very location. There are institutions like MAC/VAL, which consistently produces some of the best in French contemporary art, dance and video. Located in Vitry-sur-Seine just south of Paris, MAC/VAL was the first contemporary art museum of the banlieue. It&apos;s just a short metro and bus ride from the city, but the emphasis is almost exclusively local. Surrounded by enormous gardens, its white walls and infinitely high ceilings make for an introspective and intimate space for introducing the latest emerging contemporary artists, as well as established names such as Gilles Barbier, Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto and Christian Boltanski. Unlike the fly-by-night small underground gallery enterprises in London or New York, MAC/VAL is an established public entity in a modernised building, with constant upgrades and renovations. The museum enjoys yearly funding from the municipality of Val-de-Marne and has no problems supporting emerging French work.  In the infamous northern (&apos;car burning&quot;) suburbs of St Denis and Aubervilliers, there are fantastic programmes and institutions. Les Laboratoires d&apos;Aubervilliers is the type of place many artists would dream of; heavy on concept and opportunity, light on pomp and circumstance. Les Laboratoires asks artists to play with various mediums including performance, visual arts, sound and video - this past year, works from Les Laboratoires have been shown in one of central Paris&apos;s most prestigious venues for contemporary art, the Jeu de Paume. Increasingly, these institutes that support emerging talent in the banlieues are seeing networking possibilities inside Paris proper, with heavyweight Palais de Tokyo being linked to all of the aforementioned groups, along with the canal-side Point Eph\u00e9m\u00e8re and the Main d&apos;Oeuvres in Saint Ouen. All three spaces are targets for young fine art graduates looking to share a creative space within the city.  Further mainstream help comes from the robust and open-armed national association Maison des Artistes which provides artists with all types of benefits including subsidised studio space, tax breaks and free entry into many art institutions - and you would probably question any artist who decided to &quot;work&quot; underground here.  Just last year the city opened the much anticipated CentQuatre in the 19th, on the edges of the city ... and it has swiftly become a bridge between the centre and the banlieues. A massive building complex that spans nearly 35,000 square metres, it was created with the goal of developing a dialogue between the art world and the public - to erase the divide between the two - especially in the run-down area on the edge of town where it is located. The institution has launched a strong residency programme, promising a hearty stipend (\u20ac1,500 per month) for artists, who are encouraged to share their works-in-progress with the public. Bars and restaurants around the CentQuatre have seen a wave of new customers - most of them looking like they&apos;ve wondered out of a Kooples catalogue, with their keffiyehs, distraught hair, dark rimmed glasses - who now mosey about the grounds as a daily hangout and meeting point. Paris&apos;s attempt to build up the outer rings of the city is proof that the outlying suburbs are stirring people&apos;s attention, with CentQuatre being the focal point. Last year the building played host to Fiac&apos;s little sister Slick, an emerging art fair, which brought many well-heeled collectors to the 19th, probably for the first time in their lives.  The only tragedy in this whole rebirth is the inexcusable reluctance of the Parisian populace to wave the white flag and accept that, yes, Paris now actually extends far beyond the boundaries of the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, and has done so now for quite some time. Thankfully, there&apos;s a programme called Tram that hopes to facilitate those seeking a way to actually get out and see this stuff. Tram (or Le r\u00e9seau art contemporain Paris/Ile-de-France), based in the 10th, offers transport and entry to and from the events and performances at 30 institutions throughout Ile-de-France. And on one Saturday each month, Tram also offers a more in-depth tour of an institution&apos;s new offerings. Prices for this service are \u20ac5 per person, or about 90% cheaper than a taxi ride.

In another way, too, the summit echoes one of the big gaps in managing the world economy \u2013 the co-option of China into decision making. While he found time to go to Latin America as well as shuttling round Europe, Gordon Brown did not manage to make it to Beijing (or Tokyo or New Delhi, for that matter). Given that China is now the world&apos;s third-largest economy and has the biggest foreign exchange reserves, it might seem perverse for Brown to have left contact with China to diplomatic channels.  With the OECD warning that world trade is in freefall, the role of China is of obvious significance. Last November, it became the first nation to apply a major fiscal package in response to the crisis, a measure that has been followed by assurances from Prime Minister Wen Jiabao that more will be spent if necessary. As well as the November package, which will be devoted largely to infrastructure, Beijing has opened the monetary tap with hugely increased bank lending and announced measures to help 10 key industrial sectors.  As a result, the stance taken by the Chinese Communist party leader and president, Hu Jintao, in London, will be a key factor in determining whether the summit marks a real effort to confront the crisis. In particular, the meeting will show if the now fashionable formulation of &quot;G2&quot; \u2013 the US and China \u2013 holds water, given the synergy between the two nations. Despite its economic rise over the last three decades, the mainland has not been a major player in global forums, largely by its own choosing as it pursued Deng Xiaoping&apos;s advice to keep its head down while it concentrated on growing richer as a result of the economic sea change he introduced 30 years ago. But this is now changing for three reasons that need to be taken into account at the London meeting. First, while it is being hit hard by the slump in external demand and its own weak domestic consumption, China had not suffered the financial meltdown rocking the west. That is largely due to the fact that its banks were already state-owned, that they had not gone in for dodgy financial instruments, and that they have now opened the lending sluices to pour liquidity into the economy. They still have many faults, and may face a new wave of bad loans in a few years, but for the moment their balances have been strengthened and their loan ratios are low \u2013 and they do what the government tells them to.  Second, China is insistent that, while it still faces major problems in reviving economic growth, it is taking the lead in coping with the crisis through its stimulus package, even if the danger is that it does not sufficiently address the fundamental need to boost domestic consumption and improve the welfare system. The official forecasts from Beijing that growth will hit 8% this year may turn out to be propagandist whistling in the wind, but the confidence is there.  The World Bank reckons that 6.5% is more likely. Even that would be a sharp contrast to the performance of the west and Japan. Such growth may be achieved through short-term measures that do not address the mainland&apos;s longer-term need to rebalance the economy. But the plans \u2013 from more than 100 urban infrastructure projects in Beijing to huge railway developments including hundreds of miles of high-speed track and a major overhaul of the power grid system \u2013 are impressive.  Third, on the back of what has been announced since the launch of the stimulus package in November, China is making its voice heard in economic and financial matters as never before. It is not just that its leaders are speaking out, but that they are doing so in a much sharper tone than before. In Davos, earlier this year, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao delivered some hard home truths to the western financial world. What he said about the &quot;unsustainable model of development, characterised by prolonged low savings and high consumption&quot; was undeniable. What was interesting was that he said it at all, and in such a forum.  This month, Wen has been back on the charge, expressing his worries about the safety of China&apos;s US treasury bonds, echoed by senior monetary officials at the People&apos;s Bank of China. Visiting New York, a Chinese bank regulator has expressed concern about his country&apos;s dependence on the dollar through its US government securities. This week, the governor of the central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, has criticised &quot;governments that have not emulated China&apos;s decisive stimulus action&quot; and published an essay calling for the expansion of IMF Special Drawing Rights as an alternative to the dollar.  Chinese officials say the crisis has shown that a unipolar world financial system is now untenable. The state newspaper, China Daily, has run a front page headline saying simply &quot;Obama must do more to clean up dollar mess&quot;, while the Communist party newspaper People&apos;s Daily has been delivering regular tickings-off to the west for its misconduct. Today, its front page was a story about an economic planner forecasting that &quot;China, not the US, will lead economic recovery&quot;. Sixty years ago, when the Communists set up the People&apos;s Republic, Mao Zedong proclaimed that China had stood up again. For all the major problems it faces at home, the tens of millions of migrant workers thrown out of work, the flaws in the system and the uncertainties about the longer-term effectiveness of Beijing&apos;s medicine, the mood on the mainland appears to reflect the mixture of danger and opportunity contained in the Chinese word for crisis.  This means that Brown and company face a different kind of dragon at the London summit. If, as looks probable, the G20 proves incapable of producing any real solutions, the new China will still have to be dealt with. It can no longer be seen simply as a producer of low-cost goods reliant on its reserves of cheap labour and capital and on imported technology. The second generation of market-led economic reform will be, in many ways, more challenging than the first. That challenge will not only be for China, but also for the rest of a world in which the mainland is now an integral part."}, {"sentences": ["New Storm in Sega world     Storm-G for YouChoose Photograph: YouTube    Akihabara News visited Sega&apos;s Joypolis games arcade in Tokyo for the launch of its Storm-G machine."], "tags": ["Internet", "Computing", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-01T23:01:00Z", "title": "YouChoose: Kinetic wave sculptures, Storm-G's world launch and Jacko's replacement", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/02/you-choose", "article": "Making waves, out of wood     kinetic wave for youchoose Photograph: YouTube    Reuben Margolin went rafting, and watching the waves inspired him to make techno-kinetic wave sculptures from bits of wood, cardboard tubes and various &quot;salvaged objects&quot;.

A low-flying metal cloud. A stylised pool of water as seen from the treetops. This summer&apos;s Serpentine Gallery pavilion, designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of the Tokyo architectural studio Sanaa, is certainly the most ethereal yet. Over the nine years that the London art gallery has been commissioning its much talked about (and much-liked) pavilions, designs have veered from the happily lightweight to the impressively substantial. In 2006, Rem Koolhaas and Cecil Balmond created a pavilion in the guise of a stylised hot air balloon. In 2003, Oscar Niemeyer shaped a building that might have been shipped, concrete post by concrete curve, from Brasilia while looking to all the world as if it might last decades rather than the three, fleeting months required. The most beautiful of the Serpentine pavilions to date has been the 2002 offering by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito, working in close collaboration with Cecil Balmond, the celebrated Arup engineer and mathematician. Sejima \u2013 who has worked with Ito \u2013 and Nishizawa are, it appears, working quietly to ensure that the 2009 pavilion is prettier than all that have gone before. Their design, unveiled yesterday, is what the architects describe as &quot;floating aluminium drifting freely between the trees like smoke.&quot; It will work, they say, &quot;as a field of activity with no walls, allowing views to extend uninterrupted across the park and encouraging access from all sides.&quot; It will be a &quot;sheltered extension of the park [Kensington Gardens] where people can read, relax and enjoy lovely summer days&quot;. Weather permitting, of course. This metal sunshade will be supported by the slimmest of columns to help it appear to float. It will undulate around trees in the park, reaching for the sky in places, while dropping almost to the ground in others. In effect, it will be a shorthand version of Sanaa&apos;s buildings \u2013 structures that aim to be as immaterial as architecture can realistically be, while offering many rather than just the one main entrance. To date, the partnership&apos;s most talked about buildings include the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, the N-Museum in Wakayama and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa. Achieving such enchanting immateriality, however, will be a lot easier with a summer parkland pavilion than with a major museum building, and Sanaa will be aided and abetted in its quest by the Japanese structural design and engineering firm Saps, led by Mutsuro Sasaki as well as by a team from Arup fronted by David Glover, Ed Clark and Cecil Balmond. Such a powerhouse of design and engineering talent might seem like the equivalent of a using sledgehammer to crack a nut, yet it does show just how popular the Serpentine pavilion project is with professionals who are simultaneously working on buildings\u2013 as Balmond is\u2013 as mighty, radical and sensational as the new CCTV Tower in Beijing. The Serpentine pavilion is a chance to play with architecture at an intelligent, yet popular and hugely enjoyable level. Julia Peyton-Jones&apos;s idea, meanwhile, of only commissioning what she describes as &quot;pre-eminent&quot; architects who have yet to make their &quot;debut&quot; in England, remains as fresh this year as it did when Zaha Hadid first took on the challenge in 2000.

US crude oil futures rose more than $3 a barrel to $51.53 earlier today. &quot;There&apos;s a desperation to grab on to any good news,&quot; said Manus Cranny at MF Global Spreads. &quot;House prices rising, Americans buying cars, steel manufacturers (ArcelorMittal) obtaining refinancing, world leaders smiling and the French turning up on time at Excel in London for the G20 is enough for one day to cheer the London and European markets and help them power ahead.&quot; Gordon Brown and Barack Obama have expressed confidence that the summit will come up with a strong agreement to tackle the problems of struggling economies, financial regulation and troubled banks. But Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, have refused calls for more government spending, and are pushing for concrete steps on tougher regulation. Sarkozy toned down his earlier threat to walk out of the summit last night, and Obama could be seen chatting with Merkel at the leaders&apos; dinner. The US president also said differences between the leaders had been &quot;vastly overstated&quot;. &quot;A new fiscal agreement will probably not come, but there&apos;s a feeling that they are going to organise themselves. Obama has drawn a line in the sand,&quot; said Cranny. He added that market expectations had been managed down so much that even if world leaders cannot agree on additional fiscal stimuli, a &quot;cohesive&quot; statement on financial regulation would be treated as good news. He thought the market would continue to drift higher over the next few days, although he was concerned that trading volumes were quite thin. Green shoots? Investors were also cheered by news that UK house prices recorded their first increase in March after 16 months of declines. And British lenders plan to make credit more easily available to households and businesses over the next few months, the Bank of England reported today. &quot;The economic outlook was no longer expected to be a factor bearing down on credit availability,&quot; the Bank&apos;s survey concluded. Daiwa economist Colin Ellis said the survey &quot;could mark a turning point for the UK economy&quot;. &quot;This positive news chimes with other glimmers of economic hope that have cropped up in recent weeks - heightening expectations that maybe the UK is indeed now past the worst of the recession. Time will tell - but we increasingly think so,&quot; he added. Britain&apos;s construction sector continues to shrink, but at a slower pace than before, a separate survey showed. The European Central Bank cut interest rates across the eurozone by a quarter point to 1.25% at lunchtime. The move was smaller than the half-point reduction expected by markets, sending the euro higher. It climbed 1% to $1.3357 against the dollar. On the other side of the Atlantic, US car sales fell by 37% in March - a smaller-than-expected drop that sparked hopes that the world&apos;s largest car market could be near the bottom. David Buik at BGC Partners said: &quot;Obviously, the summit will dominate the headlines for the next day or two. However it is as well to notice that there are a few not exactly green shoots of recovery but perhaps a sign that, with the exception of unemployment, we may be somewhere at the bottom of the cycle.&quot; He added: &quot;As is often the case, the market is likely to overdo it. However, there are signs of a greater appetite for risk. Also, it is fair to say the stockmarket fell much more quickly in 2008 than the economy did. Companies are now leaner and meaner so there may be some value out there.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Now the German author and film-maker Doris D\u00f6rrie has made a direct homage to Ozu&apos;s masterpiece (and world top 10 fixture) Tokyo Story.", "This is a sweet-natured piece, and though the final section in Tokyo itself is sentimental and over-extended, there are poignant, mordant insights."], "tags": ["Drama", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-02T23:13:09Z", "title": "Film review: Cherry Blossoms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/02/cherry-blossoms-german-film-review", "article": "The great Japanese master Ozu continues to inspire.

You can&apos;t blame them. After all, the cardboard couple starred in the movie that launched the action franchise back in 2001 before Diesel stormed off the sequel because the studio wouldn&apos;t meet his inflated pay demands.  That left the pretty and pretty dull Walker to carry 2 Fast 2 Furious, and to be fair to him he did a very good job and the second movie became the biggest hit of the franchise when it raked in $236.4m (\u00a3159.8m) worldwide. The nadir came three years later in 2006 when The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift became the first of the three to fail to cross $100m in North America. It chugged out of the gates weighed down with not only the worst title of them all but also without any recognisable star. But the action scenes were good, which reminded me of something attributed to the former Universal chairman Stacey Snider back when Diesel left the franchise. &quot;We feel,&quot; Snider reportedly declared, &quot;the brand of this film is attitude, cars and hip casting, and that it is not dependent on star casting.&quot; I&apos;m fairly certain franchises are dependant on stars and now that Snider plies her trade at DreamWorks 2.0 alongside Steven Spielberg, Universal has reaffirmed its commitment to star power in a big way. Diesel, who took a cameo in the third movie, and Walker, who incidentally launched his small-screen career in Pampers commercials, have been staring down from billboards in the US above the legend, &quot;New Model. Original Parts.&quot; As far as their charisma and acting ability go, combined with the studios&apos; hive-mind mentality, I believe a fairer slogan would have been, &quot;Same formula. Used parts.&quot; Having said that, the action sequences are stupendous in places and the title Fast &amp; Furious doesn&apos;t misrepresent. Michelle Rodriguez also returns from the original to out-smoulder the fieriest turbo-boosters and many believe the movie will set a new opening weekend record for April. To do that it will need to outrun the $42.2m set by Anger Management in 2003. I&apos;ve no doubt come Sunday Fast &amp; Furious will be the No 1 release, but that April record is a tough one to break. Also new this weekend is a fine new rites-of-passage comedy from Superbad director Greg Mottola. Adventureland stars Kristen Stewart of Twilight and Jesse Eisenberg and is one of the funniest and most poignant tales of young love to come out of Hollywood in a while. Whereas Fast &amp; Furious launches in 3,462 cinemas, Adventureland opens in roughly 1,862. Last weekend&apos;s champion Monsters Vs Aliens from DreamWorks Animation will still be up there, as will Lionsgate&apos;s horror tale The Haunting in Connecticut, although genre releases typically fall off by approximately 50% in their second weekends. Monsters Vs Aliens&apos; $59.3m launch last weekend paved the way for a triumphant appearance by the studio&apos;s chief Jeffrey Katzenberg at the Hollywood convention ShoWest in Las Vegas this week. Katzenberg, like many other studio chiefs in attendance over the past four days, pledged his undying belief in the future of 3D and expressed frustration over the slow deployment of digital cinema in the US and around the world. There was plenty of frustration in Sin City this week, and not just on the casino floors. The 3D revival cannot be fulfilled until the digital foundation is in place and that won&apos;t happen until there&apos;s a thawing in the credit markets and the banks start lending again. Katzenberg seems fairly sure this will start to happen in the coming months. The success of a dozen or so big studio 3D movies scheduled to open this year hinges on it."}, {"sentences": ["Although North Korea insists the rocket is designed to do no more than put a communications satellite into orbit, Washington and Tokyo, among others, insist it is a covert attempt to test a Taepodong-2 missile capable, in theory, of striking Alaska or Hawaii.", "&quot;North Korea knows that if it launches a ballistic missile, the Obama administration will try to seek bilateral talks on nuclear weapons, aid and a US pledge of non-aggression,&quot; said Hideshi Takesada, a North Korean specialist at the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Japan", "South Korea", "World news", "Obama administration", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-03T16:28:55Z", "title": "Barack Obama warns North Korea over ballistic missile launch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/03/north-korea-missile-obama", "article": "President Obama issued a stern warning to North Korea today, saying that it cannot go ahead with the planned launch of a long-range rocket with impunity. However, Pyongyang was today pressing ahead with final preparations for the launch, which the US and its allies believe is a cover for a ballistic missile test. The countdown could begin as early as tomorrow , analysts believe. Speaking in Strasbourg before the Nato summit, Obama said: &quot;Should North Korea decide to take this action, we will work with all interested partners in the international community to take appropriate steps to let North Korea know that they cannot threaten the safety and stability of other countries with impunity. &quot;The response so far from the North Koreans has been not just unhelpful but has resorted to the sort of language that has led to North Korea&apos;s isolation in the international community for a very long time,&quot; Obama said. Last night China was reportedly engaged in eleventh-hour attempts to persuade North Korea to cancel the launch. But, with the rocket now almost fuelled, the countries that have most to fear from North Korea&apos;s sabre-rattling \u2013 the US, Japan and South Korea \u2013 are frantically attempting to craft a response. Although North Korea insists the rocket is designed to do no more than put a communications satellite into orbit, Washington and Tokyo, among others, insist it is a covert attempt to test a Taepodong-2 missile capable, in theory, of striking Alaska or Hawaii. This is not entirely uncharted territory for any of the parties. North Korea provoked international anger when it test-fired a Taepodong-1 missile \u2013 a less sophisticated version of the rocket now being primed for takeoff \u2013 over Japanese territory in 1998. Three years ago it chose 4 July to put on its own fireworks display, test-firing a Taepodong-2 that exploded moments after takeoff. Its decision to try again in the face of almost unanimous opposition was motivated by key military and political calculations. Analysts said it wanted to test the missile technology, with a view to selling it to bidders from the Middle East. In the short term, the launch was designed to demonstrate to Obama that he could expect just as rough a time as his predecessor in the White House. &quot;North Korea knows that if it launches a ballistic missile, the Obama administration will try to seek bilateral talks on nuclear weapons, aid and a US pledge of non-aggression,&quot; said Hideshi Takesada, a North Korean specialist at the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo. &quot;It is aware that Bush offered bilateral talks the last time there was a test launch and it believes that by going ahead with nuclear tests and missile launches it will soften Washington&apos;s stance yet again.&quot; Elsewhere, the mere threat of a missile test is having the opposite effect. Japan has sent Aegis destroyers to its northern coast and has threatened to shoot the rocket down if it malfunctions and veers towards its territory. North Korea, meanwhile, has warned it will interpret any attempt to intercept its &quot;peaceful satellite&quot; as a declaration of war that would be met with a &quot;thunderbolt of revenge&quot;. The rhetoric is alarming, but, in refusing to back down, North Korea was merely reverting to type in an attempt to win concessions, applying what one academic called the &quot;power of uncertainty&quot;. In 2003 it withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and in 2005 announced it had developed a nuclear weapon; a year later it claimed to have successfully tested one. Then last year it walked away from six-party nuclear talks, despite diplomatic overtures from the outgoing Bush administration. So far Kim has given Obama similarly short shrift, even after he sent his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, to east Asia in February with promises of a new, more constructive era in bilateral ties. With the rocket almost primed for takeoff, few dared to ponder the possible consequences of failure. At the very least it would deal a blow to Kim&apos;s prestige at home at a pivotal point in his presidency, while a botched Japanese attempt to intercept wayward boosters would be an embarrassing setback for its costly missile defence system. At the very worst, one think-tank warned this week, it could spark a military conflict in the region."}, {"sentences": ["127 mins Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story segues into a Teutonic Lost In Translation (well, almost) in this slightly uncomfortable character drama, as a German widower takes a sentimental journey to Japan after his wife&apos;s unexpected death, and predictably benefits from the change of culture."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-03T23:01:00Z", "title": "In cinemas this weekend: April 04 2009", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/04/cinema-listings", "article": "Monsters Vs Aliens (PG)  (Rob Letterman, Conrad Vernon, 2009, US) Seth Rogen, Reese Witherspoon, Kiefer Sutherland. 95 mins A nice idea for a family animation: a secret government team of monsters (of the 1950s B-movie variety) is marshalled into action against a four-eyed extraterrestrial invader.

Official figures from the US labour department yesterday showed the rate of joblessness rose by 0.4 percentage points during March as 663,000 jobs were eliminated. Economists said the report provided few positive fragments. But early inklings of improvement in the US housing market and in consumer confidence have fuelled a powerful recovery in the financial markets, amid hopes the slump could soon bottom out.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39 points to 8017 yesterday, capping its best four-week stretch since 1933. It was the first time the blue-chip index had broken through 8000 since early February. Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight, said unemployment tended to be a lagging indicator which improves later than other economic measures. &quot;This certainly tells us that any green shoots people have been looking for haven&apos;t shown up yet in the labour market,&quot; he said. &quot;As people lose their jobs, they tend to spend less - and so do people who still have jobs, because they&apos;re concerned that they could be next.&quot; Signposts of recovery, such as weekly working hours and temporary employment, continue to fall. Jobs were lost in all categories except for healthcare and education, with 161,000 positions disappearing in manufacturing, 126,000 in construction and 133,000 in professional and business services. The White House had been anticipating bad news. Barack Obama&apos;s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, had said: &quot;I think it&apos;s safe to expect - without having seen them - that we&apos;ll see additional severe job cuts in America.&quot; Since the economic downturn began, the number of jobs lost in the US has reached 5.1 million, the biggest decline since troops were demobilised at the end of the second world war.  Analysts believe the unemployment rate, already at its highest since 1983, is likely to peak in double figures. Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York, said: &quot;We&apos;re at a record high in joblessness. The question is how much higher can we go? I would not be surprised to see us get to 10% or 11%.&quot; Big cuts by employers are coming thick and fast. In Detroit, the struggling carmakers General Motors and Chrysler, which have already shed tens of thousands of workers, have said they will have to shut more factories and trim payrolls to satisfy viability goals set by the Obama administration. The parcel delivery company FedEx said yesterday it was laying off 1,000 people after a slump in profits. Disney has axed 1,900 positions at its US theme parks to &quot;reflect today&apos;s economic realities&quot;. Peter Morici, professor of business at the University of Maryland, said the rate of joblessness could already be close to 11% if people &quot;discouraged&quot; from the labour force were included - for example, part-time workers unable to find full-time jobs and stay-at-home parents who would rather be employed. &quot;Discouraged by a sluggish job market, many more adults are sitting on the sidelines, neither working nor looking for work, than when George Bush became president,&quot; said Morici. In another sign of hardship, business activity in the services sector shrank for a sixth successive month last month. The Institute for Supply Management&apos;s index dropped from 41.6 to 40.8, suggesting orders and inventories continue to weaken. A jump in home purchases last week fuelled fragile sentiment the US economy was at least deteriorating at a slower pace, if not bottoming out.  Retail sales are slightly improving and the corporate debt market is beginning to thaw. Enlivened by the Obama administration&apos;s $787bn (\u00a3530bn) stimulus package and by the US treasury&apos;s latest plan to clean up banks&apos; toxic assets, the blue-chip Dow Jones index has rallied by 21% since 9 March. But the hike in unemployment proved a harsh sign of more pain to come in towns and cities across the US. Chris Rupkey, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York, said: &quot;This is a full-blown recession with the job losses coming fast and furious.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The capital&apos;s striking Tidal Basin is lined by 3,700 Japanese cherry trees, donated by the Mayor of Tokyo in 1912 to mark the two cities&apos; then burgeoning friendship."], "tags": ["Washington DC holidays", "City breaks", "United States holidays", "Hotels", "Food and drink", "Cultural trips", "Shopping trips", "Travel", "Washington DC"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-03T23:01:00Z", "title": "I love Washington DC in the springtime", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/04/washington-dc-travel-tips", "article": "&apos;The moment you land in Washington, DC, you remember why you live in Colorado,&quot; said Hunter S Thompson. Washington has never, to my knowledge, graced a list of the world&apos;s most romantic cities and few could imagine the line &quot;I love DC in the springtime&quot; falling soulfully from Cole Porter&apos;s pen. As a seat of government the city naturally attracts venom and the innate line of thinking is that the place is bloodless, bureaucratic and transient. But friends of mine who know the city say Thompson and his ilk have got it wrong. One lobbyist points out, &quot;Even a policy wonk&apos;s thoughts can turn to romance.&quot; He cites the city&apos;s low-rise architecture and wide, gracious avenues, designed by Pierre-Charles L&apos;Enfant in the 1790s and inspired by Versailles, as evidence of a secret, pulsing, Francophile soul, while Georgetown, on the banks of the Potomac, has a whiff of old England.  In April Washingtonians celebrate yet another turbulent on-off international relationship. The capital&apos;s striking Tidal Basin is lined by 3,700 Japanese cherry trees, donated by the Mayor of Tokyo in 1912 to mark the two cities&apos; then burgeoning friendship. This weekend sees the trees in full, heart-swelling bloom, and a million visitors are expected to stroll - or embrace - beneath the petals and celebrate the National Cherry Blossom Festival.  But Washington doesn&apos;t need blossom to feel sexier than salsa this year. The Obama circus is in town and the District of Columbia is officially hot. Even at Dulles Airport you note the capital&apos;s starry-eyed affair with its 44th president. Mugs, fridge magnets and T-shirts all proclaim the lurve. And I subscribe to the vibe: I walked through the arrival lounge carrying my copy of Dreams From My Father. As my cab entered DC, cardboard cut-outs of Barack Obama peered from windows, fond echoes of the inauguration. My cab driver said proudly, &quot;Obama house!&quot; as we whisked past the building formerly known as the White House. In a bookshop later, I overheard two women discussing the virtues of Portuguese water dogs as presidential pets.  While the honeymoon lasts, much of DC seems to think of the Obamas as extended family; unsurprising, perhaps, in a city where African-Americans comprise nearly 60% of the population. The kinship is strengthened by the notion that, as a long-time Chicago resident, Barack Obama is the first truly urban president. A point proved when, on his first weekend in town as president, he popped into a popular neighbourhood diner, Ben&apos;s Chili Bowl (benschilibowl.com) in the U-street district. The signal was clear: you no longer have to eat at some over-priced grill to be an insider.  Avoiding pomposity, it seems to me, is the key to enjoying DC and finding its more soulful sub-culture. While the Capitol and the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials remind you of your antlike insignificance, and Maya Ling Yin&apos;s Memorial Wall commemorating the Vietnam dead reduces everyone to tears, you can get a little monumented out in DC. As one Washingtonian friend remarked, gesticulating at a plinth, &quot;Another fucker on a horse.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Obama House&quot; is so familiar from the West Wing that it&apos;s both surreal and underwhelming to find yourself suddenly outside it. It must have been jollier back in the early 1800s when there was a brothel in the grounds, and President John Quincy Adams&apos;s wife Louisa said drily that instead of voting itself a pay rise, Congress ought to found an orphanage for their bastard progeny. It seems every DC age has had its scandal, with the last half-century bringing us JFK&apos;s serial rutting, Watergate, Monica Lewinsky&apos;s refrigerated dress and the recent revelation that Eliot Spitzer, the crusading New York attorney general, favoured Washington for his trysts with a $5,000-a-night hooker. My hotel, the Tabard Inn, close by the Dupont Circle, is a celebrated place of assignation in DC, and has featured in several novels, including John Grisham&apos;s Pelican Brief. It&apos;s worth going to Washington for the Tabard alone, which is ludicrously good value. Unfortunately, there are no lifts, but that didn&apos;t deter one elderly loved-up couple (he sporting a Homburg, she a cloche) from hauling themselves upstairs.  The Tabard consists of three interconnected turn-of-the-century townhouses, stuffed full of crazy antiques, paintings and curios, and has a deservedly praised restaurant (one of the earliest to source organic ingredients).  Another enjoyable way to experience this unexpected side of the capital would be a grand tour of its galleries and museums. The Mall is lined with the Smithsonian&apos;s great institutions, and while New York equivalents can easily charge $20, DC&apos;s finest are free. It would take a month to even begin to do justice to the collections, but seeking the city&apos;s more sensual side I stood entranced before the Whistlers in the Freer Gallery (asia.si.edu), before wandering through their oriental art collection. Later, in the Hirshhorn (hirshhorn.si.edu), I was transfixed by Louise Bourgeois&apos;s erotically nuanced sculptures. And in the National Gallery of Art (nga.gov) I passed through Multiverse, a vast and utterly enchanting light sculpture by the American artist Leo Villareal.  Outside the Tabard, the best way to locate the city&apos;s beating heart is to roam up-and-coming neighbourhoods. On the north side of Dupont Circle, I found the packed but charming Bistro du Coin (bistrotducoin.com) with its unpretentious trad Gallic dishes.  I also perused the area around 14th and U Street, where young Democrat dads in groovy specs push buggies past hip bars. Enter any coffee shop and you&apos;ll see a clutch of latte-sipping Obamites tapping away at their MacBooks. A lone Popeye&apos;s Fried Chicken joint sits forlornly amid the galleries and home furnishing stores, reminding you that this was, until recently, a predominantly poor, black area. One d\u00e9cor shop was called Home Rule (homerule.com), highlighting the DC dwellers&apos; perennial gripe that they have no voting representation in the US Congress. The district&apos;s vehicle licence plates bear the mantra &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot;. Then a Brit journalist friend and his Washington-raised girlfriend walked me over to the Adams-Morgan district where 18th meets U Street. We had cocktails and sushi in Perry&apos;s (perrysadamsmorgan.com), a fancy-pants sort of a joint celebrated for its rooftop terrace. But I preferred the daisy-fresh late-night feast we enjoyed around the corner at the Amsterdam Falafel Shop (falafelshop.com) on 18th, where college kids and lobbyists queue to line their stomachs after a hard night&apos;s partying, and the delightful owner, Scotty, became misty-eyed as he recalled standing on the Mall in ice-cold weather for Obama&apos;s inauguration. Far from the political bovver-boys on Capitol Hill there&apos;s a lot of heart in DC. It&apos;s true that muggings are disappointingly commonplace, and as one African-American Washingtonian told me wryly, &quot;You&apos;ll not meet a single person who&apos;s crossed the Anacostia River to the city&apos;s Southeast ghettos.&quot; But homicide rates have halved from the crisis years, and the process of gentrification seems relentless I spent my final day in Washington in the near-deserted and hauntingly lovely gardens of Dumbarton Oaks (doaks.org), a Gilded Age mansion in Georgetown landscaped by Edith Wharton&apos;s niece, Beatrix Farrand.

Was it a punctuation mark, a footnote or the start of a new chapter? Was it about Islam and the west, or free speech, or a Booker Prize-winning novelist, or an unholy mix of all these things? After the fatwa, nothing would ever be quite the same again. Everyone was scorched by the affair. At the time, I remember, the episode gave British publishing a buzz. Muslim radicals were burning books, a writer had fled into hiding with Special Branch protection and thousands of column inches were being devoted to the proper conduct of a free society. In the age of greed, it was almost reassuring to know that the printed word was still a matter of life and death.  In hindsight, the human cost was terrible. Several people were killed in Turkey, a Norwegian publisher was shot and the novel&apos;s Japanese translator was knifed to death in Tokyo. Rushdie himself became universally famous in a way no serious writer could possibly enjoy. For a decade his existence was transformed into a living nightmare. Somehow, with great dignity and good humour, he kept his sanity. In the slipstream of history, these things are forgotten. Set against the broader canvas of 9/11, the war on terror, the 7/7 bombings of London and New Labour&apos;s assault on our civil liberties, the Rushdie affair wears the strange innocence of an ancient war. It has also become hoary with commentary: hundreds of articles, at least one novel, and no fewer than five books, from Lisa Appignanesi&apos;s The Rushdie File to Malise Ruthven&apos;s A Satanic Affair Now, in this latest anniversary year, Kenan Malik&apos;s From Fatwa to Jihad (Atlantic \u00a316.99, pp266) is an enthralling but not entirely successful attempt to place &quot;the Rushdie affair&quot; in context.  Malik is a seasoned commentator on multicultural Britain. The best parts of his book are his analysis of the complex dynamics that turned The Satanic Verses from an expensive literary novel for which Penguin paid an unprecedented $850,000 into the best-known, least-read book on the planet. Malik shows that it wasn&apos;t the book but its symbolic status that ignited the campaign. And it wasn&apos;t Rushdie&apos;s critics in Britain but his enemies in India who started it. Like almost all its opponents, Syed Shahabuddin, a champion of India&apos;s 150 million Muslims, had not opened the novel. &quot;I do not have to wade through filth to know what filth is,&quot; he said. When the first protests began in the UK, three months after publication, first in Bolton and then in Bradford, the burning of The Satanic Verses did not attract much attention. Not even a British Pakistani writer like Hanif Kureishi saw it coming. Refreshingly, Kureishi is the first to admit this. &quot;I saw it as a book about psychosis, about newness and change.&quot; Even when the book was burned in Bradford, &quot;it didn&apos;t register,&quot; he says. Then global politics kicked in. No one really knows why Khomeini issued his fatwa. Was it a political tactic to wrong-foot some internal enemies ? An emotive reaction to television images of Muslim riots in Islamabad? One thing is certain: the fatwa transformed an obscure British row into a global conflagration. The European Union withdrew its ambassadors. Iran broke off diplomatic relations with Britain. America uttered weasel words but did nothing. Rushdie stayed in hiding. Since then, there has been a succession of test cases in the fraught co-existence of Islamist and liberal Britain in the aftermath of 9/11 and the age of jihad: the affair of the Danish cartoons, the fire-bombing of Gibson Square publishers over the publication of a piece of soft porn, The Jewel of Medina, and the row over the location filming of Monica Ali&apos;s Brick Lane As much as Baghdad or Helmand province, enlightenment values like democracy and the rule of law have become a battleground in the war on terror. The vocabulary of this debate was forged in the white heat of the fatwa. Malik is right.

The state&apos;s official news agency said it had successfully put a satellite into orbit and said the satellite was transmitting revolutionary songs as it circled the Earth. However, both the US military and South Korea said the satellite had failed to orbit, with the payload dropping into the sea. The US president, Barack Obama, led international condemnation of the launch, which Washington and others see as a test of weapons technology. The US had initially feared that Pyongyang planned to launch a Taepodong-2 missile, theoretically capable of reaching Alaska, in breach of a UN ban. &quot;Now is the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through illegal weapons,&quot; Obama said in speech in Prague. &quot;Rules must be binding, violations must be punished, words must mean something.&quot; The multi-stage rocket lifted off at 11.30am (2.30am GMT) from the Musudan-ri site in north-eastern North Korea. The US northern command said stage one of the missile fell into the Sea of Japan and the remaining stages along with the payload landed in the Pacific ocean. No debris fell on Japan. The South Korean defence minister, Lee Sang-hee, said the satellite had failed to orbit, Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency reported. &quot;Based on our judgment made so far, all first, second and third [stage] rockets fell into the ocean, and thus nothing has been put into orbit,&quot; Lee reportedly said at a parliamentary session in Seoul. Three years ago, a Taepodong-2 test failed within seconds. Details remain unclear, but the foreign secretary, David Miliband, described this morning&apos;s North Korean move as a &quot;satellite launch&quot;. He accused Pyongyang of a &quot;hostile policy&quot; towards the rest of the world, adding: &quot;This action contributes directly to their ballistic missile programme.&quot; The US, Japan and South Korea argue that the launch technology for a missile is the same as that for a satellite, but will find it harder to press their case than if a Taepodong-2 had been fired. China and Russia called for calm and restraint on all sides. The White House described the launch as a clear breach of UN resolution 1718, passed after long-range missile and nuclear tests in 2006, which demanded that North Korea suspend &quot;all activities related to its ballistic missile programme&quot;. Japan&apos;s chief cabinet spokesman, Takeo Kawamura, said: &quot;Even if a satellite was launched, we see this as a ballistic missile test ... we are highly concerned by this matter.&quot; South Korea called it a &quot;reckless&quot; act that threatened regional stability. The EU &quot;strongly condemned&quot; Pyongyang&apos;s step. Tokyo had deployed warships and Patriot missile interceptors off its northern coast to shoot down any debris which might hit its territory. But, like the US, it had already said it would not intercept the device after Pyongyang warned that shooting it down would be an &quot;act of war&quot; and would prompt retaliation. US and South Korean warships, equipped with missile interceptors, plied the waters between the Korean peninsula and Japan, while Russia reportedly scrambled fighter jets to its far east in case of debris. Japan and the US requested an emergency meeting of the security council, which will take place in New York tonight. UN diplomats, speaking anonymously, told Reuters no country was considering imposing new sanctions on Pyongyang \u2013 they would be almost certain to be blocked by Russia and China \u2013 but the starting point could be discussing a resolution for the stricter enforcement of earlier sanctions. China has occasionally criticised its neighbour in the past, notably when Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in 2006, but has usually preferred to use its leverage as the North&apos;s main ally in private. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University, in Beijing, said China had learned that tough measures did not work and cost it &quot;crucial influence with Pyongyang at even more sensitive moments&quot;. China will probably decide that bringing its neighbour back to the table to resume the stalled six-party talks on aid for nuclear disarmament is a greater priority. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, today called on the North to return to the talks as he warned that the launch was not conducive to peace and stability. Many believe that Pyongyang was aiming to grab US attention as well as test and improve its missile-related technology and advertise it to potential purchasers such as Iran. &quot;The test represents both a calling card for North Korea to the [Obama] administration and at the same time strengthens its bargaining position,&quot; Professor Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, said. He pointed out that the nuclear test in 2006 had been a hostile act but led to bilateral negotiations with the US. Pyongyang had warned the world that it would launch the rocket between 4 and 8 April and notified agencies such as the International Maritime Organisation, which it has not done on previous occasions. The launch will boost morale at home, particularly because South Korea has yet to put a satellite into space. It will bolster the position of the country&apos;s leader, Kim Jong-il, who is believed to have suffered a stroke last year but is thought to be back in charge of major decisions. The state KCNA news agency said in a report: &quot;Our scientists and engineers have succeeded in sending satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 into orbit by way of carrier rocket Unha-2. &quot;[It] was developed by our wisdom and technology, and is a proud achievement made out of our battle to upgrade our country&apos;s space scientific technology&quot;. It added that the satellite was transmitting the Song of General Kim Il-sung and Song of General Kim Jong-il. Kim Il-Sung, the father of the current leader, is still feted as the North&apos;s &quot;eternal president&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo said the first booster stage appeared to fall into the Sea of Japan, and the second into the Pacific Ocean \u2013 a marked improvement on a test of the Taepodong-2 missile three years ago."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Barack Obama", "US news", "World news", "Politics", "Gordon Brown"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-05T19:25:51Z", "title": "North Korea's defiant rocket launch tests Barack Obama's nuclear resolve", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/north-korea-nuclear-weapons", "article": "North Korea sent tension soaring across Asia yesterday and tested the crisis response of Barack Obama&apos;s two-month-old US presidency when it launched a long-range rocket capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Pyongyang&apos;s defiance of international pressure to cancel the launch cast a cloud over a speech on international security delivered by Obama in Prague, during which he unveiled a battery of measures aimed at stemming the spread of nuclear weapons. Obama denounced the North Korean move as &quot;a provocation&quot; as the UN security council was called to an emergency session in New York, and the White House, Nato, and the European Union said Pyongyang&apos;s action could not go unpunished. North Korea&apos;s official news agency said the country had sent a satellite into orbit, where it was transmitting revolutionary songs. The US and South Korea, however, said the payload had dropped into the Pacific Ocean. Obama led the international condemnation by saying the launch threatened nations &quot;near and far&quot; and underscored the need to tackle nuclear proliferation, \u2013 the theme of the speech that he delivered in front of almost 30,000 people in Prague. He pledged to pursue bilateral nuclear arms cuts with the Russians, multilateral reductions with all other nuclear powers, including Britain, and to press the US senate to ratify the international treaty banning nuclear testing. He called for nuclear non-proliferation to be reinforced by banning manufacture of bomb-grade fissile material and establishing an international &quot;nuclear fuel tank&quot; to stop countries enriching uranium. All &quot;vulnerable&quot; nuclear material would also be secured in safe compounds within four years, he added. He said the risk of terrorists acquiring a nuclear weapon was the &quot;most immediate and extreme threat to global security&quot;. Obama declared that the US, as the only country ever to have used atomic weapons, had a special moral responsibility on nuclear disarmament to make life in the 21st century &quot;free from fear&quot;. The lofty aim was overshadowed, however, by the challenge from Pyongyang. Yesterday&apos;s launch is seen as a test of weapons systems in breach of a UN ban. Analysts suggested it was intended to unsettle Obama as well as improve the technology and advertise it to potential purchasers, such as Iran. As news of the missile launch was still being digested across the world, the 15-member UN security council met in closed session in New York to discuss a global response. The US, the UK and France were pushing for strong and united action, including new sanctions, but they faced resistance from the veto-wielding Russia and China, who were expected to block or dilute such moves. Yukio Takasu, Japan&apos;s ambassador to the UN, called the launch &quot;a clear crime&quot;. His French equivalent, Jean-Maurice \u00adRipert, said: &quot;We expect the council to unanimously condemn what has happened.&quot; Even so, the talks were expected to be long and difficult and the session ended early this morning without agreement on a reaction to Pyongyang&apos;s move. Gordon Brown, also in the Czech \u00adRepublic for the EU-US summit, called the missile launch \u00ad&quot;completely unacceptable&quot;. The multi-stage rocket lifted off at 11.30am local time yesterday from the Musudan-ri site. Tokyo said the first booster stage appeared to fall into the Sea of Japan, and the second into the Pacific Ocean \u2013 a marked improvement on a test of the Taepodong-2 missile three years ago. The US and allies argued before the UN security council that the act was a clear breach of UN security council resolution 1718, passed after long-range missile and nuclear tests in 2006. Japan&apos;s PM, Taro Aso, said it was &quot;extremely provocative&quot;. South Korea attacked it as &quot;reckless&quot;. &quot;The test represents both a calling card for North Korea to the [US] administration and at the same time strengthens its bargaining position,&quot; said Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister.

It suggested that this Italian company had a prodigious ability to use visual theatre to mine the psychological world of fairytales with an acuity Freud would admire. This was theatre that worked on several levels simultaneously, and was much bolder than most work being made by UK companies for family audiences. Back in the UK with a new show created with Tokyo&apos;s Setagaya Theatre, the company has turned to Hans Christian Andersen&apos;s story of frozen hearts and broken friendships healed by the power of love. It is good, but not quite as good as its predecessor, walking a far more tricky line between the comic and the dramatic; it never seems as multilayered as Beauty, or as confident in its excavation of the rich symbolism of Andersen&apos;s story. Nonetheless, there are some interesting ideas, particularly in the way it sets up the beautiful but deadly Snow Queen as the older &quot;other woman&quot; in the budding relationship of adolescent Gerda and her friend Kay, who gets a splinter of the devil&apos;s mirror in his eye and falls prey to the charms of the icy enchantress. Indeed, you feel she may actually kiss him to death. She is quite a woman - completely at odds with the innocent Gerda, and even something of a martial arts expert. The suggestion here, perhaps, is that she is a rite of passage for Kay, who only belatedly understands his true love for Gerda. The pair&apos;s final dance is sweetly sensual. The story is episodic, and Gerda&apos;s encounters with various characters such as the Crows and the Robber Princess, though entertaining enough, seem to detract from the dramatic urgency of her quest to save Kay. However, the show has a great deal going for it, particularly in its visuals, which make a statement right from the opening moment when we are introduced to the towering, devilish Grand Master and his incubi. It also features one of the most thrilling stage blizzards I&apos;ve ever seen.

Although Pyongyang insisted that the aim of yesterday&apos;s exercise was to send a communications satellite into orbit, regional powers strongly suspect it was a covert military exercise, since the rocket used, the Taepodong-2, is equally capable of carrying warheads. The principal concern about the Taepodong-2 is its range. Theoretically it can fly up to 4,160 miles, putting Alaska and Hawaii within reach. Yesterday&apos;s manoeuvre is certain to revive debate in the US about the deployment and efficacy of missile defence shields on the west coast. George Bush ordered a pared down version of a missile defence system to be built in 2002. Twenty interceptor missiles have already been installed in underground silos at Fort Greely, Alaska, and 20 more are planned during the next 18 months.  But critics say the interceptors are inadequately equipped to work against sophisticated intercontinental rockets which can take countermeasures to evade strikes. Those include creating clouds of dust around themselves, using miniature jammers to block radar signals and launching several balloons to act as decoys. The alternative to self-defence - engaging the North Koreans in dialogue - has proven equally intractable. For 15 years, Pyongyang has danced a delicate two-step around the international community, alternately ramping up its nuclear programme and then desisting when large incentives are offered. It withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 2003, citing a US &quot;failure&quot; to make good on aid and non-aggression promises contained in a 1994 deal. In 2005, it said a nuclear weapon had been built. A year later came the first nuclear test. Five days after the 2006 test, the UN passed resolution 1718, which banned North Korea from conducting any tests related to a nuclear weapons programme, including their &quot;means of delivery&quot;. In July 2007, the north agreed to close the Yongbyon reactor and destroyed its cooling tower a year later. But in September 2008 it announced the reactor would be restarted in the face of US &quot;hostility&quot;. In October that year, hopes of a breakthrough were raised after the Bush administration removed North Korea from the US list of states that sponsor terrorism. The gesture followed a surprise decision by Pyongyang to resume dismantling the Yongbyon reactor and allow international inspectors to visit all declared and undeclared nuclear sites in return for massive aid and energy assistance. Yet the six-party talks have since stalled, with North Korea threatening to walk away from them altogether if the UN security council, due to convene in New York later today, punishes it for the rocket launch. Despite North Korea&apos;s form, US officials hope it will return to negotiations, albeit with a strengthened hand. Stephen Bosworth, the US special representative for North Korea, says the White House&apos;s aim remains the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. &quot;Everyone has a long-term interest in getting back to the six-party process,&quot; he said. Some analysts are more pessimistic. Hiroyasu Akutsu, a North Korea specialist at the National Institute for Defence Studies in Tokyo, believes Pyongyang will persist with nuclear and missile development until it believes it can negotiate with the US on equal terms. &quot;From what [North Korea] has been saying, that is their strategy, that the US must recognise it and negotiate disarmament with it as it once did with the Soviet Union. I think it&apos;s unrealistic, but that&apos;s their aim.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["A nuclear-capable North Korea shooting missiles over Japan could push Tokyo in a direction that would sharply increase tensions with China."], "tags": ["Nuclear weapons", "World news", "US news", "Hans Blix"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-05T23:01:00Z", "title": "Hans Blix: Patience with Pyongyang", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/06/hans-blix-nuclear-weapons", "article": "It happens that desperadoes hold groups of people hostage - for instance in planes or banks. Sometimes the police or military take some quick action or try some ruse to remove the danger. Sometimes they refrain from moving an inch for fear that hostages will be killed or some disastrous explosion set off. They may seek to talk the desperado out of his corner, perhaps offer to fly a plane hijacker to another destination after releasing his hostage. In many cases, they simply wait. Often - but not always - tiredness and exhaustion bring an end without drama. Are we in a similar situation with North Korea? The big powers recognise that the threat or use of military power is not an option. Actions against key targets in North Korea could hardly be quick enough to prevent the regime inflicting horrible damage on South Korea and perhaps Japan. It need not use nuclear weapons. Seoul is within artillery range from the North. A sudden collapse of the North Korean state would also be a nightmare.  So what about talking? It has been done with varying success for many years and will no doubt be continued. The US has sometimes voiced threats and increased pressures, and usually thereby made the situation more dangerous. However, even during the Bush administration (second term), the US seems to have concluded that to talk North Korea out of its nuclear programme the regime must be offered something that is more useful to it than nuclear weapons and missile programmes. Conversely, the regime knows that for doing away with these programmes, it can demand a great deal.  Over the years, the North Korean regime has had good reasons to fear efforts to eliminate it through actions from outside - military attacks or subversive activities. It seems wise, therefore, that guarantees against such actions may have been placed on the table. For the North Korean government, the question may be what offers the best security - nuclear weapons of their own or a piece of paper.  Perhaps a piece of paper could be made more attractive if it were signed by all the relevant great powers and combined with a peace treaty. Perhaps it would also be more credible if it were offered in the margin of the revival of international nuclear disarmament. While allowing civilian nuclear power and guaranteeing access to uranium fuel, it would have to comprehensively ban nuclear weapons, enrichment of uranium, and reprocessing on the whole Korean peninsula.  The North Korean regime has often been isolated and ostracised. Although there have been good reasons for this, the country may well have felt humiliated. Against that background, the offer of diplomatic relations with the US and Japan, and normal relations with the world at large, may have considerable value as a part of a quid pro quo for dismantling the nuclear weapons programme and for other forms of engagement, for instance against the proliferation of nuclear and missile technology. Many other offers can and are already part of the sweet talk: food and economic assistance of various kinds, and energy assistance - oil and perhaps a resumption of the construction of the two light-water reactors that were part of the 1994 agreed framework. There may be limits to the persuasive power of the Chinese government, but it is significant - and there can be no doubt that Beijing has an enormous interest in using it. A nuclear-capable North Korea shooting missiles over Japan could push Tokyo in a direction that would sharply increase tensions with China.  So while the security council and everybody else will condemn the latest North Korean missile tests, a resumption of the talks will be sought rather than more sanctions. Perhaps President Carter will go again to Pyongyang, reminding Kim Jong-il and the regime of the wishes of Kim Il-sung. We must hope that in the six-power talks formulas are found that can bring sufficient benefits to all sides. Such formulas are unlikely to include sufficient inspection to guarantee that no undeclared fissile material is hidden but must have guarantees against any capability to produce more such material.  And what if nothing is enough to persuade the North Korean regime? If it fears that nothing but a continued demonstration of its nuclear weapons and missile power will guarantee its existence? Then we shall have to be patient, seek to prevent proliferation, and wait for another day.  \u2022 Hans Blix is chairman of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission and former head of the UN weapons inspection team in Iraq secretariat@wmdcommission.org"}, {"sentences": ["About 80% of its business now comes from foreign markets and it has already established warehousing centres in New York, Melbourne and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Publishing", "University of Cambridge", "Books", "Education", "UK news", "Higher education", "Cuts and closures"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-05T23:01:00Z", "title": "Cambridge University Press: dons step in as digital age threatens jobs at world's oldest publisher", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/06/cambridge-university-press-jobs", "article": "College dons have become embroiled in a bitter row over plans to axe more than 150 jobs at Cambridge University Press - the oldest continually operating book publisher in the world. Established under charter from Henry VIII 425 years ago and responsible for works by John Milton, Isaac Newton, and, more recently, Stephen Hawking, the publisher was set to play a leading role in this year&apos;s celebrations to mark the university&apos;s 800th anniversary. But the carefully-choreographed world of Nobel prize-winning scientists, King&apos;s College choristers and Footlights comedians has been shaken by news that scores of local printers&apos; jobs are under threat. Management argues that the move has been forced on them as the industry changes from lithographic to digital production. But critics claim the redundancies will be the beginning of the end for a world-renowned operation that recently printed Lord Stern&apos;s hugely influential review on climate change. The CUP is a charity that is supervised by a &quot;Syndicate&quot; of 18 academics from the highest echelons of the university. Representatives from the shop floor and the Unite union took their case direct to the Syndicate, which is chaired by Dr Gordon Johnson, the president of Wolfson College, and includes economist philosopher Amartya Kumar Sen, former master of Trinity College.  They say their arguments were sympathetically received and that this has led to a change in tack from the former accountant and current chief executive of the press, Stephen Bourne and his fellow-managers. Tomorrow, Unite is set to meet CUP management again, amid mounting hope that at least half of the jobs threatened by the restructuring will be saved in what looks like a U-turn by the publishers. But the management is more cautious. Peter Davison, CUP&apos;s corporate affairs director, confirms that the company is trying to soften the blow in a harsh employment environment but says structural change in the printing industry has swept away pretty much every lithographic printing company in the high-cost south of England.  &quot;We needed to take action because we saw losses of \u00a32m annually for the next three years. We estimate that if we reduce the number of redundancies to 60 it would mean ongoing annual losses of \u00a3300,000 which we can tolerate for the time being, but it&apos;s not as though we are free from the technological writing which is on the wall,&quot; says Davison. The unions are convinced that the direct appeal to the dons has paid dividends but no one inside the Syndicate was available to comment and Davison denied that management was buckling under pressure from the Syndicate.  &quot;The decision to backtrack has resulted from an acknowledgement that deteriorating employment conditions put it under a duty, if at all possible, to at least put off wider cuts as long as possible,&quot; said Davison, adding: &quot;I am not aware of any intervention by the Syndicate.&quot; Whatever the truth, the pressures on a printing division that was once seen by many in the university as a cash cow along with its examination board, look unlikely to go away and are spreading throughout the wider publishing operation. Setting up a digital printing operation costs a lot of upfront money - cash that CUP says it has not got - but once up and running can be much cheaper and flexible to run. Similarly, academics who used to rely on hardback books to help climb the career ladder have more recently been turning to the kind of self-publishing and free distribution offered by the internet. The press still employs 1,000 people in its home town and a further 800 overseas who look after the 25,000 titles in print. About 80% of its business now comes from foreign markets and it has already established warehousing centres in New York, Melbourne and Tokyo. Thousands of books printed in Cambridge are still air-freighted out of Britain to North America and Asia on a weekly basis, something that would have amazed many of its earlier authors. Milton, however, would no doubt have enjoyed an honest row over printing at Cambridge. He wrote in 1644: &quot;Where there is much desire to learn, there of necessity will be much arguing, much writing, many opinions; for opinion in good men is but knowledge in the making.&quot; How Henry VIII helped to create a publishing giant For centuries, Cambridge University Press has had religious and scientific publishing at the centre of its operation, with bibles and prayerbooks making up a significant proportion of its total output. CUP, which is owned by the university, is based to the south of the city, on Shaftesbury Road.

The company, which is the oldest continually operating book publisher in the world, is also the printer to the Queen.  That status originated from letters patent which were granted to the university by King Henry VIII in 1534. Its first book was actually printed in 1584 and since then CUP has published many of the country&apos;s leading thinkers from John Milton to Charles Darwin through Bertrand Russell and on to Stephen Hawking. The publishing house does not produce fiction but it can still cause controversy.  In 2007, it decided to destroy all remaining copies of a book published the year before - Alms for Jihad: Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World - after a messy legal case brought by a Saudi billionaire.

In London, the FTSE 100 index in London climbed about 60.15 points to 4089.34 points this morning, a gain of 1.5%. HSBC shares opened over 2% higher at 449.75p and later traded up 4.7% at 455p, after the banking giant secured almost universal support from shareholders for its record-breaking \u00a312.5bn rights issue. Stockmarkets across Asia were also up. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index posted the biggest gains, rising 2.3% to 14883.72. Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei closed 1.24% higher at 8857.93. Japanese exporters including Panasonic and Nissan rose after the dollar climbed above \u00a5100 for the first time in months. The global rally is now in its fifth week as greater optimism about the world economy has increased traders&apos; appetite for risk. The trillion dollar deal agreed at last week&apos;s G20 summit spurred hopes of a global recovery, and markets shrugged off Friday&apos;s gloomy US jobs data. Optimism was boosted by comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that the central bank would do everything it could to stabilise the financial sector. Wall Street ended higher on Friday to record its fourth consecutive week of gains - its best four week performance since 1933. The Dow Jones closed to its best level since early February. &quot;Is it the start of a bull rally? It is probably too early to say, but there is certainly a better appetite for risk than we have seen for some time,&quot; said David Buik at BGC Partners. &quot;Markets tend to recover before the economy but despite the green shoots of recovery being either hallucinations for some or wildly embryonic for others, there are likely to be some serious setbacks along the way, leaving investors challenging the recovery of the economy. Equities are likely to bob around like a cork in a bath for the next 3 months. However the last quarter of 2009 may well see a recognisable rally.&quot; Oil prices rose more than $1 to above $53 a barrel this morning. US light crude for May delivery hit $53.59 while London Brent Crude rose to $54.18 a barrel. However, some analysts warned that the rally could be overdone. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt that there&apos;s been some improvement in the global outlook, but not enough to justify what&apos;s going on in the markets,&quot; said Tim Rocks, of Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. &quot;Many people have been buying out of fear rather than conviction, and eventually the true degree of the difficulties the world is facing will reassert itself and markets will go back down.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;China and Russia share the concern that this is a threat to the region, but they appear reserved and cautious as of now,&quot; he told reporters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Barack Obama", "United Nations", "US news", "Japan", "China", "Russia", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-06T08:47:55Z", "title": "Divisions emerge in international response to North Korean rocket launch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/06/north-korea-rocket-launch", "article": "The US president, Barack Obama, was today struggling to coordinate an international response to North Korea&apos;s launch of a rocket over Japan yesterday. As the UN security council entered a second day of emergency deliberations, differences have emerged over whether to impose punitive measures in retaliation for the launch. The Taepodong-2 rocket flew twice as far as any previous North Korean missile. Although Obama described the action as a &quot;provocation&quot;, the US and Japan have so far failed to win support from China and Russia for a statement condemning Pyongyang and tightening existing sanctions. The Japanese foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone, today admitted there were divisions in the security council. &quot;China and Russia share the concern that this is a threat to the region, but they appear reserved and cautious as of now,&quot; he told reporters in Tokyo. Japan called the emergency session soon after the long-range rocket soared over its airspace yesterday morning. Air defence forces were put on standby as the first stage fell in waters off the country&apos;s west coast and the second plunged into the Pacific Ocean east of the archipelago. According to the South Korean Chosun Ilbo newspaper, the range of the rocket was double that achieved in North Korea&apos;s previous Taepodong-2 missile test, carried out in 1998. Citing South Korean and US intelligence authorities, the paper reported that the rocket&apos;s second stage landed in waters about 1,984 miles (3,200km) from the Musudan-ri launch site. The North Korean ambassador to the UN, Shin Son Ho, told reporters in New York: &quot;We are happy. Very, very successful. You should congratulate us.&quot; North Korea claimed the Taepodong-2 rocket put an experimental communications satellite into orbit, where it is collecting data and broadcasting the Song of General Kim Il-Sung and the Song of General Kim Jong-il. But US, South Korean and Japanese scientists say the only broadcasts are likely to be from the bottom of the ocean because the satellite failed to reach orbit. The advance in North Korea&apos;s ballistic missile technology will raise concerns that the country could one day be capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the US or western Europe. It is likely to interest potential buyers from Pakistan, Iran and Syria, who have sent observers to previous launches. Analysts suggested the move may also have been intended to grab Obama&apos;s attention. The White House, Nato and the EU insisted Pyongyang&apos;s action should not go unpunished. &quot;Now is the time for a strong international response and North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through illegal weapons,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Rules must be binding, violations must be punished, words must mean something.&quot; So far, however, the US and its allies have been unable to persuade China and Russia that the act was a breach of UN security council resolution 1718, passed after long-range missile and nuclear tests in 2006. The resolution bans Pyongyang from activities related to a ballistic missile programme and calls on the international community to stop trading weapons and luxury goods with North Korea. US officials believe these sanctions have not been stringently applied. China, a historical ally of and food supplier to North Korea, has called on all sides to remain calm. &quot;Our position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking action that might lead to increased tension,&quot; Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador to the UN, told reporters. Russia described the North Korean rocket launch as &quot;regrettable&quot;, but stopped short of confirming whether the launch had violated existing resolutions. &quot;Before embarking on any actions, we should understand the character of this launch because, at this particular moment, we do not have a clearcut picture,&quot; Igor Scherbak, the deputy Russian permanent UN representative, said. In contrast to previous occasions, Pyongyang had notified agencies such as the International Maritime Organisation that it would launch the rocket between 4 and 8 April. The launch cast a cloud over a speech on international security delivered by Obama in Prague, during which he unveiled a range of measures aimed at stemming the spread of nuclear weapons."}, {"sentences": ["The best opening for the series yet, it also represented an enormous leap from the franchise&apos;s last film, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, which opened with $23.9m in 2006."], "tags": ["Action and adventure", "Film", "Culture", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-06T10:35:02Z", "title": "Fast & Furious zooms to US No 1 with biggest ever April opening", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/06/fast-and-furious-vin-diesel-michelle-rodriguez", "article": "American cinemagoers have apparently not lost their appetite for daredevil racers and their pumped-up cars \u2013 Fast &amp; Furious, a retooled fourth outing for The Fast and the Furious franchise (not the subtle titular difference) zoomed to the top of the US box office this weekend, breaking records in the process. The film, which reunites the cast of the 2001 movie for the first time, defied critics and industry expectations to rake in a phenomenal $72.5m (\u00a348.7m), the highest ever total for a film released in April. Intriguingly, its success appears to have been overwhelmingly based on support from Hispanic audiences, who turned out in droves to see a film whose opening scenes take place in the Dominican Republic and features Latina actors Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. Box-office tracking suggests a remarkable 46% of the audience was Hispanic. The movie also features the return of Vin Diesel, who walked out of the franchise after the first film, reprising his musclebound road warrior role opposite Paul Walker&apos;s undercover cop.

Our decision is to sell into strength now.&quot; Soros stressed that restoring health to the &quot;basically insolvent&quot; banking system and the housing market is key to any recovery. The public-private investment funds introduced to rid US banks of bad debts will work but won&apos;t be enough to recapitalise the banks so they can start lending again, he said. &quot;What we have created now is a situation where the banks will be able to earn their way out of a hole but by doing that, they are going to weigh on the economy,&quot; Soros said. &quot;Instead of stimulating the economy, they will draw the lifeblood, so to speak, of profits away from the real economy in order to keep themselves alive.&quot; Analysts agreed that the financial system remains a problem and thought recent optimism that the worst may be over was overdone. &quot;The market&apos;s stance on banks had been too optimistic recently,&quot; said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi Securities in Tokyo. &quot;Some large US banks have already passed stress tests, but others haven&apos;t, and given that results are coming up soon, this simply reignited investor uncertainty.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["A recent post directed us to previously.bitten&apos;s 10 offbeat experiences in Tokyo, featuring a wander through the alleys of Shibuya (where the Love Hotels are situated), and the world&apos;s largest Buddhas in Kamakura."], "tags": ["Travel websites", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T08:54:00Z", "title": "Weekly travelinks: Guardian Travel's weekly round-up of blogs, videos, images and general travel miscellany", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/07/travel-websites-china-tibet-australia-tokyo", "article": "Welcome to round three of our new series of weekly travelinks, a collection of travel miscellany that we find interesting, amusing or just want to share - new blog posts, images, hotels, festivals, people, videos and other bits and bobs.

As leader of a yakuza \u2013 or Japanese mafia \u2013 gang, Goto amassed a fortune from prostitution, protection rackets and white-collar crime, while cultivating a reputation for extreme violence. Tomorrow, his life will take a decidedly austere turn when he begins training at a temple in Kanagawa prefecture south of Tokyo, the Sankei Shimbun newspaper said today, citing police sources. The 66-year-old, whose eponymous gang belonged to the powerful Yamaguchi-gumi crime syndicate, was expelled from the yakuza fraternity last October after a furious row with his bosses over his conduct. Known as Japan&apos;s answer to John Gotti, the infamous mafia don, Goto reportedly upset his seniors amid media reports that he had invited several celebrities to join his lavish birthday celebrations last September. Several months earlier he had attracted more unwanted publicity following revelations that he had offered information to the FBI in return for permission to enter the US for a life-saving liver transplant in 2001. At an emergency meeting last October the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s bosses \u2013 minus their leader, Shinobu Tsukasa, who is serving a six-year prison term for illegal arms possession \u2013 expelled Goto, splitting his gang into rival factions. According to the Sankei, Goto will formally join the priesthood on 8 April \u2013 considered to be Buddha&apos;s birthday in Japan \u2013 in a private ceremony. The former gangster was quoted as describing the occasion as &quot;solemn and meaningful, in which Buddha will make me his disciple and enable me to start a new life&quot;. In his deal with the FBI, Goto reportedly gave up vital information about yakuza front companies, as well as the names of senior crime figures and the mob&apos;s links to North Korea. Underworld experts have pointed out, however, that the bureau could have gleaned the same information from yakuza fanzines. Goto&apos;s transplant was performed at UCLA medical centre in Los Angeles In the spring of 2001 by the respected surgeon Dr Ronald W Busuttil, using the liver of a 16-year-old boy who had died in a traffic accident. The grateful don, who was suffering from liver disease, later donated $100,000 (\u00a368,000) to the hospital, his generosity commemorated in a plaque that reads: &quot;In grateful recognition of the Goto Research Fund established through the generosity of Mr Tadamasa Goto.&quot; Jake Adelstein, a former crime reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, received death threats before he went public with the transplant story last spring, and has been living under police protection ever since. When it was assigned to cultivate the Tokyo area in the late 1980s, the Goto-gumi stuck to what it knew best: drugs, human trafficking and extortion, before new anti-gang laws forced it to move in to more lucrative areas such as real estate and the stockmarket. At the height of their powers, Goto&apos;s henchmen were capable of unspeakable acts of violence, including bulldozing businesses that refused to pay protection money and administering beatings to victims in front of their families, reports said. A 1999 leaked police file noted that &quot;in order to achieve his goals, [Goto] uses any and all means necessary or possible. He also uses a carrot-and-stick approach to keep his soldiers in line. His group is capable of extremely violent and aggressive acts&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Across Asia, stockmarkets were down, with Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei losing 2.7% to 8595.01 and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng 3.9% lower at 14,354.84."], "tags": ["Recession", "Job losses", "Business", "UK news", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-08T08:10:57Z", "title": "Recession: Latest surveys point to bleak outlook for Britain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/08/uk-economic-gloom-recession", "article": "The British economy could continue on its downward path for another year and take a further two years to return to its pre-recession level, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned today.

The FTSE 100 index in London dropped about 30 points to 3898.90 in early trading and investors were also braced for a poor round of US company results. Across Asia, stockmarkets were down, with Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei losing 2.7% to 8595.01 and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng 3.9% lower at 14,354.84. Experts ranging from Morgan Stanley&apos;s strategy team to billionaire investor George Soros have warned that the recent rise in global stockmarkets is a bear market rally because the economic turnaround is yet to come. The NIESR estimates the UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of the year, following the previous quarter&apos;s 1.6% decline - the biggest since 1980. The think tank said the rate of contraction seen in the current recession was &quot;very similar&quot; to the slowdown at the beginning of the 1980s. &quot;If the 1980s profile were followed, output would continue to decline for up to another year and it would take two further years before the level of output enjoyed at the start of 2008 would be reached again,&quot; it said. Official figures yesterday showed a sharp decline in industrial production after a collapse in world trade, which City economists said suggested another big fall in GDP in the first quarter of this year. Consumer confidence slipped last month as people worried about rising job losses, a survey from Nationwide building society showed today. And, according to a worldwide poll, economic confidence is lower in Britain than in any other leading country. Unemployment in the UK recently hit 2 million for the first time since 1997, and is set to climb to 3.2 million next year. Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday angered unions and politicians with plans to cut up to 4,500 staff in Britain - just days after its boss denied staff were at risk. A report from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation/KPMG today also painted a gloomy picture of the labour market. It showed a slight easing in the decline in the number of permanent jobs available in the UK, but full-time placements have been falling for a year and analysts see little sign of a strong recovery yet. While the permanent placements measure rose to 33.5 in March from 30.3 in February, that was still well below the 50 level that indicates growth. &quot;These latest figures leave no doubt that the UK jobs market is at its worst in the 11-year history of the survey and recovery might take longer and be more protracted than many hope,&quot; said Mike Stevens, partner and head of business services at KPMG."}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo development team has apparently, &quot;collated feedback on the series&apos; strengths and weaknesses via fan forums, both ardent and casual PES players and press comment, and has incorporated a wide range of requests in the new game&quot;.", "AIFrom the release: &quot;The Tokyo team has worked to improve the AI of the game, with Teamvision 2.0 implemented.", "The release ends with an interesting quote from Jon Murphy, PES European Team Leader: &quot;The preparations for PES 2010 have been in place for some time now, with the reorganization and increase of the Tokyo-based studio allowing expert teams to concentrate on their particular area."], "tags": ["Technology", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "Mobile"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-08T09:18:02Z", "title": "PES 2010 - the fight back begins here?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/apr/08/playstation-xbox", "article": "Konami has put out a press release about PES 2010, due out in the autumn on PlayStation 3, PS2, Xbox 360, PSP and mobile phone.

Match-Day AtmosphereMore varied crowd reactions to the action, including lots of chants and cheers. The game is also looking to replicate the differences between home and away fixtures. I&apos;m not sure how this will be conveyed by the crowd though, perhaps the stadia will have authentic away enclosures so if your team scores, only a fraction of the crowd will react. Commentary is also being updated to offer a &quot;fresher, more concise overview of the game&quot;. AIFrom the release: &quot;The Tokyo team has worked to improve the AI of the game, with Teamvision 2.0 implemented. Midfielders and defenders now work together to cover open space and close down attacks, meaning that cover can be provided for lower-ranked defenders. This also has the additional effect of removing soft goals, thus returning PES 2010 to its simulation roots. In terms of attacking, players can also now move several players once, sending them into different areas, opening up more goal-scoring possibilities than ever before&quot;.  Hmm, that last bit sounds a little like FIFA 08s abortive off-the-ball controls. Apparently you&apos;ll also be able to set off attacker runs in response to set-pieces - so free kicks might be a little more tactical than just kicking hte ball and crossing you fingers. Individual player skills&quot;In previous PES games, the team formation has determined the movements of the players. PES 2010 introduces a new system wherein the individual attacking and defending nature of the players is integral to the way they play. Each player enjoys unique AI tied into their best abilities, and is reflected in the actions of their team mates&quot;. So if you have a good crosser running down the wing, more players will flood the penalty area in anticipation. Other stuffMore pre-match strategic options (&quot;pass frequency, movement, the line of defence, width of play, or the position of the front line&quot;); a new penalty system offering greater control and accuracy; lots more DLC with regular team and content updates; the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence...

We are now in a better position to implement the greatest raft of changes and improvements to the series we have seen, and thank the PES community for their input.&quot; The suggestion is, this iteration has been in development for significantly longer than the year or so since Pro Evo 2009.

The prime minister wanted new government spending to exceed 2% of GDP because of &quot;the extent of the fall in Japanese economic output recently, which is larger than other advanced economies, and also given the need for international co-operation to revive the world economy&quot;. Japan has slipped further into recession this year as global demand for its cars and electronics has plunged. The package is designed to help contract workers and small businesses with tax cuts and credit guarantees; boost regional economies; expand green technologies, and support elderly care. The government also said it would implement &quot;bold&quot; reforms and direct public and private-sector investment into three areas of focus: creating the world&apos;s leading low-carbon society; strengthening nursing and medical services, and boosting tourism and cultural activities, including the arts. It will also encourage the start of mass production of electric cars in three years and boost solar power generation to 20 times the current level of 1.42m kilowatts. The government also plans to subsidise salaries of workers at nursing homes, aiming to create 300,000 jobs in the next three years, to add to the current 1.3m. The stimulus package also includes a car scrappage scheme similar to the &quot;cash for clunkers&quot; programme being debated in the US Congress. Japan, home to several of the world&apos;s biggest carmakers, is considering giving \u00a5250,000 to consumers who trade in a car 13 years or older for a more fuel-efficient model. Such schemes already exist in a dozen European countries and have boosted car sales. Britain&apos;s ailing motor industry has called on the government to introduce a similar incentive in this month&apos;s budget. Last month, Japan&apos;s parliament passed a record \u00a588.5tn budget for the new fiscal year, which started on 1 April, including parts of Aso&apos;s two previous stimulus packages. Officials have not said where they would find the extra money, though Aso recently said he would turn to issuing bonds if needed. Japan&apos;s public debt already stands at 170% of gross domestic product\u201a the highest level among industrialised economies."}, {"sentences": ["The news prompted a stockmarket rally and sent the Nikkei index in Tokyo soaring by 3.7% to 8916.06."], "tags": ["Japan", "Automotive industry", "Travel and transport", "World news", "Business", "Environment", "Solar power", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-09T23:01:00Z", "title": "Japan goes green with \u00a3100bn economic recovery", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/10/japan-recession-stimulus-green-economy", "article": "Japan today announced a \u00a515tn (\u00a3102bn) stimulus package that focuses on boosting the green economy in an attempt to drag the country out of its worst recession since the second world war. The total is a substantial increase from the \u00a368bn package announced by the prime minister, Taro Aso, on Monday, and is likely to top \u00a556tn when other measures such as tax cuts and credit guarantees are included. Announcing the stimulus plan in a televised speech, Aso said: &quot;Japan&apos;s economy is worsening rapidly with exports and production tumbling. Job conditions are also deteriorating sharply. Japan&apos;s economy can be described as being in a crisis.&quot;  In addition to pledging more loans for hard-pressed small businesses and cash for job creation, it will also encourage the start of mass production of electric cars in three years and boost solar power generation to 20 times the current level of 1.42m kilowatts. &quot;I want to show that Japan&apos;s future is not all that dark if we follow this vision,&quot; Aso said. &quot;If you just read the newspapers, it seems like tomorrow will be completely gloomy. But this is not the case. There is some light.&quot; The stimulus package also includes a car scrappage scheme similar to the &quot;cash for clunkers&quot; programme being debated in the US Congress. Motorists will be eligible for between \u00a5100,000 and \u00a5250,000 in subsidies if they trade in cars that are more than 13 years old for a hybrid or other environment-friendly vehicle. Though details have yet to be released, the measures could result in new car sales of between 450,000 to 1.51m, according to the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. Together with the introduction of lower taxes on clean-energy cars, consumers replacing an old vehicle for, say, a new Toyota Prius hybrid could make savings of about US$4,000. The news prompted a stockmarket rally and sent the Nikkei index in Tokyo soaring by 3.7% to 8916.06. Shares in Toyota, maker of the Prius hybrid, rose 4.3%, while those of Sharp, the world&apos;s second-largest maker of solar cells, surged 10.7%. However, analysts said that if the latest stimulus works, the resulting boost in demand for carbon-fuelled electricity could negate any advances made by the wider use of green cars. The country is only just beginning to address its poor track record on green spending. While industry, the biggest polluter, has been left to aim for voluntary targets, the onus is now on individual householders and businesses to spearhead Japan&apos;s version of the Green New Deal. Until now Japan has set aside only 2.6% of total spending for climate change measures, compared with 12% in the US and 34% in China, an HSBC report said. Some analysts doubted that the envisaged shift to fuel-efficient cars would have much of an impact on Japan&apos;s attempts to meet its Kyoto protocol targets. The country&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions rose 2.3% last year, putting them at 16% above the target it has committed itself to achieving by 2013. &quot;I don&apos;t think the stimulus will make any notable contribution to Japan&apos;s emission cuts,&quot; said Itsuho Haruta of Natsource Japan, adding that the package would make only a tiny contribution to the fall in emissions expected as a result of plunging industrial output. The government also plans to revive the use of solar energy by expanding a scheme in which power companies - traditionally reluctant to boost their use of renewables - will buy more surplus energy generated by households equipped with solar panels. It will also set up solar power generators at 37,000 schools and introduce heat-insulating materials and other energy-saving measures in 3m buildings over the next three years. The measures - which are equivalent to 3% of the country&apos;s GDP - were approved by the ruling Liberal Democratic party&apos;s executive council. The government is expected to approve the proposals today. Officials have not said where they would find the extra money, though Aso recently said he would turn to issuing bonds if needed.

North Korea says Sunday&apos;s launch was to send a satellite into orbit, but Japan and allies call it a cover for a missile test. Japan&apos;s cabinet reauthorised and ramped up economic sanctions imposed on the isolated country since a 2006 missile test, by lowering the cap on remittances that must be reported and reducing the amount of money visitors can carry into the North, chief cabinet secretary Takeo Kawamura announced. The old sanctions, which must be renewed every six months, expire on Monday. The latest renewal is good for one year. &quot;North Korea forced a missile firing, the act that our country finds intolerable,&quot; Kawamura told a news conference. &quot;The additional steps are aimed at monitoring the money flow into the North more closely.&quot; The new measures will reduce the amount of remittances to North Korea subject to reporting to the Japanese government to 10m yen (\u00a368,000) from 30m yen, and slash the amount of money that travellers can bring into the North by more than one-third to 300,000 yen. The measures today also renew an import ban and tight restrictions on exports to the North, as well as a ban on selling luxury goods to North Korea, including pricey beef, caviar, alcohol and cars, in accordance with a UN resolution. Ruling politicians hoped for a ban on all exports, but that did not make the list today, apparently because its expected impact is limited, Kyodo News agency reported. North Korea, one of the world&apos;s poorest countries, is in desperate need of outside help, particularly since aid that flowed in unconditionally from neighbouring South Korea for a decade dried up after president Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul in 2008. Famine is believed to have killed as many as 2 million North Koreans in the mid and late-1990s when natural disasters and mismanagement devastated its centrally controlled economy. The North has since relied on aid to help feed its 23 million people. However, with trade between the two countries already restricted sharply, additional measures are believed to have little impact on the North and are seen rather as a political tool. Japan had readied missile interceptors both on land an off its north-western coast on Sunday but did not fire them because no debris appeared to fall toward its territory. Japan instead requested an emergency session of the security council to call for a stern response to the launch, but the debate has stalled, with North Korea&apos;s close allies China and Russia calling for restraint. Sunday&apos;s launch has also triggered debate among some ruling lawmakers that Japan should consider a possibility of pre-emptive strike on North Korean missile facilities."}, {"sentences": ["Manga fans lined the streets to support Aso&apos;s bid for the Liberal Democratic party leadership last autumn, and novelty goods bearing his likeness continue to sell well in Tokyo&apos;s &quot;otaku&quot; (geek) district of Akihabara.", "Sazae-san, a comic strip about a typical Tokyo family that first appeared in 1946, moved to the small screen in 1969 to become the longest-running animated programme of all time."], "tags": ["Japan", "Comics and graphic novels", "Global recession", "Global economy", "Culture", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Anime", "Manga"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-10T14:24:35Z", "title": "Japan looks to manga comics to rescue ailing economy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/10/japan-manga-anime-recession", "article": "While other countries bail out banks, slash interest rates and prop up struggling industries, Japan is pinning its hopes for economic recovery on a less likely source: manga comic books. As part of 15 trillion yen of fresh stimulus measures unveiled today, Japan hopes to raise the percentage of its exports of &quot;soft power&quot; - manga, animated films, video games and pop music - from 2% of the total to 18% over the next decade, creating half a million jobs. &quot;Japanese content, such as anime and video games, and fashion draw attention from consumers around the world,&quot; the prime minister, Taro Aso - a self-confessed manga addict - told reporters this week as he waved copies of magazines from China and Taiwan featuring Japanese pop stars on their covers. &quot;Unfortunately, this soft power is not being linked to business overseas. By linking the popularity of Japan&apos;s soft power to business, I want to create a 20-30 trillion-yen market by 2020 and create 500,000 new jobs.&quot; Cynics will view the manga drive as a crafty election ploy as Aso, who keeps a supply of his favourite titles on the back seat of his official car, attempts to build on a boost in his support following the North Korea&apos;s rocket launch and the arrest of a senior aide to the main opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa. Manga fans lined the streets to support Aso&apos;s bid for the Liberal Democratic party leadership last autumn, and novelty goods bearing his likeness continue to sell well in Tokyo&apos;s &quot;otaku&quot; (geek) district of Akihabara. The cultural affairs agency has reportedly requested 12 billion yen to create a national centre for media art that would promote Japanese pop culture overseas. The manga genre encompasses every possible theme, from tales involving lovable characters for children, to historical and political themes, sports and pornography. Many of the most popular titles are turned into hit TV series and films. Sazae-san, a comic strip about a typical Tokyo family that first appeared in 1946, moved to the small screen in 1969 to become the longest-running animated programme of all time. It still airs every Sunday evening. &quot;Manga used to be regarded as something for children until they were around 15,&quot; manga critic Haruyuki Nakano told Kyodo News last month on the 50th anniversary of two of Japan&apos;s pioneering weekly manga titles. &quot;But baby boomers in postwar Japan kept reading their favorite manga even after they entered college and became adults. That helped make manga widespread in Japanese culture,&quot; Nakano said. While translated Japanese manga are proving popular in the US market, sales at home have been hit by the spread of game consoles and online comics, and the dramatic growth of titles that can be read on mobile phone handsets. The traditional manga market was worth just over 400 billion yen in 2007, down from around 580 billion yen a decade earlier, while sales of e-manga are forecast to rise to over 70 billion yen by 2012."}, {"sentences": ["Gregory was arrested in 1993 after attempting to smuggle heroin from Thailand to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Discrimination at work", "Work & careers", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-10T23:01:00Z", "title": "Hazel Davis talks to people with a notorious past who found redemption in the workplace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/apr/11/discrimination-at-work-notorious", "article": "Going to work to the sound of flashbulbs might sound like the life of a megastar but for some people, life in the public eye is anything but glamorous. When most of us enter a new workplace, at best we might agonise about how soon to reveal that enormous tattoo on our ankle or whether to disclose that we once appeared on Cash in the Attic. If we&apos;re lucky, we can even get away with inventing a whole new persona which will see us through our career.  But for some workers, their entire history is an open book as soon as they accept the job offer.  For 43-year-old Sandra Gregory from Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire, there is no reinventing the past.  Gregory was arrested in 1993 after attempting to smuggle heroin from Thailand to Tokyo. Originally sentenced to 25 years in jail, she spent four years in Thailand&apos;s Lard Yao prison, known as the Bangkok Hilton, before being repatriated and pardoned by the king of Thailand in 2000. Her story attracted huge media attention nationwide and her name and face became well-known.  Gregory was released in 2001. &quot;I came home and realised I didn&apos;t have a life,&quot; she says. &quot;Nothing to do, no money, no structure. I had no proper qualifications.&quot;  However, she had nearly completed an Open University degree and, after an 18-month break, went to Oxford University as a mature student. Gregory didn&apos;t disclose her background on her application, merely saying that she had been in Thailand. &quot;They did know, obviously,&quot; she says. &quot;But once I got there my tutor said, &apos;Let&apos;s just leave that behind&apos;.&quot; Now an articulate, enthusiastic and well-educated woman (with a 2:1 from Oxford and considerable teaching experience), it would seem that doors would open for her.  But, says Gregory, &quot;I sent 70 job application letters and got two interviews.&quot;  One of those interviews involved having a long chat with the managing director of a high-profile company, whereby she talked in detail about her experiences in Thailand. He told her she didn&apos;t have the job - but he had enjoyed hearing about what had happened to her. &quot;I honestly think he just enjoyed the gossip,&quot; she laughs.  Now Gregory works for Suma, the UK&apos;s largest independent wholefood wholesaler-distributor, based in West Yorkshire.  But her reputation preceded her. &quot;I know that when I got the job at Suma, some people weren&apos;t too happy about me joining and sent emails to that effect,&quot; she says. &quot;When I started, there was a fair bit of nudging and saying &apos;that&apos;s her&apos;. Sometimes people at work would say, &apos;I saw you on the telly,&apos; and I&apos;d think &apos;Yeah ... um you&apos;ll have to say something else too.&apos; I don&apos;t mind talking about it at all but I do mind if it doesn&apos;t have a purpose.&quot; Being part of a co-operative means Gregory is expected to be involved in all aspects of the company. &quot;We had the official photograph done about a year ago and I somehow didn&apos;t feel it was right to be in it. But ironically, I now work as a sales rep, representing the company with my face and name,&quot; she laughs. Gregory feels she is accepted now. But, she says: &quot;I did feel for ages that everyone hated me for what I had done. I don&apos;t think I could have worked harder but most people know me for who I am now. I would hope that people look at me and judge me by my performance.&quot; Rachel Brushfield, a career strategist who runs Energise Brand Communications, thinks the move might even be a positive one for Gregory&apos;s employers. &quot;Employing someone who has made a large and very public mistake and who demonstrates that they have learnt from it sends out a positive message to current employees and future talent. A company culture where considered and monitored risk, combined with good values and systems to support and monitor entrepreneurial spirit will help many companies thrive in the recession.&quot;  University lecturer Shaun Russell hit the headlines in 1996 when his wife and six-year-old daughter were murdered and his nine-year-old daughter Josie severely injured.  Russell says: &quot;We became the subject of intense media interest for several years, through the period when the attacker was being sought by police, his trial, appeal and re-trial and the inquiry into his prior treatment by the authorities. On the advice of police and lawyers I co-operated closely with the media, and Josie became something of a national &apos;celebrity&apos;.&quot;  Russell took six weeks off work while Josie recovered. He then returned part-time to his old job at the University of Kent. His colleagues, says Russell, treated him with &quot;great kindness, sympathy and generosity&quot;. But on occasion the pressure of that goodwill became too much.  Russell says: &quot;Sometimes I found myself having to &apos;support&apos; my more neurotic and overwrought colleagues, a couple of whom showed an irritating and sycophantic interest in mine and my daughter&apos;s experience and notoriety. People were uncertain about how to deal with me after the attacks. Some were worried that any expression of their sympathy would seem inadequate. Others were simply sensitive to the great pressures on me while I was trying to re-build mine and Josie&apos;s lives, as well as handling the intense public interest in the case.&quot; Russell eventually moved to north Wales and, after bit of contract work, took up a post at the University of Wales, Bangor. &quot;Due to the national profile and notoriety of our case, just about everybody knew about it,&quot; he says. &quot;It may have made it easier for me to get work, possibly because I was now better known and attracted a degree of sympathy. After a while, I found myself having again to relate my inside story to intrigued and fascinated - though generally sympathetic - colleagues.&quot;  Like Gregory, Russell worked harder in a bid to move on from the tragedy that had struck his family: &quot;My need to put the terrible events behind us led to me putting extra effort into rebuilding my career - such as working evenings, weekends and holidays on projects in order to compensate for time taken off to work with the police and the media. &quot;I doubled my efforts at work to deflect any possible criticism and, in fact, several of the contacts that Josie and I made through media exposure resulted in benefits for mine and my colleagues&apos; work, such as donations for research projects and student scholarships.&quot; Wolverhampton Nursery nurse Lisa Potts relinquished her anonymity in July 1996 when she dramatically saved the children in her care from an armed assailant. She was attacked with a machete and severely injured but won the George Medal - and several other awards - for her efforts. After the attack, Potts took six months off to recover. She returned to her old job but found it difficult.  &quot;The media interest was huge and the press [were] at the school a lot,&quot; says Potts. &quot;I had become a celebrity even though I hadn&apos;t asked to be one and that was really hard. I felt in a way I was hindering the school by being there.&quot; After writing her life story, publishing a children&apos;s prayer book and undertaking some speaking engagements, Potts decided to go back to college to study counselling and then applied for a job with a teenage pregnancy unit. &quot;That was pretty scary,&quot; she says. &quot;Where do you say you&apos;ve been for the last five years? What do you write in the box?&quot;  Shortly after, Potts married, moved house, went to work for Sure Start as a counsellor and set up her own children&apos;s charity, Believe 2 Achieve. &quot;Everybody was really quiet when I walked in and obviously they knew who I was,&quot; she says. &quot;Within a week I had no choice but to start talking about it and cracking jokes. Then it was OK, but for a while nobody knew what to say to me.&quot; But Potts says she got sick of always being known as &quot;the Machete Heroine&quot;.  &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be known by one moment of my life,&quot; she says. &quot;And that was hard to shake off.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["That was where he earned his nickname, as the \u00adJapanese fans thought the combination of Tokyo Verdy&apos;s green strip, the striker&apos;s \u00admuscular build and his passing facial resemblance to the actor and bodybuilder Lou \u00adFerrigno (who played the comic book hero in the 1970s television series) was irresistible."], "tags": ["Porto", "Champions League", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-11T23:00:48Z", "title": "Manchester United need to be aware that Porto's young Hulk is not so green", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/12/hulk-porto-champions-league-manchester-united", "article": "When footballers used to come in all shapes and sizes it was possible to have a decent stab at who played in which \u00adposition just by looking at the line-up. Spot the portly little full-back; the wafer-thin winger; the outhouse centre-\u00adforward with his nimble sidekick. Modern football puts so much \u00ademphasis on athleticism, it is \u00adincreasingly rare to find top players whose physical shape deviates too dramatically from the six\u2011foot, six\u2011pack competitor. And when they do crop up, there is always the likelihood of Peter Crouch syndrome. People need persuading that footballers who are not built to look the part can play the part. So it was that when Givanildo Vieira de Souza introduced himself to an English audience, with a substitute&apos;s appearance at Emirates Stadium in the early stages of the Champions League back in the autumn, 60,000 people chuckled at the incongruity of it all. Porto&apos;s No12, a beefcake of a centre-forward with the suggestive name of &apos;Hulk&apos; on his back, looked lumbering and clumsy rather than powerful and terrifying. When that same player charged up the pitch at Old Trafford a couple of minutes into last week&apos;s thrilling \u00adquarter-final, thumping in a shot that \u00adencapsulated Porto&apos;s new spirit of vibrancy and intent, his evolution into a talent to be taken \u00adseriously took another impressive bound. He is still raw \u2013 that bold willingness to just get the ball and thunder towards goal is certainly part of the attraction \u2013 but the 22-year-old has already made enough progress for Dunga, the Brazil coach, to take notice. In Portugal there is a rich \u00adtradition of importing obscure Brazilians and \u00admoulding them into glittering \u00adperformers. In recent years Porto have reaped tremendous benefits. Mario Jardel in his pomp during the late 1990s was one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe, racking up an astonishing 130 goals in 125 league appearances. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s 2004 Champions League winners were indebted to a new generation of imports \u2013 the Brazilian-born Deco pulled the strings, Derlei was a prolific scorer and Carlos Alberto was a youngster of considerable promise who scored with a swivelling volley in the final against Monaco. Hulk arrived at the Estadio de Dragao last summer for \u00a46m (\u00a35.4m), having come to the attention of Porto&apos;s scouts because of his fantastic goalscoring feats in the J-League. That was where he earned his nickname, as the \u00adJapanese fans thought the combination of Tokyo Verdy&apos;s green strip, the striker&apos;s \u00admuscular build and his passing facial resemblance to the actor and bodybuilder Lou \u00adFerrigno (who played the comic book hero in the 1970s television series) was irresistible. Porto&apos;s coach, Jesualdo \u00adFerreira, used the newcomer cautiously to start with, offering him one start in each of the and Champions League before December, but a decision to make Hulk a \u00adregular, as part of a South \u00adAmerican \u00adattacking trio alongside \u00adCristian \u00adRodriguez and \u00adLisandro Lopez, \u00adcoincided with an upsurge in the team&apos;s form. He is fast, brave, has a hammer of a left foot and has shown the hunger to score scruffy goals as well as \u00adspectacular. Ferreira believes there is far more to come. &quot;Hulk is not the finished article,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;He&apos;s a long way from being so as he&apos;s just starting, and he&apos;s aware of that. But he has enormous potential. I hope he&apos;s going to become one of the best in the world in his position. If he has luck, he has the mentality to do it.&quot; Recent displays have led to comparisons with his boyhood hero. &quot;Ronaldo is my idol,&quot; said Hulk. &quot;He&apos;s the best player I&apos;ve ever seen play. He&apos;s an \u00adinspiration to me to work hard every day.&quot; Sir Alex Ferguson has been impressed enough with him express surprise that he has not yet been capped by his country. Hulk is one of three Brazilians in Porto&apos;s \u00adcurrent squad, alongside goalkeeper Helton and midfield anchor \u00adFernando, who made a big statement in the Champions League first leg at Old Trafford with a man-of-the-match display. While Hulk&apos;s future is brimming with possibility, he does not need to look far into the history of Porto to discover some cautionary tales. Carlos Alberto is only 24, but his career has foundered. Since leaving Portugal he has been on the books of six different clubs in three years, was shunted around on loan, encountered disciplinary problems and is not far away from the obscurity he came from. As for Jardel, his career hit the skids with an ill-starred move to Bolton Wanderers. From there he tried his luck in Italy, Argentina, Spain, Cyprus and Australia \u2013 sinking from the high standards of his Porto hey-day as his weight spiralled upwards. He was last seen back where it all began for him, at his tiny local club, Ferroviario. For Hulk, still on the rise, this is a time for optimism. Among other aspirations, he is keen to find the net in the \u00adChampions League. Sir Alex Ferguson noted that Manchester United are &quot;good at firsts&quot; when he was told that Porto have not lost to British opposition at their home stadium. He had better hope that Hulk is not in the mood for a first of his own on Wednesday night. &quot;I am,&quot; he notes, &quot;enjoying my best form of the season.&quot; While Porto can afford to draw 0-0 or 1-1 to progress to a semi-final against either Arsenal or Villarreal, something tells you it is not in their nature to play a careful game. They are unrecognisable from the shambles that surrendered so meekly at Emirates last September, \u00adlosing 4-0 and provoking Ferreira to predict: &quot;In the next few months we will have to be a strong team.&quot; And how they have responded."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo is the world capital of fine chocolate.", "Chocolat de H, Roppongi Hills, Tokyo; roppongihills.com/en William Curley, Owner of William Curley Chocolate Shop, Richmond, Surrey When I was a pastry chef at La Tante Claire in London, I used to head to Paris whenever possible and wander the streets gazing through the windows of the patissiers, which is when I first discovered Jean-Paul H\u00e9vin&apos;s shop."], "tags": ["Food and drink", "Travel", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Chocolate"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-11T23:01:00Z", "title": "The expert panel: Where can you buy the world's best chocolate?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/apr/12/chocolate-william-curley-burdick-guido-gobino", "article": "Willie Harcourt-Cooze, chocolate producer and author of Willie&apos;s Chocolate Factory Cookbook With chocolate, you either compromise on flavour for shelf life or you go for quality.

Peter Zumthor is an architect&apos;s architect: he is hugely admired within the profession as a designer of precision and integrity and a master craftsman working in a range of materials from sandblasted glass to cedar shingles. The Pritzker award, announced yesterday, will earn him $100,000 (\u00a367,500) in prize money but, more importantly, will help broadcast his work to a wider audience. The prize is widely regarded as the top honour in architecture, having been set up in the 1970s by the Pritzkers, one of America&apos;s most wealthy families, who own the Hyatt group of hotels. The award, which is always given to a living architect displaying &quot;talent, vision and commitment&quot;, was modelled on the Nobel prize. The list of past winners reads like a Who&apos;s Who of the architectural world. It includes Richard Meier (1984) and Frank Gehry (1989) of the US; James Stirling (1981), Norman Foster (1999), Zaha Hadid (2004) and Richard Rogers (2007) of the UK; Renzo Piano of Italy (1998); and Tadao Ando of Japan (1995). Last year&apos;s winner was the French designer Jean Nouvel. A panel of judges, chaired by the chairman of London&apos;s Serpentine Gallery, Lord Palumbo, deliberated in secret. In their citation they described Zumthor as a &quot;master architect&quot; who is &quot;focused, uncompromising and exceptionally determined&quot;. The panel praised his detachment from current trends, saying his buildings were &quot;untouched by fad or fashion ... humility resides alongside strength. &quot;While some have called his architecture quiet, his buildings masterfully assert their presence.&quot; Zumthor&apos;s most renowned creation is the 1996 rebuilding of a thermal spa in Vals, Switzerland. He used giant slabs of Valser gneiss to set the building into the mountainside, with slabs of the roof grassed over and bursting with flowers in spring. The judges also singled out his Field Chapel to St Nikolaus von der Fl\u00fce in Mechernich, Germany, which was built using more than 100 tree trunks overlayed with concrete. The panel particularly admired the Kolumba museum in Cologne, which it said was a &quot;startling contemporary work that is completely at ease with its many layers of history&quot;. Amid the global multimillion dollar practices that have been established by some of his predecessors on the roll-call of Pritzker prize winners, Zumthor stands out for the low-key modesty of his way of working. His practice is located in the remote village of Haldenstein in the Swiss mountains, which, as the prize judges pointed out, keeps him removed from the flurry of activity of the international architectural scene. There he employs fewer than 20 staff.  Zumthor has said he likes to keep his operation minimalist as it allows him to own the entire process of developing a new building from start to finish. His desire is to be the author of everything. &quot;I&apos;m not a producer of images. I&apos;m this guy who, when I take on a commission, I do it inside out, everything myself, with my team,&quot; he told the New York Times. Along with the smallness of scale comes discrimination over the projects that he takes on, which sees him reject far more offers of commissions than he accepts. He has written: &quot;In a society that celebrates the inessential, architecture can put up a resistance, counteract the waste of forms and meanings, and speak its own language.&quot; Past winners: Examples of their work 1983 IM Pei, Chinese-born American architect: Louvre pyramid 1989 Frank Gehry, Canadian-born American: Guggenheim, Bilbao 1993 Fumihiko Maki, Japan: Metropolitan Gymnasium, Tokyo 1996 Rafael Moneo, Spain: Museum of Modern Art, Merida 1999 Norman Foster, UK: London Gherkin 2004 Zaha Hadid, British Iraqi: London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Olympics 2007 Richard Rogers, British: Pompidou Centre 2008 Jean Nouvel, French: Arab World Institute, Paris"}, {"sentences": ["Sea-level rise at that global temperature increase will take out cities including London, New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Sea level"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-14T09:43:06Z", "title": "James Randerson: To stop a climate catastrophe we must first believe we can make a difference", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/apr/14/climate-catastrophe", "article": "Climate scientists are hyping the global warming crisis in order to keep themselves in jobs, conferences and research grants to exotic locations. Their snouts are wedged deep in a lucrative trough. So goes the familiar chant from the climate naysayers \u2013 those who are convinced climate change is not caused by people nor that its effects are overblown. So the results of the Guardian&apos;s poll of climate experts showing that most believe we don&apos;t have a hope in hell of keeping planetary warming to below 2C \u2013 the threshold the EU defines as &quot;dangerous&quot; \u2013 are all the more remarkable. It blows the lid on a very different sort of conspiracy: that climate scientists have actually been toning down their message lest the worst-case scenario becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. As one respondent put it, &quot;Great things can only be achieved by everyone believing it can be done. How do you think the second world war was won? Churchill didn&apos;t stand around saying most people think we will lose the war. He said we will fight it on the beaches.&quot; Far from over-playing their hand to swell their research coffers, scientists have been toning down their message in an attempt to avoid public despair and inaction. Just 7% of the 261 experts surveyed (200 of whom were researchers in climate science or related fields) said they thought governments would succeed in restricting global warming to 2C. Nearly two-fifths thought this target was impossible and 46% thought a 3 to 4C rise by the end of the century was most likely. A 3 or 4C rise might not sound much but the climatic shifts accompanying it would be massive. At 3C one to four billion extra people would face water shortages and 150 to 550 million more people would be at risk of hunger. With an extra degree of warming on top of that, seven million to 300 million would be put at risk of coastal flooding due to sea level rise. In the face of such apocalyptic scenarios it is natural for people to feel like giving up. Small personal actions such as turning the TV off standby, turning down your thermostat and lagging the loft have always seemed pitiful in the face of a global catastrophe. But if the scientists are saying the bad stuff is going to happen anyway then it is tempting to think we might as well stop punishing ourselves, jump on that no-frills flight and be done with it. Unfortunately, the climate doesn&apos;t give us a milestone beyond which we can stop bothering. Warming the planet to 3C beyond pre-industrial levels is a lot worse than a 2C rise, but it is a walk in the park with mum buying you an ice-cream compared with a rise of 4C. Likewise, stopping us getting near 5C is very much worth the effort. Sea-level rise at that global temperature increase will take out cities including London, New York and Tokyo. The poles will be transformed by warming. Scientists must stop sanitising their message. World leaders and their people need to hear the warnings loud and clear and follow through with radical action that matches the scale of the crisis. Only if they do will future generations look back on what is looking decreasingly likely to be our &quot;finest hour&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Engineering consultant Atkins has based its \u00a35 million project on intersections in Tokyo, where traffic is halted in all directions at once, allowing pedestrians to cross roads diagonally as well as straight ahead."], "tags": ["London"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-14T16:19:37Z", "title": "London's Oxford Circus is to be redesigned to help pedestrians", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2009/apr/14/london", "article": "From Building Design:  Work on an experimental scheme to semi-pedestrianise Oxford Circus, one of central London&apos;s busiest junctions, begins this week.

There is only one condition. All the parts must come from living organisms. To the scientists involved, the competition is an exercise in extreme, not to say minuscule, DIY. Instead of hinges and door knobs, they must use the microscopic components found inside biological cells. Instead of screwdrivers and hammer-drills, the tools of the trade are those of the genetic engineer. The aim of the competition, now in its sixth year, is to take the basic building blocks of life and turn them into useful technology. Along the way, scientists hope to create the biological equivalent of a hardware store, in which strands of DNA and cellular machinery will line the shelves, ready to be pieced together by anyone with the know-how. &quot;Our mission has been to see if we can use biological parts to build things and operate them. A lot of people said it&apos;s too complex and can&apos;t be done, but every year we have systems that show it can work,&quot; said Meagan Lizarazo, a former biologist and assistant director of the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. This week, the last of the teams, most of whom are students, will register for the competition. From June, they will spend three months building their machines from components ordered from MIT&apos;s registry, which already contains around 3,200 biological spare parts. The parts are refered to as &quot;biobricks&quot;, which explains why the trophy for first prize, to be awarded in the first week of November, is a metal lego brick the size of a shoebox. Any new parts the scientists use must be deposited in the public registry when the competition is over. By pitting the world&apos;s best up-and-coming scientists against one another, the competition&apos;s organisers aim to accelerate progress in what has become a powerful and controversial field known as synthetic biology. One leading advocate of the technology is the American scientist and entrepreneur Craig Venter, who hopes not only to make bugs that produce hydrogen for environmentally friendly vehicles, but to create new life from scratch. Critics of the field raise concerns that scientists could make dangerous new organisms by accident, or that the knowledge could fall into the hands of terrorists, who could resurrect long-contained viruses, or fashion more deadly strains. The competition has already produced some promising ideas. Last year, a team led by Roland Eils at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, re-engineered Escherichia coli bacteria so that instead of swimming towards food, they homed in on substances released by dangerous pathogens. When they get close, the bacteria turn themselves into microscopic suicide bombers by churning out a natural toxin, killing both themselves and the pathogens around them. The team&apos;s entry was called &quot;E.colicense to kill.&quot; Since then, the team has created E. coli that hunt down cancer cells, and have used them to destroy tumours in mice. This year, Eils says the team is considering building a machine out of parts taken from human cells for the first time. A previous entry from scientists at Edinburgh University involved bacteria that could detect arsenic in contaminated water supplies. In a freeze-dried form, the bacteria can be used in water testing kits for use in Bangladesh, where arsenic in water from bore holes has killed countless people. The competition began in 2004 with only five entrants. A year later, it went international and attracted 13 teams. This year, more than 100 teams from all over the world have already signed up. The teams come from all over the world, with entrants from Mumbai and Beijing, Tokyo and Melbourne, Stanford and Sheffield. Paul Freemont, who co-founded the Institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology at Imperial College London, is heading one of Britain&apos;s best hopes this year, but confesses his team has yet to decide what to build. One of the ideas would involve using vats of bacteria to make clothing. They have already shown that they can control the movement of bacteria by switching the motors that drive their whip-like tails on and off at will. &quot;Our team is due to meet in a few weeks&apos; time and they will start with a blank sheet of paper,&quot; said Freemont. &quot;They&apos;ve got to brainstorm from scratch, and that makes it a really interesting way of doing research.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The use of the &quot;exclusive pedestrian phase&quot; \u2013 or &quot;pedestrian scramble&quot;, as it&apos;s also known \u2013 is perhaps best known at Hachiko Square in Tokyo.", "The council is hoping that the &quot;Oxford Circus Diagonals&quot; \u2013 as it wants the crossing to be known \u2013 will become a symbolic image of London, as they already are in cities such as Tokyo and New York."], "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-14T16:57:57Z", "title": "Leo Hickman: Oxford Circus to get pedestrian-friendly revamp", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/apr/14/oxford-circus-pedestrian-friendly", "article": "Oxford Circus has long been one of London&apos;s least appealing destinations. It marks the cross-section of Regent Street and Oxford Street, both cathedrals to the kind of homogeneous, globalised retail experience that can leave you feeling so dispirited and hollow. But that&apos;s not the only reason to avoid the place: it is a living hades for anyone travelling on foot. Cattle have more freedom to move on market day. Pedestrians are made to feel as if they&apos;re an irritant to be penned in by barriers and cajoled forward only once the road traffic has passed. The sheer volume of people passing through this narrow intersection only compounds the misery. But this is soon set to change with the introduction of the &quot;Barnes Dance&quot;. No, this isn&apos;t a new move sweeping the nation \u2013 even if you did have enough room to shake your hips while waiting for the green man to appear at Oxford Circus \u2013 but the nickname for the type of pedestrian crossing where all road traffic is periodically stopped and pedestrians are allowed to cross all at once, even walking diagonally across the intersection if they so wish. The use of the &quot;exclusive pedestrian phase&quot; \u2013 or &quot;pedestrian scramble&quot;, as it&apos;s also known \u2013 is perhaps best known at Hachiko Square in Tokyo. If any news organisation is looking for footage of a chaotic road crossing this is usually the place they call upon. The Barnes Dance alludes to Henry Barnes, the famous American traffic engineer who once wisely said: &quot;You can&apos;t be a nice guy and solve traffic.&quot; Barnes said in his 1965 autobiography, The Man With the Red and Green Eyes, that he didn&apos;t actually invent the concept of the crossing, noting that he already knew of such crossings in Kansas City and Vancouver in the 1940s. Westminster City Council has announced that work is to begin shortly on a \u00a35m revamp of Oxford Circus that will see a very similar crossing built. It should be completed, it says, in time for the switching on of the Christmas lights in November. (Another reason to avoid this particular part of London, but let&apos;s hold fire on that debate for another time.) Lowly pedestrians should welcome the move as it will finally see them placed on an equal footing \u2013 literally \u2013 with the buses, taxis, bikes and other motorised vehicles that have traditionally bossed proceedings at Oxford Circus, an area that sees a staggering 200m visitors a year. (I&apos;ve never cycled through Oxford Circus, but I would be interested to hear a cyclist&apos;s perspective of both the existing and proposed crossings.) The council is hoping that the &quot;Oxford Circus Diagonals&quot; \u2013 as it wants the crossing to be known \u2013 will become a symbolic image of London, as they already are in cities such as Tokyo and New York.

But few seriously thought the UK, which had never produced an opening weekend above \u00a33m for a film in this cars-and-crime franchise, would come close to matching the American success. The result \u00ad\u2013 \u00a34.93m over the three-day weekend, and \u00a36.01m including takings on Easter Monday \u2013 is far in excess of industry expectations.  The original The Fast and the Furious took the market by surprise when it opened in the US in June 2001 with $40m. The film&apos;s UK debut figure, \u00a31.76m, was significantly less potent, possibly because it was released three days after the 9/11 terror attacks. Despite losing Vin Diesel, sequel 2 Fast 2 Furious opened strongly with $50.5m in the US and \u00a32.75m in the UK, both in June 2003. Three years later the third film, Tokyo Drift, which jettisoned Paul Walker but welcomed back an unbilled Diesel in cameo, was less commercially persuasive: launching with $24m and \u00a31.81m respectively. Both Walker and Diesel are back for Fast &amp; Furious and so, it seems, are the fans of the earlier films, as well as a whole new audience that was probably still at primary school in 2001.  The result restores good cheer to a studio that just the week before was rocked by the commercial disappointment of its hugely-hyped Richard Curtis comedy. The Boat That Rocked shed a relatively slim 28% to slide two rungs to fourth place this weekend, no doubt boosted by a relative lack of Easter sunshine. After 13 days on release, Universal&apos;s pirate-radio tale has grossed \u00a34.21m but is clearly not destined to match Love Actually&apos;s total UK haul of over \u00a336m.  In the US, Zac Efron comedy 17 Again is being steered clear of Hannah Montana: The Movie and will instead release this Friday (17 April). Here in the UK, with the Miley Cyrus flick not scheduled for release until 1 May, local distributor Entertainment took advantage of the school holidays, positioning its body-swap flick as the top choice for tween and teen girls. The result \u2013 \u00a32.56m over three days, and \u00a33.3m including Easter Monday \u2013 is marginally ahead of the debut achieved by Step Up 2 the Streets last Easter. That urban-inflected dance sequel benefited from brand loyalty but lacked an equivalent star, with Channing Tatum in just an extended cameo. From Good Friday to Easter Sunday 2008, it notched up \u00a32.36m, and \u00a33.11m over the four days. 17 Again&apos;s Efron enjoyed a much bigger opening (\u00a38.41m, including previews) last October with Disney&apos;s High School Musical 3: Senior Year, but a comparison with that tween phenomenon is hardly fair. 17 Again was beaten into third place by Monsters Vs Aliens, which rose slightly from its debut the previous weekend, and has now grossed \u00a312.43m after 11 days of release plus two days of previews. This compares with Bolt, which had achieved \u00a313.65m after its second weekend, although its complex preview platform was more extensive. Bolt released in the February half-term and had fewer holiday days to grab its cash; Monsters Vs Aliens should benefit from the current longer school break and has plenty more gas in the tank.  Facing off against the DreamWorks Animation hit, Race to Witch Mountain and especially Dragonball: Evolution struggled to engage families&apos; attention. Disney&apos;s Race took \u00a3581,000 in three days and \u00a3784,000 over four. This compares with Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson&apos;s previous family comedy The Game Plan, which overcame the significant local handicap of a storyline involving American football to debut in March 2008 with \u00a3767,000. Race may pick up more viewers as the school holiday nears its end and families start mopping up the weaker titles. Dragonball, which opened last Wednesday and has managed a weak \u00a3436,000 in six days, does not look destined for box-office glory. Top specialist release is Swedish vampire flick Let the Right One In, which picked up \u00a3203,000 in three days and \u00a3270,000 over the four, from 68 screens, plus \u00a321,000 in previews. The critical favourite won a score of 98% Fresh at Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 appropriately so, since the film was awarded the website&apos;s Critical Consensus prize, voted by critics at last June&apos;s Edinburgh film festival. Comparisons are tricky, but arthouse chiller The Orphanage opened at Easter 2008 on 74 screens with \u00a3320,000 in three days, and \u00a3441,000 including Monday and some previews. That Spanish-language film benefited from producer Guillermo del Toro&apos;s name in the marketing. Another comparison might be Spanish horror [Rec], which debuted exactly a year ago with \u00a3100,000 from 70 screens, including previews. Given the Easter boost, the top 15 films were predictably up on the equivalent mid-April 2008 period, which did not coincide with Easter. But the surprise is by how much: a whopping 99%.

His debut single, Umiyuki (Ocean Snow), entered the top 5 in 2008, whipping elderly Japanese ladies into a nostalgic frenzy as they remembered the joys of hearing enka in their youth. Meanwhile, his hip-hop image and idiosyncratic background caught the attention of the media, making Jero a cult among teenagers.            The missing link in this otherwise arbitrary chain of events is Jero&apos;s own grandmother, a native Japanese who moved to the United States after marrying an American serviceman she met during the second world war. When other kids on the block were listening to Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, six-year-old Jero was introduced to the wistful ways of enka singers like Hibari Misora and Keiko Fuji. After coming to Japan as an English teacher, Jero was talent spotted in Tokyo and a music career was conceived. In a tribute that would have had Biggie and Tupac nod props of approval, Jero appeared on NHK Television&apos;s New Year&apos;s Eve spectacular in a shirt bearing a large picture of his grandma&apos;s face \u2013 much to the curiosity of viewers used to performers appearing in stuffy, old-fashioned crooner suits. Before Jero, enka was thought of as commercially obsolete. Critics have lauded the way he&apos;s managed to mould an antiquated genre around a modern context, in a way that appeals to both old and new generations. Last week, Jero made his US debut, performing for President Obama at the opening of the National Cherry Blossom festival in Washington DC.

Buying abroad I&apos;m thinking about getting a netbook, and I&apos;m just about to take a trip to Tokyo. Should I wait and buy there?Gerry G Odonovan JS: Japan is generally expensive and was late into netbooks, so they mostly have the same models as us at similar prices. An Asus Eee 1000H, for example, goes for about \u00a539,000 (\u00a3260), and you&apos;d also be charged VAT to bring it into the UK. You can check prices at Google.co.jp even if you can&apos;t read the Japanese text. There are other problems with buying a computer abroad. First, it&apos;s unlikely to have a UK keyboard, operating system or manual, and it won&apos;t have a UK mains plug. (These are less of a problem when buying in the US.) Second, you may have trouble getting repairs or support, unless the machine has an international guarantee card. And you won&apos;t be able to take it back to the shop.

Cutting out backgrounds I need to cut off the &quot;white space&quot; around an image in a jpg. Is there a  free tool that can do so automatically?Dan Dreamingbear JS: You need to remove the background and make it transparent, so that whatever is behind the background shows through. Unfortunately, the JPEG file format doesn&apos;t support transparency, so you will need to convert the final image to Gif or PNG. Otherwise there are lots of ways to remove backgrounds, and the About.com articles Removing Backgrounds and Maintaining Transparency in Graphics Software and Knock it Out! Removing Backgrounds with Photoshop will give you a good idea of the options. Also have a look at Transparency From Here to There for help with using transparent images. If you can&apos;t get hold of a copy of Photoshop, you can try to do them in Gimpshop. This is a version of Gimp, the free Gnu Image Manipulation Program, deweirdified to work like Photoshop.

Grosvenor, which traces its roots back to the 17th century, said today it made a loss of \u00a3594m last year \u2013 that compared with a profit of \u00a3524m in 2007. The company, owned by the sixth duke and his family, controls swathes of London&apos;s swanky Mayfair, including, of course, Grosvenor Square as well as an extensive area to the south of Hyde Park Corner including Belgravia landmarks such as Eaton Square. It is the West End&apos;s largest landlord but the collapse of hedge funds and the mass sackings of investment bankers in the City have led to a drop in property values in the areas where these failed financial wizards live and work. The results are the worst for 16 years and include a hefty \u00a31.3bn of writedowns on the values of properties and investments, including a \u00a3165.3m drop in the value of the Liverpool One retail park which opened last May. &quot;This is a challenging time for the property industry and inevitably Grosvenor has been affected,&quot; said chief executive Mark Preston. &quot;But the impact has been cushioned by our well-diversified portfolio, low gearing and steps taken since 2007 to curb acquisitions and reduce our development exposure. Hence, the impact on net asset value is relatively limited.&quot; Grosvenor said its net asset value \u2013, which measures the value of its properties minus the value of its liabilities \u2013 dropped 7.4% to \u00a32.8bn. &quot;2009 is likely to be another difficult year of continued credit restrictions and poor confidence in the occupier markets,&quot; Preston said. &quot;Looking beyond the downturn, our significant financial capacity puts us in a good position to take advantage of the excellent buying opportunities which will arise as the property market recovers.&quot; The company has cash and overdraft facilities totalling \u00a3523m and the company intends to reinvest in its core London portfolio as well as take advantage of possible opportunities in Asia.

I&apos;ve taken on the role of trendspotter for WGSN, a fashion and style forecaster used by international brands and individual designers alike for their trend forecasts and analysis. In these dark economic times, fashion labels and retailers are looking to the street for inspiration. There are two main factors in play. One: we&apos;re forced to get more creative with what we&apos;ve got in our wardrobes; and two: we&apos;re much pickier about buying new things. &quot;What people buy and how they wear it is invaluable information for a retailer,&quot; says my trend mentor, WGSN&apos;s associate womenswear editor Kathryn Kenny. &quot;Seeing real women wearing real clothes is very powerful, rather than looking at models on a catwalk.&quot; This doesn&apos;t mean that catwalk models are exempt from the scrutiny of WGSN&apos;s 250-plus editors, designers and analysts. Catwalk reports, along with the tens of thousands of street shots, trade show analyses and retail news are what make up the &quot;creative intelligence&quot; that is disseminated to WGSN&apos;s 35,000 paying subscribers - including Armani, Diesel, H&amp;M, Topshop and Louis Vuitton, and mobile phone companies LG and Sony Ericsson. Many pay \u00a315,000 a year for the service. Marks &amp; Spencer subscribes. &quot;The information we get from WGSN on a daily basis is used in all aspects of the business from design to forward planning,&quot; says Neil Hendy, head of womenswear. It&apos;s like paying to get your fashion homework done for you. Street shots are vital to WGSN. &quot;From accessories in Stockholm to beachwear in Rio, our customers like to see new product styled in different cities, cultures and locations,&quot; says Catriona MacNab, head of trends. Scouting trends in Rio strikes me as a pretty sweet deal. Sadly, my services are required in London. Remember skinny jeans? They were &quot;spotted&quot; and &quot;trended&quot; back in 2002 on the streets of Tokyo. &quot;Boyfriend&quot; blazers came from the street - now they are everywhere, from Gap to H&amp;M. The Scandinavian layered look is also hot. &quot;They do a really top-heavy silhouette in Stockholm and Copenhagen, with loads of layers on top and really skinny trousers.&quot; As a rookie trendspotter, what should I be looking for? Subjects that are &quot;stylishly put together, directionally chic without being obviously loud or freakish&quot;. Trousers and jackets are particularly hot, so I&apos;m to look out for interesting examples of each. Anything too commercial or &quot;try hard&quot; is to be avoided. &quot;We&apos;re not snobs,&quot; says Kenny, &quot;but we&apos;re connoisseurs.&quot; I hate being approached by people on the street, whatever they are peddling, but Kenny suggests I open with a compliment. She assures me that people are usually flattered. A few people walk by, but Kenny shakes her head. After what feels like ages I spot a woman with harem-ish pants, a boyfriend blazer and a nicely arranged scarf. She&apos;s holding a cigarette, so I offer a light, then sneak the photo suggestion in. She obliges. Kenny is pleased and checks &quot;trans-seasonal dressing&quot; (due to the blazer) and &quot;sandals with socks&quot; off a mental checklist. I&apos;m on a high. It&apos;s like asking someone out. Feeling more daring I approach a gaggle of girls and single one out for her fetching tulip-shaped coat. Afterwards, Kenny reflects that she was a bit too young and that her outfit didn&apos;t have enough &quot;interesting detailing&quot;. Next, I spot a very cool girl with the hair and swagger of a young Debbie Harry. Kenny picks out the polka dots on her dress and the cut of her leather jacket as things her team could use. I snap a woman sporting an interesting nautical-meets-rock-chick look, some faded blouson-style jeans and a woman in a snakeskin blazer that looked better than it sounds. Kenny slaps my wrist when I err towards slightly-too-mad ensembles. The next day I return to WGSN with my haul - 20 photos, which I&apos;m told is not bad. The verdict? &quot;You were apprehensive at first, but once you knew the kind of style to look for you were on fire,&quot; beams Kenny. &quot;You have a good eye for street style but you&apos;re too quick to pick up on a look that is already on the high street. You need to focus on more directional looks providing new inspiration for our clients.&quot; I mention this to my photographer friend, Darren Hall, who does a lot of street reportage, and he gets all philosophical: &quot;There are some people who interest us immediately, at first glance, before a word is spoken.

It was called The Dinosaur and the Baby. Godard, along with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, was then at the head of the new tendency in French film, the Nouvelle Vague. This New Wave was basically a group of young male film critics, the defenders of Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks, who had turned themselves into directors: Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer and Godard himself. Like his friends, Godard adored Fritz Lang. And Lang - like other grand old men, like Roberto Rossellini, like Max Oph\u00fcls - was fond of the kids who formed the Nouvelle Vague.  But what, really, was the Nouvelle Vague? As they both chain-smoke in black and white, Godard, with a small smile, asks Lang what it feels like to be an older film-maker. (A dinosaur, Lang corrects him, a dinosaur.) Because what strikes him, Godard continues, in the work of Lang, is his extreme youth: he is always interested in things when they happen for the first time. He is always interested in new problems. And Lang inhales, and exhales, and slowly replies that he thinks that their craft, their art - the art of cinema - is not just the art of their century, it&apos;s art for young people.  You think it&apos;s the art of youth, me I think that too, agrees Godard, happily. Youth! When he interviewed Lang, Godard was nearly 40. But youth, in the end, was still the basic definition of the Nouvelle Vague. The phrase &quot;La Nouvelle Vague&quot; was first used in 1957 by the journalist Fran\u00e7oise Giroud. Writing in L&apos;Express, she used it to describe a new generation of French youth who were the subject of a vast public opinion survey (question number 7: &quot;Are you happy? Explain your reply&quot;). Thirty years later, Godard&apos;s Histoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma offered this definition: &quot;perhaps the only generation which found itself in the middle of both the century and perhaps of cinema&quot;. In retrospect, it&apos;s possible to see why Godard also thought that a defining feature of the Nouvelle Vague was collaboration. Its figures formed a mutual support group. They all wrote for the new cinema magazines in Paris in the 1950s - most notably, Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma. They went to the same regular film screenings at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise, run by the magisterial archivist Henri Langlois. They gave each other money. They borrowed each other&apos;s actors - such as Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Jean-Claude Brialy. Most importantly, they worked on each other&apos;s films. They helped produce them, and write them. Truffaut, for instance, the year after Les quatre cents coups won him the award for best director at Cannes, provided Godard with the four-page outline of his own first film, \u00c0 bout de souffle, and allowed his name to be used to get his unknown friend some funding. The Nouvelle Vague, so canonical, so assured of its own history, was really the joyful experiment of a few excitable friends. And this shared joy is obvious in their delighted quotation of each other&apos;s films. In Les quatre cents coups, Rivette&apos;s Paris nous appartient is showing - even though, at that point, it had not yet been released. And when, in Godard&apos;s Une femme est une femme, Anna Karina asks a girl called Suzanne what she&apos;s been up to lately, she mimes a shoot-out, then playing a piano. The same actress had been Charles Aznavour&apos;s love interest in Truffaut&apos;s Tirez sur le pianiste, which had come out the year before. Like every movement, the Nouvelle Vague didn&apos;t really exist. All those films date from three years, from 1959 to 1962, when Truffaut made Les quatre cents coups, Tirez sur le pianiste and Jules et Jim, Chabrol directed Les cousins, Rivette finally showed Paris nous appartient, and Godard made \u00c0 bout de souffle, Une femme est une femme and Vivre sa vie. Even then, by 1962, it was obvious how different these kids were.  And yet, in Les quatre cents coups, the story of a boy adrift in the punitive world of adults, Truffaut announced their central theme: the refusal of adulthood as a world of tyranny and corruption. Their theme was youth. But youth is elusive. Youth is complicated. At the start of Godard&apos;s later film Masculin f\u00e9minin (1966) - the subject of which he described as &quot;the idea of youth&quot; - the viewer sees a close-up of Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, who was 15 when he played the hero of Les quatre cents coups. Now 22, he is sitting in a caf\u00e9, nervously chatting up a girl and playing with his cigarette. L\u00e9aud is still young, he is still a symbol of revolt. But he is also a boy who wants to be cool. He wants to be a film star - just as Belmondo wanted to be Bogart in \u00c0 bout de souffle. Rohmer said that the Nouvelle Vague directors were literary people who made films. And they inherited the novel&apos;s great investigation: of characters who are romantics, who want to live life like a novel. The characters in the Nouvelle Vague are romantics who want to live in a film. The Nouvelle Vague put cinema into the street. Then it entered the bedroom, the bathroom - the world of the censored and the hidden. The ideal of youth was absolute truthfulness. And this was possible because of new cinematic techniques: the faster film stock (the Kodak Tri-X panchromatic camera negative); the new hand-held cameras (the \u00c9clair Cameflex); and the new possibilities for mobile sound recording (the Nagra III). The heroes of the Nouvelle Vague weren&apos;t just the directors: they were the sound engineers, the directors of photography - the greatest of whom, perhaps, was Raoul Coutard. When shooting \u00c0 bout de souffle, Coutard pieced together reams of photographic stock (more sensitive at the time than film stock) to shoot a night scene.  And this truthfulness had a theory, too. The one thing these directors all had in common, after all, was that they all wrote film criticism. Criticism and directing were, in the end, just different ways of sketching out films. And the most important theoretician of the Nouvelle Vague was the great critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin, a co-founder of Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma and the dedicatee of Les quatre cents coups Bazin&apos;s two heroes were Robert Bresson and Roberto Rossellini. In these directors, he found examples of film-makers who, in Bresson&apos;s terminology, wanted to use film not to &quot;reproduce&quot;, but to &quot;create&quot;. &quot;The screen has no backstage,&quot; Bazin wrote in his essay &quot;Theatre and Cinema&quot;. When a character leaves the screen, he argued, we believe in his continued existence as a character. When he leaves a stage, we know he becomes a man who was playing a part. Therefore, Bazin concluded, all cinema is documentary, even fictional films. The language of cinema is coextensive with life. Jean Renoir, after all, had said: &quot;In La r\u00e8gle du jeu, I didn&apos;t film that role, I filmed Marcel Dalio playing that role.&quot; With Bazin as his mentor, Godard went further, describing \u00c0 bout de souffle as a documentary on Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo in a film by Jean-Luc Godard.  The search for truth was understood as a search for the literal. It is there in Truffaut&apos;s Tirez sur le pianiste, where Aznavour is in bed with a girl. She sits up, exposing her breasts. You know, says Aznavour, in cinema it would be like this - and he raises the sheet to cover her up. Or consider Godard&apos;s response, in the short film Two American Audiences, recording his visit to New York University in 1968, when he is asked why, in La Chinoise, he interrupted characters&apos; conversations with loud quotations from Vivaldi. It seemed, said an earnest grad student, a mystery. &quot;Why is it a mystery?&quot; Godard said. &quot;When you are walking in the street, you are suddenly whistling for 10 seconds, and then, you know ... I mean: there is nothing more than that.&quot; This devotion to the real had a further consequence. Truth, in Godard&apos;s formulation, meant that he wanted to &quot;both show and show myself showing&quot;. (His master, he added, was Montaigne.) In a survey that came out in Cahiers in 1966, Italo Calvino commented that, for him, the most interesting aspect of the new French tendency in film was this invention of the film-essay. The line between fiction and documentary was being constantly erased, he thought, by the Nouvelle Vague&apos;s precision.  The essayistic tendency was patented by Godard, whose films revel in exposing the film as film - above all, with varieties of writing: intertitles, quotation, subtitles, book covers, random words in neon. But the play with form wasn&apos;t just his. Truffaut was also adept at what he called &quot;respectful pastiche&quot; - such as, in Tirez sur le pianiste, his gleeful use of the gangster clich\u00e9 when a man has just been murdered: &quot;Go back inside, it was just an accident.&quot; All the conventions could be sidestepped. And the difference constituted by the Nouvelle Vague can be seen in the history of the script for Bonnie and Clyde. It was written by Robert Benton and David Newman, who had Truffaut in mind for the film. Too busy, Truffaut recommended Godard instead, who happened to be going to New York. Godard announced he could do it in three weeks&apos; time. The producers were scared: no time, they said, no money, no studio, no deal. What did it matter, said Godard - why not? &quot;If it happens in life, it can happen in a movie.&quot; And when the producers worried that the weather in Texas might not be right for shooting, he countered: &quot;We can make this film anywhere; we can make it in Tokyo.&quot; Still dubious, they called the Texas weather bureau. There was a strong likelihood of rain. &quot;I am speaking of cinema, and you are speaking meteorology,&quot; said Godard. The next day, Benton and Newman met the director in his hotel. &quot;Call me when the script reverts to your ownership,&quot; he said.  Godard&apos;s final quip reveals another aspect of the Nouvelle Vague&apos;s youth: it believed in a utopian politics, constantly trying to invent new means of cinematic production. Rivette had anticipated this politics in Paris nous appartient: a politics that took the form of paranoia. His film is nominally about a group of actors trying to put on a production of Pericles, while characters mysteriously die or disappear. But really it is about the new politics of youth - where politics is figured as melodrama. In Rivette&apos;s ironic redefinition, radical politics is revealed as a possible version of egotism: an obsession with the hidden world of adults.  By 1968, however, the paranoia seemed less paranoid. Langlois was sacked from the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise by Malraux, the minister for culture. Amid orchestrated protests, Langlois was eventually reinstated. But the protests continued, and culminated in the May \u00e9v\u00e8nements. That month, the Cannes festival went ahead as usual. In response, Godard and Truffaut put forward a motion to stop the festival in solidarity with the workers and students on strike.  But this public twinship was illusory. 1968 marked the moment when Godard abandoned conventional film-making - and the Nouvelle Vague disintegrated. With Bazinian grandeur, Godard had once said that he did &quot;research in the form of spectacle&quot;. The search for the truth in images now became a search for a true politics of the image, against its corruption by capitalist hegemony. It was too much for Truffaut. &quot;Between your interest in the masses and your own narcissism there&apos;s no room for anything or anyone else,&quot; he wrote to Godard in 1973: &quot;you&apos;re the Ursula Andress of militancy.&quot; But Truffaut and Godard had always been uneasy friends. When Belmondo lay dying in the street at the end of \u00c0 bout de souffle, Godard wanted him brutally to ask to be shot one more time: &quot;Quick in the spinal column.&quot; Truffaut persuaded him to cut it. And while this cut is a sign of the problematic friendships of the Nouvelle Vague - a disparate collection of rivalries and talents - it also exemplifies the shared and deep concern for truth: their insouciant precision. For the Nouvelle Vague was truly young - the directors&apos; experiments remain contemporary. They are still a shock. And their lesson is delight. At one point in Une femme est une femme, Brialy interrupts the argument his character is having with the character played by Anna Karina, and turns to the camera. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a comedy or a tragedy,&quot; he says. And then he adds, with the chutzpah of someone doing something for the first time: &quot;In any case, it&apos;s a masterpiece.&quot; \u2022 The Nouvelle Vague season runs at the BFI Southbank, London SE1, until 31 May.

Led by John McGregor, they fell with David Crockett, James Bowie, William Travis and the others at the Alamo in 1836 and so passed into the ranks of those whom America has raised to sainthood. The Alamo, once a Spanish Catholic mission to the Indians, became the fortress besieged by several thousand Mexicans as Texas struggled to free itself from the yoke of the dictator, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, self-styled Napoleon of the west. The outcome of this battle was inevitable, yet as Santa Anna ordered the bodies of the Texan defenders to be burnt he could scarce have imagined that within just two months he would be utterly defeated. To visit the site of the battle now is to take part in a nationwide service of remembrance that is played out each day of the year. The high-frequency volume of DayGlo Texas is turned down when you enter these walls and somehow the atmosphere of the Cenotaph descends and is maintained. The role of the Scots who died is given due acknowledgement as you tour the gardens and outlying buildings. Each of them had followed a well-worn path. Our nation exports its people, its industry and its ideas. But we also export our belligerence. The Union of the Crowns and the Treaty of Union a century or so later brought an end to several hundred years of fighting the English. Perhaps we got bored and so began touring Europe looking for other people&apos;s wars in which to take part. Indeed, in some cases, it looks like our ancestors tossed a coin to decide which side they were on. &quot;It&apos;s heads. So you&apos;re on Napoleon&apos;s side and I&apos;m on Wellington&apos;s.&quot; Thus it was only natural that John McGregor found himself playing his bagpipes with Davy Crockett on his fiddle as they sought to lift Texan spirits. Someone, though, forgot to tell the US National History unit, which has made an excellent short film about the Alamo. For at its conclusion there is a tribute to the assorted Englishmen, Irishmen and Germans who similarly found themselves facing the implacable vengeance of a Mexican dictator. But of Scotland&apos;s contribution there was nothing. Did they not know, I asked my helpful curator, about McGregor and his pipes? And David Wilson, Isaac Robinson and Richard Ballentine and how they sang Green Grow the Rushes O? Yes sir, they surely did. And yes sir, they surely were grateful. There was just the merest insinuation, though, in the languid Texan&apos;s otherwise friendly demeanour, that this was not the first chippy Scot who had made representations on behalf of these obscure but heroic Jocks. He assured me, however, that he would pass on my observations. Also in the grounds of the Alamo is perched a charming little obelisk, upon which are inscribed the artful characters of a Japanese poem; a gift from the Tokyo government. Yet the cry of &quot;banzai&quot; was not heard at the Alamo, while &quot;let&apos;s get right intae these Mexican bassas&quot; surely was. As a proud Scot, this left me even more bereft and undermined. And so I invite our first minister to offer a wee plaque as a gift to the Americans to pay tribute to McGregor and his band who fell on this holy place. Texas surely would appreciate it."}, {"sentences": ["A bad week for ...

Surrounded by mountains on three sides and volatile open sea on the other, and fed by the pristine waters of a fast-flowing river, it is the stuff of distillers&apos; dreams. The Highlands of Scotland, though, lie thousands of miles to the west: the home of the best single malt whisky in the world is Yoichi, until last year a little known town on Japan&apos;s northernmost island of Hokkaido. Its rise to the pinnacle of the centuries-old tradition of turning barley into &quot;the water of life&quot; was enough to make any proud Scotsman weep into his tumbler of Glenfiddich. Not only did Nikka&apos;s Yoichi 1987 vintage beat dozens of other labels to claim the single malt title at last year&apos;s world whisky awards - in Glasgow of all places - its rival distiller, Suntory, won the best blended whisky award with its 30-year-old Hibiki. Today, as expert tasters meeting in London prepare to name this year&apos;s winners, Suntory and Nikka, Japan&apos;s two biggest distillers, are again preparing to ruffle a few traditionalist feathers. &quot;We were very surprised to win the award,&quot; said Masatoshi Takeuchi, a spokesman at Yoichi, which still uses coal fires to heat its pot stills, a labour-intensive method most Scottish makers have discarded. &quot;It has definitely helped create a new breed of Japanese whisky fan. And the most ardent converts don&apos;t care about the price.&quot;  Though Japanese interest in single malts has undergone a dramatic transformation since the days when salarymen swilled glasses of cheap blended concoctions - liberally diluted with water and ice - the growing popularity of wine and shochu, a fiery Japanese spirit, is forcing distillers to court new markets. Whisky sales in Japan have fallen 75% since the bubble-era peak of the early 1980s, while exports have accounted for only a tiny percentage of total production. But the cachet that comes with recognition at international tastings and competitions has transformed Japanese whisky from laughing stock to serious contender for the affections of imbibers from Tokyo to Tulloch. Nikka is targeting the emerging markets of Sweden and France, while Suntory is about to launch an overseas promotion driven by its 86-year-old distillery in Yamazaki, on the outskirts of Kyoto. &quot;We want to sell in overseas markets where drinkers are looking for something real, but different,&quot; said Keita Minari, global marketing manager at the Yamazaki distillery. &quot;First timers are sceptical, but once they&apos;ve tried our whisky we find that they are always pleasantly surprised.&quot;  The Yamazaki distillery shipped 1,500 cases overseas in 2003, the year its 12-year-old single malt won the gold medal at the International Spirits Challenge. A slew of awards since then has driven annual shipments up to 20,000 cases, with sales to China and Taiwan now rivalling those to the US. Yamazaki has selected the UK to launch a 12-year-old Hibiki blend next month in an attempt to steal market share from the likes of Johnny Walker and Chivas Regal. Consumers in Japan will have to wait until September. Tastings in Britain have generated a fantastic response, according to Minari: in a recent promotion at Heathrow&apos;s Terminal 5, 1,000 bottles of Yamazaki single malt sold out in a month. While Scottish distilleries are free to buy in whiskies from other makers to orchestrate the desired blend, their Japanese counterparts do everything in-house. This arrangement, with a variable climate and reverence for traditional distilling methods, is turning this relative newcomer into a whisky powerhouse. Suntory, which controls 70% of the domestic market, has more than 100 types of unblended whisky at its disposal.  &quot;Although some Japanese people are the last to believe in the quality of their own products, their malt whiskies are as good as any in the world,&quot; said Chris Bunting, an expatriate Yorkshireman who blogs about the country&apos;s whisky at Nonjatta.  &quot;No one can say that Japan isn&apos;t making the genuine article.&quot; Man behind the malt Suntory and Nikka have Masataka Taketsuru to thank for their success. He fell in love with whisky while studying chemistry at Glasgow University in 1918, trained as a blender in Campbelltown and Speyside, then returned to Japan. Taketsuru was headhunted by Suntory&apos;s founder, Shinjiro Torii, to launch the firm&apos;s Yamazaki distillery in 1923. Ten years later he and his Scottish wife, Rita, opened the Yoichi distillery.

Fans of Liverpool and Arsenal are to prelude their clubs&apos; Premier League clash by displaying corresponding mosaics in honour of 1970s and 80s hero Ray Kennedy \u2013 a man who, until the launch of a fledgling campaign last year, was languishing in unthinkable hardship and obscurity. On a simple red background, Kennedy&apos;s white No5 will adorn the Kop, while the visitors&apos; enclosure will show a blue No10 on yellow \u2013 mirroring the shirt the mercurial forward wore during Arsenal&apos;s Double-winning Wembley victory against Liverpool in 1971. The gesture, and what it signifies, should be savoured by fans of every club in the land. Struck down by Parkinson&apos;s disease at the unusually early age of 35, Kennedy&apos;s long battle against the debilitating neurological condition has left him housebound, reliant on daily care and, on bad days, barely able to walk or talk. A private individual, he slid from view after a special testimonial in 1991, living alone in his native north-east. With no regular income, the player who won six league titles and three European Cups in a glittering 16-year career was forced to sell his collection of medals and international caps in 1993. Despite struggling to make ends meet, even badly injuring himself in a bathroom ill-equipped for his needs, this most selfless of champions has never asked for help. Thankfully, two years ago, 40-year-old Karl Coppack, an events sales manager and lifelong Liverpool fan, decided to do the asking for him. Devised diligently with friends and fellow trustees Matthew Anton, Steve Hinds, Andy Campbell and Robbie Ashcroft, Coppack&apos;s Ray of Hope Appeal has collected over \u00a340,000 from fans across the globe for essential equipment and services for Kennedy \u2013 and for the Parkinson&apos;s Disease Society, to whom 10% of proceeds are sent each month. Fans&apos; matches, shirt auctions, sponsored motorcycle rides to the Bernabeu, even an epic &quot;92-club Dash&quot; to request memorabilia from every league ground in the country (carried out by Coppack and pals in nine frenetic days in April 2008) \u2013 the Appeal has garnered support and well-wishers from Tokyo to New York. In February this year, with the added bonus of a donation from the PFA, the bathroom of Kennedy&apos;s Whitley Bay bungalow was equipped with a new shower, handrails and other fittings to enable him to navigate the room safely. Further projects addressing Kennedy&apos;s substantial needs will be undertaken but, as Coppack is keen to stress, much like tonight&apos;s celebratory tribute at Anfield the Appeal is far from just another testimonial. &quot;It&apos;s great that Ray finally has a new bathroom, but the point is that the support and the money are there forever \u2013 to help him and his family when things are perhaps not so easy in the future.&quot; The event-organising, painstaking letter-writing and gentle haranguing carried out by the Appeal reveals much about the attitude of British clubs to the plight of former players. &quot;Some clubs were more receptive than others,&quot; Coppack chuckles diplomatically. &quot;But the money is still flooding in from fans everywhere - I have just received a cheque from the Newcastle United Supporters Club. It&apos;s truly been a fans&apos; effort.&quot; Coppack&apos;s personal story is not short on trauma. After first interviewing Kennedy, his boyhood idol, for the Liverpool fanzine Through the Wind and Rain in 2005, he suffered a brain haemorrhage the following year. It was July 2007 before he was able to work again. As he began returning to normal life, Coppack was moved to act. &quot;I hated the sense that, given the fact Ray had a testimonial organised for him in 1991, &apos;that&apos;s that.&apos; As well as being one quarter of Liverpool&apos;s greatest-ever midfield, this was a dignified human who spent the summer at home with his family rather than cavorting around the Costa like other footballers did in his era. I wanted people not to forget.&quot; The sublime Kennedy&apos;s contribution will stand for all time. Arrowing home a tie-winning late strike at Munich&apos;s Olympic Stadium in Liverpool&apos;s 1981 European Cup semi-final; meeting George Armstrong&apos;s 88th-minute cross at White Hart Lane in 1971 to clinch Arsenal&apos;s first league championship in 18 years. Those supple feet and cultured brain turned dreams into blissful realities. Yet the career of one of football&apos;s most decorated players began, much like it ended, in bitter adversity. Rejected as a Port Vale apprentice by Sir Stanley Matthews himself, Kennedy was working in a boiled sweet factory when he was dramatically signed by the Gunners in 1968. The club&apos;s first-ever European trophy soon followed, the teenage Ray scoring a crucial late goal against Anderlecht to help snatch the Fairs Cup in 1970. The following season, 1970-71, is now the stuff of legend. Drafted into the side only because of injury to more experienced players, the 19-year-old Kennedy shone with uncommon brilliance, going on to become the league&apos;s 27-goal top scorer and a national phenomenon. Described by Jimmy Greaves as &quot;the player of the 70s&quot;, Arsenal&apos;s bustling, match-winning centre-forward subsequently became Liverpool&apos;s visionary left-sided midfielder under Bob Paisley \u2013 a seamlessly successful switch of Wengerian proportions. Eight majestic years at Anfield saw five league titles and that trio of European Cups, Kennedy netting 51 goals and numerous entries in Liverpool folklore in the process. His thrown-in for Alan Kennedy, sole scorer in the European Cup final of Paris 1981 against Real Madrid, is heralded as the most important in the club&apos;s history. But it was on being transferred to Swansea in 1982 that the first signs of Parkinson&apos;s began to show. Increasingly unable to perform, the stricken player ended his career at Hartlepool in 1984 and was subsequently diagnosed. His humility as undimmed today as it ever was, Kennedy is delighted at the help he has received from the Appeal. But true to form, he remains genuinely surprised at how fondly his playing days are remembered. &quot;Both sets of fans have been great to me and it&apos;s an honour to have played for both clubs. I hope this season Liverpool do well domestically, and that Arsenal triumph in Europe!&quot; Coppack, meanwhile (who is still as enraptured as an eight-year-old during any conversation in which Kennedy&apos;s name is mentioned), has every reason to feel proud. The curious union of this self-effacing supporter and his footballing idol was born of a heartfelt pragmatism rendered wholly anachronistic by the fiscal might of the modern game. It is hard to imagine any young fan sitting, 30 years from now, on the sofa of a grateful Fernando Torres, watching Football Focus and chewing the fat of golden former days. Yet it is on the foundations laid by such graceful champions as Kennedy that today&apos;s globe-swallowing clubs are built. Tonight&apos;s tribute will sound a rare and inspiring note of humanity to those fans who have witnessed all that came before and after the Murdoch-inspired hubris of the 1990s \u2013 the violent puberty from which football has now slunk, troubled and bloated, into uncertain adulthood. In the era of boardroom billionaires and bad debts, rarely has a piece of off-pitch news read sweeter. And the fans of two of England&apos;s greatest footballing dynasties \u2013 dynasties for whom Kennedy was there at the most crucial of moments \u2013 will tonight concur most warmly.

Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, a member of the hugely successful band Smap, was arrested on suspicion of public indecency after police officers found him seated naked on the grass near the Roppongi entertainment district at 3am. Residents had called police after spotting a man wandering around the park and yelling incoherently. The 34-year-old singer, whose clean-cut image has made him one of the most popular members of the five-piece band, reportedly said: &quot;What&apos;s wrong with being naked?&quot; His clothes were found in a bundle beside him. Reports said Kusanagi, who has also built a successful film and TV career, had been drinking with friends in Roppongi before the incident. His arrest has dominated the TV news in Japan, while fans lined the streets outside the police station for a glimpse of the singer. While his antics were tame by the standards of the rock world, Smap&apos;s squeaky-clean image means their backers are likely to take a dim view of Kusanagi&apos;s drunken cavorting, even if their millions of fans will probably forgive him. Toyota immediately suspended the rental car commercials in which he appears and industry experts speculated the band was likely to lose more lucrative contracts. Smap \u2013 an acronym for sports, music, assemble, people \u2013 have dominated the pop scene for almost 20 years, as the most visible act belonging to the secretive talent agency, Johnny and Associates. &quot;We apologise deeply for the trouble and worry caused to everyone, especially his fans,&quot; the agency said in a statement, adding that it would make a further announcement on Kusanagi&apos;s future career. Smap&apos;s members are fixtures on Japanese TV programmes, appearing in everything from variety to drama programmes and even hosting their own celebrity cookery show. They have built a huge following in South Korea, thanks mainly to Kusanagi&apos;s fluency in the language. TV footage showed a haggard-looking Kusanagi being transferred to a police station this afternoon. &quot;He has such a clean image,&quot; one woman told the TBS television broadcaster. &quot;He doesn&apos;t seem like that kind of person.&quot; Kusanagi reportedly apologised for his actions. He admitted stripping off in the park but said he had no recollection of how he got there. The episode is an embarrassment for the government, which had hired Kusanagi to promote Japan&apos;s switch from analogue to digital TV broadcasting over the next two years. The Kyodo news agency quoted Kunio Hatoyama, the internal affairs and communications minister, as describing the singer as a &quot;bastard&quot;. &quot;His actions are shameful for a person who is asking the public to shoulder a financial burden,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Cannes film festival lineup (directors in brackets) Opening film Up (Pete Docter and Bob Peterson) Closing film Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky (Jan Kounen) In competition Bright Star (Jane Campion) Spring Fever (Lou Ye) Antichrist (Lars von Trier) Enter the Void (Gaspar No\u00e9) Face (Tsai Ming-liang) Les Herbes folles (Alain Resnais) In the Beginning (Xavier Giannoli) A Prophet (Jacques Audiard) The White Ribbon (Michael Haneke) Vengeance (Johnnie To) The Time That Remains (Elia Suleiman) Vincere (Marco Bellocchio) Kinatay (Brillante Mendoza) Thirst (Park Chan-wook) Broken Embraces (Pedro Almod\u00f3var) Map of the Sounds of Tokyo (Isabel Coixet) Fish Tank (Andrea Arnold) Looking for Eric (Ken Loach) Inglourious Basterds (Quentin Tarantino) Taking Woodstock (Ang Lee) Out of competition The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (Terry Gilliam) The Army of Crime (Robert Gu\u00e9diguian) Agora (Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar)"], "tags": ["Cannes 2009", "Cannes film festival", "Quentin Tarantino", "Ken Loach", "Pedro Almod\u00f3var", "Ang Lee", "Brad Pitt", "Terry Gilliam", "Heath Ledger", "Johnny Depp", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-23T12:43:16Z", "title": "Cannes film festival announces lineup with Tarantino, Almod\u00f3var and Campion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/23/cannes-film-festival-lineup", "article": "It could be the script from a high-concept Hollywood blockbuster. Down on the Riviera, the Cannes film festival is braced for its bloodiest year in decades as the recession bites, the casinos stand empty and the champagne is replaced with sparkling ros\u00e9. But wait: riding to the rescue are all the heroes from festivals past, an army of art-house darlings summoned home to save the day. Announced today, the official lineup for this year&apos;s event reads like a festival hall of fame. It gives indulgent centre stage to former Palme d&apos;Or winners such as Quentin Tarantino, Jane Campion, Lars von Trier and Ken Loach, and old faithfuls like Michael Haneke, Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Gaspar No\u00e9 and Ang Lee. Variety magazine hailed it as &quot;Cannes&apos;s biggest heavyweight auteur smackdown in recent years&quot;. Two British films are among the 20 nominees for the all-important Palme d&apos;Or award. Loach will be hoping that his social-realist fairytale Looking for Eric can repeat the feat of his 2006 prize-winner The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Showcasing a wry turn from Eric Cantona, Loach&apos;s film concerns a glum postman who receives some Gallic life lessons from the former Manchester United striker. Looking for Eric is joined in competition by the coming-of-age drama Fish Tank, the second film from writer-director Andrea Arnold. Three years ago, Arnold won the jury prize with her acclaimed debut feature, Red Road. &quot;British film is flying right now,&quot; John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council, said today. &quot;This year&apos;s Cannes lineup shows that the British industry is delivering world-class cinema which complements the kind of commercial success that was recognised at the Oscars earlier this year.&quot; For good measure, Woodward pointed out that another nominee, Jane Campion&apos;s Bright Star, was also buttressed by lottery funding. Charting the romance of the poet John Keats and his muse Fanny Brawne, the film stars Ben Whishaw and Abbie Cornish. Elsewhere the news was less encouraging for US cinema, with Quentin Tarantino&apos;s gore-soaked Inglourious Basterds the sole American film selected for the main competition. Described by its director as &quot;a spaghetti western but with world war two iconography&quot;, the picture stars Brad Pitt as a gung-ho army lieutenant, rattling hell-for-leather across Europe on the hunt for Nazi scalps. Other potential highlights include Antichrist, a satanic horror film from Lars von Trier, Ang Lee&apos;s hippie saga Taking Woodstock, and Broken Embraces, a psychological thriller that reunites Pedro Almod\u00f3var with his favourite actor, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. Heavily tipped to win the top prize for Hidden back in 2005, the Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke gets another bite at the cherry with The White Ribbon, in which a rural school in 1900s German becomes a petri dish for fascism. Terry Gilliam&apos;s The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus will play out of competition. The film showcases the final screen outing of Heath Ledger, who died midway through production. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell were later drafted in to complete the picture. Today&apos;s announcement ensures that the Cannes organisers have at least arranged an enticing shop-window display. However, the festival&apos;s success is largely decided behind the scenes \u2013 in the marketplace behind the Palais where thousands of film titles are snapped up by international distributors. It remains to be seen whether the cash flows as freely this year. Festival director Gilles Jacob has predicted that visitor numbers are likely to drop, while Vanity Fair has already cancelled its traditional black-tie ball. Elsewhere, yacht rental firms have reported a marked decline in business, suggesting that the usual Cannes fraternity of millionaire executives and playboy high-rollers could well be steering clear. The 62nd edition of the Cannes film festival opens on 13 May with the world premiere of the Pixar animation Up, about an old man who tethers helium balloons to his house and wafts off in search of adventure. Organisers will no doubt be hoping that the film&apos;s buoyant, optimistic mood turns out to be contagious. The curtain comes down 11 days later with a screening of a ritzy biopic, Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinski, directed by Jan Kounen.

Today the erstwhile Charlie Ray Wiggins is relaxed and dapper in the London office of his record company, yet despite all the evidence, it&apos;s not always easy being Raphael Saadiq. &quot;I like to say it&apos;s like bein&apos; a smart person that&apos;s very good at math, but you don&apos;t really need your friends to know that you&apos;re really that good,&quot; he says, as he starts to explain why it&apos;s only on his third solo studio album, The Way I See It, that he&apos;s been able to make music that directly references the classic soul sounds he grew up with. &quot;You could engineer a bridge, but people don&apos;t really need to know that, so you don&apos;t let that part out. I felt like, at this point, I&apos;ll just let you know, &apos;This is what&apos;s left for me, to really explore what I like to do.&apos;&quot; It&apos;s perhaps a strange revelation from an artist who appears to have done more than most to reimagine soul and R&amp;B as future-oriented musics. After years alongside his brother and cousin in the group Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! and pioneering production work for the likes of D&apos;Angelo, Bilal and John Legend, The Way I See It finds Saadiq getting in touch with his inner Motown. It&apos;s not the recent successes of the Winehouses and the Duffys that have turned his head: the majority of the album was made three years ago, before Back to Black made retro-sounding new-school soul one of the most saleable musical commodities. And anyway, he argues, it&apos;s about time black musicians felt able to reference their musical heritage more directly. &quot;I feel like a lot of white bands do it all the time,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to see another white-boy band come out and do a Motown sound, while all the black dudes are singin&apos; with that thing [autotune] on their voices, rappin&apos; and doin&apos; all kindsa tap dancin&apos;. I was like, &apos;No! I&apos;m not gonna let the Killers come out and be in some suits an&apos; some ties, and somebody else comes out doin&apos; the Beatles, when I eat and sleep that!&apos; Not to take anything from them - I love it when bands like the Killers or the Kings of Leon go back and pull somethin&apos; from the past and make it theirs, I think that&apos;s the best thing. But I don&apos;t see too many urban groups doin&apos; it.&quot;  If it requires the kind of cast-list that Saadiq has assembled, maybe the lack of competition is easier to comprehend. As well as Stevie Wonder&apos;s late-night dash to answer his distress call (&quot;He picked up the phone and said &apos;What&apos;s up, fool?&apos; He called me &apos;fool&apos;! I said, &apos;Man, I need you on this record really bad.&apos; He said, &apos;When do you need me?&apos; I said, &apos;An hour,&apos; thinkin&apos; maybe he&apos;d say &apos;I&apos;ll come next week.&apos; And he just came right over that night&quot;), he also called on Joss Stone and veteran Motown percussionist Jack Ashford. &quot;On Sure Hope You Mean It, Jack played the bells,&quot; Raphael recalls. &quot;He was supposed to play a different line, but he did his own thing, and it was magical. When you&apos;ve got a veteran in the room, you don&apos;t say anything. And Joss? The Brits need to not be so hard on her. I&apos;ve been around a lot of soulful people, and she has it. When she opens up her mouth to sing, you feel it.&quot; Saadiq was born in Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco, the second-youngest of 14 siblings and half-siblings. &quot;I grew up in a neighbourhood where I was the rare person,&quot; he reflects. &quot;I was the person drivin&apos; a moped, listenin&apos; to Dirty Mind or Octopus&apos;s Garden. You&apos;re drivin&apos; through a ghetto, but you&apos;re listenin&apos; to Prince or the Beatles. I was makin&apos; my own little movie in my head.&quot; His obsession and aptitude for music put him in the right place at the right time shortly after his 18th birthday in 1984. He was hanging out in an Oakland studio when a call came in announcing an audition was being held the following day in San Francisco, with places in the touring band for Prince protegee Sheila E up for grabs. While others were decked out in Prince-inspired clothes, working on their dance moves in the queue, Wiggins, in baseball cap and jeans, quietly went about his business. Unimpressed with Sheila&apos;s sister, who he felt had too much attitude, he gave a spur-of-the-moment false name; and rather than lose face when Sheila told him he&apos;d got the job, he had to quickly learn to answer to the name Raphael. &quot;Next thing I was in Tokyo, in a stadium, singin&apos; Erotic City,&quot; he marvels. &quot;We were in huge venues with the biggest sound systems in the world; all these roadies throwin&apos; me basses, and a bunch of models hangin&apos; round Prince to party. For almost two years. That was my university.&quot; With Prince&apos;s band, the Revolution, &quot;on the outs,&quot;, the teenage newcomer often found himself playing bass with the headliner at after-gig club shows. &quot;I think he liked my feel, otherwise he wouldn&apos;t have invited me to play,&quot; Saadiq reasons. &quot;He introduced us to some nice girls, too. He was really cool about that: he&apos;d always walk up to you and say, &apos;There enough girls here for you tonight?&apos; Yes, sir!&quot; &quot;University&quot; over, he returned to Oakland, and got serious about Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! Initially, Raphael was content to let other members produce, but by the time of their second album, in 1990, all the band were involved in crafting the sound. He adopted the surname Saadiq - it means &quot;man of his word&quot; in Arabic, though he is not a Muslim - to avoid confusion in writing and production credits with his brother, Dwayne , who was also in the group. &quot;I started feeling the at-homeness,&quot; Saadiq says of becoming a producer. &quot;You could go outside, get something to eat, go back in the studio: no &apos;Flight out at four, Raphael - meet you downstairs in five minutes ... &apos; In my heart I love performing just as much, but I think producing is somethin&apos; everybody should do.&quot; By the time the Tonys made their last album in 1996, Saadiq was established as a songwriter, producer and session bass player, roles he has sustained alongside projects such as the short-lived supergroup Lucy Pearl (with A Tribe Called Quest producer and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and En Vogue singer Dawn Robinson) and a solo career that began with the acclaimed Instant Vintage album in 2002. In 1998, he spent a few days working with D&apos;Angelo on the singer&apos;s second album, but the painful pace of the protracted sessions at Electric Lady studios in New York meant Saadiq couldn&apos;t hang around to complete anything. &quot;His manager said he was a little upset,&quot; Saadiq smiles, &quot;but I&apos;m an Oakland boy - we don&apos;t care! A month and a half later I was in New York, walkin&apos; through the Village with this girl, and I wanted a spliff. I was really bein&apos; a little disrespectful - just knock on the door and be like, &apos;Yo, gimme a spliff,&apos; when he&apos;s supposed to be mad at me. But that&apos;s what I did! He ran up to the door and said, &apos;Aaaaah! We gotta do somethin&apos;!&apos;&quot; By the time Saadiq left a few hours later, the pair had finished a track. Untitled (How Does It Feel) won best male R&amp;B vocal at the Grammys in 2000. After so many years being so many different things to so many different people, helping others find a voice for their own hurts and heartaches, it&apos;s a little odd that, aside from a brief mention on Instant Vintage&apos;s first track, Saadiq has kept his own pain and loss out of his music. &quot;My brother was murdered when I was seven,&quot; he says, matter-of-factly. &quot;Then another brother ODed - heroin - and my other brother committed suicide because he couldn&apos;t get off drugs. My sister was a singer, she sang blues. A cop was chasin&apos; some kid through a residential neighbourhood, and the kid killed her when he ran into her car. And through all of that I was makin&apos; records, but it wasn&apos;t comin&apos; out in the music. I did it to kinda show people you can have some real tough things happen in your life, but you don&apos;t have to wear it on your sleeve.&quot; There are no dark clouds hovering over The Way I See It; the record is a euphoric celebration, made by someone who has spent a lifetime getting to trust his intuition. &quot;I was more or less makin&apos; a record that I like,&quot; he says. &quot;Goin&apos; on stage and playin&apos; these songs is the most natural I&apos;ve ever felt in my whole career. It took me a while to be able to say that; I&apos;ve made so many records and performed so many times I wasn&apos;t sure what I was feelin&apos; was true. But I&apos;m more open with myself on the stage, and I feel that everybody&apos;s there with me and we&apos;re all gettin&apos; something really big out of it, together. The energy goes both ways, from the listeners to me and the band, and everybody has the same feeling. Through rough times we&apos;re getting this vibration - which is how it&apos;s supposed to be.&quot; \u2022 Raphael Saadiq plays at the IndigO2 in London on Monday 27 April."}, {"sentences": ["A Japanese pop star was released today after being detained overnight for allegedly being naked and drunk in a Tokyo park, police said.", "After police questioning and a search of his apartment, Kusanagi was further questioned by prosecutors, who decided on his release, a Tokyo Metropolitan police spokesman said on condition of anonymity, citing department policy."], "tags": ["Japan", "Music", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T08:18:02Z", "title": "Police release pop star found drunk and naked in Japanese park", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/24/japanese-pop-star-naked-park", "article": "A Japanese pop star was released today after being detained overnight for allegedly being naked and drunk in a Tokyo park, police said. Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, a member of hugely popular group Smap, was arrested yesterday after neighbours complained to police that a drunk man was a making a fuss in the park in Roppongi district. Dozens of reporters and photographers waited outside the Harajuku police station where Kusanagi was held. A silver van carrying him drove quickly away, its curtains tightly closed. After police questioning and a search of his apartment, Kusanagi was further questioned by prosecutors, who decided on his release, a Tokyo Metropolitan police spokesman said on condition of anonymity, citing department policy. Police seized nothing from his apartment. Kusanagi has not been charged. Public indecency carries a penalty of up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 300,000 yen (\u00a32,100). Public broadcaster NHK said prosecutors decided to release Kusanagi because there is no concern that he would flee or destroy evidence. Kusanagi&apos;s arrest has been the top news item in Japan, with major TV networks making frequent reports. At the time of his arrest, Kusanagi was sitting on the grass, naked and heavily intoxicated, police said. Media reports said he drank more than 10 glasses of Japanese rice wine and beer before going to the park and had no idea why he undressed himself. Kusanagi surged to stardom after his debut in 1991 as part of the five-member Smap, which dominated Japan&apos;s pop music scene, and starred in TV dramas and films. Kusanagi is also popular in South Korea. Toyota Motor and Procter &amp; Gamble were among a handful of companies to cancel commercials featuring the star, while several television programmes in which he was to appear have been suspended."}, {"sentences": ["The Briton, a former Foreign and Commonwealth diplomat based in Tokyo, claimed this week that a top-three finish was within her grasp, specifying a time of 2hr 22min, three minutes inside her best."], "tags": ["London Marathon", "Athletics", "Paula Radcliffe", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T19:22:47Z", "title": "Race director Dave Bedford happy with London Marathon mix of celebrity and elite", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/24/london-marathon-dave-bedford-elite-celebrities", "article": "The 29th London Marathon takes over the capital&apos;s streets tomorrow but despite the prospect of world and Olympic champions running a course-record time, the shortage of elite British interest continues to cast a shadow over the race. When Paula Radcliffe, the world record holder, broke a toe last month the home interest was left with Mara Yamauchi, who finished sixth in the Beijing Olympic final, and Tomas Abyu, ranked outside the top 250 marathon runners last year. Last week Brendan Foster accused the London Marathon of failing in its objective of nurturing British endurance running, but the race director and former 10,000m world record holder, Dave Bedford, yesterday denied that the event is losing its way in a maze of celebrity couples and banana costumes. &quot;There is nothing Mickey Mouse about having world record holders and Olympic champions and world champions competing,&quot; said Bedford. &quot;The Mickey Mouse bit is something else way down the field and you cannot link this issue with that fact that British runners are not performing.&quot; The elite fields may be impressive, but when the press conferences were held this week by far the largest turnout was for the celebrity runners Katie Price and Peter Andre. &quot;We need the celebrity side of things so we hit the newspapers and people who aren&apos;t directly interested in the sporting bit,&quot; said Bedford. &quot;I think it&apos;s the combination and the mix \u2013 and really, without the elite field, arguably stronger this year than the Olympic line-up, we wouldn&apos;t have the TV coverage we have.&quot; Bedford conceded that elite distance running in this country is in a poor state. &quot;It was only five years ago that Paula Radcliffe was the first Briton home, male or female \u2013 if that&apos;s not an indictment I don&apos;t know what is. That may sound sexist but in distance running that is a sad state of affairs.&quot; At the head of the men&apos;s field the pacemakers have been instructed to run at a pace of 2hr 4min, which would eclipse the course record of 2:05.15 run by Martin Lel last April. The Kenyan has struggled with a minor hip injury this week and returns to London after managing only fifth place at the Olympics. Those who could scupper his chances this time include Kenya&apos;s Olympic gold medallist Samuel Wanjiru, Jaouad Gharib of Morocco \u2013 the silver medallist in Beijing \u2013 and Ethiopia&apos;s Tsegaye Kebede, who took bronze last summer. Another threat is Zersenay Tadese, the Eritrean who became a national hero when he won his country&apos;s first ever Olympic medal in 2004 by taking bronze over 10,000m. In the women&apos;s event the Olympic champion Constantina Dita arrives having failed in London on her seven previous attempts. Challenging her for the title are Catherine Ndereba, of Kenya, who took gold at the last world championships and silvers at the last two Olympic Games, Germany&apos;s defending champion Irina Mikitenko, China&apos;s Zhou Chunxiu who took bronze in Beijing, and the 35-year-old Yamauchi. The Briton, a former Foreign and Commonwealth diplomat based in Tokyo, claimed this week that a top-three finish was within her grasp, specifying a time of 2hr 22min, three minutes inside her best. She has claimed that living in Japan, where marathon running is taken very seriously, has motivated her to train harder. The wheelchair race can provide some home comfort. Shelley Woods finished just outside the medals, claiming fourth place in Beijing to go with the silver and bronze medals she won over the shorter distances, while David Weir \u2013 who was too exhausted to take part in the Beijing marathon \u2013 sets out to defend the London title he has won for the past three years.

According to the Pakistani security analyst Amir Mir, at most 6% of missile strikes hit their intended militant targets. People living close to Taliban-held parts of Orakzai Agency told me they often hear drones whirling overhead like giant, distant flies. The drones have created a general sense of terror among the population and the fear that they may fall victim to the next missile strike. The Pakistan army too has killed many civilians and, according to human rights organisations, displaced up to a million more. Although a precise number is not available, the death toll from army operations is estimated to be in the thousands. The army looks like a foreign occupier in these fiercely independent lands. From mountain-top bases in Kohat army guns pound far-away peaks in far-away Taliban strongholds after nightfall. The powerful vibrations that follow each volley echo through the valleys like a thunderstorm. A storm of discontent has already infected the population. &quot;You get used to it [the sound of mortars],&quot; says Gul Khan, &quot;but always you think of your wife and children. They get very scared.&quot; Sometimes, the ordnance misfires and lands in farmland and, occasionally, villages. The army and paramilitary police man numerous checkpoints, and it is not uncommon to see the rubble of a government building that has been struck by a suicide bomber. But by night the Taliban travel freely through districts nominally under army control, and the locals advise against leaving the safety of the village for the highways where kidnappings are common. Attacks on Pakistan army and government targets occur on an almost daily basis. The vast majority of those are in the tribal agencies or North-West Frontier Province where the Taliban recruit most of their fighters. The Taliban have expanded their insurgency through these same areas with alarming speed, much to the shock of the international community. US secretary of state Hillary Clinton described Pakistan as a &quot;mortal threat&quot; to the world following Pakistan&apos;s formal approval of de facto Taliban rule in the lower Himalayan Swat valley. The Zardari government caved in after fears that its refusal to approve the measure would lead to a fresh round of hostilities. That was not the end of it, though. The Guardian reports that in the Buner district neighbouring Swat, a mere 100km from Islamabad, the Taliban now run checkpoints \u2013 much like the army in areas it controls \u2013 and have occupied government buildings and ordered bureaucrats and aid workers to leave the vicinity. Slightly to the west, an uneasy truce between the provincial government and the Taliban in Bajaur tribal agencies risks turning into an all-out civil war as militants from Tehreek-e-Nifaaz-e-Sharriat-e-Mohammadi \u2013 the same group that brokered the Swat peace deal on behalf of the Taliban \u2013 clash with their Taliban counterparts. According to one of the US government&apos;s chief counter-insurgency strategists, Pakistan &quot;could collapse within months&quot;. Rather than quick, violent disintegration, however, the real threat to Pakistan is a slow and equally brutal Balkanisation where loyalties, and conflict, may increasingly be drawn upon ethnic lines. From its very creation, Pakistan has struggled to find a national identity beyond the ethnic fault lines that for centuries defined the region&apos;s different communities. As the government struggles to deliver the basics to a population in the grip of grinding poverty \u2013 the United Nations Human Development Report 2007/08 conservatively estimates that 32.6% of Pakistanis live in poverty \u2013 ethnic nationalism has, for many and not just tribal Pakhtuns, become a panacea for their tribulations. The paradox of the Taliban is that although they are ostensibly not nationalists their insurgency is largely fuelled by disaffected young Pakhtun men who, with few other prospects, are lured by tribal honour and the respect garnered from fighting the Pakistan army, seen as a proxy for the United States. For disfranchised, highly patriarchal tribal societies, long instilled with a warrior culture that is not an insignificant thing. In the Kohat and Dera Adam Khel tribal areas just south of Peshawar, where I travelled last week, support for the Taliban is extraordinarily high \u2013 even among those who do not agree with their strict social precepts. As in other areas, the Taliban have successfully exploited resentment towards a largely non-existent government. That support appears to have two key elements. First, it is a response to the local and federal governments&apos; abject failure to provide livelihoods and services and crackdown on rampant corruption. Second, the Taliban have won respect and prestige with their resilience against the better-equipped Pakistan army, with its jet fighters and tanks, and United States&apos; missile strikes. There is also widespread refusal to acknowledge the Taliban&apos;s capacity to wreak violence and oppression on the areas it occupies. Often, for instance, I was asked if I believed stories of the recent flogging of a young woman in Swat. The incident \u2013 captured on video and widely distributed throughout Pakistan and the world last month \u2013 caused uproar even among people in these parts. Many are sceptical of such incidents, stating that they have been manufactured to discredit the Taliban and Islam. With confidence in the government so low, it isn&apos;t difficult to understand where the scepticism comes from. &quot;The solution to Pakistan&apos;s problems is to follow [the Taliban&apos;s understanding of] Islam,&quot; says Ahmed Gulzai, a mid-ranking Taliban activist who only last year was fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Now he is proselytising to the youth at a village madrasa. &quot;The elite don&apos;t want the Taliban [to rule the country] because then they won&apos;t be able to keep stealing the society&apos;s wealth,&quot; he notes. &quot;Things will be much better under the Taliban, there will be no corruption. If something is worth 100,000 Rupees, it will be sold at 100,000 Rupees.&quot; The war with the Taliban has been sold for a lot more. According to a Guardian report in February, up to 70% of all military aid since 2002 may have been misappropriated. Pakistan&apos;s elite may soon have more billions to play with. The Friends of Democratic Pakistan \u2013 a group of 31 nations including the United States and Britain and a number of international organisations like the World Bank and the United nations \u2013 pledged donations totalling $5.28bn in Tokyo last week. Then there is a further $7.5bn over five years in non-military aid that the Obama administration is considering furnishing to Pakistan. Military aid is expected to be even greater. Pakistan has also received a $7.6bn loan from the International Monetary Fund, while the World Bank has given another $500m. But without a concerted, genuine battle for hearts and minds in the tribal areas that addresses core grievances, no sums of cash will stem the Taliban. \u2022 The names above have been changed to protect the identities of people interviewed."}, {"sentences": ["I&apos;ve been fixated with Japan since a trip to Tokyo earlier this year, so the other day I went to the Japan Centre on Piccadilly to breathe a bit of that special air.", "I was disappointed - a certain lack of attention to detail has turned it into a much more London experience than a Tokyo one."], "tags": ["Vegetarian food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Vegetarianism"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T23:01:00Z", "title": "The new vegetarian: Yotam Ottolenghi gives aubergines  a Japanese- flavoured makeover", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/25/aubergine-miso-cabbage-yotam-ottolenghi", "article": "I&apos;ve been fixated with Japan since a trip to Tokyo earlier this year, so the other day I went to the Japan Centre on Piccadilly to breathe a bit of that special air.

The World Health Organisation stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert over the swine flu strain \u2013 a unique mix of human, pig and bird viruses \u2013 but its director general, Dr Margaret Chan, said the option remained &quot;on the table&quot;. The virus, which may be responsible for a further 48 deaths in Mexico, has thrown the country into confusion. There are a total of 1,004 cases and eight have been detected over the border in Texas and California. Today, people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands, football matches went ahead without spectators, theatres, shops and museums closed, staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant and health workers patrolled buses, ordering sickly-looking people home. Scientists have long feared that a new flu virus could launch a worldwide pandemic. Evolving when different flu viruses infect a pig, a person or a bird, mingling their genetic material, the hybrid could spread quickly because people would have no natural defences. &quot;We are seeing a range of severity of the disease, from mild to severe and of course death,&quot; said Chan. &quot;The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease.&quot; In New York the results of tests for swine flu on 75 children remain unclear after a school trip returned from Mexico with pupils complaining of illness. Mexico&apos;s health secretary Jose Angel Cordova said: &quot;We are very, very concerned.&quot; Any doubts over of the extent of the emergency were dispelled today by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City&apos;s central Reforma boulevard. With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms, queues sprouted at health clinics and hospitals across the city. President Felipe Calder\u00f3n said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type \u2013 labelled A/H1N1 \u2013 not previously seen in pigs or humans. Few cases have had any contact with live pigs. The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus, avian virus and pig viruses from North America, Europe and Asia. It might be completely new or has only now been detected. Given how quickly flu can spread, there might be cases incubating around the world already, said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota: &quot;Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out [of Mexico] every day. You&apos;d have to believe there&apos;s been more unrecognised transmission that&apos;s occurred.&quot; It was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer. A &quot;seed stock&quot; genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centers for Disease Control. If the US government decides vaccine \u00adproduction is necessary, it would be used by manufacturers to get started. At Mexico City&apos;s international airport, passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aeroplanes and \u00adspreading the disease. Britain&apos;s Foreign Office issued a warning to travellers about the outbreak but stopped short of recommending people did not visit Mexico. US health officials did the same, urging visitors to wash their hands frequently. In Asia, which has fought hard to contain the H5N1 bird flu virus, which has killed at least 257 people worldwide since late 2003, tighter enforcements were being made. Passengers and pork products from Mexico were being checked at many airports. Health authorities in Thailand and Hong Kong said they were closely monitoring the situation. At Tokyo&apos;s Narita airport \u2013 among the world&apos;s busiest with more than 96,000 people using it daily \u2013 officials installed a device at the arrival gate for flights from Mexico to measure the temperatures of passengers. &apos;We are increasing health surveillance following the outbreak of swine flu,&apos;&apos; said Akira Yukitoki, an official at the Japanese airport&apos;s quarantine station. He said 160 passengers arriving from Mexico yesterday were screened. The airport also plans to put up signs urging tourists to &quot;wear masks, wash hands and gargle&quot;, Yukitoki said. In the Philippines, the government was also tightening monitoring at all ports to prevent the entry of any pigs or pork from Mexico and the US. &quot;We&apos;ve seen swine influenza in humans over the past several years, and in most cases, it&apos;s come from direct pig contact. This seems to be different,&quot; said Dr Arnold Monto, a flu expert with the University of Michigan. &quot;I think we need to be careful and not apprehensive, but certainly paying attention to new developments as they proceed.&quot; While the fear is palpable among Mexico City&apos;s 20 million residents, confusion mixed with traditional mistrust of official statements means widespread suspicion that the government is not telling the whole truth about the disease. The government had claimed until late on Thursday that there was nothing unusual about the flu cases and the sudden turnaround that saw schools closed across the capital on Friday angered many Mexicans. Government workers were ordered to wear masks, and authorities urged residents to stay home from work if they felt ill. What seems almost certain is that the doors of all nurseries, kindergartens, schools and universities in the vast metropolis of 20 million people will remain closed this week. With the authorities urging people to avoid crowds, the atmosphere inside the metro and crowded buses is notably tense. Health secretary Cordova, a devout Catholic, stopped short of urging Mexicans not to go to mass tomorrow, but he did emphasise that a nod of the head was better than a handshake when it came to greeting friends."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;The JCP of today is very different,&quot; said Go Ito, a professor of politics at Meiji University in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-27T18:02:03Z", "title": "Disgruntled Japanese turn to resurgent communists", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/27/japanese-communist-party-resurgence", "article": "Faced with an economy in steep decline, rising unemployment and an uncertain future, a growing number of Japanese are shunning the conservative consensus and turning instead to a new brand of cuddly communism. While the leaders of Japan&apos;s two main political parties battle poor opinion poll ratings and accusations of sleaze, the Japanese Communist party (JCP) has seen its fortunes transformed after years of being dismissed as an irrelevant hangover from the cold war. In the last 16 months membership has soared to more than 410,000 as the revamped party courts younger voters from the working poor. Of the 14,000 \u00adpeople to have joined since the end of 2007, about a quarter are aged under 30, the party says. That contrasts with the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), whose membership has plummeted from 5 million at its peak to about a million today. By dispensing with ideological rhetoric and focusing on welfare and jobs, the JCP has struck a chord with students, the unemployed and the estimated 10 million Japanese earning less than 2m yen (about \u00a314,000) a year. Yasuhisa Wakabayashi is typical of the new Japanese communist. The 23-year-old Yokohama factory worker joined the party in January. &quot;Unlike the mainstream parties, the communists aren&apos;t interested in seeking donations from major corporations,&quot; he said. &quot;They talk about education and welfare and the problems of ordinary people. And they are honest.&quot; The JCP is making its presence felt on the internet. Among its clips is a rousing tirade by the party&apos;s affable leader, Kazuo Ishii, against the exploitation of contract workers, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube. The circulation of its official newspaper Akahata (the Red Flag) has risen for eight straight months to 1.6m, although it is still a long way short of its 1980 peak of 3.5m. The JCP also owes some of its success to a novel published in 1929. Kanikosen (The Crab Ship), a Marxist-inspired account of rebellion, sold over half a million copies last year after it became required reading on restless university campuses. Despite its resurgence, few believe the party will play a pivotal role in national politics. It has just nine seats in the 480-seat lower house, and is hampered by an electoral system that penalises minor parties. JCP officials insist they will play no part in a coalition, not even if it means turfing the LDP out of office for only the second time in 54 years. &quot;We would co-operate on individual policies but we wouldn&apos;t be part of a coalition,&quot; said Kimitoshi Morihara of the party&apos;s international bureau. &quot;There is no difference between the LDP and Minshuto [the main opposition party] on the economy, defence or any of the big issues of the day. But we are different.&quot; The JCP is barely recognisable from the party of 30 years ago. Now, dialectic materialism has been replaced by a commitment to &quot;democratic change within the current framework of capitalism&quot;. &quot;The JCP of today is very different,&quot; said Go Ito, a professor of politics at Meiji University in Tokyo. &quot;The modern party is pragmatic, which is why it has managed to tap into the dissatisfaction being felt right across Japanese society.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Since 2003 and the war in Iraq, he has spoken out about the war when he was playing in any country that supported it: even, in Tokyo, giving a speech about international geo-politics in Japanese."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-28T12:28:47Z", "title": "Why Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman was right to speak out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/apr/28/pianist-krystian-zimerman", "article": "Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman&apos;s political speech during his debut recital at Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles shocked his Californian audience. He told the Americans to &quot;Get your hands off my country&quot;, before he played Polish composer Karol Szymanowski&apos;s Variations on a Polish Theme. But Zimerman has a track record with making political comment part of his concerts. Since 2003 and the war in Iraq, he has spoken out about the war when he was playing in any country that supported it: even, in Tokyo, giving a speech about international geo-politics in Japanese. This time, it&apos;s Obama&apos;s decision to continue the Bush policy of building a missile defence shield in Poland that has angered him \u2013 so much so that he said to the audience in Los Angeles that this would be his last appearance in America. When I met Zimerman last year to interview him for Music Matters, I asked him if he really thought this kind of protest was the best way of making a point. His answer was that he couldn&apos;t in good conscience play to an audience in a country whose political leaders he disagreed with, without making some kind of stand. Zimerman isn&apos;t na\u00efve enough to think that his way of speaking out is going to change US policy in Eastern Europe. But he feels his music making can only speak to listeners who understand where he&apos;s coming from.  It may have been clumsy \u2013 the Los Angeles Times&apos;s critic Mark Swed said that Zimerman&apos;s voice was &quot;quiet but angry&quot; and &quot;did not project well&quot; \u2013 but I admire Zimerman&apos;s convictions. Gumbel says that &quot;classical musicians are not exactly famous for political ranting&quot;. I don&apos;t agree: from Paderewski, Poland&apos;s piano virtuoso prime minister, to Hanns Eisler, from Cornelius Cardew to Kurt Masur, countless classical composers and performers have been just as vocal and committed in their political beliefs as have any other musicians. It&apos;s probable Zimerman only made his speech because of the Polish music he was about to play. Playing Bach and Beethoven is one thing, but performing Szymanowski&apos;s virtuosic Polish Variations for the exotic East-European delectation of a Los Angeles audience must have stuck in Zimerman&apos;s craw. Which is why he exploded, in his &quot;quiet but angry&quot; way.  The reaction of the audience, from cheering to walk-outs, showed that Zimerman touched a nerve, both in potentially offending his Californian hosts, and in breaking the invisible wall that often separates classical musicians from their audiences. I&apos;m glad Zimerman isn&apos;t afraid to shatter that barrier, and to show that however cut off from the world a celebrity recital in a glitzy hall might seem to be, it&apos;s not. In Berkeley, an earlier leg of Zimerman&apos;s US tour, he asked the audience to appreciate how Bach&apos;s music could be heard as political: the Second Partita was composed in a minor key, perhaps, Zimerman said, because there was a leader that Bach didn&apos;t like. Zimerman ended the piece in C major, instead of the C minor that Bach writes, a sly indication that Zimerman approves of Obama more than Bush. But not enough, apparently, to play in America again. I hope, for the US, that he changes his mind (he&apos;s made the same promise about never playing in the States before, but then returned). Performers have every right to remind us of the political and social systems that connect us all, and to confront audiences with the difficult musical meanings that are latent in any concert programme.

The Wall Street Journal reported today that the stress tests conducted by the US government on 19 banks found that Citi and Bank of America both need more funds to cover future losses caused by the economic downturn. The US government conducted the stress tests in an attempt to identify which financial institutions are well positioned to ride out the slump and which are too burdened by toxic assets and bad debts. Both banks are said to be disputing the preliminary findings. The final results of the stress tests are due to be published next week. Shares in both banks fell by almost 7% in early trading on Wall Street. The report also sent shares falling in Asia and Europe, where FTSE 100 index lost more than 100 points at one stage to hit 4058, with banks among the biggest fallers. Traders warned that if Citi and Bank of America are both short of funds, then other banks would also need to increase their capital reserves. Analysts had already predicted that several other companies, such as Wells Fargo and some regional banks, would perform poorly on the tests. &quot;Traders are seeing new short positions enter the market, as opposed to the profit-taking that has taken the edge off the strong run-up of late,&quot; said Manus Cranny, senior market commentator of MF Global Spreads. Shareholder pressure The Federal Reserve asked banks to estimate their losses based on several economic scenarios, in which GDP, unemployment and house prices fell by varying amounts. According to the WSJ, banks that are asked to raise more capital after the stress tests will not be declared insolvent. Citi and Bank of America are both under heavy pressure from shareholders, despite posting better-than-expected results for the first three months of 2009. At Citi, chief executive Vikram Pandit has been criticised for not cleaning up its balance sheet faster. Bank of America&apos;s boss, Ken Lewis,  could be ousted as chairman at an annual general meeting tomorrow. Investors are furious that Lewis paid $50bn (\u00a335bn) for Merrill Lynch before it became clear quite how much Merrill had lost in the crisis.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 2%, with Cathay Pacific down 8%, Air China off 13% and China Southern Airlines falling 15%. Luxury hotel operator Shangri-La dropped 8.7%. In London, Carnival - the cruise operator - fell by almost 5%, with TUI Travel down by 3.5% and British Airways losing 5.7%. Shares in luxury goods makers also came under pressure, as traders anticipated lower sales at airports if swine flu has a significant long-term impact on travellers. Burberry fell by almost 6.5%, Christian Dior lost 2.8%, and Swatch dropped over 5%. Analysts at Bernstein warned that a serious epidemic could be a &quot;perfect storm&quot; for the international travel sector. &quot;Assuming swine flu was like Sars \u2013 ie far from devastating but serious enough \u2013 the more probable risk for luxury goods stocks is short-term weakness,&quot; Bernstein said.

A few of the audience walked out, while others stayed to remonstrate. Responses on the LA Times culture blog were vividly divided. Most of the audience, though, cheered, and rightly so. Mr Zimerman feels passionately about US foreign policy - on one occasion he treated a Tokyo audience to a short speech on the subject in Japanese. All this makes some feel uneasy, but these are angry times and Mr Zimerman feels he must make a stand so that audiences understand where he is coming from.

In the rarefied circumstances of a classical-music concert, such acts are almost unheard of. Andrew Clements, the Guardian&apos;s music critic, says he has never witnessed anything like it. Zimerman himself, though, has recently begun to make a habit of such speechifying, regularly vocalising his opposition to the Iraq war (in Tokyo, he even registered his political views in Japanese). And in the pop and folk worlds, such interventions are much less rare - as when Rage Against the Machine came onstage at Reading last year dressed in Guant\u00e1namo-prisoner-style costumes; or, at the 2005 Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre, when Patti Smith wove a stream-of-consciousness tirade against child labour into her performance. Which isn&apos;t to say that pointed political statements are absent from classical music: far from it. When the North Ossetian conductor Valery Gergiev - a friend of Vladimir Putin&apos;s - performed Shostakovich&apos;s Seventh Symphony in South Ossetia last year in the wake of the conflict with Georgia, he was making a statement as eloquent as if he had made a speech from the stage. That symphony could not be more loaded as a symbol of Russian nationalism: it was premiered during the siege of Leningrad in 1942 by a makeshift, enfeebled and malnourished orchestra. Leonard Bernstein famously conducted Beethoven&apos;s Ninth at a concert shortly after the fall of the Berlin wall; and, in 1968, Rostropovich, the Azerbaijani cellist, performed the Dvorak Cello Concerto with the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra at the Proms - on the day the tanks rolled into Prague. The atmosphere was tense and the mood ran high against the Russians - but Rostropovich&apos;s performance went down in history as one of the most heartfelt and emotional ever given.

Skip to February 2008 and I&apos;m being rushed into emergency surgery as part of my spine has collapsed due to a rare bone tumour. The resulting damage to my spinal cord meant I was paralysed from the chest down with little hope of ever being able to walk again. I then began six months of intensive rehab, learning how to dress myself, get out of bed, make tea and to control my wheelchair well enough to not run over the nurses&apos; toes or trash displays in supermarkets. When I was discharged I was more determined than ever to not let my disability get in the way of my music career. The first steps were to build up my stomach muscles enough to be able to sing and hold a guitar without keeling over and having to get someone to prop me back up again. A friend who played orchestral percussion helped me develop a new way of playing the drums, using two beaters in each hand, rather like marimba/vibraphone players, which enabled me to cover all the beats that I used to play with my foot pedals. So by the end of summer, I was ready to perform again, starting with some small acoustic gigs and radio sessions in my home town of Nottingham. Since then both of my bands have played shows in London, had airplay on BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 music, BBC Ouch! Podcast, and we&apos;ve even made the top 100 of the US college radio charts!

He has died aged 43 from heart failure in Bangkok, where he had gone to view the rough-cut of his latest production, Nymph.  In its first years Fortissimo worked principally as a sales agent, but in 2000 Barendrecht embarked on work as executive producer with Clara Law&apos;s The Goddess of 1967. In the past seven years he was producer, co-producer or executive producer on more than 30 films, including works by European directors such as Peter Greenaway, Alex van Warmerdam, B\u00e9la Tarr and Sergei Bodrov and the American gay directors Gregg Araki and John Cameron Mitchell, whose Shortbus shocked and invigorated Cannes audiences in 2006. The greater part of Barendrecht&apos;s work, however, was with Asian directors. In Thailand, where he established a second home, he had worked with Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang, for whom he produced four films, including the still-unfinished Nymph. Springtime in a Small Town (2002) revived the career of the mainland Chinese director Tian Zhuangzhuang, who had been prevented from making a film for nine years after his film Blue Kite was overly critical of the Chinese government. Recent notable prize-winning films have included Zhang Yang&apos;s Getting Home (2007) and Kiyoshi Kurosawa&apos;s Tokyo Sonata (2008), which won last year&apos;s jury prize at the Chicago international film festival. Fortissimo&apos;s most recent production, Tsai Ming-liang&apos;s Face (2009), has been selected to compete in the Cannes festival. When honoured with an industry toast at the Hamptons international film festival last year, Barendrecht was styled &quot;the playboy of the Pacific rim&quot;, and his zest for life was enormous. The secret of his success lay not just in his passion for films and his excellent and catholic taste, but much more in his gigantic and embracing personality. It was near impossible to catch him without the beaming and always sincere smile. He was a persuasive marketer too. If he told you a film should be seen, you took care to see it.  Born in Amsterdam, Barendrecht was the son of an insurance company manager and a nurse. He studied theatre sciences at the University of Utrecht - although he had already made his mark at 15 with a well-argued liberal political treatise, which caught the attention of the Dutch royal family. Film quickly came to dominate his interests, and from 1987 to 1990 he was an energetic contributor to the Rotterdam international film festival and its Cinemart. In February 1990 he moved briefly to the Berlin film festival as a press officer for the Forum des Junges Films. In 1991, he returned to Rotterdam to become co-ordinator and programme adviser, with particular concern for Cinemart. Established in 1984, this was the first platform of its kind to offer film-makers the opportunity to launch their projects to the international film industry. Many films of the last quarter-century owe their existence to Cinemart, of which Barendrecht became a board member after leaving the festival in 1997. In 1991, he formed Fortissimo Films, joined in 1995 by Michael Werner, who in 2000 became his co-chairman. The two seemed an ideal partnership, and Fortissimo went rapidly from strength to strength. Initially based in Amsterdam, in 1997 - on the suggestion of the director Wong Kar-Wai - Fortissimo set up an office in Hong Kong, which was the base for most of the production activities.  Barendrecht&apos;s gift of friendship was phenomenal. He was known and loved worldwide, but seemed capable of returning every friendship. He delighted in his homosexuality, which made him, throughout his career, an influential supporter of gay cinema. His most lasting legacy, however, will remain his success, through his productions and influence, in changing the international market for and the international perception of Asian films. He was founder and honorary adviser of the Hong Kong-Asia film financing forum, a member of the advisory board of the Thai film federation and panel consultant for the Asian film awards. In 2007 he and Werner received the CineAsia award of excellence. He is survived by his parents and his brothers. A foundation has been established in his name to support talented young film-makers.  \u2022 Wouter Barendrecht, film producer and marketer, born 5 November 1965; died 5 April 2009"}, {"sentences": ["Here chasing down the story got confusing, and stirred up a minor maelstrom in Tokyo.", "But the company&apos;s Tokyo press man Archie Mochizuki told me: &quot;Depending on how well the product does on the marketplace, it may eventually be distributed globally.&quot; On the face of it, big sales seem unlikely."], "tags": ["Carbon offsetting", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon footprints", "Environment", "Gadgets", "Energy", "Climate change", "Corporate social responsibility", "Renewable energy", "Wind power", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-30T11:45:17Z", "title": "Greenwash: Fujitsu's 'wind-powered' laptop is powered by the most expensive green energy in the world, writes Fred Pearce", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/30/greenwash-fujitsu-wind-powered-laptop", "article": "Every green should have one \u2013 the world&apos;s first wind-powered laptop. The idea of a little turbine plugged into a socket on the side is intriguing, even if the truth is a bit more prosaic. A lot more prosaic. In fact, to buy this machine you&apos;d have to be green according to the definition preferred by my old dictionary. That is, &quot;gullible&quot;. For this is probably the most expensive green power in the world. The new Fujitsu laptop, the FMV-BIBLO LOOX U/C50N Eco, went on sale in Japan last week. The company promises that for each sale it will purchase &quot;green power&quot; sufficient to offset the emissions from the likely electricity use of the machine during its lifetime. They have done the maths. Fujitsu figures average daily switch-on time will be nine hours, half in use and half on charge. And they reckon the lifetime in use at 960 days, spread over four years. That, they say, will use 46kW hours of electricity. Generating that by conventional means, the company says, will likely produce 18kg of carbon dioxide emissions. All fine so far. Fujitsu says it will offset those emissions with &quot;green power certificates&quot; from a company called Japan Natural Energy, which in turn invests in five windfarms and 12 biomass power plants across Japan. Japan Natural Energy is an established organisation that sells its offsets to numerous companies, including Fujitsu&apos;s electronics rivals such as Sony and Ricoh. Of course, Fujitsu takes no account of the carbon footprint of manufacturing the machine, which for laptops I have seen estimated at four times the footprint from use. But one step at a time. No greenwash so far. My problem is not the offsets but the price would-be greens are being asked to pay for their &quot;wind-powered&quot; laptops. Here chasing down the story got confusing, and stirred up a minor maelstrom in Tokyo. I won&apos;t go into the details, but at various times the company gave out a range of different prices for their green machine. Its spokespeople initially told me it was on sale at the same price as non-green versions, while at one point giving the impression to the computer writer Martyn Williams that they were charging almost 50% more than for a regular machine. After what I think by now amounts to an in-depth investigation, I can reveal that the C50N has two versions, a &quot;wind-powered&quot; version and a regular version. The wind-powered version costs 118,800 yen, which works out at roughly \u00a3834, or $1,228. While the regular version costs 113,800 yen. Unless you count a picture of the planet on the lid, they are otherwise identical. So that&apos;s an extra \u00a335, or $52, for those carbon credits. Williams told me he reckoned that was a good deal. &quot;It&apos;s a small price to pay for all that carbon-neutral karma!&quot; I guess that lots of green-minded Japanese consumers will agree. Guys, you are being greenwashed. Now it is my turn to do the maths. If Fujitsu is selling the 18kg of carbon dioxide offsets that come with the wind-powered version for 5000 yen, that works out at just over 278,000 yen per tonne of carbon dioxide. Or, if you prefer, \u00a31,950 per tonne. I checked the price I would pay at my favourite British carbon offsetting company, the Oxford-based Climate Care. They sell carbon offsets, much of it for wind turbines and biomass burners in Asia, for \u00a38.60 a tonne. They would thus offset those 18kg from the wind-powered laptop for about 15p. Or 227 times less than Fujitsu is charging. For those of you who like your stats in percentages, that mark-up from 15p to \u00a335 would be around 23,000%. Can I suggest that anybody interested in offsetting the emissions from buying a C50N would be a lot better off buying the regular version and arranging their own offsets. Currently the machine is only available in Japan. But the company&apos;s Tokyo press man Archie Mochizuki told me: &quot;Depending on how well the product does on the marketplace, it may eventually be distributed globally.&quot; On the face of it, big sales seem unlikely.

The family has a crazy history of dysfunction, prostitution and resentment, details of which periodically emerge in flashback. The idea of step-siblings thrown together in death is a good one: but this wacky, soapy treatment is odd, to say the least."}, {"sentences": ["Prosecutors have decided not to charge a Japanese pop star who was arrested for cavorting naked in a Tokyo park."], "tags": ["Japan", "Pop and rock", "Music", "World news", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-01T07:46:15Z", "title": "Naked Japanese pop star in park escapes charges", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/01/tsuyoshi-kusanagi-japan-naked-park", "article": "Prosecutors have decided not to charge a Japanese pop star who was arrested for cavorting naked in a Tokyo park.

Kusanagi was released and apologised in a televised news conference the day after his arrest last Friday. Prosecutors declined to confirm the report. Kusanagi allegedly sat on the grass, naked and drunk, with his clothes neatly folded up a metre away from him. Kusanagi admitted he drank too much rice wine and beer before going to the park and said he had no idea why he undressed himself. He said he would voluntarily refrain from public appearances for an unspecified period to take responsibility for his actions. Public indecency in Japan carries a penalty of up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 300,000 yen (\u00a32,000). Companies and TV stations dropped him from endorsements and programming following the incident, which was front-page news in Japan.

The UK business has sold more than 18,000 life and pensions policies and has around \u00a31.2bn of assets under management. The announcement, which closely follows Hartford&apos;s decision to suspend sales from its Japanese operation in Tokyo, will raise question marks over the viability of so-called &quot;third way annuities&quot;. These are complex retirement products which allow pensioners to benefit from a guaranteed level of income while still investing in the stockmarket with its growth potential and so increase their final fixed annuity income. They are also known as &quot;variable annuities&quot;. Hartford, trading in the UK as Hartford Life, blamed &quot;the continued turmoil in financial markets and our company&apos;s overall efforts to preserve capital and reduce the risks associated with various business lines&quot; for its withdrawal. &quot;Our decision to suspend all sales in the UK is a difficult one,&quot; Hartford&apos;s president and chief executive, Marc Lieberman, said. In January, Hartfold Life acknowledged that 2008 had been &quot;challenging&quot; but added &quot;we are delivering real value to advisers and clients during these volatile times.&quot; The Hartford decision could dampen attempts by other insurers to break into the third way annuity market. Lincoln, Met Life and Aegon all have variable products and had been encouraged by actuarial research from Tillinghast Towers Perrin suggesting a \u00a370bn market by 2016. Nigel Callaghan, a pensions expert at advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said several things had gone wrong for Hartford. &quot;The key isses have been extreme stock market volatility causing much higher than anticipated costs on the guaranteed elements; uncertainty over the strength of the guarantees from both advisers and clients following the Lehman collapse; complex and expensive product design; and a slow acceptance of a new concept by IFAs. &quot;Today&apos;s announcement comes as no surprise. For now, the much hyped &apos;third way&apos; in retirement plans turns out to have lost its way.&quot; Investors in Hartford&apos;s variable annuity have the option to transfer out. But for those whose guarantee price is currently higher than their underlying fund value, it probably makes sense to stay put at least until the fund value recovers. Other providers are expected to continue promoting variable annuities in the UK, hoping to pick up business now the market leader has pulled out. But the withdrawal of a major player will dampen demand and possibly deter further entrants."}, {"sentences": ["Unimpressed Anthony in Tokyo writes ... &quot;Just a quick question for you to ponder at half-time."], "tags": ["Premier League", "Middlesbrough", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-02T04:46:53Z", "title": "Middlesbrough v Manchester United - as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/02/middlesbrough-manchester-united-premier-league-minute-by-minute-report", "article": " Good afternoon ... and welcome to Sir Alex Ferguson v Sky Sports (episode MMCXVII). &quot;If you shake hands with the devil, you pay the price,&quot; grumbled Ferguson when asked about today&apos;s 12.45pm kick-off. Why exactly he&apos;s so narked about his players getting an extra couple of hours&apos; rest before the second leg of their Champions League semi-final is anyone&apos;s guess, but the upshot is that he&apos;s expected to rest a few players today. Which might just be enough to raise Middlesbrough&apos;s hopes of causing an upset ...  Team news Ferguson brings in Ben Foster, Ji-Sung Park, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Dimitar Berbatov and Federico Macheda to replace Edwin van der Sar, Michael Carrick, Cristiano Ronaldo, Anderson, Carlos Tevez and Darren Fletcher. Oh, and Jonny Evans to replace Rio Ferdinand, but that doesn&apos;t really count as rotation because the latter is knacked. For Boro, Justin Hoyte replaces Andrew Taylor.  Middlesbrough: Jones, McMahon, Wheater, Huth, Hoyte, O&apos;Neil,Sanli, Bates, Downing, King, Aliadiere. Subs: Turnbull, Digard,Emnes, Alves, Arca, Adam Johnson, Grounds. Man Utd: Foster, O&apos;Shea, Vidic, Evans, Evra, Park, Scholes,Giggs, Rooney, Berbatov, Macheda. Subs: Kuszczak, Ronaldo,Anderson, Nani, Rafael Da Silva, Gibson, Tevez. Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire)  Get your digs in early &quot;There are three excellent reasons why SAF is moaning about the early kick-off,&quot; parps Gary Naylor. &quot;Because he can&apos;t moan about a three o&apos;clock kick-off; because he can&apos;t complain about an evening kick-off; and because he can&apos;t complain about a Sunday kick-off. &quot;  Middlesbrough&apos;s chances today - none, or slightly less than that? To be fair, Ferguson has shuffled his line-up a fair bit, but it&apos;s still hard to see United leaving the Riverside with less than three points. That said, Boro have actually not lost at home yet in 2009 - winning four times and drawing another five (in all competitions) since they lost to Everton on Boxing Day.  The important numbers United need 10 points from their remaining five games to win the league. Middlesbrough probably only need three points (and a slight improvement in their goal difference) from their remaining four to avoid relegation, given how useless Newcastle and Hull have been lately.  My prediction: Middlesbrough 0-3 Manchester United.  1 min Berbatov rouses himself from his season-long slumber for long enough to roll the ball to Macheda, and we&apos;re underway at the Riverside.  3 mins Jeremie Aliadiere has the first shot of the game, wriggling free just outside the Utd area before digging out an effort that rolls some way wide of Foster&apos;s left-hand post. Not especially threatening in and of itself, but Boro have started at a good tempo.  5 mins United&apos;s first attempt on goal is not much better, as Rooney collects a long ball forward on the left wing before cutting inside McMahon and curling the ball some way over the bar.  7 mins Middlesbrough have actually done a better job than United of keeping the ball on the floor and retaining possession so far, but they&apos;ve clearly also been told to shoot whenever they get any sort of sight on goal, and Downing is the latest to crack one wide of Foster&apos;s goal from 30 yards out.  10 mins Aliadiere gets his head to a Hoyte throw-in from the left and flicks it on towards the penalty spot, but there&apos;s nobody in a Boro shirt anywhere near it. Somewhere along the way Scholes has taken a bang to his own noggin and is standing on the edge of the area looking a tad dazed.  11 mins The first corner of the game goes to Boro, but Vidic thumps it away with Wheater rushing in.  12 mins &quot;Dear Dr Bandini,&quot; begins a reader going by the pseudonym Confused in Manchester. &quot;I have recently been harbouring illicit and impure thoughts of the delicious pleasure of seeing Newcastle go down, something which would be aided by Boro points today. However, as an United fan, I feel compelled to cheer my team, and also to hope that the Newcastle achieve a point at Anfield. What should I do?&quot; Erm ... find a real doctor, perhaps?  15 mins Boos and whistles ring round the Riverside after Wheater is penalised for a powerful but fair tackle on Macheda, who had controlled the ball with his hand. &quot;I think referee Mark Halsey has got it wrong twice here,&quot; opines the devil&apos;s spokesman Andy Gray.  17 mins Tuncay wellies the ball over the bar from 20 yards and is rewarded with a chorus of ironic cheers from United&apos;s travelling support.  20 mins Giggs decides it&apos;s high time he made some contribution to this game, and promptly sets out on a 35-yard run straight through the heart of Boro&apos;s midfield and defence before suddenly realising he&apos;s running out of pitch and pinging a pass straight into the boot of the nearest defender.  21 mins And now Rooney belts another one over. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve had a shot on target yet ...  22 mins Ooh - we have now though, and United have Foster to thank for the fact they&apos;re not a goal behind. Half of the United team seemed to stop after Macheda, who really hasn&apos;t featured much so far, clattered into McMahon about two seconds after the defender had hoofed a long ball clear, but the ball fell to Marlon King, who flicked it on to Aliadiere surging into the area, and the Frenchman rifled in a low effort that Foster managed to block with his foot.  GOAL!! Middlesbrough 0-1 Manchester United (Ryan Giggs 24 mins) Well, there you go - United&apos;s first shot on target is a goal, as Ryan Giggs picks the ball up inside the D, steadies himself and drills a low effort through a defender&apos;s legs and past Jones.  27 mins &quot;Are you watching Merseyside,&quot; crow the United fans as Vidic knocks the ball behind for a Boro corner. It&apos;s hard not to feel sorry for Boro - they had started quite brightly, but their problem all season has been an inability to score goals and for all of their solid build-up work so far, they&apos;ve only had one clear-cut chance, and that fell to Aliadiere - who just isn&apos;t a natural finisher.  30 mins Boro&apos;s fans appeal loudly for handball as Tuncay&apos;s chipped ball towards Aliadiere is cut out in the penalty area, but Halsey waves away the appeal and United break at pace. Macheda races up to the edge of Boro&apos;s area, but seems to get caught in two minds about waiting for support or going alone and gets dispossessed.  32 mins They&apos;ve shown a replay of that Tuncay ball again - it atually skimmed off Aliadiere&apos;s thigh before brushing Vidic&apos;s arm, but you couldn&apos;t really argue that the defender knew much about it.  35 mins United have enjoyed a lot more possession since the goal, and for the first time in the game have been able to slow the tempo down and take charge a little bit in the last few minutes.  37 mins Downing picks the ball up in space 30 yards out, glances up and decides to have another dig. It&apos;s on target, but lacking in pace and Foster gathers it easily enough.  38 mins Macheda earns the first booking of the game for an innocuous enough challenge near midfield. I suspect that has a lot to do with his earlier foul on McMahon (22 mins), that went unpunished.  40 mins Huth stands with both arms aloft just inside United&apos;s half, imploring Justin Hoyte out on the left to send him the ball. The full-back eventually obliges, Huth takes one step forward in possession and then cannons a shot straight into the nearest opponent&apos;s midriff. That was silly.  42 mins &quot;Every time I hear Aliadiere&apos;s name said, I think someone is going to go into a childrens rhyme,&quot; chirrups John Martin. Erm, why?  44 mins Boro win another corner, but once again make nothing of it, and within moments of it being taken Scholes slams a drive just wide at the other end. It&apos;s a lot easier to imagine United scoring a second than Boro equalising at the moment.  45 mins And now Scholes fires an almost identical effort wide once again.  Peepety-peeeep! And that&apos;s it for the first half. I&apos;ll be back in a tick with some half-time thoughts and emails.  &quot;Five straws for Boro fans to clutch at&quot;, begins Jeremy Anderson promisingly. &quot;1. The Riverside is a Big Four graveyard, not least for Man Utd (Boro 4-1 United anyone?) And for a change it is packed to the girders, as who knows when they&apos;ll play United again? 2. Aliadiere, the pacy poor man&apos;s Torres, will be coming up against the same defence which redefined flimsy against Liverpool. 3. Utd are tired and down to their &apos;B&apos; team. 4. The laws of probability demand that United stop scraping through games. 5 Who could deny that Alves likes to fill his boots against this outfit?&quot;  Hmm, I think you&apos;re reaching a touch with some of those points Jeremy - for starters United have won this fixture a lot more often than they&apos;ve lost it; secondly Aliadiere must be a very poor man&apos;s Torres because his finishing has never been particularly good; thirdly United&apos;s B team (if it really even is a B team) is still pretty handy and fourthly Alves would need to come off the bench before he can have a say in this game. I&apos;ll give you No4, though.  Unimpressed Anthony in Tokyo writes ... &quot;Just a quick question for you to ponder at half-time. At the beginning of today&apos;s piece you reckon that Boro will be OK with three points from their remaining games, and also predict a 3-0 score today. Those three points (three draws or a win at Newcastle) would put them level with Hull, even if Hull get no points from the remaining four (not impossible, I agree). But the goal difference is going to be quite difficult, isn&apos;t it? Three draws obviously no good. But they have to make up not only the difference as it stands now (two worse than Hull), but from the defeats from three of the four remaining matches. Let&apos;s say five or six. Now, Newcastle have been woeful, but do you really think that Boro will score five or six against them a week on Monday? Or are you just making it up as you go along.&quot;  Maybe you&apos;re right Anthony. Or, maybe I&apos;m just suggesting that Hull could get hammered by a similar, or even greater margin, somewhere along the way. They do play United in their final game, after all.  The Aliadiere-themed children&apos;s rhymes begin &quot;I agree with John Martin,&quot; writes Julian Le Saux. &quot;Aliadiere/He&apos;s hiding on the stair/He&apos;s going to bite your mother&apos;s leg/And burn your sister&apos;s hair. For example.&quot;  46 mins Boro get the second half started. No changes from either side as yet.  48 mins Manchester United are unbeaten (with 13 wins) in the last 15 games in which they have led at half-time. Boro have not won any of the last nine games (they lost seven) in which they have trailed at half-time. Just so you know.  49 mins It looked for a moment there as if United had put the game beyond Boro, as Rooney weaved in from the left before cutting the ball back to an onrushing Macheda six yards out. The Italian, though, fired just wide under pressure from Huth.  GOAL!! Middlesbrough 0-2 Manchester United (Park, 51 mins) Well, they really didn&apos;t have to wait much longer really did they? Rooney is the provider once again, rolling an inviting through-ball into the path of Park after the midfielder had spun free of David Wheater on the edge of the D. All that was left for Park to do was slot the ball past Jones with a composed side-footed finish. Game over, surely.  53 mins Incidentally, if anyone spots Dimitar Berbatov at any point during this game, do let me know. I could have sworn I saw him on the pitch some time around kick-off.  55 mins Lots of substitutions all at once. For Middlesbrough Didier Digard comes on to replace McMahon, while Alves is on for King. United send on Tevez in place of Macheda.  56 mins Tevez needs all of about 12 seconds to start causing havoc in the Boro back line, flying past two defenders before Huth slides in to take the striker&apos;s feet from under him about two inches outside the right-hand edge of the penalty area. The free-kick doesn&apos;t come to anything, though.  59 mins Aliadiere puts in a cross from the right for Boro, but nobody manages to get their head to it. Southgate stands on the sideline making cryptic hand gestures.  62 mins This game&apos;s gone a bit flat since that second goal. &quot;Berbatov is picking daisies over in the top left corner of your screen,&quot; insists Pat D&apos;Arcy.  65 mins Some lovely build-up play from United - Scholes dropping the ball onto the foot of Giggs, on the right, who then picked out Tevez in the middle of the area - ends with the Argentinian belting a volley into Huth&apos;s midriff.   67 mins Yup, still not a lot to report. United are basically whiling away the remaining minutes by passing the ball around in tidy little triangles just inside the Boro half, before periodically trying to loft the ball in to one of Rooney, Tevez or Giggs in or around the area.  69 mins The crowd stirs briefly as Boro win a free-kick near the left-hand touchline, but Huth can only glance a tidy enough delivery from Downing off the top of his head and some way over the bar.  70 mins Marvin Emnes has replaced Gary O&apos;Neil for Boro.  71 mins I just saw Berbatov jumping for a header! He didn&apos;t win it, of course, but it&apos;s the thought that counts.  73 mins John Martin is back with another Aliadiere-themed rhyme. &quot;Maybe Aliadeire gave Berbatov a stare/Which made him run away/Like he was never never there.&quot; Yup, this is what it&apos;s come to.  74 mins Park wins a corner for United with a typically dogged chase down the right-hand side and is promptly replaced by Nani ...  75 mins ... the corner fails to clear the first man.  77 mins &quot;There is a simple thumb rule as to relegation,&quot; insists Peter Bering. &quot;The team that gets as many points as the number of games played will always avoid relegation. This means that Middlesbrough will need two victories and one draw from their three last games to be safe. Unlikely, but possible.&quot; I honestly don&apos;t know that they&apos;d need that many Peter - teams have survived on less than 38 points before (I believe 34 is the current record) and the way Hull and Newcastle are playing it&apos;s not inconceivable that none of these teams will win another game. Were Boro to do as you say, though, I&apos;m sure they would indeed stay up.  78 mins Rooney slices through an increasingly ragged Boro back line before whisking another effort over the bar.  80 mins Alves rumbles purposefully towards the middle of the United defence, before mis-controlling the ball as he reaches the edge of the area, kicking it into his own shin and then falling over. Oh dear.  82 mins Well that really should have been a third, as Berbatov (I know - again!), Rooney and Tevez combine in and around the Boro box before finally working the ball to John O&apos;Shea eight yards out. There&apos;s no repeat of mid-week, though, as his shot is charged down, rebounding back onto his knee before going out for a goal kick.  84 mins Rooney wings another effort wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. He&apos;s actually played very well, but I&apos;d be intrigued to see how many shots off target he&apos;s had in this game.  87 mins &quot;Middlesbrough are only three points off safety but they are playing like they&apos;ve given up,&quot; sighs Roy Allen. &quot;If Southgate can&apos;t persuade his players that staying up is important, why is he still in his job? Steve Gibson is routinely praised in the press for being less trigger happy than many of his fellow chairmen when it comes to sacking managers. But surely this loyalty is misplaced? When a team with everything to fight for is this listless, something is wrong with the leadership.&quot;  90 mins Huth pumps the ball towards the United area, but this Boro team team long since gave up the ghost. This was always going to be a hard game to get a result from, but I have to agree with Roy Allen (87 mins) and others who have emailed in during the closing stages of this game - after a bright start to the game, Boro showed no real fight once things turned against them.  90 mins (+3) Just for a moment Alves looked to be clean through on goal, but Evans slid in at the last to nick the ball off his toes on the edge of the area.  90 mins (+4) And now Alves lumps a free-kick some way over the bar from 25 yards out.  Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! Halsey puts Riverside out of its misery and United take another confident stride towards retaining the Premier League title. They are now, for a few hours at least, six points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table, while Boro remain three adrift of 17th placed Hull and Premier League safety at the bottom. They have three games left to make up the deficit, but they&apos;ll need to show a good deal more fight than they did here.

Today, this is represented by Japan&apos;s roster of hard-rocking riot grrls. From Yoko Ono to today&apos;s new breed, Nippon&apos;s femme fatales succeed in making western rock&apos;s masculine posturing look positively puny. In celebration of these all-girl bands, Tokyo club night Saiko hosted last week a special Rock Chick event, showcasing the latest female-fronted acts the city has to offer. Event organiser Dan Grunebaum thinks it was an idea that &quot;couldn&apos;t be more obvious,&quot; but nobody had previously attempted, which is strange considering the great bands to choose from. Historically, bands like Shonen Knife (who toured with Nirvana and counted Kurt Cobain among their most vocal fans) and Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her (who released a record in the UK after Courtney Love bigged them up in NME), suport the idea of women reigning supreme in the upper echelons of J-rock&apos;s hierarchy. Then there are noiseniks Melt Banana and a host of others, including Akiko Wada, Ex-Girl and Buffalo Daughter to name a few. At Rock Chick, new acts Natccu (who is touring the UK in May with electro-femmes Tokyo Pinsalocks) and Bo-Peep play love-laden indie and lairy punk respectively. Every moment of it is thrilling. &quot;Japan has a culture of karaoke,&quot; says Natccu, &quot;so vocal melodies are really important to us. There are a lot of famous female singers in Japan and have been for a long time, since showa pop and the enka singer Hibari Misora. Female singers are perceived as being better than men because their voices are more melodic.&quot; Meanwhile Reiko, drummer in the awesome Tokyo Pinsalocks, cites that city&apos;s liberal attitude towards gender as giving rise to the riot grrl renaissance. &quot;In Tokyo, women are free to do what they want. We know lots of other female artists (not only musicians, but DJs and photographers) and we all express our own opinions on art. I know it&apos;s different for office ladies and, generally speaking, gender relations are far behind European standards, but for us personally there&apos;s nothing holding us back.&quot; Though the alternative scene may be free from stereotypes, Japan&apos;s music mainstream has female pop idols like Ayumi Hamasaki and Morning Musume (an ever rotating lineup of twee-pop touting teens) to maintain the gender-imbalanced status quo, where a girl&apos;s world is limited to shoes, shopping and Twittering over tabloid scandal. It&apos;s no surprise that this section of the entertainment industry is overseen by powerful men. &quot;Japanese women rockers represent an alternative to patriarchy by operating outside of the male-dominated entertainment industry,&quot; says Grunebaum. &quot;Many Japanese women rockers say and do what they want because they have no interest in joining the mainstream, and commercially have nothing to lose.&quot; However, perhaps feminist forcefulness is what mainstream Japanese pop needs. Strong female acts like Shiina Ringo and Yuki have enjoyed huge commercial success and represent a more substantial appreciation of womanhood by Japan&apos;s pop-loving masses. What&apos;s clear is that, with female-fronted bands continuing to reign supreme, Japan&apos;s gender roles are slowly changing."}, {"sentences": ["A recent bulletin informs us of Tokyo&apos;s latest fad: cat cafes; where &quot;customers seeking human and feline companionship pay to sip tea and stroke one of the 20-odd resident cats, representing 17 different breeds.&quot; \u2022 One of our favourite bloggers Maryam in Marrakech, recently returned from Yemen, and is churning out superb images as if superb images of Yemen are going out of fashion."], "tags": ["Travel", "Travel websites"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-06T09:54:47Z", "title": "Guardian.co.uk's weekly travelinks: Tokyo's cat cafes, lustrous Yemen, and the Naples underworld", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/may/05/travelwebsites", "article": "Welcome to round seven of our series of weekly travelinks.

The Tate announced today that for its big autumn show this year it would hang Turner&apos;s responses to some of the greatest paintings side by side with the originals. The exhibition, six years in the planning, was long thought unmountable because of the borrowing involved. About 100 paintings will be brought together and it will show Turner responding to and competing with artists including Titian, Poussin, Rubens, Canaletto, Rembrandt, Claude, Cuyp, Van de Velde, Constable and Ruisdael. Tate Britain&apos;s director, Stephen Deuchar, called it &quot;a compare and contrast exercise of an exhilarating kind&quot; and the show&apos;s conceiver, David Solkin, professor of the social history of art at the Courtauld Institute, admitted it was, in some ways, a step into the unknown. &quot;The most exciting thing for me is that I have no idea what I&apos;m going to learn from it,&quot; he said. The cockney-accented Turner, regarded by many as Britain&apos;s greatest artist, was in some ways the Damien Hirst of his day. He was hugely talented and he knew it. He worked the system and was a brilliant self-publicist. Solkin said Turner regarded the masters and the best of his contemporaries as his greatest competitors for fame. Art historians can see the Turners and the paintings he was emulating separately, or in books, but very rarely are they together. &quot;We&apos;ve been putting together reproductions and making comparisons, which of course is extremely unsatisfactory. There&apos;s no scale, no texture, so the risk is that what we&apos;ve written in the catalogue is going to be rendered obsolete.&quot; Turner was deliberately inviting audiences to compare his works with the greats and Tate visitors will be able to judge for themselves. Solkin is confident the artist&apos;s reputation will remain intact. &quot;I think Turner is going to be seen as a great painter even when he might have fallen short. I&apos;ll be more intrigued by the interesting failures. Turner never loses himself entirely. He&apos;s never going to be Titian, he&apos;s always going to be Turner.&quot; The exhibition will also shine a light on Turner&apos;s fierce competitiveness by hanging together two paintings last seen together at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1832 \u2013 John Constable&apos;s Opening of Waterloo Bridge and Turner&apos;s Helvoetsluys, on loan from Tokyo. Constable had spent 10 anxious years on what he thought at the time was his masterpiece and he was horrified to see it hanging next to a painting by his rival Turner. But he may have been reassured that his at least stood out; it was bigger and it had deep, luxurious colour which the artist added to as Turner watched. Turner responded with some finishing touches to his seascape \u2013 he simply daubed a bit of red paint into the middle of the sea, fashioning it into a buoy. If it was an act of provocation, then it worked. Constable became convinced he had been shot out of the water. While Turner was in awe of the masters \u2013 he broke down in tears on seeing a Claude in the Louvre \u2013 he was also confident enough to take them on. The opening pairing in the show will be two pictures that have not hung together for 170 years, Van de Velde the Younger&apos;s A Rising Gale (borrowed from Toledo, in the US) and the Turner companion piece Dutch Boats in a Gale. Deuchar said Turner was one of a handful of British artists with a truly international reputation, and one job at the Tate was to extend it. After the London show, from September to January, Turner and the masters will travel to the Grand Palais in Paris \u2013 Turner is revered in France \u2013 and the Prado in Madrid, where he is less well known."}, {"sentences": ["The gains in Tokyo reflected early confidence about of the US government&apos;s stress test of the country&apos;s 19 largest financial institutions."], "tags": ["Financial crisis", "Global economy", "Japan", "Business", "US economy", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-07T07:26:02Z", "title": "Japan stockmarket hits a six-month high ahead of US stress tests", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/07/japanese-shares-surge-on-us-stress-tests", "article": "Japan&apos;s Nikkei share index hit a six-month high overnight amid growing confidence about the US banking system.

Official figures showed today that input prices fell at an annual rate of 5%, the biggest decline since July 2002, while annual producer output price inflation dropped to 1.2% last month from 2% in March - according to the Office for National Statistics. That was the lowest reading since April 2004, although higher than the 0.7% expected in the City. The data underpins the Bank of England&apos;s expectation that consumer price inflation will slow sharply later this year. The central bank will publish its latest inflation and economic growth forecasts next Wednesday. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics said the numbers &quot;serve as a timely reminder that pipeline price pressures in the UK economy are fading rapidly&quot;. He said they provided &quot;some reassurance that, despite the recent slow downward progress of consumer price inflation, much weaker cost pressures should feed through to the high street in time&quot;. Analysts expect factory gate prices to keep falling in coming months, with manufacturers still struggling for business. &quot;We suspect that many manufacturers will cut their prices over the coming months given increased spare capacity and the need to be competitive in a still depressed environment. This view is strongly supported by the latest survey evidence,&quot; said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. The main reason for the sharp easing in producer price inflation were lower fuel prices. Fuel costs fell by 8.2% in April from the previous month, with gas prices plummeting 17.5%. Despite some supply problems, gas prices were on a downward trend through April because of an increase in natural gas deliveries and above average temperatures towards the end of the month, the statistics office said. Crude oil prices rose by 5.1% on the month but fell by 37.9% in the year to April. A year ago, oil prices were rising sharply and peaked at a record high of $147 a barrel in July. Prices then started to fall as the global economic downturn gathered pace, triggering expectations that demand for oil and its products would drop sharply. This morning oil climbed above $57 a barrel, close to a six-month high on hopes that economic recovery could boost world oil demand. &quot;People got optimistic [after the US bank stress test results] because it wasn&apos;t as bad as they thought it would be,&quot; said Tony Nunan of Mitsubishi in Tokyo. &quot;&quot;But we are not out of the woods yet.

The labor department said the jobless rate jumped to 8.9% in April from 8.5% the previous month, marking the highest level since September 1983. US employers cut 539,000 jobs in April, the smallest number since October. The figure was better than the 590,000 decline expected by economists, spurring hopes that the worst might be over. &quot;It&apos;s all going to add to the conviction that the economy is approaching bottom,&quot; said Pierre Ellis of Decision Economics in New York. Employment in the private sector fell by 611,000 but this was tempered by a 72,000 jump in government positions. There were bigger job losses over the previous two months than originally estimated. The March non-farm payrolls figure was revised to show a decline of 699,000 from 663,00, and February now shows a drop of 681,000 compared with a previously reported fall of 651,000. Jay Mueller of Wells Capital Management in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said: &quot;It&apos;s a terrible number but an improvement relative to the very terrible numbers we had before. The big question is has the peak in job losses hit? I am somewhat skeptical that we have seen the absolute worst of it, but you can&apos;t rule that out. By the time we get through with this, I think the unemployment rate will be close to 10%. The government hired a lot of people.&quot; A total of 5.7 million jobs have now been lost since the start of the recession in December 2007. Others were more hopeful that the economy could be on the mend soon. &quot;The labour market may have seen its worst months for job cuts. It will be a low healing process, but improvement is expected to come by mid-year,&quot; said Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi in New York. &quot;The economy doesn&apos;t turn on a dime but it does look as if the pace of job losses is starting to slow from the turn of the year. You can make the case that the panic layoffs that we saw at the turn of the year are starting to ease.&quot; There were job losses across nearly all sectors last month, although at a slower rate than previously. The manufacturing sector lost 149,000 jobs while construction cut 110,000 and the service industries slashed 269,000 positions. The education and health services sector added 15,000 jobs."}, {"sentences": ["What about a war with North Korea or an earthquake in Tokyo?...."], "tags": ["Banking", "Bank of America", "US economic growth and recession", "Obama administration", "Timothy Geithner", "Financial crisis", "Economics", "Credit crunch", "US economy", "US politics"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-08T20:00:00Z", "title": "Banking on stress | Richard Adams", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/may/08/banking-us-stress-tests", "article": "Now the US government has published its &quot;stress tests&quot; of the balance sheets of America&apos;s largest financial institutions, the reaction \u2013 on Wall Street and in the nation&apos;s media \u2013 has been one long sigh of relief. That seems odd, given that the fine print of the stress tests reveals:  The results of the SCAP [the Supervisory Capital Assessment Programme, the sexy official title for the stress tests] suggest that if the economy were to track the more adverse scenario, losses at the 19 firms during 2009 and 2010 could be $600 billion.  Only $600bn? Phew. Remind me to find a broker and blow next month&apos;s rent on Wells Fargo stock. The reason for the relief is that things could have been worse. Indeed, back in February, when the execution of the stress tests was announced, there was a common expectation that they would be. Now, after a few months of economic data dropping hints that the worst might be over - including today&apos;s preliminary figures that &quot;only&quot; 539,000 jobs were lost in April \u2013 the discovery that &quot;only&quot; 10 out of the 19 largest financial institutions are suffering from a lack of funds, and need raise &quot;only&quot; another $75bn in capital to see them through to 2010, is what passes for good news these days. By a stroke of excellent luck, the $75bn figure is conveniently smaller than the $110bn that the US Treasury has left through its troubled assets relief programme. That means that even if the troubled 10 can&apos;t raise the money themselves through selling shares, the Treasury has enough in hand to fund the deadbeat banks without having to mug Congress for another bailout \u2013 a bailout that in the current climate Congress almost certainly wouldn&apos;t grant. More importantly, in the context of the trillion-dollar telephone-book figures bandied about since the financial crisis became acute last year, $75bn almost sounds like small change. It&apos;s not, of course, but it feels like it is when a potential loss of $600bn is a worst-case scenario. Spread over 10 firms, and coupled with the sightings of green shoots and the stock market and credit market recovery, the toxic 10 should be able to raise the additional capital \u2013 although Bank of America, in the deepest hole, may struggle to raise the $34bn the government is demanding. If they fail then the stress tests will have worked, in the sense that they identified the banks in the weakest position, and trigger further government intervention. So far, so good. If the economy&apos;s improvement turns from sentiment to fact, then the crisis (in the medical definition of the term) will be over \u2013 and the process of recovery can begin. If it doesn&apos;t, and the light at the end of the tunnel turns out to be a runaway train, the stress test&apos;s worst case may start to look pretty good, and $75bn will indeed be peanuts. Since the details of the stress tests \u2013 exactly what was found and how toxic assets were valued \u2013 remain under wraps, there&apos;s no way of knowing how robust the banks really are, or how much value we can attach to these numbers. We will find out soon enough, though. In the short-term, the Treasury seems to have convinced the market that the tests are credible, and that may be all it needs to do. Back in February, when the stress test idea was launched, the Obama administration was faced with two unpalatable alternatives. At one extreme was the free market one, allowing a wave of bank collapses. (That as a solution was being argued for as recently as yesterday by those on the destroy-the-village-in-order-to-save-it right, specifically Amity Shlaes.) The other extreme was the &quot;Swedish model&quot; \u2013 no, not that sort of model \u2013 whereby the state would seize the troubled banks, nationalise and then retool them, based on Sweden&apos;s experience of the early 1990s. Paul Krugman was a vocal member of the Swedish team. Obama and Geithner instead went with a policy that Krugman now describes as &quot;muddle through&quot;: prop up the banks to prevent any more Lehman Brothers-style catastrophes; use Treasury and Federal Reserve funds to fill the gaps in lending left by the shellshocked banks; then recapitalise one way or another the banks themselves. And that&apos;s where we are now. What else needs to happen? The balance sheets of America&apos;s banks are still loaded with toxic debts and instruments, the credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations that we have come to loath so well. They, though, are slowly being worked out, through balance-sheet write-downs and the nascent government plans to kick-start buying and selling of the sort of assets (securitised mortgage bonds, say) that rank alongside West Nile disease in popularity on Wall Street. After that, we&apos;re still waiting for the Obama master-plan on how to stop the circus from coming back to town when the economy finally recovers. Memories on Wall Street are remarkably brief - for some reason, the prospect of millions of dollars dangled in front of brokers leads to short-term memory loss. Left to their own devices, Wall Street&apos;s alchemists will inevitably return to slicing and dicing streams of income and chunks of debt, in the same manner as they did between 2000-2007. And who knows, maybe next time the crisis will be even worse, given the knowledge that the US government will print money to save America&apos;s reckless banks. The economy will recover, eventually, and perhaps sooner than many people expected. The best time to start regulating the Wall Street of tomorrow is today. The trillion-dollar question remains, how? Writing in the Washington Post, Sebastian Mallaby traces the pitfalls and failures of regulating the financial sector. His conclusion is that the stress tests, as pioneered in today&apos;s announcement, offer a way of keeping the masters of the universe in order:  Rather than looking at how their portfolios would have behaved in recent history, banks must force themselves to imagine how their portfolios would respond to future shocks. What if the US economy shrinks for the next two years? What if the dollar goes into free-fall? What about a war with North Korea or an earthquake in Tokyo?.... The administration&apos;s stress tests are the template for this new approach. The measure of their success is not whether they cause the rally in bank stocks to continue, pleasant though that rally is. The real question is whether the administration forces the banks to raise the capital they are lacking, even at the risk of ending the market rally \u2013 and then whether it makes stress-testing a permanent feature of bank regulation.  In that case, &quot;muddling through&quot; will have delivered the template to regulate Wall Street&apos;s bruised banks. Because if it works this time, why not have them keep taking the tests?"}, {"sentences": ["With art you cannot end poverty, but you can bring about the end of misery.&quot; When the moussem ends and the visitors return to Fez, Casablanca and Marrakech, and the artists to Paris, New York and Tokyo, Asilah returns to its tranquil self."], "tags": ["Morocco holidays", "Cultural trips", "Short breaks", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-08T23:01:00Z", "title": "A cultural revival on Morocco's coast", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/may/09/asilah-morocco-travel-culture", "article": "The man raised the hood of his djellabah against the Atlantic breeze. As the sun crept over the ramparts, he reached for his brush and began to paint a dramatic swirl of colour onto the whitewashed medina wall. Passers-by stopped to watch, offering to hold his ladder.  He wasn&apos;t a Moroccan Banksy, but one of many artists that flock to the white-cubed town of Asilah for its annual festival, the International Cultural Moussem.  Held every August, it draws an eclectic crowd with everyone from Sufi chanters to Japanese artists, along with thousands of spectators and a gaggle of economists, politicians and academics for satellite events - testament to the festival&apos;s socio-economic impact. As well as public art demonstrations, exhibitions and concerts, with a heavy Islamic and Spanish influence, it ends with a three-day horse festival, including a musket-firing cavalry charge. Straddling the cliffs of Morocco&apos;s north Atlantic coast, Asilah was founded by the Phoenicians around 1500 BC. A prosperous trading town, it was invaded by the Carthaginians, Romans, Normans and Portuguese, among others; and it was Spanish territory before being returned to Morocco in 1956. Its medina is bite-sized and impossibly picturesque. I strolled around the spotlessly clean warren of alleyways, where the brilliant-white buildings are punctuated with blue paintwork that matches the vibrancy of the sky. Through a half-open doorway I caught a glimpse of an electric-blue courtyard picked out by a shaft of sunlight. It was almost impossible to believe that, like neighbouring Tangier, Asilah had spent decades in a seemingly inexorable decline. Its renaissance began in 1978, when two local friends, Mohammed Bena\u00efssa and Mohammed Melehi planned the first moussem under the banner &quot;Culture and Art for Development&quot;, inviting 11 artists from around the world to literally paint the town. The local residents pitched in to scrub and whitewash the whole town in preparation for the event, and children were assigned to help the artists. Morocco&apos;s Ministry of Culture restored a section of the crumbling ramparts, and the Raissouli Palace (rue Ahmed el Monsour), a former pirate&apos;s home, was transformed into an opulent palace of culture.  When I met Bena\u00efssa - former minister of foreign affairs and Asilah&apos;s mayor since 1983 - he described the town in the 1970s: &quot;There was nothing: no telephones, electricity was very poor, there was drinking water for just one hour a day. Living conditions were terrible: sewage ran in the streets, garbage was everywhere.&quot; Every year, more and more artists came, leaving brightly-coloured murals on the whitewashed walls. The success of the festival engendered a sense of civic pride and bit by bit the infrastructure was improved, houses were renovated and historical buildings were restored. Teams of children competed to clean the beaches, adults to maintain their neighbourhoods. Thirty years on, Bena\u00efssa&apos;s belief that art and culture can be used as a catalyst for change is unwavering: &quot;Look at what it has done. With art you cannot end poverty, but you can bring about the end of misery.&quot; When the moussem ends and the visitors return to Fez, Casablanca and Marrakech, and the artists to Paris, New York and Tokyo, Asilah returns to its tranquil self. But the art remains, and it is everywhere. Murals - replenished every year - adorn the buildings, enveloping windows and curling around drain pipes. Many of the children who helped at the first moussem are now artists and a new and enterprising generation is cashing in on the art boom, selling their na\u00efve crayon drawings from doorways. Workshops abound and the contemporary Gallery Aplanos (rue Tijara 89) wouldn&apos;t look out of place in London or New York. Its medina may lack Marrakech&apos;s tangle of souks and panoply of shops, but it&apos;s also endearingly free from the hassle and hustle of other Moroccan cities. There was a fine selection of carpets on offer at Bazar Atlas (rue Tijara 25). Cream handiras, or wedding blankets, silver sequins glittering in the sun; shaggy Beni Ouarain, with their bold geometric markings, and vivid, tightly-woven kilims from the High Atlas hung outside. Inside, there was a dizzying array of babouches - pointed, rounded, sparkling and furry slippers - and tagines of every size and colour jostling for space.  Outside the medina, the call of the muezzin mingled with the strains of the Spice Girls. Villagers from the Rif Mountains - their distinctive straw hats decorated with gaudy pom-poms - led donkeys laden with bulging sacks through the traffic, trading gigantic yellow melons from makeshift stalls on the street.  I wandered through the covered market, past mounds of pungent saffron, succulent olives and plump figs bursting with ripeness; enveloped in the aroma of freshly-baked bread, the tang of mint and the sweet smell of dates. Hungry, I made my way to the seafront and Casa Pepe (22 place Zallaka, + 39 41 73 95), where waiters squeezed between the heaving tables. A djellabah-clad fisherman appeared in the restaurant doorway. He pulled two enormous lobsters from his steel bucket, their claws tied together with string. Lunch had arrived for a gregarious Spanish family.  After dining on freshly caught sardines, I took a taxi to Paradise Beach a few miles out of town. When the tarmac ended we bumped along the rocky road, then over dunes and shrubs, passing more traditional taxis - donkey-drawn wooden carts with passengers hanging precariously off the side. Finally, we turned down the winding path to the beach. Before us, the sweeping bay glimmered in the heat haze: miles of honey-coloured sand pounded by Atlantic rollers.  Beyond the row of ramshackle cafes, football matches were underway. Children played under parasols and women sunbathed in everything from bikinis to burkas. Grumbling camels plodded up and down the surf with their tourist cargo, while boys galloped bareback between the beach towels on scrawny mules.  Asilah&apos;s rehabilitation continues under Bena\u00efssa&apos;s watchful eye. When I remarked that the festival has fulfilled its objectives, he demured: &quot;Let us say it is fulfilling its objectives because there is no end to improvement.&quot;  Apartments are springing up along the neglected coastline eastwards to Tangier. Boutique riads are sure to follow. But Bena\u00efssa has allowed only limited development within the medina&apos;s ancient walls, determined that it won&apos;t lose its spirit, or become another Marrakech.  It certainly has all the ingredients to become the new Essaouira, but it&apos;s a modest place and, for now at least, it&apos;s content to be the new Asilah.

Equality Now, a New York-based human rights group, called on Japan&apos;s government to immediately ban RapeLay, a virtual game that can be played on Windows PCs, and to honour its international commitments to end the sexual exploitation of children. Amazon, the online retailer, removed RapeLay from its UK and US sites earlier this year after it was discussed at a UN conference on the sexual exploitation of children in Rio de Janeiro last November. Amazon Japan recently followed suit, but the game is widely available on other online shopping sites. Jacqui Hunt, the director of Equality Now&apos;s office in London, said the game was &quot;extremely problematic at many levels&quot;. &quot;The suggestion that the gamer has transformed the violent crime of rape into an act of sex indicates all too well the danger of objectifying and dehumanising women and normalising violence against them,&quot; she said. Equality Now has urged its 30,000 members to write to the prime minister, Taro Aso, demanding that Japan fulfil its obligations as a signatory to the UN convention against all forms of discrimination against women. Though Japan is a lucrative market for games depicting sexual violence, RapeLay was spotlighted as a particularly depraved example of the genre. The games, featuring high-resolution graphics and virtual interaction, are often set in schools or train carriages, with players awarded points for committing acts of sexual violence until the victims start to &quot;enjoy&quot; the experience. The victims are usually dressed in school uniforms, although their age is deliberately kept ambiguous. The hentai [pervert] theme is common in Japanese comics, animated films and video games, many of which tap into the popular subculture of Lolicon, a Japanese rendering of Lolita complex. Japanese law bans the production and sale of sexually explicit images of children under 18, but it exempts animated and computer-generated images. Illusion, the software firm that produces RapeLay, has so far resisted calls to withdraw the game, saying it complies with Japanese child pornography laws. &quot;The game is not intended for sale overseas, so we can&apos;t comment further,&quot; an Illusion spokesman told the Guardian. But campaigners challenged the firm&apos;s claim that it was targeting only the Japanese market, where such games are considered &quot;acceptable&quot;. &quot;The age of the internet means it&apos;s impossible to confine anything to a specific market,&quot; said Hiromasa Nakai, a spokesman for Unicef Japan. &quot;People in Japan have to realise that what might be acceptable in one culture or context might not be acceptable in another. In any case, many Japanese people have no idea what&apos;s on sale on their own doorstep, and RapeLay is only the tip of the iceberg.&quot; The game is just one of tens of thousands of video games containing explicit sexual content that can be bought online or at stores in Tokyo&apos;s geek district of Akihabara. Pressure to tighten the law comes amid an alarming increase in demand for child pornography. In 2007, just over 300 children under 18 were identified as victims, according to Japanese police, up more than 20% from 2006 and the highest total since records began in 1999. While police prosecuted 25 child pornography cases in 1999, the figure had risen to 585 cases by 2006."}, {"sentences": ["Bao arrived in Beijing on Friday having travelled home from America via Tokyo.", "Deng Haihua, a health ministry spokesman, told reporters that of the 233 people on board the flight from Tokyo, 106 were foreigners; roughly a quarter of them were Japanese."], "tags": ["China", "Swine flu", "World news", "Flu", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-11T12:41:30Z", "title": "China confirms first swine flu case", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/11/china-swine-flu", "article": "A student recently returned from the US has become mainland China&apos;s first confirmed case of swine flu, prompting the Chinese authorities to try to quarantine all those who shared a flight with him.

Up to 130 passengers who shared flights with the infected man are in isolation, the state news agency Xinhua reported, with authorities sending text messages to mobile phones nationwide asking those who had been on board the flights to report to the disease prevention bureau. Bao arrived in Beijing on Friday having travelled home from America via Tokyo. He developed symptoms on a domestic flight from Beijing to Chengdu, in Sichuan, the health ministry said. He went to hospital and was transferred to the city&apos;s infectious disease hospital after being found &quot;weakly positive&quot; for swine flu.

An act of borderline self-flagellation, it often seems that shows in Japan justify their worthiness by the amount of discomfort you have to go through to experience them.

There&apos;s no re-entry and you&apos;re not allowed to bring your own food or drink. It becomes a mad game of perseverance for those eager fans straight through the door at midday, as there&apos;s no food available inside and, at \u00a5600 (\u00a34) for less than half a pint of beer, getting refreshed can be an expensive business. By 4pm the venue&apos;s stairs are crowded with fashionable (and famished) fans.  Then, of course, there&apos;s the complete disregard for audience eardrums that live venues across Tokyo have cultivated. They crank up the volume a few thousand decibels higher than even Spinal Tap would tolerate, creating a strange division between the fans who remembered to bring earplugs and the poor sods cowering at the back who didn&apos;t. However, this aural assault is worth suffering as tonight&apos;s show is a triumph for Tokyo&apos;s alternative music scene. Cupid Recordings is the project of Yudai Hirano, the Japanese answer to Tony Wilson. As the host of Fuji TV&apos;s FACTORY music show (wonder where he got that idea from?), Hirano offers a rare opportunity for Japanese and international alternative artists to be heard on one of the nation&apos;s main TV stations by huge audiences. Away from broadcasting, Hirano is known as a rock producer and Cupid Recordings is his next step in bringing indie music to a wider audience. While many of the bands, like shaggy-haired lad-rock wannabes Quattro, simply ape the less appealing aspects of the western indie world, a handful of acts offer something more vital. London-based British/Japanese combo Levelload are tonight&apos;s only overseas act and, like a sparring brother and sister, Tony Wade and Mariko Doi take turns to see who can thrash the loudest across frenetic, electro-tinged drumposiums. Meanwhile, Bugy Craxone are introduced by a hyperactive man dressed like Jimmy Savile and offer more femme-fronted indie in the manner that Japan does so well, with lead singer and pin-up Suzuki Yukiko managing to maintain a look of innocence despite her band&apos;s cacophonous wail. The highest praise is reserved for Midori. Like many Japanese artists they have little web presence beyond their official site and no audio for fans to enjoy. Which means you&apos;ll have to take my word that these genre-bending, jazz-enfused, scatter-punk harbingers of danceable doom are currently the best thing in Japan. Ferocious frontwoman (it&apos;s always the girls!) Mariko, dressed in school uniform, spits and fights with the crowd, climbs the stage rigs and cavorts on top of speaker stacks, punching herself in the head as she goes. Mariko destroys much of the set and hits any photo pit cameramen that get too close. This is surprising behaviour for a band that don&apos;t play guitars, just piano, upright-bass and drums. They&apos;ve been offered international tours on several occasions before, but apparently getting them all on a plane at the same time is too much to deal with.

The coronation could come on Saturday when Arsenal, battered and beleaguered after a harrowing denouement to their own season, return to Old Trafford but, when the story comes to be told of the 2008-09 campaign, it will be the manner in which Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s men have handled the smaller clubs that will be remembered as the defining reason why they are on the brink of equalling Liverpool&apos;s haul of 18 titles. Ferguson used to say that it was the games against Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool that decided which colour ribbons adorned that 18lb hunk of silverware at the end of each season but this year the opposite has been the case. United&apos;s record against their three major rivals is moderate at best, with three defeats and only four points from five games, but their victory at Wigan has maintained a remarkable record of beating every team bar one, home and away, below eighth position in the league. Of 69 points available against those 12 sides \u2013 in descending order, West Ham United, Manchester City, Wigan Athletic, Stoke City, Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers, Portsmouth, Sunderland, Newcastle United, Hull City, Middlesbrough and West Bromwich Albion \u2013 United have taken 67, the one blemish being a 1-1 draw at home to Newcastle on the opening weekend of the league season. On Sunday week few would bet against them making it 70 out of 72 when they finish their league programme at freefalling Hull City. United, however, have not recorded a single victory in their away games against the seven teams directly behind them, taking four points out of 21 and \u00adscoring only four goals in the process. They have also taken 10 points fewer than Liverpool in terms of matches between the top four clubs, Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s team having an immaculate record against United and Chelsea, as well as drawing twice with Arsenal, to earn 14 points from six games. Chelsea, like United, have struggled in their top-of-the-table clashes, with only four points from six games, whereas Arsenal have managed eight points out of a possible 15 going into the weekend game at Old Trafford. Liverpool&apos;s advantage has been lost, however, by their inferior record against the bottom 12 teams, dropping 13 points against Middlesbrough, Hull, Stoke (twice), Wigan and Manchester City. It has been a lesson, in other words, in the importance of winning the bread-and-butter matches, something that Ferguson recognised himself when he was asked to nominate United&apos;s most important game of the season. The man who stands on the brink of an 11th title in 16 years elected the 1-0 win at Stoke on Boxing Day, just a few days after United had returned from winning the World Club Cup in Tokyo. It is United&apos;s consistency in those kind of games that has established them in a position to reach 92 points this season, eclipsing their previous best of 91 from the 1999-2000 campaign, and prompted the Premier League to put plans in place for the trophy to be presented, if necessary, after the Arsenal game. A curiosity of Ferguson&apos;s previous 10 titles is that there has been only one occasion \u2013 against Tottenham Hotspur on the last day of the treble-winning 1998-99 season \u2013 when the championship was confirmed on their own ground, and for it to happen against Arsenal would make it particularly sweet for Ferguson when he remembers that day in 2002 when Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s team won the league at Old Trafford courtesy of a Sylvain Wiltord goal. Ferguson described it at the time as being outside a house, pressed up against the windows, watching everyone having a party inside."}, {"sentences": ["The Guardian&apos;s Justin McCurry, reporting from Tokyo, points out:  The losses mark a dramatic turnaround from last year when Sony, which is in the midst of a tough cost-cutting and restructuring regime under its Welsh-born chief executive Sir Howard Stringer, reported a \u00a5369.4bn profit."], "tags": ["Sony", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-14T11:43:36Z", "title": "Sony reports $1bn annual loss: so what's the solution?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/may/14/sony-annual-loss", "article": "Sony has just reported its first annual loss in 14 years, having lost 98.9 billion yen (\u00a3685m; $1 billion) in the fiscal year that ended in March. It now says it will close three Japanese factories -- &quot;one for cell-phone cameras, another for video recorder parts and another for systems used for smart cards&quot; -- which means it will close eight factories worldwide by March 2010, reports AP. The story says:  Sony also continued to lose money in its game segment, where its PlayStation 3 home console and PlayStation Portable have struggled against rival offerings from Nintendo Co., the Wii and DS, as well as in some markets against the Xbox 360 from Microsoft Corp.The company sold 10.06 million PlayStation 3 machines for the fiscal year through March, up 10% from the previous year.

The Guardian&apos;s Justin McCurry, reporting from Tokyo, points out:  The losses mark a dramatic turnaround from last year when Sony, which is in the midst of a tough cost-cutting and restructuring regime under its Welsh-born chief executive Sir Howard Stringer, reported a \u00a5369.4bn profit. It said its forecast reflected expectations that the &quot;deterioration in the business environment brought on by the slowing global economy will continue&quot;, adding that the cost of restructuring would add to the losses.  The results are not too surprising. Sony was already having a tough time with the PS3 failing to repeat the massive success of the original PlayStation and the PS2, the decline of the CD-based music business, and increasing competition in the consumer electronics markets from Asian companies outside Japan. Sony, like many other companies, was then hit by the global financial meltdown.  And the big question remains: What can Sir Howard do to turn things around? Cutbacks can reduce losses but it&apos;s hard to see how Sony can turn round its games business (where the PS3 simply costs too much to make) or find new areas to develop.

Sony said net losses could increase to \u00a5120bn for the 12 months to the end of next March, as a result of plunging demand for electronics and the yen&apos;s strong performance against the dollar and euro. The losses mark a dramatic turnaround from last year when Sony, which is in the midst of a tough cost-cutting and restructuring regime under its Welsh-born chief executive Sir Howard Stringer, reported a \u00a5369.4bn profit. &quot;We have made these forecasts on the assumption that tough business conditions caused by the global economic recession will continue,&quot; Nobuyuki Oneda, Sony&apos;s chief financial officer, said. Sony is just one of several leading Japanese firms that have seen earnings obliterated over the past year by the global slump in demand for cars and electronic gad\u00adgets. Last week Toyota, reported its first net loss \u2013 of \u00a5436.9bn \u2013 for almost 60 years; this week Hitachi, the consumer electronics and industrial equipment maker, announced the biggest ever annual loss by a Japanese manufacturer, of \u00a5787.3bn. Today Sanyo reported a net loss last year of \u00a593.2bn, compared with a \u00a528.7bn profit the year before. The Nikkei business newspaper said another electronics maker, Toshiba, was planning to end production of liquid-crystal display TVs at its plant in Plymouth, with the loss of 250 jobs. Sony&apos;s key business, consumer electronics, suffered an operating loss amid falls in sales of its Bravia range of flat-panel TVs. Its gaming sector also recorded losses as its PlayStation 3 console continued to struggle overseas against Nintendo&apos;s Wii. Although Sony sold 10.06m PS3s last year, up 10% from the previous year, its gaming division lost \u00a558.5bn. It expects to sell 13m PS3s worldwide this year, while Nintendo forecasts sales of 26km Wii consoles. Sony has already announced plans to shed 8,000 jobs from its regular global workforce of 185,000 and a similar number of temporary jobs, and to close several of its 57 manufacturing plants worldwide. It said today that it had finalised the planned closure by December of eight plants: four in Japan and four overseas, in the US, France, Mexico and Indonesia. The closures and other cost-cutting measures are expected to bring savings of \u00a5300bn by next March. But the economising is being hampered by consumers&apos; reluctance to spend money on new cameras, game consoles and TVs as long as the global economic outlook remains uncertain. Sales dropped almost 13% to \u00a57.73tn last year, by 20% in the US, 17% in Europe and 14% in Japan. Sony forecast an operating loss of \u00a5110bn through to the end of March 2010, down on its \u00a5227.78bn loss last year and smaller than many analysts had expected. Sales are expected to fall 6% to \u00a57.3tn. But the results for the January to March quarter underlined the size of its problems. Operating losses totalled \u00a5294.31bn compared with a \u00a56.18bn profit a year ago, while sales fell 22% to \u00a51.5tn. Analysts said the firm should turn its attention to how it plans to take advantage of an economic recovery, particularly in its core electronics division, which sustained losses of \u00a5168bn last year, due largely to losses on TVs. It is expecting a deficit of \u00a5201bn this year. &quot;The results and forecasts seem very average. What I really want to know is how Sony is going to compete after the economy recovers,&quot; said Nobuo Kurahashi of Mizuho Investors Securities. &quot;Cost-cutting and wringing profits out the TV division are important, but that will only take you so far. Sony focuses a lot of attention on portable devices with network capability. That doesn&apos;t seem to be going well, so it&apos;s difficult to expect profits from that business. &quot;Sony is spread out too thin and hasn&apos;t shown what new product group will take it into the future.&quot; A second year of losses in 2010 would add to the pressure on Stringer, who tightened his grip on Sony in February when he replaced Ryoji Chubachi, part of the old guard, as president, and appointed a team of younger executives to develop new products. The earnings results were released after Sony&apos;s shares closed down 6.8% in Tokyo at \u00a52,400. ."}, {"sentences": ["And the original Godzilla, as a symbol of atomic destruction, was chiefly interested in stomping all over Tokyo, until the 1998 American remake had the giant lizard not heading to France (whose nukes had triggered its mutation) but swimming halfway round the world to Madison Square Garden."], "tags": ["Action and adventure", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-14T23:01:00Z", "title": "Anne Billson | Angels & Demons should at least be commended for leaving Hollywood's backyard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/anne-billson-angels-and-demons", "article": "So there&apos;s a plot to blow up the Vatican?

As a reporter in the recent animated hit Monsters Vs Aliens observes: &quot;Once again, a UFO has landed in America, the only country UFOs ever seem to land in.&quot; Hollywood&apos;s tunnel vision is a west coast version of Saul Steinberg&apos;s New Yorker cartoon cover, A View of the World from Ninth Avenue, in which Manhattan dominates the foreground, with states beyond the Hudson river foreshortened and reduced to a couple of rocks, and the Pacific Ocean and Asia barely visible in the distance. The rest of us aren&apos;t even on the map.  As non-Americans, we have long since learned to embrace Los Angeles or New York as symbols of the humanity to be saved - but that doesn&apos;t excuse some of the cavalier treatment meted out to the rest of the world. The 1995 disease-a-thon Outbreak, for example, kicked off with vast tracts of Zaire succumbing to an ebola-like virus, but in Hollywood terms that was merely an amuse-gueule. In the eyes of Hollywood, Africans are expendable, and it&apos;s Californians - Rene Russo in particular - whose health we are supposed to worry about in that film. It&apos;s the same in real life: no one was too concerned about dying Mexicans until swine flu started spilling across the border and infecting Americans.  The 1997 thriller The Peacemaker opened with a nuclear explosion wiping out 1,500 people in the Urals. If that really happened, it would presumably have resulted in radioactive fallout that would have contaminated huge swaths of Europe and central Asia for decades to come, but we weren&apos;t supposed to care about that. We were supposed to worry about the Bosnian terrorist heading for Manhattan with a warhead in his backpack. To the screenwriter&apos;s credit, the Bosnian himself points out that Americans don&apos;t give a fig about atrocity until it&apos;s in their own backyard - an observation whose truth became apparent a few years later when real life caught up with the movies and the destruction of the World Trade Centre became the biggest news story of a generation. To be fair to Hollywood, other countries can be just as parochial on those rare occasions when they are holding the film-making reins. The most refreshing aspect of GoldenEye wasn&apos;t so much the reincarnation of James Bond in the form of Pierce Brosnan, as the villain threatening to annihilate Greater London rather than a US metropolis. Bless. And the original Godzilla, as a symbol of atomic destruction, was chiefly interested in stomping all over Tokyo, until the 1998 American remake had the giant lizard not heading to France (whose nukes had triggered its mutation) but swimming halfway round the world to Madison Square Garden. As you do. The biggest stakes, of course, are when it&apos;s the entire planet in the firing line. Global disaster movies such as Independence Day and Armageddon do sometimes acknowledge the existence of nations other than the US, it&apos;s true - though usually in the form of brief shots of babbling foreigners fearfully clustering around the world&apos;s tourist landmarks (which is foolish of them, because invading aliens or killer asteroids invariably have the Eiffel Tower or the Taj Mahal already lined up in their crosshairs). At least The Day After Tomorrow cast off its blinkers just long enough to give us an update on the British royal family, frozen to death at Balmoral, before offering the ironic spectacle of American refugees fleeing the new ice age by heading south across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Where, one imagines, they&apos;ll all catch swine flu later on.

As you may well be aware, this addictive take on the Pokemon phenomenon mixes monster collection with impressively deep RPG elements. Players become junior monster hunters, taking on dozens of quests to defeat various hideous creatures, before using the body parts of vanquished beasts to craft new weapons and armour.  Importantly, the game is designed to be played cooperatively via the PSP&apos;s ad-hoc networking system, which means fans have to gather together to take part. &quot;Players in Japan congregate everywhere, from parks to cafes to amusement arcades to on public transport,&quot; says Capcom. &quot;It&apos;s not unusual to see large huddles of kids in parks, all sitting together playing the game; it&apos;s very rare to take the subway in Tokyo without seeing a few dozen people playing Monster Hunter together as they commute.&quot;  To kick things off, the former site of the Lazarides gallery in central London will be converted into a Monster Hunter play zone. From the press release:  From July 1st to September 1st, across the whole school holidays, the space is being transformed into a haven for Monster Hunter players to congregate, socialise and, of course, play Monster Hunter, with hundreds of fans expected to descend each day. Three floors will be available for players - featuring comfortable seating, free soft drinks and amazing graffiti art, and enough space for several hundred enthusiasts to come together and play. Open from 10am to 8pm, 7 days a week, and from 10am to 10pm on Thursdays, the space, called The Gathering Hall, will open its doors to everyone who wants to experience Monster Hunter at its best - played with other people - and to meet fellow fans. Admission is only allowed with a PSP - so don&apos;t forget your console and a copy of Monster Hunter!  It&apos;s a nice idea, and it&apos;ll be interesting to see how much of Capcom&apos;s apparently multi-million pound promotional campaign is channeled into pushing this social element. Will UK gamers be as willing to gather in public places in this way? I thought we&apos;d be seeing loads of people on buses and trains battling each other via Bluetooth mobile games and/or ad-hoc PSP titles by now, but it hasn&apos;t really happened. I think maybe there hasn&apos;t been a killer co-op title on PSP - and also, not enough people own the handheld here. Though actually, not enough people own it in Japan - or at least they didn&apos;t when Capcom first decided to take its original PS2 title and create a PSP exclusive follow-up. Monster Hunter went on to become a national obsession - the third title in the series shifted over 500,000 copies last year in Japan alone.  Another thing is, the concept would benefit from a decent Google Latitude-esque spotting system that finds PSP owners in your area and alerts you to where they are and what they want to play. I&apos;m not sure that, over here, portable gaming is as culturally embedded as it is in Japan, so people probably need to be nudged. Perhaps the expected release of Sony&apos;s Ad-Hoc Party app, which allows users to indulge in global online gaming via connection to a PS3, may provide a more comfortable alternative to going out on the streets, pan-handling for gaming chums. Hopefully, though, the tentative gathering of hardcore British fans in a chic art gallery could be the beginning of something much larger. I love the idea of spontaneous public gaming, like flash mobs but less Nathan Barley-esque."}, {"sentences": ["To no avail.&quot; After shooting about 10 frames, Van Es went back to the darkroom and prepared a print for his regular 5pm transmission to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Photography", "Culture", "World news", "Vietnam", "US news", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-19T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Hugh van Es", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/may/20/hugh-van-es-obituary-vietnam-war-photography", "article": "The Dutch photographer Hugh van Es, who has died aged 67, became famous for his iconic picture of Americans leaving Saigon, on one of the last helicopters out, on 29 April 1975, the day before the city was captured by the North Vietnamese army at the end of the Vietnam war. At the time he was working as a staff photographer for United Press International (UPI).  The photograph has usually been assumed to be of the US embassy, but in a newspaper article a few years ago, Van Es wrote: &quot;If you looked north from the office balcony, towards the cathedral, about four blocks from us, on the corner of Tu Do and Gia Long, you could see a building called the Pittman Apartments, where we knew the CIA station chief and many of his officers lived. Several weeks earlier, the roof of the elevator shaft had been reinforced with steel plate so that it would be able to take the weight of a helicopter. A makeshift wooden ladder now ran from the lower roof to the top of the shaft. Around 2.30 in the afternoon, while I was working in the darkroom, I suddenly heard Bert Okuley [a UPI staffer who escaped that evening] shout &apos;Van Es, get out here, there&apos;s a chopper on that roof!&apos;&quot; Van Es grabbed his camera and dashed to the balcony. &quot;Looking at the Pittman Apartments,&quot; he said, &quot;I could see 20 or 30 people on the roof, climbing the ladder to an American Huey helicopter. At the top of the ladder stood an American in civilian clothes, pulling people up and shoving them inside. Of course there was no possibility that all the people on the roof could get into the helicopter, and it took off with 12 or 14 on board ... Those left on the roof waited for hours, hoping for more helicopters to arrive. To no avail.&quot; After shooting about 10 frames, Van Es went back to the darkroom and prepared a print for his regular 5pm transmission to Tokyo. It took about 12 minutes to send a single print with a caption but, as he laconically put it: &quot;Editors didn&apos;t read captions carefully in those days.&quot; The picture was erroneously described as showing the embassy roof and, after years of trying to put the record straight, the photographer gave up. &quot;Thus,&quot; he said later, &quot;one of the best known images of the Vietnam war shows something other than what almost everyone thinks it does.&quot; Van Es was a convivial snapper of the old school but, beneath the expletive-laden, gruff exterior, a bit of a softie. His friends knew him as &quot;Vanes&quot;, and he was not only a fully paid-up war veteran but also a gregarious and dominant presence at the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club in Hong Kong, his base in later years. Friends fondly, but ironically, described him as &quot;the Dutch ambassador for couth and culture&quot;. &quot;But it was he,&quot; said Annie, his devoted wife of almost four decades, &quot;who always remembered the birthdays.&quot; And it was he who, in the early 1980s, on a photo-shoot in the New Territories, heard whimpering from a dustbin, and came back with a tiny puppy abandoned by its Chinese owners. The dog became the cherished family pet. Typical Vanes: tough shell, soft centre.  He was born Hubert van Es in Hilversum in the Netherlands and learned his profane and always apparently rudimentary English while hanging out with allied troops at the end of the second world war. He had decided he wanted to become a photographer at the age of 13, after going to a photo exhibition at the local museum which featured the work of the war photographer Robert Capa, who became his lifelong hero.  Van Es began work as a photographer with the Nederlands Fotopersbureau in Amsterdam in 1959. After arriving in Hong Kong as a freelance in 1967, he joined the South China Morning Post as chief photographer, and the following year had a chance to go to Vietnam as a soundman with NBC News. After a brief stint there, he joined the Associated Press staff and was with them in Saigon until 1972, when he transferred to UPI, with whom he spent three years.  The only money he ever made from the famous photograph was a one-off bonus of $150. Proud though he was of the picture, he was even more pleased with the shots he had taken during the battle for Hamburger Hill. Van Es stayed on in Saigon and took pictures of the North Vietnamese, made safer by the Vietnamese words Boa Chi Hoa Lan, meaning Dutch press, which he stuck in his camouflage hat along with a miniature plastic Dutch flag. After Vietnam, he made Hong Kong his base and also covered the Moro rebellion in the Phillipines and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  He is survived by Annie. \u2022 Hugh (Hubert) van Es, photographer, born 6 July 1941; died 15 May 2009"}, {"sentences": ["And of the 20 films in competition for the Palme D&apos;Or, there are two other films by women directors alongside Bright Star: Map of the Sounds of Tokyo by Isabel Coixet and Fish Tank by Andrea Arnold."], "tags": ["Film", "Cannes film festival", "Jane Campion", "Gurinder Chadha", "Andrea Arnold", "Women", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-19T23:01:00Z", "title": "Viv Groskop profiles six women film directors who have broken through the celluloid ceiling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/20/profile-women-film-directors", "article": "In Cannes last week, Jane Campion was on fighting form, urging women to take up arms against the &quot;old boys&apos; network&quot; of the film industry. The 55-year-old New Zealand director, who won the Palme D&apos;Or for The Piano in 1993, was at the festival for the premiere of her new film, Bright Star. &quot;I would love to see more women directors because they represent half of the population and gave birth to the whole world,&quot; she said. &quot;Without them the rest [of the world] are not getting to know the whole story.&quot; Becoming a film-maker means developing a thick skin, she added. &quot;My suspicion is that women aren&apos;t used to that. They must put on their coats of armour and get going.&quot; According to the arts charity Birds Eye View - which supports women directors internationally and launched the UK&apos;s first major women&apos;s film festival in 2005 - only 6% of film directors are female. In Cannes last weekend, Birds Eye View founder, Rachel Millward, hosted a forum for female film-makers, where documentary maker Anne Aghion noted it would not have been possible to combine her career &quot;and the accompanying 16-hour days&quot; with any kind of family life. Female talent is breaking through none the less. Cannes is abuzz over Sam Taylor-Wood&apos;s forthcoming Nowhere Boy, a film about the early life of John Lennon. And of the 20 films in competition for the Palme D&apos;Or, there are two other films by women directors alongside Bright Star: Map of the Sounds of Tokyo by Isabel Coixet and Fish Tank by Andrea Arnold. So who are the rare female directors currently making their mark - the pioneers to inspire the next generation? Here are six of the very best. Andrea Arnold Fish Tank cost only \u00a32m and was shot in 30 days, but it is Arnold&apos;s biggest film to date. Born in Dartford, Arnold, 48, was originally a children&apos;s television presenter, playing Dawn on the Saturday morning programme, Number 73, in the 1980s. Then, in 2004, she won an Oscar for her live-action short film, Wasp, about a single mother on a Kent estate; during her acceptance speech she famously remarked that winning was &quot;the dog&apos;s bollocks&quot;. Her first full-length film, Red Road, about life on a Glasgow housing estate, won comparisons with Lars von Trier and a 2007 Bafta for Best Newcomer. At Cannes, Fish Tank has been hotly tipped. The film&apos;s success has been put down to the raw performance of first-time actor Katie Jarvis as Mia, a 15-year-old excluded from school. Arnold likes her films to be gritty and real: &quot;Dramatically, I like darkness, I like conflict,&quot; she says. &quot;You&apos;ve got to try and present the truth, haven&apos;t you?&quot; Nadine Labaki A Lebanese actor and director once best known for her music videos, Labaki, 35, was propelled on to Variety&apos;s Ten Directors to Look Out For list with the 2007 release of Caramel, a romantic comedy about five women in a beauty salon in Beirut, which she co-wrote, directed and starred in. All the rest of the cast were non-professional actors, and the casting took her a year. A fan of Woody Allen and the Coen Brothers, Labaki&apos;s work has been compared to that of Pedro Almod\u00f3var, and her next project is eagerly awaited. &quot;I need to be obsessed with something before I write about it,&quot; she says, &quot;because I want it to be as true as possible.&quot; Gurinder Chadha Chadha, 49, grew up in Southall, south London, and directed Bhaji on the Beach, Bend it Like Beckham (one of the highest-grossing films of 2002), Bride and Prejudice, and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. &quot;I tell stories about people audiences might think they have nothing in common with,&quot; she says, &quot;then they emotionally connect with them and find they&apos;re not different at all.&quot; A one-time BBC reporter, Chadha moved into film production in 1990. Her first (short) film was Nice Arrangement, about a British-Asian wedding. Married to the Japanese-American film-maker Paul Mayeda Berges, she is now filming It&apos;s a Wonderful Afterlife in London: a film about an Indian matriarch obsessed with marriage, billed as &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding meets Shaun of the Dead.&quot; Kelly Reichardt Reichardt is the US director of the acclaimed Wendy and Lucy, released in the UK earlier this year. Shot for $300,000 in 18 days, it stars Michelle Williams as Wendy, a young woman desperate to start a new life, who finds herself in severe financial difficulties. The New York Times called it &quot;political to the bone but without any of the usual grandstanding&quot;. Reichardt grew up in Miami with a crime-scene investigator father and an undercover narcotics agent mother. Her debut film, River of Grass, was nominated for the Sundance Grand Jury Prize in 1994. She later made a short film, Travis, about the Iraq war, and Old Joy, a commentary on the US, post-9/11, depicted through the lives of two friends in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Dark themes pulse through her work; perhaps not surprising from a director who notes that she enjoys &quot;people most when I&apos;m away from them&quot;. Kasi Lemmons Missouri-born Kasi (pronounced &quot;Casey&quot;) Lemmons, 48, is an actor, writer and director with a string of TV appearances, including stints on The Cosby Show and ER. She played Ardelia Mapp, Clarice Starling&apos;s roommate and fellow FBI agent, in The Silence of the Lambs. Born Karen Lemmons, she is the daughter of a poet/psychotherapist mother and biology teacher father. She made her debut as a writer and director in 1997 with Eve&apos;s Bayou, which starred Samuel L Jackson as a philandering husband. Last year, Talk to Me, her film of the life of 1960s radio personality Ralph Waldo &quot;Petey&quot; Green Jr - starring Don Cheadle, Martin Sheen and Chiwetel Ejiofor - won four awards, including the Image Award for Outstanding Direction in a Motion Picture. Her latest film, Black Nativity, a gospel music re-telling of the Bible, is currently in pre-production. Jennifer Lynch The 41-year-old daughter of David Lynch wrote the Twin Peaks tie-in book, The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, when she was 22 and made her first feature film, the doomed Boxing Helena starring Sherilyn Fenn, in 1993. After the film was critically savaged, Lynch faded from view to write novels and have a daughter, Sydney, now 14. Her second film, Surveillance, starring Julia Ormond and Bill Pullman, released here in March, was a thriller about a pair of FBI agents who arrive in a small town to investigate a multiple murder. Last year Lynch became the first woman in the history of the New York City Horror Film Festival to win the Best Director award. Her mantra? &quot;Make the film you want and then set it free.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Enter the Void was shot in English in Tokyo, and centres on a young man who, following the brutal death of his parents, wants to look out for his younger sister."], "tags": ["Cannes 2009", "Cannes film festival", "Drama", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-22T12:30:23Z", "title": "Irr\u00e9versible's No\u00e9 reverses for 'sentimental' Cannes contender", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/22/cannes-film-festival-gaspar-noe", "article": "A few days before the Cannes premiere of his new feature Enter the Void, director Gaspar No\u00e9 is in fretful mood, in &quot;a huge, huge rush&quot; to get his film finished in time for screening.

Every year, there is a scandal, even when there is no reason to have one.&quot; This time around, he doubts that there will be anything to upset audiences too much. He describes his new film as &quot;sentimental&quot;, a melodrama. He also thinks it is his most ambitious work yet, in which he has tried to portray &quot;altered states of consciousness&quot;. When his lead character closes his eyes, the director hopes to place the audience entirely inside his mind. Enter the Void was shot in English in Tokyo, and centres on a young man who, following the brutal death of his parents, wants to look out for his younger sister. He himself is dying. This is No\u00e9 in Kubrick mode, a film in part inspired by his reverence for 2001: A Space Odyssey, which he first saw when he was eight and has seen at least 40 times since. &quot;That was my first hallucinogenic trip ever \u2013 seeing that on a big screen.&quot; Nobody has yet seen the film, and No\u00e9 is angry about existing online speculation. &quot;I don&apos;t know who the fuck put Philippe Nahon into my movie,&quot; he says of the burly French actor who has appeared in his two previous features, Seul Contre Tous and Irr\u00e9versible.  Enter the Void was an exhausting film to make, No\u00e9 says. He did extensive research into near-death experiences, astral projection and chemically-induced hallucinations; he pored over the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Then there was an immensely complex shoot, and an even more complicated post-production process: the film boasts special effects from Pierre Buffin, whose credits include Spider-Man 3 and Alexander.  Now, No\u00e9 says, he wants to relax by making a &quot;joyful&quot; and explicit sex film - he makes it sound something like an avant garde version of an Alex Comfort book. Working with a small crew, and shooting sex instead of SFX, will be like a quiet Sunday after a very hectic week.  \u2022 Enter the Void screens in competition at the Cannes film festival today."}, {"sentences": ["In this company, Korea&apos;s Joon-ho Bong is surprisingly the poor relation, with Shaking Tokyo, about a recluse forced to engage with life again, though it has its moments."], "tags": ["DVD and video reviews", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-22T13:40:00Z", "title": "DVD review: Tokyo!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/22/dvd-review-tokyo", "article": "An enjoyably loopy triptych of films set in Japan&apos;s crowded capital, by three talented outsiders.

The winners will be announced on 10 June.  Factor fiction? Consumer champion Which? is calling for a review of the guidelines on how sunscreen SPF factors are calculated, arguing that the rules allow different methods of testing that could result in very different results. &quot;The fact that sunscreens with the same factor on the label can be tested in different ways means they won&apos;t necessarily give the same level of protection, and that&apos;s a problem if people assume they are interchangeable,&quot; said Martyn Hocking, editor of Which? magazine. Its tests found four suncreams which claimed an SPF of 15 gave far lower protection, while Asda&apos;s bargain Sun System factor 15, which costs just \u00a33, had an actual SPF of 24.

However, the Mississippi River meets the Missouri River near St Louis.   The love song of Thomas Stearns Eliot is one of 20th-century literature&apos;s untold stories. Most of the players in this strange romance are dead now, but she who was at the heart of it lingers on in the twilight of old age, surrounded by the memorabilia of lost times. Valerie, the second Mrs Eliot, lives still in Kensington, west London, in the marital flat she shared with the poet before his death in 1965, a date faithfully recorded on the blue plaque outside. Inside, in scrapbooks never before revealed, is a touching record of that marriage, a miscellany of billets-doux between an impressionable but tough-minded young woman and the poet who occasionally liked to refer to himself, in a playful reference to his Mississippi roots, as &quot;Old Possum&quot;. Both seem conscious of the timeless romantic appeal of their relationship, however discreet they were about it at the time. Valerie, as much as her &quot;Tom&quot;, is alert to posterity&apos;s gaze when she writes, on a playbill for Anouilh&apos;s Antigone: &quot;I sat next to TSE, my darling, and that makes any play endurable.&quot; If their contemporaries in 1957 could have seen these notes - an enthralling insight into a late love affair - they may have been astonished. As well as being the most influential poet of his time, TS Eliot was also a director of the publisher Faber &amp; Faber. In this role of editorial patron, he discovered and nurtured many of the greatest talents of the age: WH Auden, Stephen Spender, Philip Larkin, Ted Hughes, Robert Lowell, Marianne Moore and many others across the English-speaking world. And then there was his life as a poet, the celebrated author of The Waste Land, Murder in the Cathedral, Four Quartets and The Cocktail Party. In his prime, Eliot enjoyed a power and an influence unimaginable today. Within the Vatican of Anglo-American letters, he was the Pope. Generations of schoolchildren were raised on &quot;Prufrock&quot;; young, would-be intellectuals studied his critical writings; and for critics everywhere, he was the ultimate literary yardstick. Eliot&apos;s fearsome reputation was buttressed by an aloof and secretive public persona. In 1948, Eliot was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Featured on the cover of Time, even quoted in a US petrol advertisement, mobbed by the press on transatlantic crossings, Eliot was swamped with attention, and so was his secretary, who quit. In August 1949, having advertised for a replacement, Eliot hired a young woman from Leeds named Valerie Fletcher. The latest recruit to the Faber typing pool was a remarkable, and remarkably attractive, young woman on a mission. She had been obsessed - the word is hardly too strong - with TS Eliot and his poetry since the age of 14 when she first heard &quot;The Journey of the Magi&quot; in a recording by the poet. &quot;It was extraordinary,&quot; she told the Observer in 1972. &quot;I felt I just had to get to Tom, to work with him.&quot; After a stint at a secretarial college, she had been employed by novelist Charles Morgan, simply as a preparation for somehow getting a job with Faber. At her interview, when the vacancy arose, Eliot had chain-smoked and was, she remembered, &quot;obviously as nervous as I was&quot;.  Almost eight years later, towards the end of 1956, and because &quot;Miss Fletcher&quot; was now a respectable 30 year old, the great poet, in his late 60s, proposed marriage to the super-efficient secretary who always called him &quot;Mr Eliot&quot; when she answered the buzzer from her boss. Once he was accepted, he confessed that he would have asked her much sooner if he had known the strength of her feelings, but she had been so formal with him that he was unsure whether she liked him. There were many reasons for Eliot to be wary of matrimony, but most of them could be expressed in the fateful and tragic name of Vivien Haigh-Wood, his recently deceased first wife. Eliot, the expatriate American from St Louis and avant-garde author of &quot;The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock&quot;, had met the &quot;vivacious&quot;, neurasthenic Vivien (also known as &quot;Vivienne&quot;) in Oxford during the spring of 1915.  They were married in London, after a whirlwind courtship, on 26 June 1915. It was a decision that Eliot came bitterly to regret. He soon discovered that his new wife had a history of nervous illness that had left her emotionally unstable, physically fragile and horribly vulnerable to the brooding immaturity of her young American husband. Eliot&apos;s first marriage became a nightmare, partly of his own making, some of which is reflected in The Waste Land, the poem that he completed during the years 1915-22. Some say that Vivien&apos;s influence on the poem is decisive and even that she had a hand in it. Certainly, there is no doubt that her precarious health blighted every aspect of Eliot&apos;s life and drove him to the edge of a breakdown. By 1923, newly acclaimed for The Waste Land, he was renting rooms in Charing Cross Road, had adopted a bizarre alias, &quot;Captain Eliot&quot;, and taken to wearing pale green face powder and lipstick.  By the mid 1920s, with Vivien now afflicted by rheumatism and neuralgia, the Eliots were living in what Vivien referred to as &quot;a fearful abyss&quot; - a darkened flat, no visitors, no social life, a kind of psychological paralysis in which Eliot hardly felt himself to be alive.  In 1927, coming out of yet another marital crisis, Eliot found the consolations of faith, was baptised and then received into the Church of England. To those admirers for whom The Waste Land had been the work of a great modern iconoclast, this was a profound betrayal. The same year, completing his psychological transition to England, he dropped his American citizenship. Meanwhile, Vivien was migrating madly from sanatorium to sanatorium. On her rare visits to London, she caused her respectable husband, who had left his job in the City to join Faber &amp; Faber, acute distress. On one typical occasion, at a book party, she had screamed at him: &quot;You are the bloodiest snob I ever knew&quot;, to his intense embarrassment. Not surprisingly, Eliot took refuge in alcohol. Anthony Powell wrote in his diary: &quot;Eliot always drunk these days.&quot; And so the tragedy of Mr and Mrs Eliot continued to unfold. The poet sequestered himself in his third-floor office at 24 Russell Square in London. If Vivien called, the Faber staff were instructed to say that he was out, while he slipped away from the building by a back door. Vivien, in extremis, went around London with a &quot;joke knife&quot; made of rubber, threatening retribution. By 1935, in a state of near total collapse, Vivien was also causing scenes at performances of her husband&apos;s plays.  Finally, in 1938, Eliot and the Haigh-Wood family, in a controversial move whose details remain obscure and hotly disputed, arranged for Vivien to be committed to a private mental hospital in Finsbury Park. She died there in 1949, coincidentally in the same year that Valerie Fletcher joined Faber &amp; Faber as &quot;Mr Eliot&apos;s secretary&quot;. With such a traumatic history, Eliot, who was a cautious man at the best of times, proceeded with infinite caution in his courtship of Valerie. They both did. Another secretary, later a director, at Faber, Rosemary Goad, has vivid memories of &quot;Miss Fletcher&quot;, the new girl in the typing pool. &quot;We used to tease her mercilessly about her devotion to TSE, but she took it in good part,&quot; she says. &quot;None of us suspected any romance. It was so unlikely, it never occurred to us.&quot;  She still recalls her colleague&apos;s immense discretion, even when she was actually wearing &quot;this socking great emerald&quot; engagement ring. &quot;We asked her many times who&apos;d given her the ring, but she never told us,&quot; says Goad, who also remembers that Eliot used to take his secretary for drinks after work to the Russell Hotel. &quot;He used to give her red roses,&quot; she told me last week. Like many of the other momentous occasions in Eliot&apos;s life, his marriage to Valerie was conducted amid the greatest secrecy at St Barnabas church, Kensington, very early in the morning of 10 January 1957. Eliot&apos;s reason for not confiding in even his closest friends was his horror of publicity, but it suited him temperamentally and, besides, he wanted to keep this for himself. All the evidence points to an elderly man (aged 69) revelling in the unfamiliar sensations of romantic love. In his scrapbooks, shown exclusively to the Observer, it is possible to see Eliot&apos;s meticulous planning of this momentous early-morning ceremony. No one was told in advance. The Faber office would get the news from a letter to the chairman, Geoffrey Faber. Not even Eliot&apos;s long-standing friend and fellow lodger in Carlyle Mansions, the publisher John Hayward, would know until the morning itself. At 7.15 am, a plain van would collect the blushing groom from an overnight stay at the Athenaeum, his club, for the short ride to the church in Addison Road. The only witnesses to the marriage would be Valerie Fletcher&apos;s parents, who had stayed with their daughter at Bailey&apos;s Hotel. The best man, a friend of Eliot&apos;s, was also the officiating priest, the Reverend CP Wright. At eight o&apos;clock, after the short ceremony, a taxi would whisk the happy couple to their wedding breakfast at a nearby flat followed by a flight to the south of France. By the time the news broke - &quot;The Confidential Bride&quot; - they would be beyond the reach of Fleet Street. Almost, but not quite. The scrapbooks contain a cutting from the Daily Express: &quot;TS Eliot gives a unique photo-interview&quot;. It does not seem to have mattered. A blissful, newly married Valerie Eliot sent a postcard back to her secretarial colleagues at Faber, &quot;I have so much to tell you on Monday so prepare to do no work!&quot; she wrote. &quot;A Daily Express photographer caught us in the lounge this evening and a Daily Mail man pursued us to Roquebrune! A lovely honeymoon apart from TSE catching flu, and cracking a tooth.&quot; After his death, she told the BBC: &quot;He obviously needed to have a happy marriage. He wouldn&apos;t die until he&apos;d had it. There was a little boy in him that had never been released.&quot; Despite the 38-year age difference, Eliot&apos;s second marriage brought fulfilment. Rosemary Goad says: &quot;He was completely rejuvenated by Valerie.&quot; As a member of the Faber staff long after Eliot&apos;s death, I remember his American publisher, Robert Giroux, telling me about Mr and Mrs Eliot&apos;s first visit to New York as newlyweds. On the day after landing with his young bride, the famous author telephoned his editor with just one request. The hotel was just fine, but they would like a double bed. Everyone agrees that Eliot revelled in married life with Valerie, writing in one late poem (&quot;A Dedication to My Wife&quot;) of &quot;lovers whose bodies smell of each other&quot;. In the scrapbooks, the couple collected a wealth of tender, mundane trivia, samples of bedroom wallpaper, notes scribbled on theatre programmes, carefully dated press cuttings and annotated menus (&quot;Valerie had crepe suzette&quot;) from fancy dinners. At literary parties, onlookers were fascinated to see the cadaverous figure of the poet holding hands with his bosomy, blonde new wife. For her part, Valerie was always there to fend off unwelcome attention. From the scrapbooks, too, there&apos;s evidence that Eliot p layed the role of mentor and father-figure as well as lover and husband. Mostly they stayed home at night, but when they went to the theatre, he would carefully annotate their programme. After seeing Beyond the Fringe, Eliot noted on the back of his playbill: &quot;Amazingly vigorous quartet of young men: their show well-produced and fast moving, a mixture of brilliance, juvenility and bad taste.&quot; Here he singled out Peter Cook and Alan Bennett, concluding that &quot;it is pleasant to see this type of entertainment so successful&quot;. In another cutting, he tells the Daily Express: &quot;I am thinking of taking up dancing lessons again, as I have not danced for some years.&quot; The new joy in Eliot&apos;s life breaks cover in his late work. At the time of his marriage, he was completing a new play, The Elder Statesman, in which a very senior public figure is compared to a silkworm who has subsisted for years on very bitter mulberry leaves. His daughter tells him it is time to give up this diet and break out into the world like a butterfly. The tragedy of Eliot&apos;s newfound happiness was that his health, never good, was beginning to fail. In foggy, postwar London, he suffered badly from influenza and bronchitis and his heart was weak. Valerie arranged for Eliot to take convalescent winter holidays in the Bahamas and the Caribbean. Their scrapbooks contain many photographs of them relaxing in the sunshine. Eliot, in waistcoat and white golfing cap, might have the bottoms of his trousers rolled up, but he still looks awkward and out of place, like a bank clerk on the razzle. As well as visits to Jamaica, every year Valerie would take her husband to stay with her old mother in Leeds. Mrs Fletcher was predictably dazzled by her famous son-in-law and impressed by what she called his &quot;virginal&quot; looks.  In June 1964, Eliot visited Leeds, which he had come to like, for the last time. In October, he collapsed into a coma from which he was not expected to recover. Valerie held his hand in a nightlong vigil and in the morning he regained consciousness. Later, she told the Observer that he &quot;looked at me as if to say &apos;I&apos;ve done it&apos;&quot; and she took him home to Kensington. As he was carried across the threshold of the flat, he exclaimed: &quot;Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah&quot; and for a while he rallied. But he was living on oxygen and at Christmas his heart began to fail again. According to Peter Ackroyd, whose unauthorised account of his life is by far the best available, he came out of his final coma to utter Valerie&apos;s name and then died on 4 January 1965. Valerie was 38 when he died. For years, she left their Kensington flat as a shrine to his memory, with nothing changed, down to the oxygen bottles from his final days. In addition to her profound bereavement, she was left with the complex legacy of TS Eliot&apos;s literary estate which was fast becoming a publishing phenomenon. As well as the administration of numerous valuable copyrights around the world, and a constant drizzle of literary requests, particularly from India, where Eliot is held in special reverence, there was the intractable, and increasingly vexatious, question of the poet&apos;s last wishes.  In his will, in keeping with the spirit of his times, which abhorred personal vanity, Eliot had directed that there should be &quot;no biography&quot;. A number of scholars and contemporaries tried to breach this interdiction with various kinds of ephemeral memoir, with no encouragement from the estate. As his widow, Valerie felt obliged to uphold her late husband&apos;s wishes. She became a byword in academia for her unwillingness either to co-operate with, or grant permission to, the hordes of academics who were swarming over Eliot&apos;s life and work. Slowly, she took command of the Eliot business. In 1974, to widespread acclaim, she published a facsimile edition of The Waste Land, complete with a full-blown scholarly apparatus. Rosemary Goad remembers: &quot;Valerie was very proud of this edition. It meant she could at last hold her own as an Eliot scholar.&quot; Then came Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s musical of Old Possum&apos;s Book of Practical Cats. Suddenly, the forbidding author of The Waste Land was being seen in a new and more playful light by schoolchildren and their parents as far afield as Tokyo and Buenos Aires. Cats also made the Eliot estate immensely rich, feeding more envy. In those days, in the mid 1980s, the Valerie Eliot I knew was extracting huge enjoyment from the heady razzmatazz surrounding the Eliot estate&apos;s unexpected good fortune. Magnificently turned out in high 30s fashion, her presence added a blast of prewar fun to the routine proceedings of the Faber board. After the meeting was over, she needed no encouragement to come to the Savoy Grill, where she would be indulged like minor royalty. &quot;Let&apos;s have a little gin, dear,&quot; would be the regular preamble to hours of fascinating reminiscence about &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Wystan&quot; and &quot;Stephen&quot;, and many others from the heyday of British modernism. If only someone could have recorded these moments of spontaneous recollection! Today, Valerie Eliot remains contentedly in the flat she shared with her husband, &quot;living and partly living&quot;, in the words of the Chorus to Murder in the Cathedral. The Eliot papers are safe in Harvard, Texas, New York and elsewhere, but inscribed first editions of many landmark texts from the 20th century are crammed into wall-to-wall bookcases. Elsewhere, on tables and dressers, are countless photographs and miniatures, a tantalising display of Edwardiana. Now 82, her health is frail, but she has constant help and the devoted assistance of Debbie, her confidential secretary. She never gives interviews. In the evenings, she attends occasional literary functions and sees friends from the old days such as Stephen Spender&apos;s widow, Natasha. When the many volumes of TS Eliot&apos;s letters begin to be published later in 2009, his fans will be one step closer to that elusive biography. For the moment, his widow cherishes his memory among a tantalising mass of memorabilia and has just allowed the BBC to make a film about the private and public face of the man she still calls &quot;Tom&quot;, sometimes in the present tense. \u2022 Arena: TS Eliot is on BBC2 on Saturday 6 June at 9.40pm The scrapbooks: tokens from a true-life romance Every family album is vibrant with the frisson of the unguarded pose and the snatched or unscripted moment. These eight bulging Eliot scrapbooks which have lain unexamined for almost half a century on Mrs Eliot&apos;s shelves, are particularly absorbing for three main reasons.  First, from a life in which so much is public and stripped bare of any mystery, it&apos;s fascinating to go behind the scenes and see the poet putting his feet up, so to speak. Second, from the loving accumulation of mundane cuttings, playbills and menus, you get an extraordinary insight into the relationship between &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Val&quot;. It&apos;s instructive to see how much devoted attention they paid to the quality of their domestic life and the private thrill they obviously derived from living in the present moment. Finally, these forgotten volumes paint a moving picture of Eliot in old age, a great writer who was lucky enough to marry a woman happy to be his devoted handmaiden as much as his wife and muse.  But more than just satisfying crude literary voyeurism, these scrapbooks expose what life was like in the literary London of the 1960s and how di\ufb00erent it was from our own times.

The KNCA news agency, the regime&apos;s official mouthpiece, said: &quot;We have successfully conducted another nuclear test on 25 May as part of the republic&apos;s measures to strengthen its nuclear deterrent.&quot; Officials in South Korea said they had detected a minor tremor consistent with those caused by an underground nuclear explosion. The country&apos;s Yonhap news agency quoted a government source as saying that the North had test fired a short-range missile immediately after the nuclear test. The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting in New York later today to discuss its response to the latest escalation in the North Korean nuclear crisis. President Barack Obama called the test a matter of grave concern to all nations. &quot;North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community,&quot; Obama said in a statement. &quot;North Korea&apos;s behaviour increases tensions and undermines stability in north-east Asia.&quot; Gordon Brown described the test as &quot;erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.&quot; The prime minister added: &quot;This act will undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula and will do nothing for North Korea&apos;s security. The North Korean news agency said the test had been &quot;safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control. The test will contribute to defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism and ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the region.&quot; South Korea and Japan condemned the test, North Korea&apos;s second since it exploded its first nuclear device in October 2006 in defiance of international opinion. That test prompted the UN security to pass a resolution banning Pyongyang from activities related to its ballistic missile programme. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, convened a session of the country&apos;s security council after seismologists reported earthquakes in the Kilju region, site of the North&apos;s first nuclear test. In Tokyo, Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Takeo Kawamura, said the test was &quot;a clear violation of the UN security council resolution and can not be tolerated&quot;. North Korea had warned of a second nuclear test after the UN condemned its test-launch of a ballistic missile on 5 April and agreed to tighten sanctions put in place in 2006. Pyongyang insisted it had put a peaceful communications satellite in orbit, but experts said the technology and methods were identical to those used to launch a long-range Taepodong-2 missile. After the UN refused to apologise for condemning the launch, North Korea expelled international inspectors, threatened to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor \u2013 which it had agreed to start dismantling in 2007 \u2013 and walked away from six-party nuclear talks. Today&apos;s test will add to fears that the North is moving closer to possessing the ability to mount a nuclear warhead on long-range missiles that are capable, in theory, of reaching Hawaii and Alaska. &quot;This test, if confirmed, could indicate North Korea&apos;s decision to work at securing actual nuclear capabilities,&quot; Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongkuk University in Seoul, told Reuters. &quot;North Korea had been expecting the new US administration to mark a shift from the previous administration&apos;s stance, but is realising that there are no changes. It may have decided that a second test was necessary. [It] seems to be reacting to the US and South Korean administrations&apos; policies.&quot; Analysts believe the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, hoped to use the test to shore up support from the military amid mounting speculation that he is about to name one of his three sons as his successor. Kim, 67, appears to be re-establishing his grip on power since reportedly suffering a stroke last August. Today&apos;s test is a direct challenge to attempts by Obama to engage the North and stem the spread of nuclear weapons. Despite promising a fresh start to bilateral relations, Obama, who denounced last month&apos;s missile launch as &quot;a provocation,&quot; has so far failed to persuade North Korean to enter into negotiations. Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace in Tokyo, who is close to Pyongyang, said the test was a reminder that North Korea &quot;is going it alone as a nuclear power&quot;. &quot;North Korea doesn&apos;t need any talks with America. America is tricky and undesirable,&quot; he said. &quot;It does not implement its own agreements. &quot;We are not going to worry about sanctions. If they sanction us, we will become more powerful. Sanctions never help America; they are counter-productive ... We don&apos;t care about America and what they say.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The eldest, Kim Jong-nam, whose mother was Song Hye-rim, Kim&apos;s first mistress, is widely believed to have fallen out of favour with his father after he was arrested in Tokyo in 2001 while travelling on a false passport."], "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "World news", "US foreign policy"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-25T11:00:00Z", "title": "No more sunshine in North Korea | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/25/north-korea", "article": "North Korea&apos;s latest actions, seen as recklessly dangerous by the outside world, may be broadly explained in three ways. The first is that Pyongyang is in the grip of an intensifying power struggle over the succession to the country&apos;s ailing president and Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il. The 67-year-old Kim recently re-emerged in public after suffering what appeared to have been a stroke last year. But he did not look well \u2013 almost a shadow of his former chubby, occasionally ebullient self. Some Korea-watchers suggest Kim has not fully recovered from the death in 2004 of Ko Young-hee, North Korea&apos;s de facto First Lady and the mother of the younger two of his three sons. Signs of internal tensions have continued to grow despite Kim&apos;s political resurrection, including a cabinet reshuffle in which about one-third of ministers lost their jobs or were reassigned. A similar shake-up is said to have taken place among the highest ranks of the military. This internal turmoil has been accompanied by a sharp upturn in aggressive rhetoric against neighbours and western countries and a marked deterioration in relations with South Korea&apos;s new, less conciliatory presidency. Following its latest missile test earlier this year and the UN censure that ensued, Pyongyang also escalated diplomatically, declaring it would &quot;never&quot; resume negotiations on its nuclear and missile programmes in the so-called six-party talks with the US, Japan, China, Russia, and South Korea. Adding to the strains, the North Korean economy, never less than a disaster area since the Soviet Union pulled the plug on assistance in 1990, has suffered further due to deepening international isolation and, to a limited degree, due to the knock-on effects of the global recession on China, its main trading partner. Speculation about a shift in power at the top focuses on Kim&apos;s sons. The eldest, Kim Jong-nam, whose mother was Song Hye-rim, Kim&apos;s first mistress, is widely believed to have fallen out of favour with his father after he was arrested in Tokyo in 2001 while travelling on a false passport. Some South Korean observers have claimed that Kim regards his eldest son as effeminate and not tough enough to take the helm. The second son, Kim Jong-chul, may also be a bit of a problem. Although he holds a middle rank in the military apparatus, his political profile is low. His interests may lie elsewhere. In 2006 he was reliably reported to have attended an Eric Clapton rock concert in Germany and possibly some football World Cup matches too. That leaves the youngest son, Kim Jong-woon (also known as Jong-un). South Korean media claimed this year that the Great Leader had chosen his third son as his successor. This was supposedly because Kim the youngest, who received some of his education in Switzerland and reportedly speaks some foreign languages, was temperamentally &quot;just like his father&quot;, with a strong will, firm ideas and a fierce temper if challenged. According to a leading expert on North Korea, the British academic Aidan Foster-Carter, a developing fight for supremacy is the most probable explanation for Pyongyang&apos;s aggressive behaviour. &quot;North Korea is snarling more. That suggests an internal power struggle,&quot; Foster-Carter told a seminar at the Chatham House thinktank in London last week. &quot;The dog barks loudest when it&apos;s feeling vulnerable. And maybe it&apos;s safer to be a hardliner than a softliner when there&apos;s a power struggle going on.&quot; But there could be no certainty, he added, given the regime&apos;s secretive nature. What might look like a many-sided succession battle might in reality be the &quot;slitherings of a single snake&quot;. Jim Hoare, a former British ambassador to North Korea, said a second explanation should be considered: that North Korea was reacting to what it perceived to be threatening and destabilising external events, notably the ending of South Korea&apos;s &quot;sunshine policy&quot; that had encouraged deeper engagement. Hoare said the Bush administration was not without blame for the breakdown in the de-nuclearisation agreement forged two years ago. &quot;Both sides failed to keep to the step by step approach, both missed deadlines,&quot; Hoare said. From this perspective, North Korea&apos;s latest nuclear test and missile launching could be seen as an attempt to get Barack Obama&apos;s attention and to push the North Korean issue up Washington&apos;s agenda. At the same time only one country, China, not the US, could apply really serious leverage as North Korea&apos;s major supplier of oil and food, Hoare said. America&apos;s options were limited and China&apos;s policy was driven by self-interest. &quot;In practice China only acts when the issue concerns China&apos;s national interests. Beijing will not necessarily handle the issue as the west and the US might want.&quot; Foster-Carter said that whatever the international community did in response, North Korea&apos;s &quot;essentialist&quot; position was unlikely to change. This had been formed 50 years ago by the experience of US bombing during the Korean war. &quot;They have made sure they are armed to the teeth ever since. What did they do during those 10 years of sunshine [policy]? They exploded a nuclear device.&quot; On the other hand, it was a mistake to see the regime as thoroughly incorrigible, he said. Despite its behaviour, the need for interlocutors was greater than ever. In the longer run, the west should be patient. The whole authoritarian state structure was likely to collapse eventually, possibly like Ceausescu&apos;s Romania, and when it did, the international community needed to be ready with stabilising contingency plans. The third possible explanation for North Korea&apos;s action today is the least palatable: the possibility that, increasingly, nobody is really in charge in Pyongyang and that the country is beginning literally to run out of control. If North Korea suddenly imploded, the US and South Korea might come in from one side and China from the other, Foster-Carter warned. The danger of history repeating itself was, he said, a &quot;baleful prospect&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo, Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Takeo Kawamura, said the test was &quot;a clear violation of the UN security council resolution and cannot be tolerated&quot;.", "Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace in Tokyo, who is close to Pyongyang, said the test was a reminder that North Korea &quot;is going it alone as a nuclear power&quot;."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "US news", "World news", "Earthquakes"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-25T15:17:00Z", "title": "North Korea tests nuclear weapon 'as powerful as Hiroshima bomb'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/25/north-korea-hiroshima-nuclear-test", "article": "North Korea today risked further international isolation after it claimed to have successfully tested a nuclear weapon as powerful as the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The test comes less than two months after the North enraged the US and its allies by test firing a long-range ballistic missile. The KNCA news agency, the regime&apos;s official mouthpiece, said: &quot;We have successfully conducted another nuclear test on 25 May as part of the republic&apos;s measures to strengthen its nuclear deterrent.&quot; Officials in South Korea said they had detected a tremor consistent with those caused by an underground nuclear explosion. The country&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported that the North had test-fired three short-range missiles from a base on the east coast immediately after the nuclear test. The underground atomic explosion, at 9.54am local time (0154 BST), created an earthquake measuring magnitude 4.5 in Kilju county in the country&apos;s north-east, reports said. President Barack Obama called the test a matter of grave concern to all countries. &quot;North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;North Korea&apos;s behaviour increases tensions and undermines stability in north-east Asia.&quot; He added that North Korea&apos;s behaviour would serve only to deepen the country&apos;s isolation.     Korea1.gif    &quot;It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,&quot; he said. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said he was &quot;deeply worried&quot; by the development. The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting in New York later today to discuss its response to the latest escalation in the crisis. Obama and other leaders did not offer details on the council&apos;s possible response. China, North Korea&apos;s key ally, said it was &quot;resolutely opposed&quot; to the test, urging its neighbour to avoid actions that would sharpen tensions and return to six-party arms-for-disarmament talks. Japan, which considers itself high on the North&apos;s potential hit list, said it would seek a new resolution condemning the test. Russian defence experts estimated the explosion&apos;s yield at between 10 and 20 kilotons, many times more than the 1\u00a0kiloton measured in its first nuclear test in 2006 and about as powerful as the bombs the US used against Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war. One kiloton is equal to the force produced by 1,000 tonnes of TNT. The force of the blast made the ground tremble in the Chinese border city of Yanji, 130 miles away. The North Korean news agency said the test had been &quot;safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control. The test will contribute to defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism and ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the region.&quot; Gordon Brown described the test as &quot;erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world&quot;. The prime minister added: &quot;This act will undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula and will do nothing for North Korea&apos;s security.&quot; South Korea condemned the test, North Korea&apos;s second since it exploded its first nuclear device in October 2006 in defiance of international opinion. That test prompted the UN to pass a resolution banning Pyongyang from activities related to its ballistic missile programme. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, convened a session of the country&apos;s security council after seismologists reported earthquakes in the Kilju region, site of the North&apos;s first nuclear test. In Tokyo, Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Takeo Kawamura, said the test was &quot;a clear violation of the UN security council resolution and cannot be tolerated&quot;. North Korea had warned of a second nuclear test after the UN condemned its test-launch of a ballistic missile on 5 April and agreed to tighten sanctions put in place in 2006. Pyongyang insisted it had put a peaceful communications satellite in orbit, but experts said the technology and methods were identical to those used to launch a long-range Taepodong-2 missile. After the UN refused to apologise for condemning the launch, North Korea expelled international inspectors, threatened to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor \u2013 which it had agreed to start dismantling in 2007 \u2013 and walked away from six-party nuclear talks. Today&apos;s test will add to fears that the North is moving closer to possessing the ability to mount a nuclear warhead on long-range missiles that are capable, in theory, of reaching Hawaii and Alaska. &quot;This test, if confirmed, could indicate North Korea&apos;s decision to work at securing actual nuclear capabilities,&quot; Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongkuk University in Seoul, told Reuters. &quot;North Korea had been expecting the new US administration to mark a shift from the previous administration&apos;s stance, but is realising that there are no changes. It may have decided that a second test was necessary. [It] seems to be reacting to the US and South Korean administrations&apos; policies.&quot; Analysts believe the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, hopes to use the test to shore up support from the military amid mounting speculation that he is about to name one of his three sons as his successor. Kim, 67, appears to be re-establishing his grip on power since reportedly suffering a stroke last August. Today&apos;s test is a direct challenge to attempts by Obama to engage the North and stem the spread of nuclear weapons. Despite promising a fresh start to bilateral relations, Obama, who denounced last month&apos;s missile launch as &quot;a provocation,&quot; has so far failed to persuade North Korean to enter into negotiations. Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace in Tokyo, who is close to Pyongyang, said the test was a reminder that North Korea &quot;is going it alone as a nuclear power&quot;. &quot;North Korea doesn&apos;t need any talks with America. America is tricky and undesirable,&quot; he said. &quot;It does not implement its own agreements. &quot;We are not going to worry about sanctions. If they sanction us, we will become more powerful. Sanctions never help America; they are counter-productive \u2026 We don&apos;t care about America and what they say.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["His eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, whose mother was Kim&apos;s first mistress, is believed to have fallen out with his father after he was arrested in Tokyo in 2001 travelling on a false passport."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Kim Jong-il", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-26T00:40:00Z", "title": "Nuclear shock waves felt in United States, but Kim Jong-il's real target may be closer to home", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/25/north-korea-nuclear-test-analysis", "article": "For senior staffers on the east Asia desk of the US national security council, gathered in the inner sanctums of Barack Obama&apos;s White House, the news, when it came, could hardly have been worse. North Korea was about to detonate another, bigger nuclear device in defiance of American-led worldwide opposition. And there was nothing the US could do about it. It is not clear when the White House learned of the impending test, although a South Korean presidential aide was quoted yesterday as saying the North had informed the US in advance. What is clear is that the grand panjandrums of Pyongyang, the secretive leaders who dwell in the hermit kingdom&apos;s mysterious palaces of smoke and mirrors, have confounded their adversaries once again. In strategic terms, the implications of their atomic demarche are substantial. By demonstrating that it has, beyond any lingering doubt, joined the nuclear &quot;club&quot;, North Korea has directly challenged the international authority not only of the US but also of its regionally more influential neighbours, China and Russia. By also firing off three short-range missiles, following April&apos;s alleged ballistic missile test, the North has seriously compromised the security of Japan and South Korea. In political terms, Pyongyang&apos;s second bomb exploded directly under the United Nations, given that the security council&apos;s resolution 1718 explicitly forbade such a repeat action after the first test in 2006. The debris from the blast includes the half-hearted sanctions, and the carrots of aid and fuel which the international community has brandished alternately in vain efforts to change the North&apos;s behaviour. In immediate terms, the detonation appears to have destroyed what remained of the six-party talks \u2013 the process whereby the US, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China had sought jointly to induce Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear programme. It has heightened proliferation concerns, given the North&apos;s alleged record of nuclear trade with Syria and Iran. And in passing, the test heaped symbolic scorn on Obama&apos;s aspirations towards a nuclear-free world. Yesterday&apos;s events revived long-\u00adstanding differences of opinion over what is driving North Korea&apos;s behaviour, and how best to respond. Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, suggested North Korea&apos;s eccentric &quot;dear leader&quot;, Kim Jong-il, was trying primarily to secure his family dynasty against its enemies. &quot;They are trying to achieve security and leadership \u2013 taking steps to enhance national security and the likelihood of regime survival.&quot; The test was worthy of condemnation, Pinkston said, but added: &quot;The international community must keep the door open on diplomacy and should not abandon it, though the situation is bleak.&quot; Glyn Ford, author of North Korea on the Brink, described the test as &quot;a message to Obama&quot;. Like other commentators, he said Kim was demanding Washington&apos;s attention, and hoping for concessions. But Aidan Foster-Carter, a leading British academic, said the most likely reason for the regime&apos;s behaviour was an intensifying fight over the succession from the ailing, elderly Kim. &quot;North Korea is snarling more. That suggests an internal power struggle,&quot; Foster-Carter told the Chatham House thinktank in London last week. &quot;The dog barks loudest when it&apos;s feeling vulnerable. And maybe it&apos;s safer to be a hardliner than a softliner when there&apos;s a power struggle going on.&quot; What analysts can agree on is that the situation has deteriorated sharply in the last year or so. In February 2007, the North agreed to abandon its nuclear ambitions in return for western aid, including a gradual end to its isolation. In October that year, the two Koreas held a summit, only the second of its kind, at which a raft of agreements was unveiled. As an earnest of its goodwill, Pyongyang began to dismantle its main nuclear facility at Yongbyon. But then things began to go wrong. The Bush administration insisted on intrusive verification measures. Pyongyang complained that the US was slow to remove it from its list of states sponsoring terrorism. Hawks on both sides tried to undermine the deal. US aid was delayed. Then came this year&apos;s six-party talks walkout over new missile testing, with the North saying it would never return. In the last few months the North&apos;s actions have become disproportionately aggressive. &quot;Both sides failed to keep to the step by step approach, both missed deadlines,&quot; said Jim Hoare, a former British ambassador to Pyongyang. &quot;[The North&apos;s] actions have made it very difficult to be positive. It&apos;s not possible to contemplate some grand initiative because the invitation is not on the table.&quot; Kim, 67, returned to public view after apparently suffering a stroke last year, but his authority may not have been fully restored. Signs of rising internal tensions include a cabinet reshuffle in which about one-third of ministers lost their jobs or were reassigned. The downward spiral seems to have been reinforced by the advent in Seoul of a more hawkish presidency disinclined to pursue the &quot;sunshine policy&quot; of engagement advocated by the late Roh Moo-hyun, who, in an apparent coincidence, killed himself at the weekend. Speculation about a shift in power at the top focuses on Kim&apos;s sons \u2013 and on his apparent wish to secure a third-generation dynastic succession. Rumours that the country&apos;s military, including influential figures such as General O Kuk-ryol, oppose a continuation of Kim&apos;s line are persistent but impossible to verify. If reports are to be believed, Kim has faced a host of parental problems. His eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, whose mother was Kim&apos;s first mistress, is believed to have fallen out with his father after he was arrested in Tokyo in 2001 travelling on a false passport. The second son, Kim Jong-chul, may also be a problem. His interests may lie elsewhere: in 2006 he was reliably reported to have attended an Eric Clapton concert in Germany, and possibly some World Cup football matches too. That leaves the youngest, Kim Jong-woon (also known as Jong-un). South Korean media claimed this year that the dear leader had chosen his third son as his successor because he was temperamentally &quot;just like his dad&quot;, with a strong will, firm ideas and a fierce temper. Diplomats scrambled to produce a united front at last night&apos;s emergency UN security council meeting, saying that they would today seek a resolution that would be acceptable to all parties. If past performance is any guide, the devil will be in the detail of such an agreement, but there were signs that several members were prepared to press for tighter sanctions. Only one country \u2013 China \u2013 could apply serious leverage \u2013 because it is North Korea&apos;s major supplier of oil and food and main trading partner, Hoare said. But while it joined yesterday&apos;s chorus of condemnation, Beijing was thought unlikely to back tougher sanctions. For the east Asia region, that presages a period of continuing, possibly deepening instability. And for the harassed NSC staffers in the White House, that is more bad news."}, {"sentences": ["(Try telling that to the Japanese, who treasure bluefin above almost all others; the selling of the enormous fish which can be both the size and cost of a small car, is practically a tourist attraction at Tokyo&apos;s main fish market.)"], "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-27T10:28:23Z", "title": "Bad taste: Why bluefin tuna does Nobu no favours", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/may/27/nobu-blue-fin-tuna-menu", "article": "There are lots of reasons not to eat at Nobu: the prices, the doormen who are better dressed than you, the fact that it is the favoured haunt of models who don&apos;t eat anything.

(Not seen it? You should.) Here&apos;s what&apos;s happened. For years there has been a campaign to get the endangered bluefin tuna removed from menus. Gordon Ramsay and others have complied, recognising that stocks are dangerously low and indeed that certain populations are at risk of extinction due to overfishing. (Try telling that to the Japanese, who treasure bluefin above almost all others; the selling of the enormous fish which can be both the size and cost of a small car, is practically a tourist attraction at Tokyo&apos;s main fish market.) Last September it was revealed that investigators from Greenpeace, rebuffed when they tried to prove Nobu was selling bluefin, had DNA-tested the fish on the menu and proved that&apos;s exactly what it was. The Nobu response: an asterisk by the offending dishes leading to a note at the bottom of the menu pointing out that bluefin is &quot;environmentally challenged&quot; and that diners should ask for an alternative. In short, Nobu has come up with a restaurant version of the Nuremberg defence: if they serve it, it&apos;s only because they are following diner&apos;s orders. Those with a conscience? Let them eat hake. The rich and conscience-free, meanwhile, can gorge on the soon to be extinct until it&apos;s all gone. And would sir like a side order of baby panda with that? The issue has raised its head now because of the imminent release of End of The Line, a feature-length documentary film based on the book of the same name by Charles Clover, about the disastrous state of the world&apos;s fish stocks. The film features the story.  Apparently, while Nobu has a couple of dozen restaurants worldwide, the message only appears on the menus at its two London restaurants. According to Richie Notar, general manager for the chain, he would like to take bluefin off the menu but his Japanese chefs won&apos;t let him. It seems that, unlike the bluefin, Mr Notar is completely spineless. It is bizarre on so many levels. The fashion and movie crowd love championing a good environmental and ethical cause because, set against the completely ephemeral way by which they make their substantial livings, it makes them look authentically emoting and human. It shows they care. And yet here&apos;s a restaurant chain, part owned by Robert De Niro, and frequented by everyone from Brad Pitt to Kate Moss happily flogging a fish on the brink of extinction.

The United States is unsatisfied with the status quo, but frustratingly lacks the tools to change the situation. Not enough attention has been paid, however, to the problem that North Korean brinksmanship has created for China. For some time, China has been content to allow North Korea a degree of latitude, while trying to avoid the worst-case scenarios of war or North Korean collapse. As North Korean behaviour becomes more erratic, the US, South Korea and especially Japan have greater incentive to take aggressive stances that could endanger China&apos;s interests in Northeast Asia. The desire to forestall a militarised Japanese response to North Korea could incline China to take a harder stance against North Korea and provide an opening for Sino-American cooperation.  Aggressive North Korean behaviour has unnerved Japan. Last week, prior to the nuclear test, a Liberal Democratic Party panel suggested that Japan should develop the capacity to launch pre-emptive strikes against prospective enemies. This is consistent with the more assertive military stance that Japan has taken in recent years, such as the deployment of warships to the Indian Ocean, and the development of sea-based missile defence. The nuclear test will only give more ammunition to Japanese hawks who wish to alter Article 9, which limits Japan&apos;s military to defensive options. Japan is unlikely to develop its own nuclear forces. As the only people to fall victim to atomic attack, the Japanese have strong cultural reasons to resist nuclear weapons. Moreover, Japan takes non-proliferation very seriously, and has historically been a strong supporter of the international institutions that undergird it. However, Japan can increase the size, capability and purview of its conventional forces sufficient to make China nervous about its position in east and northeast Asia. Historical concerns aside, Japan has the economic and potential military capability to create problems for Beijing&apos;s regional aspirations. The long-term US relationship with Japan serves to keep Tokyo in check, which is fine with China. An aggressive North Korea, however, may make this status quo untenable. As long as North Korean behaviour was tolerable, China faced a situation in which it would bear many of the costs of a North Korean collapse, while reaping few benefits. The regime&apos;s collapse would create massive refugee problems on the Chinese border, with attendant concerns about the proliferation of nuclear and missile technology. In the future, however, North Korean brinksmanship will become increasingly costly for the Chinese. This creates an opportunity for cooperation between China and the United States. China&apos;s relatively close relationship with North Korea means that Beijing likely has a clearer understanding of the internal situation of the Pyongyang regime than the United States. China probably has a better notion than the US of the balance of power between factions in the succession crisis, and a better idea of which levers to pull in order to strengthen one faction over another. China and the United States do not have identical interests. It&apos;s unlikely that the Chinese have much appreciation at all for North Korean human rights. China also still has some residual concern about the prospect of a unified, democratic Korea, but China has relatively good relations with Seoul, and China-South Korea trade and investment dwarf China&apos;s economic interest in North Korea.  China cannot &quot;solve&quot; the North Korean problem on its own. Beijing does not wish to risk a North Korean collapse, and has limited tools with which to affect North Korea policy short of a complete embargo. Nevertheless, the status quo does not work to China&apos;s benefit. As long as North Korea continues to test missiles and nuclear warheads, hawkish forces in Japan will grow stronger. A re-armed, assertive Japan is a bad scenario for Beijing, perhaps even worse than the collapse of the Pyongyang regime. Although the US and China don&apos;t have identical interests, they share enough of the same fears to make some cooperation possible. Put bluntly, there is no way to manage North Korea without Beijing&apos;s assistance, and Beijing has a strong incentive to facilitate a manageable situation."}, {"sentences": ["Several years ago in a Tokyo bookstore I came upon a strange book in which the author explained how to understand jokes."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Joseph Haydn"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-28T23:01:00Z", "title": "Andr\u00e1s Schiff on Joseph Haydn - the old joker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/29/joseph-haydn-comedy-classical-music", "article": "I had the pleasure and privilege of conducting Haydn&apos;s Symphony No 80 in D minor in Salzburg recently. It&apos;s an astonishing work, full of surprises, and almost completely unknown. The first movement is typically Sturm und Drang until the exposition is suddenly interrupted by a charming and elegant dance-like theme. In the development section, Haydn introduces unusually long pauses and, with daring modulations, makes unexpected excursions into strange tonalities. The last movement - the Presto - is a tour de force of rhythmic ambiguities: the listener has to guess where the upbeats and the downbeats are; only after 32 bars does Haydn introduce rhythmic regularity. It&apos;s ingenious, and extremely funny. But in Salzburg no one laughed. No one even smiled. It seems to be much easier to make an audience cry than it is to make them laugh. There are many music-lovers who won&apos;t even admit that humour has a place in what we call classical music. These are people who have no difficulty recognising sadness, tragedy, grief, majesty and grandeur - because these are serious attributes, and they want their beloved music to be &quot;serious&quot;. For them jokes are made of cheap, vulgar and inferior matter that cannot be tolerated on the altar of High Art. Several years ago in a Tokyo bookstore I came upon a strange book in which the author explained how to understand jokes. Each joke or anecdote was followed by several pages of instructions telling the reader why it was supposed to be funny. Haydn was writing for a public that understood perfectly his musical language. In Eisenstadt and Esterh\u00e1za, in Vienna and Paris, and first and foremost in London, he was surrounded by a small but knowledgeable circle of professional and amateur musicians who received each new work with interest and appreciation. His audience was familiar with his earlier compositions, they knew his personal style and recognised immediately the unusual features of a new symphony. Musical expectations and surprises did not have to be explained, and Haydn&apos;s humour was able to flourish. Today&apos;s listening community is of course very different, and all too often we feel the need of a &quot;Japanese booklet&quot; to enlighten certain members of the audience. Haydn&apos;s keyboard works are full of delicious surprises. Take his early Capriccio in G major, which takes as its theme the folk song Acht Sauschneider M\u00fcssen Sein. The text of this song is a humorous one: it describes castrating a pig, an operation for which no fewer than eight expert butchers were needed. Haydn translates this into musical terms by wandering wildly from one key to the next, presenting the main theme in its entirety or in fragmented form through various registers of the instrument. There is nothing conventional about this piece, nothing that would have met listeners&apos; expectations. The C major Fantasy (Capriccio) was written almost a quarter of a century later, in 1789. Compared to its predecessor, this is a mature masterpiece, a curious mixture of sonata and rondo forms. On two occasions - on a pause over an octave in the bass - the music comes to a standstill. Here the composer instructs the player to &quot;Tenuto intanto, finch\u00e9 non si sente pi\u00f9 il suono&quot; - hold until the sound is not heard any more. Even on a period instrument this pause feels painfully long - the audience begins to get worried - has the poor pianist had a memory lapse? But suddenly the bass quietly slides a semitone upwards, opening new harmonic territories. It is both hilarious and surprising. In his last piano sonata in E flat major the majestic opening movement is followed by a noble Adagio in E major. This key change alone feels shocking. Conventions of the time dictated that this second movement should have been in the dominant key - B flat major, or in C minor, the parallel minor. The juxtaposition of E flat major and E major was very daring. No composer before Haydn had had the nerve to be so experimental, although Beethoven, for one, followed his example (his late string quartet Op131 has its first movement in C sharp minor, the second in D major), and Schubert&apos;s C major string quintet moves from E major in its second movement to an F minor middle section. Haydn&apos;s Adagio ends solemnly in E major. As the piano sonata&apos;s final movement begins, the right hand alone plays five repeated quavers on G, and we think we&apos;re in E minor. The bass then enters on the tonic, E flat. It feels as if Haydn is telling us: &quot;Wrong again.&quot; His unjustly neglected piano trios are amazing works. The one in E flat minor - who else would have written a piece in this key in the 1790s? - opens with an expressive Andante Cantabile, written in double variation form. The following Allegro (there are only two movements) carries the subtitle &quot;Jacob&apos;s dream&quot; (an allusion to Jacob&apos;s dream of a ladder stretching up to heaven). According to a contemporary anecdote, the violinist of the trio that gave the first performance was infamously arrogant and vain. The first page of music is fairly simple and can be easily sightread. However, after the page-turn the fiddle part escapes into hair-raising heights, which must have presented the musician with serious difficulties - as well as teaching him a lesson in humility. Haydn&apos;s 104 symphonies are widely admired, although only a handful are regularly performed, and when they are, they are invariably placed at the beginning of programmes. This is a pity. Audiences, at the start of concerts, do not really listen to the music. They need to be warmed up - just as the players do - and so Haydn&apos;s wonderful ideas are not fully appreciated. Why don&apos;t we hear these symphonies at the end of the programme? Or indeed, what&apos;s wrong with concert of nothing but Haydn symphonies? Take No 60 &quot;Il Distratto&quot;, a theatrical masterpiece in six movements where in the middle of the Finale the music simply stops and the violins find they need to retune their instruments. Or the one in D major, no 93, the first of the so-called London symphonies. Its second movement proceeds with tender elegance until the brutal interruption of the bassoons - they feel like the proverbial bull in the china-shop. Even today, such tonal effects still feel comic and naughty. Haydn was an astounding composer, and humour is only one part of his wonderful art. Whole movements, even entire works, are built from one tiny cell - a compositional technique that the young Beethoven learned from his teacher. His sense of proportion was unerring. In the operas and oratorios he overwhelms us with dramatic force and power. The sacred works, like the late masses and his Seven Last Words, are deeply felt and profoundly moving. In his string quartets, symphonies and piano sonatas, he discovered new horizons. The world needs to appreciate him much more: of all the really great composers, he is still the most underrated. Let me finish with a joke, not a politically correct one, but one that - I guess - might have amused Joseph Haydn. On a psychiatric ward the patients are sitting in a circle, telling jokes. The jokes are numbers. &quot;58,&quot; says one. The others roll about with laughter. Another one shouts: &quot;63.&quot; Hilarity ensues. The chief psychiatrist is jealously observing the proceedings - he wants to join in the fun. &quot;17!&quot; he says. Deadly silence. &quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; he asks. &quot;Isn&apos;t there a joke number 17?&quot; &quot;Of course there is,&quot; a patient answers, &quot;but you told it so badly.&quot; \u2022 Andr\u00e1s Schiff performs Haydn piano works at the Wigmore Hall, London, on Sunday, and lectures on Haydn at the same venue at 2pm today.

Murakami, whom many consider one of the greatest living novelists, had refused to reveal the plot of the two-volume work after criticism that leaked details about his 2002 bestseller, Kafka on the Shore, spoiled its novelty value. The strategy worked and tens of thousands of his Japanese fans were happy to put their faith in the title and author alone. The book&apos;s publisher, Shinchosha, said it was forced to increase its first print run by 100,000 to 480,000 copies amid a flood of advance orders. &quot;The secrecy surrounding the work has made customers desperate to get hold of this book,&quot; Toshiaki Uchida, assistant manager of a bookshop in central Tokyo, told the Associated Press. Judging by the agency&apos;s brief review \u2013 one of the first to appear \u2013 1Q84 is classic Murakami, It is described as a &quot;complex and surreal narrative&quot; that &quot;shifts back and forth between tales of two characters, a man and a woman, who are searching for each other&quot;. The novel &quot;explores social and emotional issues such as cult religions, violence, family ties and love.&quot; The Millions, a widely read online book review site, reported that Amazon Japan had deleted five-star reviews posted before the book had even appeared. The debate over the novel&apos;s title has yet to be settled, however. Some believe it was influenced by George Orwell&apos;s Nineteen Eighty-Four, since the letter Q, when pronounced in English, is a homonym for the number nine in Japanese, pronounced &quot;kyuu&quot;. Others insist that the title is a tribute to The True Story of Ah Q, a novella by the Chinese writer Lu Xun, whose work is said to have influenced Murakami. Shinchosha has yet to decide whether to release an English version, but judging by the overseas success of Murakami&apos;s previous works, the clamour for translations will be difficult to resist. The intensely private 60-year-old \u2013 an obsessive runner, jazz addict and cat lover \u2013 has attained iconic status among many young Japanese for his treatment of the themes of loss and alienation, as well as for the humour and surrealism of his earlier novels. In recent years, his books have explored sensitive social and political events. In Underground, his first work of non-fiction, he interviewed 60 survivors of the sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway in 1995; and in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, he addresses Japanese war crimes in occupied Manchuria. In February this year, Murakami was accused of falling for Israeli propaganda after he went to Jerusalem to accept a literary prize during the country&apos;s bombing campaign in Gaza. Murakami said he had decided to thank his Israeli readers for their support. Three of his novels \u2013 Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle \u2013 made it on to Israel&apos;s bestseller lists. &quot;I gave it some thought,&quot; the Jerusalem Post quoted him as saying at the award ceremony. &quot;And I decided to come. Like most novelists, I like to do exactly the opposite of what I&apos;m told.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Now admittedly, it wasn&apos;t the best comic on the planet \u2013 it was Tokyo Mew Mew, a Sailor Moon clone with an eco-friendly twist, something I&apos;m almost embarrassed to admit was my introduction to the genre \u2013 but soon I was hooked, buying six or seven of the serial titles with my meager teenage paycheck."], "tags": ["Comics and graphic novels", "Media", "Society", "Gender", "Feminism", "Women", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-31T10:00:00Z", "title": "Are Marvel divas just fanboy fantasies? | Latoya Peterson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/31/marvel-comics-divas-manga", "article": "Marvel Comics wants to know. The publisher has recently launched its Marvel Divas collection \u2013 designed to appeal to Sex and the City fans who also read comics. The series features Patsy &quot;Hellcat&quot; Walker; Felicia &quot;Black Cat&quot; Hardy; Angelica &quot;Firestar&quot; Jones; and Monica &quot;Photon&quot; Rambeau, and it is described as sudsy fun. But somehow, I can&apos;t seem to remember when Samantha, Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte&apos;s adventures in New York were dubbed &quot;sudsy&quot;. Or even soapy, for that matter. When I first spotted the announcement on Digital Femme&apos;s blog, I noticed her exasperation. I could relate. I mean, the description and preview could have been a lot worse. They could have lightened Monica Rambeau&apos;s skin \u00e0 la Misty Knight and Vixen, or straightened her hair. There&apos;s also the acknowledgement that women do exist in the comics world and they may potentially be juggling other things besides superhero duties. But the Marvel Diva&apos;s catalogue description points at what we&apos;re really in for: What happens when you take four of the Marvel Universe&apos;s most fabulous single girls and throw them together, adding liberal amounts of suds and drama? You get the sassiest, sexiest, soapiest series to come out of the &quot;House of Ideas&quot; since Millie the Model. Romance, action, ex-boyfriends, and a last page that changes everything. Let your inner divas out with this one, fellas! You won&apos;t regret it. Let out your inner Divas, fellas? The cover shot and the predominantly male team reveal who the comic&apos;s intended audience is supposed to be \u2013 other men. The depictions of the comic by the creators reminded me of why I decamped from American comics in the first place and ran straight into the arms of the Japanese manga market. When I picked up my first shojo manga, I felt immediately transported into the protagonists&apos; life. Now admittedly, it wasn&apos;t the best comic on the planet \u2013 it was Tokyo Mew Mew, a Sailor Moon clone with an eco-friendly twist, something I&apos;m almost embarrassed to admit was my introduction to the genre \u2013 but soon I was hooked, buying six or seven of the serial titles with my meager teenage paycheck. Over time, I discovered the diversity within types of manga. I read more mature-themed comics like Doubt and Mars that dealt with issues like teen sexuality, popularlity, and love \u2013 without the use of superpowers. As I got older, I switched to read more josei (older women) titles, which were comics that dealt with the complexities of relationships in your late 20s. I loved books like Kimi Wa Petto (translated in the US and elsewhere as Tramps Like Us) and spent hours tracking down books by authors like Erica Sakurazawa (The Aromatic Bitters, Nothing But Loving You) and Ai Yazawa (Paradise Kiss, Nana). Tramps Like Us was major for me \u2013 in it, the protagonist, Sumire, coped with pressures from her stressful workplace and ridicule from her colleagues about not being a &quot;traditional&quot; woman. Sumire was expected (and at the beginning of the series, believed herself) that she was to strive for nothing less than a man with &quot;the three highs&quot; \u2013 higher income, higher education, and higher height. However, this was no easy task \u2013 Sumire was a tall, highly educated career woman, who was seen as overly intimidating to men. I remember being shocked later, looking at some Washington Post coverage of contemporary issues in Japanese society, reading about a woman invoking the three highs as a reason for her continued single status; clearly the plotlines in Kimi Wa Petto were based on real experiences. Over the years, I&apos;ve noticed a major shift in young comics fans&apos; reading habits. While there are all kinds of crossovers between genres of manga (girls who are interested in reading shonen (action) comics, horror comics, yaoi, magical girl comics, whatever), there is definitely more gravitation toward manga titles than what is put out by the US industry. Perhaps the reason is because the Japanese publishers employ a significant number of female writers and artists. One of the most popular manga studios is CLAMP, an all-female collective. I can&apos;t think of a similar situation stateside. And that may be the crucial divide, with regard to Marvel Divas. Feminist fans slammed the books, leading the creators to decry prejudging the series. However, judging from the compiled responses over at When Fangirls Attack, readers have a right to be concerned: how many times have we seen this play out before? With female characters as window dressing, sidekicks, or bait for bad guys, before they end up in a refrigerator somewhere. What&apos;s missing? Heroines that are developed in their own right as characters, and who hold their own with the ass-kicking. It is estimated that about 60% of readers of manga are girls and women, against 10% of readers of American comics. But with titles like Marvel Divas being produced by mainstream US publishers, can you really blame us?"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;With respect to the team that is visiting Tokyo, Seoul, Moscow and Beijing, I think it&apos;s important for us to take it a step at a time and I&apos;d rather not presume that we will not be successful in gaining a broad agreement on the way forward,&quot; Gates told reporters."], "tags": ["World news", "North Korea", "US news", "China", "South Korea", "United Nations", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-01T14:16:50Z", "title": "North Korea 'preparing to test most advanced missile'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/01/north-korea-new-missile-launch-move", "article": "North Korea is poised to test launch its most advanced missile, reports said today, a week after it defied the international community and conducted its second nuclear weapons test in three years. In a move that is certain to raise tensions in the region, the secretive state has transported an intercontinental ballistic missile, theoretically capable of striking the west coast of the US, to a newly-built launch site in Dongchang-ni on the country&apos;s north-west coast. South Korea and Japanese media reports said US satellites and reconnaissance aircraft had recorded the missile arriving at the site, located about 35 miles from the Chinese border, after leaving a weapons research centre on the outskirts of Pyongyang on Saturday. Experts said the missile, believed to be a modified version of the Taepodong-2 rocket launched on 5 April, would take about two weeks to assemble and load with fuel. The new missile reportedly has a range of up to 4,000 miles, which would put Alaska within striking distance, the JoongAng Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, said. The missile launched in April travelled 2,000 miles before landing harmlessly in the Pacific Ocean. The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified officials in Seoul and Washington, said the launch could take place to coincide with a meeting between President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart, Lee Myung-bak, on 16 June. North Korea has also made the mid and upper reaches of the Yellow Sea a &quot;no-sail&quot; zone until the end of July \u2013 an unusually long period \u2013 in another sign it is planning to conduct a sensitive military exercise. The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said today that satellites had picked up activity pointing towards a missile test. &quot;We have seen some signs that they may be doing something with another Taepodong-2 missile,&quot; he said during a visit to Manila. &quot;But at this point it is not clear what they are going to do.&quot; Gates said he would wait until the US had sounded out other countries before commenting on a possible response to the latest escalation in the crisis. The deputy US secretary of state, James Steinberg, is visiting several countries this week to discuss the issue. &quot;With respect to the team that is visiting Tokyo, Seoul, Moscow and Beijing, I think it&apos;s important for us to take it a step at a time and I&apos;d rather not presume that we will not be successful in gaining a broad agreement on the way forward,&quot; Gates told reporters. The North&apos;s increasingly provocative behaviour has clearly irritated China, its closest ally and biggest aid donor. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, today said China, which said it was &quot;resolutely opposed&quot; to last week&apos;s nuclear test, had ceased government exchanges with the North in protest. If the unconfirmed reports are true, it would be the clearest sign yet of China&apos;s displeasure with its unruly ally. China accounts for three-quarters of North Korea&apos;s foreign trade and supplies the vast majority of its oil and consumer goods. A second Taepodong launch in two months would pose a fresh challenge to the authority of the UN security council, which has yet to agree a united response to last week&apos;s controlled nuclear blast and the test launch of six-short range missiles. The international response will be further complicated by the appearance of two American journalists in a North Korean court this week, accused of spying on the country while making a documentary about refugees fleeing across its northern border to China. Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for the San Francisco-based Current TV, will stand trial on Thursday and face being sent to a labour camp if found guilty of &quot;engaging in hostile acts&quot;. Gates warned over the weekend that Washington would never accept a nuclear North Korea. &quot;We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us \u2026 we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state,&quot; he said at a meeting of defence officials in Singapore. South Korea, meanwhile, said today it would not tolerate military threats from its neighbour, days after Pyongyang said it no longer recognised the truce that ended the Korea war in 1953 and would attack the south if it joined in US-led inspections of ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction. &quot;If North Korea turns its back on dialogue and peace and dares carry out military threats and provocations, the Republic of Korea will never tolerate that,&quot; Lee said in a radio address. &quot;I want to make clear that there won&apos;t be any compromise on matters that affect our national security.&quot; North Korea has made good on threats to test rockets and nuclear weapons, as well as abandon six-party nuclear talks, unless the security council apologises for condemning the last long-rage missile test. The North insisted, to universal disbelief, that the exercise was designed to put a communications satellite into orbit."}, {"sentences": ["The BOAC flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong flew into extreme turbulence and crashed in March 1966, killing 113 passengers and 11 crew."], "tags": ["Plane crashes", "Brazil", "France", "World news", "Air transport", "Europe", "Americas"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-01T15:37:38Z", "title": "Q and A: Air turbulence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/01/air-france-crash-air-turbulence", "article": "What is turbulence?Turbulence is caused by sudden changes in air movement that cause the aircraft to pitch, yaw and roll. There are two types of turbulence: so-called &quot;clear air turbulence&quot;, which can happen when different bodies of air meet at high \u00adaltitudes, such as near mountain ranges or on the fringes of the jet stream in the north Atlantic. Storm turbulence is more easily detectable as it contains moisture that can be picked up by aircraft radar. But if the plane flies into it, it is hit by sudden air movements that result in it being buffeted by upward and downward draughts of air. For pilots, the main concern is not the safety of the plane, but the health of passengers and crew, who can be thrown out of their seats or hit by flying objects. &quot;Turbulence is what it says on the tin. It is a very violent movement of air in the atmosphere that is caused in many different ways. It is fairly unpredictable and a lot of money has gone into researching it and predicting it,&quot; says Kieran Daly, group editor of Air Transport Intelligence. Can it bring down a plane?Turbulence-related crashes happen once a decade, according to aviation consultancy Ascend. Examples include the crash of an Austral airlines McDonnell Douglas in Uruguay with the loss of 69 passengers and five crew in 1997. A Fokker aeroplane crashed shortly after taking off from Rotterdam airport in 1981, killing 13 passengers and four crew. One of the earliest cases involved a BOAC (later British Airways) Boeing 707 near Mount Fuji in Japan. The BOAC flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong flew into extreme turbulence and crashed in March 1966, killing 113 passengers and 11 crew. An investigation reported that the likely cause of the disaster was that &quot;the aircraft suddenly encountered abnormally severe turbulence which imposed a gust load considerably in excess of the design limit.&quot; Aviation experts expressed doubts that turbulence was the sole reason for downing a large, modern airliner. &quot;In principle you can have sufficient turbulence to critically damage the plane,&quot; says Daly. \u00ad&quot;However, for a large plane, such as an A330, it would have to be quite extraordinary. The forces on an aircraft could \u00adtheoretically break it up. It happens on small planes but for a large plane you are on the outer limits of engineering scenarios. It is much more likely that people who are not strapped in will be injured by the plane and being knocked around.&quot; What other weather conditions could have caused it?Air France fears that flight AF447 was hit by lightning, setting off an electrical fault that could have damaged the in-flight computer systems that are a feature of Airbus aircraft and play an important role in directing the aircraft. But pilots who have been hit by lightning describe it as a spectacular but relatively harmless phenomenon. In rare cases, it has been known to tear a two-millimetre hole in aircraft fuselages without endangering the aircraft. The lightning passes around the aircraft fuselage and is then channelled off the plane and into the atmosphere by so-called &quot;static wicks&quot; \u2013 sticks of wire sheathed in plastic that run off the \u00adaeroplane. One former Airbus pilot also told the Guardian the aircraft have back-up systems designed to deal with sudden circuit or computer failures, so a single lightning strike should not cause a catastrophic electronic failure. &quot;Planes are routinely hit by lightning,&quot; says Daly. &quot;It should not matter. However there is a tremendous amount of energy being absorbed by the plane. It can burn out electrical components. It can sometimes punch a hole through the metal. If you are unlucky enough to suffer a \u00adlightning strike at a crucial point of the structure then you have a problem. Also if a fire started then that is not a good thing and could go undetected for a time, causing more damage.&quot; How can pilots spot turbulence?As well as looking out of the window for storm clouds, pilots benefit from the fact that commercial aircraft can be equipped with weather radar. The equipment measures the size of raindrops, with dense water particles likely to signal a looming storm cloud that the pilot then flies around. Pilots also receive a weather report before they take off and are fed regular information by air traffic controllers. &quot;The crew would not knowingly fly into turbulence where they have weather radar warnings. The detection of turbulence has progressed over the past decade but is still something of a black art,&quot; says Daly. Why would this flight have encountered turbulence or lightning?Pilots are traditionally wary of tropical zones, where storm clouds are prevalent, particularly when crossing the equator. The flightpath took the plane through a weather system called the \u00adintertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), associated with violent storms, generated by \u00adequatorial heat. &quot;The ITCZ is a meeting point of the trade winds from either hemisphere,&quot; a Met Office spokesman said. &quot;It straddles the equator, moving according to the seasons.It goes round the world but is more pronounced across the Atlantic. You have a lot of moist ascending air due to the heat from the sun on the sea. Where the trade winds meet, they have to go \u00adsomewhere and so they go upwards. It is rather like a car in a crash which crumples up. The result is violent storms.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Jong-nam, 37, had long been regarded as Kim&apos;s natural successor but he apparently fell out of favour after he was stopped at Narita airport in Tokyo in 2001 attempting to enter Japan on a false passport.", "He told immigration officials he had planned to visit Tokyo Disneyland."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-02T08:31:27Z", "title": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-il 'names youngest son as successor'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/02/north-korea-kim-jong-il", "article": "The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has named his youngest son as his successor, South Korean newspaper reports said today, the latest in a series of dramatic developments in the world&apos;s most secretive state. South Korean intelligence officials quoted in two Seoul newspapers said that Kim Jong-un, 26, has been chosen to succeed Kim, whose hold on power was called into question after he reportedly suffered a stroke last summer. Kim, 67, has instructed officials to pledge allegiance to their leader-in-waiting, the reports said, after informing the military, politicians and overseas missions of his nomination in a secret message sent soon after North Korea tested a nuclear weapon on 25 May. The reports, which have not been confirmed by the regime, come a little over a week after North Korea flew in the face of international opinion by conducting its second nuclear weapons test and test-fired volley of missiles, a show of defiance analysts say was directed both at the US president, Barack Obama, and officials at home who had doubted the ailing leader&apos;s authority amid speculation over the succession. Park Jie-won, a member of the South Korean opposition Democratic party, said in a radio interview that the country&apos;s national intelligence service had briefed a closed session of the parliamentery intelligence committee about the succession. &quot;I was notified by the government that there are such movements, and that [North Koreans] are making pledges of loyalty to Kim Jong-un,&quot; he said. South Korean government officials declined to confirm the reports. Speculation over Kim&apos;s choice of successor intensified last August after he disappeared from public view for three months after suffering a stroke, although he since mounted a recovery. During Kim&apos;s convalescence, North Korea was effectively ruled by his brother-in-law, Jang Song-taek, who is married to his younger sister. Jang, who was officially named the country&apos;s second-in-command in April, has become a key Kim ally, even though the leader had him put under house arrest several years ago amid suspicions he was building a rival power base. In January this year, reports emerged that Jong-un had been named as Kim&apos;s successor and last month it was reported that he had been appointed to the national defence commission, an obvious route for someone being groomed for leadership. Jong-un&apos;s status as heir was never officially confirmed, however, and it could be years before the regime comments on the most recent reports of his anointment. The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said North Koreans were already learning a new song written specially for Jong-un and referring to him as &quot;the young leader&quot;. His father is known as the country&apos;s &quot;dear leader&quot; while his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the country&apos;s founder who died in 1994, is referred to as the &quot;great leader&quot;. Jong-un was born in 1983 or 1984 to the North Korean leader&apos;s third wife, Ko Yong-hi, a Japanese-born professional dancer who reportedly died from breast cancer in 2004. She also gave birth to Jong-un&apos;s elder brother, Kim Jong-chul, 28. The oldest of Kim&apos;s three sons, Kim Jong-nam, was born to a different mother, a North Korean film star who died in exile in 2002. Jong-nam, 37, had long been regarded as Kim&apos;s natural successor but he apparently fell out of favour after he was stopped at Narita airport in Tokyo in 2001 attempting to enter Japan on a false passport. He told immigration officials he had planned to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Much of what the world knows about the recent dynamics of the Kim family comes from a 2003 book by a Japanese chef who worked as Kim&apos;s personal cook. Writing under the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto, he said Kim regarded his second son, Jon-chul, as &quot;too effeminate&quot; to lead the country. By contrast Fujimoto, who referred to the sons as &quot;princes&quot;, describes Jong-un as &quot;a chip off the old block, a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality&quot;. South Korean newspaper reports say he is overweight and suffers from diabetes, and there are rumours that he was injured in a car accident last year. According to reports, Jong-un was expensively educated at an exclusive boarding school in Switzerland \u2013 although this is disputed by some South Korean experts who say the he has never been outside North Korea \u2013 and later at Kim Il-sung Military University in Pyongyang. He is a keen skier and basketball fan, and reportedly speaks English, German and French. He is thought to have eclipsed his brothers in the succession stakes because of what some have described as his naked ambition and leadership skills. In April the Swiss news magazine L&apos;Hebdo quoted a former classmate as describing Jong-un as a shy pupil who worshipped the US basketball player Michael Jordan. A former director at the school told the magazine he was &quot;humble&quot; and friendly with the children of US diplomats. As North Korea reportedly prepares to test launch a medium- and long-range missile, speculation is mounting over when Kim will announce the succession to the country&apos;s 25 million people, most of whom know nothing about his sons. Writing in the April issue of Foreign Affairs, Ken E Gause, a North Korea specialist, cited sources as saying that Kim \u2013 health permitting \u2013 could opt for April 2012, the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-sung&apos;s birth. Tensions on the peninsula continued to mount today following the north&apos;s threat last week to attack its neighbour if it participated in US-led efforts to intercept ships suspected of carrying missiles. Quoting a military source, South Korea&apos;s Chosun Ilbo newspaper said the North was stockpiling ammunition and stepping up activity in the Yellow Sea off its west coast in preparation for a possible conflict. Seoul has responded by deploying a guided-missile naval vessel to the area, close to a disputed maritime border that has been the backdrop for two deadly skirmishes in the past 10 years."}, {"sentences": ["Four months later, however, his leadership ambitions lay in tatters after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake Dominican passport so he could visit Tokyo Disneyland."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-02T12:54:34Z", "title": "North Korea: the Kim dynasty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/02/north-korea-kim-dynasty", "article": "The grandfatherKim Il-sung, North Korea&apos;s revolutionary founder, is still known as its &quot;eternal president&quot; 15 years after his death from a heart attack. The title of president has been left unfilled out of respect; his son and successor, Kim Jong-il, was instead given the title general secretary of the Korean Workers&apos; party and chairman of the national defence commission. As the originator of the philosophy of juche, or self-reliance, Kim Sr presided over North Korea&apos;s almost total isolation from the outside world and set the country on course for famine and grinding poverty among many of its 23 million people. Kim&apos;s funeral was attended by thousands of hysterical mourners and his embalmed body is encased in a glass coffin on public display in the outskirts of Pyongyang. His birthday and the date of his death are public holidays. The fatherKim Jong-il has ruled North Korea with an iron fist since his father&apos;s death in 1994. Soviet records show Kim was born in Siberia in 1941 and spent the first few years of his life in the Soviet Union, but his official biography states that he was born in his father&apos;s log cabin on Paektu, North Korea&apos;s highest mountain, in 1942, an event that was foretold by a swallow and marked by a double rainbow and the formation of a new star. He continued his father&apos;s personal philosophy of juche, adding his own military-first policy, which has brought the country to the brink of becoming a nuclear power. If North Korean propaganda is to be believed, Kim is a man of extraordinary talents. He has been credited with scoring 11 holes in one during his first-ever round of golf, writing six operas and personally designing the Juche tower in Pyongyang. He describes himself as an internet expert. But the &quot;dear leader&quot; also displayed decidedly human frailties: when not dipping in to his collection of 20,000 film videotapes, his idea of a perfect evening at home included dance performances by scantily clad women known as the Pleasure Brigade, some of whom were recruited overseas. A former heavy smoker \u2013 he gave up in 2003 \u2013 and brandy lover who easily filled out his trademark olive green trouser suit, Kim has lost a lot of weight since reportedly suffering a stroke in August last year. Next to nothing is known about Kim&apos;s marital arrangements; it is not clear if his second and third wives were, in fact, mistresses. Reports say he is now living with Kim Ok, 45, his personal secretary in the 1980s. The first sonKim Jong-nam, 38, looked certain to become North Korea&apos;s future leader after he was given a senior position in the powerful ministry of public security in 1998 and accompanied his father on a trip to China in January 2001. Four months later, however, his leadership ambitions lay in tatters after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake Dominican passport so he could visit Tokyo Disneyland. The episode proved a huge embarrassment to his father, who appears to have decided there and then that Jong-nam was unfit to follow in his footsteps. In 2007 the South China Morning Post reported that he was living incognito in Macau. The second sonIn 2003 the regime appeared to be grooming Kim Jong-chul for leadership after referring to his mother, Koh Jong-hi, as the &quot;respected mother&quot; \u2013 the same plaudit given Kim Jong-il&apos;s mother a few years before he became leader. That view gained currency in 2007 when Jong-chul, 28, was appointed to a senior position in the Korean workers&apos; party. But his father once dismissed him as &quot;too much like a girl&quot; to be a leader, and in the past year he has been eclipsed by Kim Jong-un. Jong-chul, like his younger brother, was educated, using a pseudonym, at the International School of Berne in Switzerland. A rare photograph taken in 1994 purportedly shows the curly-haired youth standing outside the school. Former classmates reportedly confirmed sightings of Jong-chul at an Eric Clapton concert and the World Cup finals in Germany in 2006. The leader-in-waitingKim Jong-un, the youngest of Kim&apos;s three known sons, has reportedly been named as his father&apos;s successor. In a country that, despite its communist doctrine, retains a Confucian respect for seniority, he could have expected only to be in line after older brothers, but emerged as favourite to lead North Korea after impressing his father with his single-mindedness and leadership qualities. Born in 1983 or 84, he was reportedly educated at the same Swiss boarding school as Jong-chul, where he developed a passion for skiing and basketball, and learned to speak English, German and French.

He started his talk by saying:  I&apos;m here to enlist you in helping to think about spreading a new story about how humans get things together. We all know the old story. We learn it when we&apos;re very young. It&apos;s reinforced by our culture, education and until recently science. Biology is war. Businesses and nations succeed only by defeating, destroying or dominating opposition. Politics is about winning at all costs. In the last decade, I see a new story emerging across a very wide number of disciplines. Competition is still central but it still shrinks a little bit to leave room for co-operative arrangements and complex interdependencies.  In spring 2000, he found himself on the streets of Tokyo. He saw something unusual for American eyes. He admitted that it was probably not odd for people outside of the US, but it was novel for him. He saw people in Tokyo walking down the street looking at their telephones. Now, a trillion SMS messages are sent a year, he said. Later, he was Helsinki, and he saw people carrying their mobile phones in their hands and looking at them very often. Three teenagers stopped to speak with two older adults. Not speaking Finnish, he didn&apos;t understand the conversation. One of the teenagers looked at the phone screen. He showed it to his teenage friends but not to the adults. The conversation continued as if this were normal. He referred to the protests in the Philippines that were organised largely by text messages, and which brought down the Estrada government, and in discussing this with a friend (who sounds a lot like Clay Shirky) his friend said:  It looks to me that the barrier to collective action has been lowered.  This led him to coin the term smart mobs. It describes the new-found ability to organise all kinds of collective action because of media, using the mobile phone and the internet. Mobile phones, computers and the internet are converging. In 1980, the computer was really just a toy. In 1990, the internet was just text, very slow text at that. If we think about this emerging medium, it will undoubtedly develop very rapidly. After he wrote his book, he was sent images from around the world by people who recognised that smart mobs were happening. In South Korea, the candidate liked by the younger generation was losing. The Korean citizen journalism site, OhMyNews, sent a text message to people telling them to vote. The candidate favoured by the young won and gave his first interview to OhMyNews. In Spain, the Madrid bombing was originally blamed on Basque separatists. Spanish people thought they were being lied to so they sent text messages letting each other know about a protest outside the government headquarters. The underdog, socialist candidate Zapatero won in the following elections thanks in part to this SMS-based protest. Some America students used social networking and SMS to organise protests against a bill they thought could lead to the deportation of their parents. The US Congress has yet to pass that bill. He talked about how the Obama campaign used Facebook, SMS and other social networking tools to bring together the hierarchal nature of a presidential campaign with grassroots organising. The campaign would come to a state and discover supporters had already been mobilised due to the use of social networking and SMS. It&apos;s leading to new ways to organise not just individuals but also in traditional organisations like government.  We&apos;re beginning to see an experiment in the US to use wiki to create public policy.  But the effect of this organisation is not always positive. Rheingold pointed to the protests in Nigeria over the Miss World competition and how Australian racists used SMS to organise the beatings of minorities. He had predicted that a picture from a camera phone would be the key image of an event, and it happened first at the 7 July 2005 bombings in London and now we see it much more frequently. He showed the image of the US Airways flight that landed in the Hudson.  We all talk about verification and context. We now have millions of reporters on the site of a story.  Rheingold then discussed the spread of knowledge through the development of alphabets and the printing press. &quot;The revolutions of the 18th century that replaced monarchies with democracies were literate revolutions.&quot; Not saying that science, the reformation or democracy were created by the printing press. But the technologies allowed people to communicate and organise in different ways. Participatory media include blogs, wikis, video sharing, tagging, bookmark sharing, video blogs. They have three characteristics: \u2022 Many-to-many media make it possible for people to broadcast and receive all kinds of information \u2022 They are social media, the value is form the participation and communication of people \u2022 Faster networks increase reach and power As he said before, these methods are moving outside politics and into business. IBM, HP and Sun have released their software under open-source licencing. IBM went from open-source accounting for none of its revenue to a majority of its revenue in four years. Eli Lilly uses a collaborative tool called Innocentive to help it develop its drugs. Google and Amazon have opened their crown jewels. Programmers have created millions of ways to create shops on Amazon. Google opened its advertising platform and allowed people to use its AdSense service. eBay helps solve the dilemma of carrying out transactions with people you don&apos;t know. Now we&apos;re seeing distributed computing platforms such as SETI@home being used to look for patterns of alien life in signals from outer space. Folding@home processes protein folding. We don&apos;t understand the scope of the problems that can be solved using this distributed computing process, he said. Rheingold says that we&apos;re at a very early stage in seeing what is possible with these collaborative technologies. He compared it to the changes that came in medicine after germ theory. It was a fundamental change, but it took time for the discovery to have its full impact."}, {"sentences": ["The Dogana&apos;s unique history was inspiring, he tells me from his Tokyo office, but presented difficulties too."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Exhibitions", "Venice Biennale"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-03T15:41:00Z", "title": "How the French Charles Saatchi became the merchant of Venice, writes Agn\u00e8s Poirier", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/03/francois-pinault-venice-art", "article": "It&apos;s easy to understand why Alison Gingeras, the curator of French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault&apos;s art collection, suggests we meet at the bar of the Monaco Hotel in Venice. The view from the hotel terrace over to Dogana del Mare, the 17th-century customs house across the Grand Canal, is spectacular. La Dogana, as the building will now be known, is also where Gingeras has worked night and day for the last six weeks. Timed to coincide with the opening of the Venice Biennale, it will throw open its doors later this week. Rewind to spring 2001, when Pinault, who built a business empire on everything from timber to fashion (he owns brands including Gucci and Yves St-Laurent), left his eldest son Fran\u00e7ois-Henri running the group in order to focus on his art collection \u2013 2,500 pieces by celebrity artists such as Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman, Cy Twombly, Takashi Murakami and the Chapman brothers, alongside rising stars including Matthew Day Jackson, Adel Abdessemed, Nate Lowman and Kai Althoff. But there was a problem: the art had no home.     Pinault's prize ... Dogana del Mare    Pinault needed somewhere to base his foundation and exhibit the collection. Initially, he chose a location just outside Paris, near where Renault used to have its factories. But negotiations with the French state were tough, and not eased by Pinault&apos;s friendship with the president at the time, Jacques Chirac. After three years going nowhere, Pinault threw in the towel. Then, in 2005, he heard that the impressive 18th-century Palazzo Grassi in Venice was looking for an owner. Pinault didn&apos;t think twice, and even poached the French culture minister and former Pompidou Centre director, Jean-Jacques Aillagon, to become his man in Italy. The space opened in spring 2006 with a shock for regulars who had attended its impeccably curated exhibitions of Italian renaissance architecture in 1997: Jeff Koons&apos;s monumental inflatable Balloon Dog (Magenta) tethered to a floating island in the canal. Even so, Palazzo Grassi was only phase one of Pinault&apos;s grand designs: he needed yet more space. So he found himself competing with the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation \u2013 which owns the famous museum nearby \u2013 to acquire the abandoned Dogana. It was with some inevitability that, in spring 2007, the city authorities chose Pinault. &quot;Only he could muster the team and invest the necessary amount of money to turn around the restoration so quickly,&quot; says Gingeras. Indeed, it took Pinault&apos;s team only 18 months to complete work, despite many technical challenges. The Dogana fills a narrow triangular spit of land right at the nose of Venice&apos;s Dorsoduro, the island that forms the western quarter of Venice, on the mouth of the Grand Canal. The site barely had any room for scaffolding, let alone 120 workers. So a temporary port was erected and floating bridges raised; even a canteen was hoisted on stilts. The project was masterminded by renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando, who had worked with Pinault twice before. The Dogana&apos;s unique history was inspiring, he tells me from his Tokyo office, but presented difficulties too. &quot;I was impressed by its simple and rational structure,&quot; he explains. &quot;I studied the history of the building and referred to several historical drawings that helped us understand the construction, as well as the different renovations through the centuries.&quot; In order to rediscover the original space, Ando removed all the partitions and interior walls that were added over the last 400 years. What was revealed was a triangle, 105 metres by 75, with a beautiful wooden roof above it. &quot;Some parts of the building could be researched and investigated only after the removing process, so we had to adjust the project step by step and be extremely flexible \u2013 and all this on a very tight schedule,&quot; he says. &quot;We were only able to proceed with authorisation from the Venetian authorities, who had to agree on every step.&quot; Ando and his team also made the building waterproof \u2013 an obvious necessity in the most canal-bound city in the world, where &quot;acqua alta&quot; is a regular hazard \u2013 and added concrete flooring. The building&apos;s famous tower, which is crowned by two statues of Atlas holding a bronze globe, surmounted by a statue of Fortune, was restored to its copper-and-gold glory. The whole lot cost something in the region of \u20ac20m, and, together with the Palazzo Grassi, it has made Pinault the owner of the biggest permanent space dedicated to contemporary art in Venice. So, what about the art? From the end of this week visitors will be able to see Mapping the Studio, the Dogana and Grassi&apos;s first dual exhibition, which has been curated by Gingeras with Francesco Bonami. As its title reveals, the show will explore those most intimate of places, artists&apos; studios. &quot;Pinault loves creative spaces,&quot; explains Gingeras. &quot;The first thing he does when he touches down in New York is go to his favourite studios in Brooklyn. He spends most of his time there.&quot; Pinault is no Charles Saatchi, Gingeras says. &quot;He favours artists he likes and has followed for a long time; he doesn&apos;t try to be encyclopedic. We do go to new galleries and shows, but 70% of the art he buys is from artists he knows.&quot; Mapping the Studio follows no chronology, Gingeras explains. &quot;It has been conceived as one exhibition split between our two spaces. The atmosphere of Grassi and Dogana may be very different, but visitors will intuitively feel the continuity.&quot; In honour of the occasion, Pinault has commissioned six new works, mainly monumental sculptures. British artist Mark Handforth has created Man on the Moon, a suspended crescent featuring a human figure who seems to have crashed there moments before, which will remain in the Dogana permanently. &quot;This piece is both hopeful and optimistic. It should add playfulness to the place&apos;s own magic,&quot; says Gingeras. There is also a sculpture by American artist Charles Ray, yet to be unveiled, which will sit on the very tip of the site. &quot;It has the potential to become a new symbol for Venice, like the lions in St Mark&apos;s square,&quot; Gingeras says. &quot;I expect to see it on every new postcard.&quot; Art aside, one thing that really will define the Dogana, says Gingeras, is its light, much of which is reflected from the water that surrounds it on three sides. &quot;I have worked at the Pompidou Centre, at Moma in New York and at Tate Modern, but I have never encountered such incredible light. It is absolutely perfect for monumental paintings with a warm palette.&quot; Wonderful as all this is \u2013 and there&apos;s no denying that the space is beautiful \u2013 the project has more than a hint of self-promotion about it, as if Pinault were asking his curators to devise an exhibition showing the world what a great art collector he is. But can collecting ever be considered an art? Gingeras is quite clear: &quot;Of course not: you can&apos;t compare the act of acquiring with the art of creating. Exhibiting art may be a craft or a skill, but it&apos;s certainly not comparable to art itself. Having said that, I don&apos;t see why private collectors should disappear behind their collection. They are not an institution; they don&apos;t have to be self-effacing.&quot; Perhaps, then, they can be allowed to do a bit of showing off. But this isn&apos;t a vanity project, Gingeras insists. &quot;I know many art collectors who started collecting during the hedge-fund years, and who sold everything when the world markets turned sour. They have no consideration for the art. Pinault is not one of them, he is a true patron of the arts. &quot;The good thing about the recession is that we will now be able to concentrate on art, on what matters. The bullshit we had to deal with before is over.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Kusama turned 80 in March, but when we meet at her Tokyo studio, she is a vision in a bobbed, blood-red wig and a red one-piece dress covered in her beloved polka dots.", "He ended up having an affair with a geisha and deserted us to be with her in Tokyo.", "I spent six hours travelling to Tokyo so I could find her address in Who&apos;s Who at the US embassy."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Yayoi Kusama"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-05T23:01:00Z", "title": "Justin McCurry talks to artist Yayoi Kusama", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/06/yayoi-kusama-art", "article": "Yayoi Kusama has created an estimated 50,000 works during a career spanning half a century, is feted in her native Japan and in the US - yet in Britain she remains relatively unknown. Kusama turned 80 in March, but when we meet at her Tokyo studio, she is a vision in a bobbed, blood-red wig and a red one-piece dress covered in her beloved polka dots.  It is impossible to discuss Kusama&apos;s work without making mention of those dots and the omnipresent lined meshed patterns she calls &quot;infinity nets&quot;. They appeared in her early paintings, on &quot;living&quot; installations comprising her own naked torso and those of her friends, and, more recently, wrapped around tree trunks in Singapore. Later this month, trees along the Thames will also be given the polka-dot treatment, as part of a collaborative exhibition with nine other artists at London&apos;s Hayward Gallery.  The motifs first came to Kusama in childhood. Born in 1929 in Matsumoto in the Japanese Alps, she started seeing a psychiatrist at the age of 10 after she became gripped by visions of dots, nets and violet flowers that covered everything she saw. &quot;I call them my repetitive vision,&quot; she says. &quot;I still see them. [They] cover the canvas and grow on to the floor, the ceiling, chairs and tables. Then the polka dots move to the body, on to my clothes and into my spirit. It is an obsession.&quot; Hers was an unhappy childhood. &quot;Not a single day went by that my mother didn&apos;t regret giving birth to me,&quot; she says. &quot;She was the only daughter of a wealthy family, so my father, as the son-in-law, was able to lead an extravagant lifestyle. He ended up having an affair with a geisha and deserted us to be with her in Tokyo. It damaged my mother. I was stuck in the middle of a long-running feud and I felt mentally cornered. That&apos;s why I started hallucinating. I started seeing a psychiatrist, and it was he who first encouraged me to develop as an artist.&quot; She studied, against her mother&apos;s wishes, at the Kyoto Municipal School of Arts and Crafts, and by 1950 had moved from traditional Japanese painting to abstract natural forms. In her most fevered periods, in her 20s, she was producing dozens of paintings a day, leading to more conflict at home. &quot;My mother was strongly opposed to my becoming an artist. She was from a very old, conservative family. She was a collector of art and desperately wanted me to become one, too. Whenever I drew or made sculptures, she would fly into a rage and throw paints and canvases at me.&quot;  Eventually, in 1957, Kusama left Japan for New York, following a lengthy correspondence with the American artist Georgia O&apos;Keeffe. &quot;I had been a great admirer after coming across her work in an old book I found in a store in my home town. Her works are wonderful, moving. I spent six hours travelling to Tokyo so I could find her address in Who&apos;s Who at the US embassy. Amazingly, she wrote back, and we kept writing to each other.&quot; In America, Kusama&apos;s installations caught the eye of critics and collectors. Her Aggregation: One Thousand Boats Show - a real rowing boat encrusted with phallic protuberances - caused a sensation when it appeared at the Gertrude Stein Gallery in New York in 1963. &quot;That kind of exhibition was extremely avant garde at the time,&quot; she says. &quot;Jackson Pollock and abstract expressionism were the big thing then. But they all came to see me and asked me why I did what I did. I said I just do Kusama art.&quot; Andy Warhol, she says, asked her permission to use the patterns in his silk screens. She refused. &quot;People were queueing in the streets, waiting to see a Kusama original,&quot; she says. &quot;After my mirror room show, other artists like Claes Oldenburg started making soft sculptures. So many artists have been influenced by my art and repeat my vision.&quot; But Kusama&apos;s mental health deteriorated to such an extent that, in 1973, she returned home for treatment. In 1975 she checked herself into the psychiatric hospital she still calls home, finding that the routine gave her the order she needed to concentrate on her work. She slowly crept back into the public consciousness, and in 2006 she was awarded the Praemium Imperiale, one of Japan&apos;s most prestigious arts prizes. Kusama has often said that if it weren&apos;t for art, she would have killed herself long ago. &quot;I only slept two hours last night. When I get tired from making pictures, I find it really difficult to go to sleep. But it&apos;s how I get away from my illness and escape the hallucinations. I call it psychosomatic art.&quot; So why does her work seem more like a celebration of life&apos;s euphoric moments? &quot;I don&apos;t really think about what my emotions are. I don&apos;t plan to make them nice and cheerful, but once I start, they just move in that direction. My hands start moving before I can think anything.&quot; Kusama will be happy if the new exhibition &quot;brings people around to the idea of the infinity of the cosmos and the beauty of life. Nothing I do stays in the gallery space. Everything I do is a walk in my mind. There are no limits.&quot; It seems almost inappropriate to ask if she ever considers retiring. &quot;No. As long as I have the energy, I will carry on. I&apos;d like to live 200 or 300 years. I want to leave my message to my successors and future generations.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["They eagerly show me their work: products and designs that will be probably be shaping next year&apos;s trends from Tokyo to New York."], "tags": ["London", "Boris Johnson", "Politics", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Museums", "UK news", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-06T23:01:00Z", "title": "My week: Munira Mirza", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/jun/07/munira-mirza-culture-adviser-boris-johnson", "article": "On Sunday morning, I&apos;m in Hackney, filming a youth debate to be shown on the website of the charity WORLDwrite. I&apos;m a bit wary of organised discussion involving &quot;young people&quot;, because there is often a tone to proceedings which encourages any adults present to suspend their critical faculties and accept that everything they say matters. Fortunately, this particular bunch is polite, articulate and thoughtful about the subject on the agenda: free speech. WORLDwrite is a small but feisty education charity which organises youth exchanges between London and countries in the developing world. It gets its young volunteers to engage with experienced professionals about the politics of development and human rights. The technology for the filming is distinctly low-tech (we are ordered to remain entirely static because there is only one microphone to pick up everything). I walk out into the sunshine feeling energised and hopeful. A lot of my work involves criss-crossing London to visit the many hundreds of projects, theatres, galleries, museums and groups that comprise the capital&apos;s astonishingly rich cultural life. From Covent Garden to Cockfosters, almost every corner of the city hums with activity, much of it unobserved by the critical mainstream. As I&apos;m in the neighbourhood, I take the opportunity to pop into Sutton House, a Tudor mansion in the middle of Hackney. It&apos;s run by the National Trust and dates from a time when the district was an idyllic country retreat for the upper classes seeking relief from the pestilence and stench of the city. In the majestic dining room, two volunteers greet me warmly, answering my questions and sharing their impressive knowledge of the building and the history of the area, including the fact that Tesco was founded nearby in the 1920s by a local market boy called Jack Cohen. Blasted back to the future with a visit to the Innovation Gallery at Central St Martins, where I have lunch with some of the college&apos;s best and most entrepreneurial students and recent graduates: an intimidatingly fashionable and impressive group of twentysomethings, some already running successful businesses. It&apos;s hard not to feel inadequate by comparison. They eagerly show me their work: products and designs that will be probably be shaping next year&apos;s trends from Tokyo to New York. London&apos;s top colleges attract the best young talent from around the world; they&apos;re truly a national asset. In the evening, I&apos;m presenting an award on HMS Belfast, celebrating a very different but no less commendable segment of cultural London: museum volunteers. This is a fantastic bunch of people who keep our museums going by acting as guides, providing translations, assisting with archiving and, of course, answering questions from people like me. The biggest event of my week is the launch of the mayor&apos;s new month-long festival of popular history: the Story of London. The venue is the rather obvious but unbeatable Tower of London. Boris Johnson is on hand and ready to give the assembled photographers what they want - the Beefeater shot.  Historian Tristram Hunt, who is co-ordinating the lectures strand of the programme, and I shuffle on to the lawn beside Boris, but we&apos;re soon made to understand by the impatient snappers that we&apos;re surplus to requirements. How can we object? Boris is probably the most camera-friendly politician in Britain and happily strikes a variety of poses. In the evening, I find myself sitting on a couch in the courtyard of the Royal Academy as a guest on the BBC&apos;s Culture Show which is filming at the opening of the RA&apos;s 241st annual Summer Exhibition. I am joined by two artists: Michael Landy, who has recently been appointed as an academician, and Grayson Perry, who is wearing what is, even by his own standards, an outrageously loud dress. I love Grayson because he&apos;s not only great fun, but also a very astute observer of the art world. By the end of the week, it&apos;s my turn to be a volunteer. I&apos;ve signed up for National Volunteering Week and committed to spending Friday afternoon at the bustling Barnet arts centre, artsdepot Open. Almost as soon as I arrive, it becomes clear that this whole experience is going to be much more useful to me than to them. I sit in on a fundraising meeting which provides a crash course in the challenges of running an arts venue in outer London. Even better, I get to watch a rehearsal of the premiere of Rafael Bonachela&apos;s new contemporary dance commission. I&apos;m brought back to earth when I help out at a &quot;messy art class&quot; for toddlers which entails being covered in heaps of shredded coloured paper. Since I began this job a year ago, I have become aware of a cultural revolution going on inside my own heart. As a transplanted northerner, London has always signified big-city glamour and cosmopolitanism. It&apos;s part of what drew me here after university. But more recently, something else has been happening: as my work takes me further afield, I am slowly falling in love with the suburbs. There is much to be said for their tranquil character, not to mention less stressful parking regimes. I have been invited to Gants Hill, previously just a name on the tube map, by the Heritage Lottery Fund to see a refurbishment they have funded. This is Valentines Mansion, a stunning historic house in acres of beautiful parkland. It feels a world away from the hip London of Central St Martins but then I walk into the lunch room to discover a contemporary commission by the talented up-and-coming artist Justin Coombes. He has produced a set of photographs of the gardens, which appear to have ghostly layers combining the past and the present. Is he suggesting that the suburbs are a palimpsest with hidden depths not always apparent to the naked eye? Jump on the Central Line and make up your own mind.

Apart from Gillian Tett herself, who has been the most prescient British financial journalist on the credit crunch, the most fascinating is Blythe Masters, a blonde, porcelain-faced Tilda Swinton lookalike who has the dubious distinction of having devised the first credit default swap. She also took a tiny device into the maternity ward to pass the time tracking share prices - doesn&apos;t everyone? - and was later blamed for opening the Pandora&apos;s box that led to global financial meltdown.  But it is Terri Duhon, another female financier, who best sums up Tett&apos;s core thesis: that it is not complex derivatives that were to blame for the crisis but the recklessness and greed of the bankers who so eagerly adopted them and used them in ways which their inventors claim never to have envisaged. Duhon, a Harley-Davidson-riding maths whizz from rural Louisiana whose talent for numbers catapulted her into the rarefied world of finance, commented: &quot;When car crashes happen, people don&apos;t blame cars or stop driving them, they blame the drivers! Derivatives are the same - it&apos;s not the tools at fault but the people who used those tools.&quot; This is a fascinating and detailed look at the crisis, seen through the prism of the venerable investment bank JP Morgan, where many of the complex derivatives that helped bring the system down originated. Tett, a senior journalist at the Financial Times, has several advantages as an author on this subject: she spent time in Japan, which underwent its own banking crisis and recession before this one; in the period running up to the collapse, she was covering credit markets, an area even most banking specialists viewed as obscure; and she has a doctorate in social anthropology, giving her an acute insight into banking tribes.  As she says, in most societies elites try to maintain power not simply by garnering wealth but by ideological domination too - deciding what is talked about and what is not. The &quot;social silence&quot; around the explosion of derivatives, and around the wealth and influence of the banking cadre, helped to construct and reinforce a new power structure and encouraged financiers to regard their activities as detached from the rest of society, until they became &quot;like the inhabitants of Plato&apos;s cave, who could see the shadows of outside reality flickering on the walls, but rarely encountered that reality themselves&quot;.  This lack of a holistic vision of finance had, Tett points out, terrible consequences, the most tragic of which have been the blows to families who had never heard of a CDO (collateralised debt obligation) or an SIV (structured investment vehicle), but are now suffering the loss of savings, homes and jobs.  As Tett tells it, the deadly progress of derivatives can be charted as a tale of three parties. The first was held in June 1994, in Boca Raton, Florida, when a dozen young bankers from JP Morgan in London, Tokyo and New York descended on a hotel where they got drunk, threw the bosses into the pool and discussed how they would grow the derivatives business. They were fired by the fervour of scientists who thought they were splitting the atom or discovering DNA - with no notion that their innovation, in the hands of others, would run disastrously out of control.  The second jamboree took place on 11 June 2007, in Barcelona, when industry body the European Securitisation Forum held its annual meeting and celebrated the most lucrative year in history for investment banks. The meeting was dubbed &quot;Global Asset Backed Securitisation: Towards a New Dawn!&quot;. With what now looks like grim irony, the band, composed of bankers, was called D&apos;Leverage - and played slightly out of tune. When the new dawn actually broke, the very next day, it was with the news that a crisis was erupting at a hedge fund with close links to Bear Stearns - one of the early markers of the great unravelling.  The third bash took place in January this year, at the World Economic Forum, where Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, was one of only a few chastened senior bankers to show his face. Dimon, who bought collapsed rival Bear Stearns for a knockdown price in 2008 in a deal described as being like &quot;the Boy Scouts taking over the Mob&quot;, hosted a cocktail party for 200 key contacts in the Piano Bar at the Swiss resort of Davos. The invitations were embossed with the ghostly image of the bank&apos;s founder, J Pierpont Morgan, hailed as the saviour of Wall Street in the crisis of 1907, with the not-so-subliminal message that Dimon had fulfilled a similar role in this debacle. A down-to-earth, hard-nosed New Yorker, Dimon emerges well from these pages. I can testify to him being a different breed from most investment-banking CEOs: my mobile phone trilled one Monday afternoon last year, and to my astonishment it was &quot;the King of Wall Street&quot; himself, wanting to discuss one of my columns, a task many banking grandees would have delegated to a PR aide. Once I realised it was not a colleague playing a practical joke, we had a cordial exchange of views on short-selling.  Tett&apos;s book gives the lie to the comforting notion that the crisis could not have been foreseen. Veteran financier Felix Rohatyn warned in the early 1990s that derivatives were &quot;financial hydrogen bombs built on personal computers by 26-year-olds with MBAs&quot;. In 2003, Bill White and Claudio Borio, the two most senior economists at the Bank for International Settlements, presented a paper challenging the orthodoxy that financial innovation was good, because it reduced and dispersed risk. Their audience, which included Alan Greenspan, was not impressed.  The JP Morgan team, whose evangelism for financial innovation went so horribly wrong, are portrayed as stunned and chastened; Blythe Masters is &quot;livid at how bankers have perverted her derivatives dream&quot;. As one of the JP Morgan innovators emailed another: &quot;What kind of a monster has been created here? It&apos;s like you raised a cute kid who then grew up and committed a horrible crime.&quot; Readers will have to make up their own mind whether Masters and her peers could, or should, have done more to curb the destructive potential of their brainchildren, who grew into such monstrous adolescents. \u2022 Ruth Sunderland is business editor of the Observer"}, {"sentences": ["We needed those Japanese blokes with white gloves who shove people on to Tokyo subway trains."], "tags": ["Labour party leadership", "Labour", "Gordon Brown", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-08T23:05:11Z", "title": "Simon Hoggart's sketch: standing space only in room 14", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/09/simon-hoggart-gordon-brown-leadership-crisis", "article": "MPs adore these events. Outside room 14 in the Commons committee corridor, it looked like Epsom used to on Derby day. Crowds were \u00adheaving, policemen were out in force, possibly to collar pickpockets and cut-purses. Lord Janner was even \u00adperforming magic tricks. A group of \u00adAfrican \u00addignitaries, some in full traditional dress, tried to force their way down the corridor. Rubber-neckers came to watch. Edward Leigh MP announced that he was resigning from the government \u2013 and he&apos;s a Tory. But why not? Everyone else is joining in the fun. MPs were going in after being \u00adsubjected to intense pressure from Brown supporters and the whips.

(&quot;We know where your homes are \u2013 all of them.&quot;) &quot;Is summat on?&quot; asked various northern MPs. A figure arrived, looking, from the back, like Mr Burns from The Simpsons. From the front it was Gerald Kaufman. We knew things were \u00adserious because he was wearing only three \u00addifferent patterns \u2013 on suit, shirt and tie. David Blunkett arrived with a black eye. Thank heavens he didn&apos;t bring along the cow that savaged him. Lord Mandelson turned up. &quot;Hello,&quot; he said silkily, leaving a hundred hacks \u00adasking: &quot;What could he have meant by that?&quot; His old enemy, John Prescott, arrived, scowling like a man who had lost a jackpot scratchcard but found a quid. By this time the room was almost full. As scores of MPs and peers continue to pile in it was becoming difficult to find standing space, or even breathing room. By 6.01pm, it looked like the first Northern line train for 10 minutes during the rush hour. We needed those Japanese blokes with white gloves who shove people on to Tokyo subway trains. The prime minister himself arrived. &quot;Hi, guys!&quot; he said to the assembled press. And that was on the record. He was smiling, but not the ghastly smile, which has to be operated mechanically. The sound of clapping and desk \u00adbanging emerged from inside. Several cabinet members, who had thought themselves too important to arrive early, failed even to push the doors open. That was lucky \u2013 if they had \u00admanaged to get in, they would have forced someone at the far end of the room out of the window and into the river. Ronnie Campbell, a bruiser from the north-east, hurled himself at the door like a policeman on a dawn raid. &quot;And I&apos;m a Broon supporter!&quot; he shouted as the press yelled &quot;heave!&quot; He got it \u00adperhaps one inch open before deciding &quot;the only thing to do is go for a pint&quot;. In the chamber, a solitary Labour backbencher was attending the debate on the health bill. Finally, after 90 minutes, it was all over, and the corridor again resembled the Israelites trying to scurry across the Red Sea before it rolled back. &quot;Brown&apos;s was the finest speech I have ever heard,&quot; said one loyalist. &quot;Same old stuff,&quot; said a rebel. &quot;He was saved by the Voice of the Valleys&quot; \u2013 believed to be a reference to Lord Kinnock."}, {"sentences": ["The west&apos;s Tokyo Game Show is, as I have written on the Gamesblog in the past, an orgasm of the senses."], "tags": ["Tetris", "Wii", "Technology", "Games", "E3"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-10T23:01:00Z", "title": "Aleks Krotoski on E3 - a trip best taken in the safety of your home", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/11/e3-electronics-entertainment-expo", "article": "A throbbing head, weak knees and flashing lights: these are only three of the reasons I did not go to the second coming of E3, the Electronics Entertainment Expo, last week in Los Angeles. There are others. The west&apos;s Tokyo Game Show is, as I have written on the Gamesblog in the past, an orgasm of the senses. Problem is, it&apos;s actually someone else&apos;s orgasm, and you&apos;ve had nothing to do with it. Instead, you have to watch, slightly embarrassed, increasingly uncomfortable, desperately hoping an exit opportunity will present itself, or that you&apos;ll find an Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or Portal Gun, so you can make a speedy getaway through a well-placed hole in the closest wall. Sure, being at the Nexus of Game has its advantages: you can be the first past the post on news and you can grab a few milliseconds with one of the industry&apos;s illustrious heroes. But you can do that at other - more sedate - games conferences, when schedules aren&apos;t so tightly packed, and the digerati have more interesting things to talk about than announcement fodder. Attending E3 is like being trapped inside of a glitter ball for seven days as it whirs around at the speed of light, while 10,000 shrieking kittens claw at your body, trying to snag one little piece of skin to hold on to so they can anchor themselves away from the walls of their spinning Alcatraz. No, not top of my agenda; I&apos;ll leave it to my esteemed colleagues to cover that show. Instead, last week I watched the fountains of games coverage that streamed through my newsreader from behind the postage-stamp-sized screen on my gargantuan original Game Boy. I was celebrating the quarter century of my personal crack cocaine, Tetris, by getting lost in its forest of gentle falling blocks, its perfect interface and its maddening learning curve. How can you go wrong with Tetris? It&apos;s been instrumental in my life; it taught me how to pack a moving van, a skill that has been extremely useful in my time as a nomad. With the sound turned down, playing Tetris is like falling in love again. Going to E3 is like being perpetually stuck in the tail end of an agonising relationship. The best vantage point for E3 is from the web, where you can sift through the announcements, videos and playable demos at your own pace, pulling out the cream of the crop without all the crap. You won&apos;t be assaulted by a booth babe - the models bought in to hide a pile of terrible silicon - attacked by a PR person or deafened by the sound of a thousand people falling from Wii wobble boards. And if the lights start to flash and your head starts to throb, it&apos;s time to put down Tetris and turn off the glitter ball.

He&apos;s a rugby fan who supports Bath and England, loves rowing, and looks comfortable wearing jeans. He was the youngest of six, and didn&apos;t finish his diploma course at Thames Poly before getting into programming and discovering an enthusiasm for computing. What&apos;s unusual about this former lad from Lewisham is that he&apos;s executive vice-president of Intel, and its chief sales and marketing officer, which makes him one of the US&apos;s top businessmen. Or, rather, the world&apos;s. When I met him for lunch in London on Friday, he&apos;d just got off a plane after a WiMax launch in St Petersburg. He&apos;d gone to Russia from Taiwan, where he gave a keynote speech at last week&apos;s Computex trade show, and on Monday, he emailed me from another WiMax event in Tokyo. Around 80% of Intel&apos;s business comes from outside the US, and Maloney reckons he spends about half his time travelling. But he&apos;s due some time off, and his holiday will include watching some rugby in South Africa. Blunt force It&apos;s not the kind of lifestyle he&apos;d envisaged in the 1970s, when he was selling leftwing newspapers outside the dock gates in London (his grandfather had been a docker), but joining Intel helped change that. It gave him the chance to rise through the ranks in the UK then move to the US, where he spent a couple of years as Andy Grove&apos;s assistant. Grove, who had arrived in the US as a refugee from Hungary, built Intel: he was like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer rolled into one. What was it like working for him? &quot;He was extremely blunt,&quot; says Maloney. &quot;We had some very blunt arguments. As a manager he was extraordinarily demanding: he paid you the compliment of taking your word seriously, and then expecting you to do better. You owe that to the people who work for you, who put so much of their lives into their jobs. He paid me an extreme level of attention, which is what I wanted: life goes by in a flash, so you might as well do your best!&quot; Much of the world runs on Intel processors, and Maloney&apos;s current task is encouraging the adoption of WiMax wireless networking, which is like longer-range Wi-Fi - but isn&apos;t being adopted as rapidly as hoped. Intel is also making an impact with the Atom chip, which is at the heart of the netbook market, and the new Culv (consumer ultra low voltage) platform. Culv was big at Computex Taiwan, I remind him, with Acer, Asus and MSI all backing Intel&apos;s new chip set. Was I right in thinking Culv was driving a wedge between netbooks and notebooks? &quot;That was the idea,&quot; Maloney says, &quot;but that&apos;s not what&apos;s happened. It turns out you can tune your manufacturing processes for higher clock speeds or for lower power consumption. And we found that in all the market segments, there was utility in coming out with better battery life, lower temperatures, less electricity use. Now it&apos;s a parallel universe, where each processor will have its own shadow.&quot; Maloney reckons Culv chips will lead to thin notebooks that have extraordinary battery life, probably eight or nine hours instead of three or four. Intel is investing more than $7bn in factories to produce smaller 32nm versions of its chips, which it hopes will take battery life over 12 hours. Intel had low-power chips before, of course, but they weren&apos;t x86 software (DOS/Windows) compatible: they were based on ARM designs, which dominate the markets for PDAs and mobiles. But after acquiring what had been Digital&apos;s StrongARM business and changing it to XScale, Intel sold it on. How did that make sense? &quot;XScale still exists and it&apos;s doing well,&quot; says Maloney, &quot;but we were the 14th or 15th ARM licensee, and didn&apos;t really bring that much to the party. In 2003-04, we were trying to prioritise between doing another version of ARM or doing another version of Banias [the Centrino processor]. We had a budget crunch and we didn&apos;t have the headcount to do both. We realised we had a greater commitment to x86 so we shifted resources to that. It turned out to be a strategic decision.&quot; So instead of having its own ARM range, Intel is now driving into ARM territory with the Atom chip - and, of course, ARM chips are starting to attack the low end of the netbook market with what Qualcomm is calling smartbooks. But does the Atom make economic sense? Microsoft took a financial hit by selling cheap copies of Windows XP into the netbook market instead of Vista: doesn&apos;t it hurt Intel to sell cheap Atom chips instead of more expensive Core 2 Duos? Mighty Atom Maloney doesn&apos;t think there&apos;s too much cannibalisation of sales at the low end - 80% of netbook buyers wouldn&apos;t have bought a notebook - and he sees a big netbook market emerging for the 7-12 age group. But, he says: &quot;The alarm bells should ring if you&apos;re defending a business - it&apos;s a wake-up call.&quot; The message is: &quot;Do it to yourself before someone does it to you.&quot; Intel has followed up on the Atom by buying a software supplier, Wind River Systems, for $884m. That doesn&apos;t seem to make sense either, because Wind River has been supporting the ARM camp, and Intel already had Mobilon, its own version of Linux tuned for netbooks. &quot;We&apos;re moving Atom into the embedded [processor] market, and Linux is the game there,&quot; he says. &quot;Wind River is bulking out our knowledge in embedded applications.&quot; In other words, to penetrate the business for chips in TVs, set-top boxes and portable devices, Intel needs Wind River to provide the sort of support for Atom that it provides for ARM. It&apos;s an answer to the chicken-and-egg problem of hardware needing software, and vice versa. Intel is aiming the Atom at the market for MIDs (Mobile Internet Devices), and perhaps even mobile phones, where x86 chips have not been able to go because of their high power requirements. These sell in much bigger quantities than PCs, which ship about 300m a year, but without much of a price premium. Maloney says that with the Atom &quot;we knew we were going to make lower margins than ever before, so we had to design it that way, using different people, with a different culture. We made a decision to go that way, so that&apos;s what we did. If we can&apos;t make money in high-volume, low-cost markets, we&apos;re doomed anyway. &quot;That&apos;s not to say it wasn&apos;t an emotional discussion,&quot; he says. &quot;It was. It still is.&quot; The chip business has always been a bit of a gamble, and in this case, Intel is betting tens of billions of dollars. It&apos;s something for Maloney to think about when he&apos;s at home in Palo Alto, rowing his wooden Carl Douglas boat around, watching the dawn break over San Francisco bay. He could, after all, be Intel&apos;s next chief executive."}, {"sentences": ["Martin Foster, 53, lives with his wife Yoko in Minami-Senju, in Tokyo&apos;s northern suburbs.", "It is usual for extended families \u2013 youngsters, parents and grandparents \u2013 to share living space in Tokyo&apos;s notoriously cramped apartments."], "tags": ["Older people", "Long-term care", "Society", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-11T08:00:00Z", "title": "A serious take on ageing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2009/jun/11/older-people-longtermcare", "article": "So cherished are the elderly in Japan that an annual national holiday is held in their honour. Respect for the Aged Day, on the third Monday in September, serves to remind everyone of their obligations to a grey section of society that is growing at an alarming rate. Getting the government to do its bit, however, can prove surprisingly hard and the responsibility for looking after pensioners lies closer to home. Martin Foster, 53, lives with his wife Yoko in Minami-Senju, in Tokyo&apos;s northern suburbs. Yoko&apos;s parents cared for her 90-year-old grandmother and the family had to make a direct appeal to the authorities to increase the level of state help her grandmother needed as she became more frail. &quot;If you want more help from the state you have to stand up and fight for it, which is something the Japanese are not used to doing or are very good at,&quot; says Martin. It is usual for extended families \u2013 youngsters, parents and grandparents \u2013 to share living space in Tokyo&apos;s notoriously cramped apartments. About two in three pensioners live with their children. Four reasons spring to mind: the social stigma attached to packing off your old folk to a nursing home; a lack of places; cost; and the basic tenet on which Japanese society operates \u2013 sacrifice of the self for the greater good. Takio Wada and his wife, Meiko, lived in the US for seven years. They dreamed of retiring to Hawaii but instead selflessly returned to Japan to care for Takio&apos;s mother, Aki. Still, Meiko can&apos;t say she wasn&apos;t warned. When they first met in Italy in 1972, he told her: &quot;I will have to look after my mother when she is old.&quot; It is Aki&apos;s 96th birthday on the day I visit their house in Soka City, Saitama. He jokes: &quot;In Japan, it may be easier for a woman to get married to a man who has no mother to take care of. Having a live-in mother-in-law can be quite tough.&quot; Apart from hearing difficulties, Aki is in rude health and can still climb the stairs to her bedroom. But Takio is 66 and his wife 68. How will they cope when she can no longer do this, or needs help with even basic tasks? &quot;First we will build a bedroom on the ground floor. Then if we still can&apos;t take care of her anymore we will move her to a nursing home \u2013 one of the more reasonably priced ones. That would be a last resort, but my mother wouldn&apos;t want to be taken to the toilet by my wife or for us to have to bathe her.&quot; Tradition dictates it is the eldest son who should take care of the parents. &quot;The younger generations don&apos;t want to do this but my generation has to,&quot; says Takio. &quot;It is up to the eldest son \u2013 I truly believe that. I think my son is thinking about this care issue now. I hope he will look at our family, how we look after my mother, and that he will take care of us. We won&apos;t request this but we live in hope.&quot; For her part, Aki has no doubt where she is best off: &quot;I prefer to live with my son than go to the nursing home. A bus comes to take me to the community centre every day, and I enjoy the company there.&quot; Junichi Umeda and his wife Mayumi are neighbours of the Wada family. Junichi&apos;s mother is in a nursing home. He and his sister contribute 25,000 yen (\u00a3170) a month each towards the 200,000 yen fee. The other 150,000 yen is covered by his mother&apos;s state pension and savings. &quot;It was my sister&apos;s decision to send her to a nursing home,&quot; says Junichi. &quot;Then she had to find a facility, but there were no vacancies. My niece had once worked at this particular care home so it was a very rare case of being able to get in through the back door. Normally you have to register and go on a long waiting list, maybe for a year.&quot; Time is one thing Japan doesn&apos;t have. The country is sitting on a geriatric faultline of seismic proportions. In the past six years, the number of people living to 100 has doubled from 18,000 to 36,000. By 2040, there will be a staggering 1 million Japanese centenarians while the population will have plunged from 127 million to 100 million, according to the UN. It&apos;s a simple equation: one in 100 will be at least 100. With a shrinking population \u2013 the birth rate is 1.23 \u2013 it is difficult to see who is going to look after them."}, {"sentences": ["When the director Michael Bay paraded Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in front of hordes of screaming fans at the world premiere of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen earlier this week in Tokyo, the photo opportunity marked the start of a summer event that had been nearly two years in the making - which was when the previous Transformers movie was released."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-11T23:01:00Z", "title": "Jeremy Kay on how to make a smash hit series", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/hollywood-franchises", "article": "When the director Michael Bay paraded Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in front of hordes of screaming fans at the world premiere of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen earlier this week in Tokyo, the photo opportunity marked the start of a summer event that had been nearly two years in the making - which was when the previous Transformers movie was released. Franchises are the name of the game in Hollywood these days. Cast your eye down the list of forthcoming summer releases and you&apos;ll see a super-sized popcorn bucket of familiar properties coming your way, from current releases such as Terminator Salvation, Angels &amp; Demons and Night at the Museum 2 to the imminent launches of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and, later this year, The Twilight Saga: New Moon. That Hollywood regards franchises as the gift that keeps on giving isn&apos;t exactly news, but what is unprecedented is the sheer volume of franchises in the pipeline. Tinseltown&apos;s appetite for proven formulas makes sound business sense, especially with the recession making the money men more risk averse. And when hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, it&apos;s little wonder there&apos;s such a stampede to moves that have proved their success. Within weeks of the 4 July opening weekend of the first Transformers film in 2007, some time before the final $708m global gross was reached, the top brass of Paramount and DreamWorks had gathered to plot the next instalment. By September of that year they announced that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen would launch on the weekend of June 26 2009. The script for the follow up was barely a glint in the studio executives&apos; eyes at that point, but they knew they needed to secure a favourable date in the crowded calendar of releases and work backwards from there.  As a general rule, two-thirds of a blockbuster&apos;s worldwide box-office is taken outside North America these days, an inescapable truism that has forced US executives to consider the rest of the world when they schedule movies. &quot;We are now looking at tentatively dating movies around the world two-plus years out, so that everything else you do on the project can be channelled towards that date,&quot; says Andrew Cripps, the president of Paramount Pictures International, who is charged with orchestrating the studio&apos;s release strategy outside North America.  &quot;You start your campaign as soon as the studio puts films up for greenlight,&quot; says Cripps. &quot;I sit around with the studio heads and the heads of production, North American distribution and marketing, and discuss the way ahead.&quot; In this case, the consensus was to adhere as closely as possible to the model for the first film. Indeed Paramount has already tentatively set the third Transformers episode - due in 2011 - to open over the independence day weekend. &quot;This is one of the most lucrative weekends in the calendar,&quot; says Cripps. &quot;The idea is the movie opens strongly and heads into that holiday period in the US for a great second weekend. Internationally it coincides with when a lot of children get out for the school holidays.&quot; To see how important this short window of box-office opportunity is to the franchise-makers, look at the release schedules for the few weeks from late June. The week after Paramount releases the Transformers movie, 20th Century Fox follows with the family-friendly Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, with the studios hoping to make plenty of money before Warner Bros releases Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince around most of the world in mid-July. Of course, it takes more than integrated distribution and marketing campaigns - not to mention the intricate promotional tie-ins - to make a successful franchise. On the creative side, franchises thrive on thematic continuity. &quot;You need to have characters that audiences want to spend more time with, and you need a big idea,&quot; says Shawn Levy, director and producer of Fox&apos;s Night at the Museum. &quot;For example, the idea of Harry Potter is he&apos;s a young wizard at a school for the paranormal, whereas Night at the Museum is about a magical tablet that brings museum contents to life after dark.&quot; It helps to step up the scale from film to film, too. Just as the warring robots in Revenge of the Fallen upgrade from city streets to the Pyramids of Giza for their climactic battle, so Ben Stiller&apos;s hapless security guard abandons the corridors of New York&apos;s Museum of Natural History for the labyrinthine halls of Washington DC&apos;s Smithsonian complex in the sequel. About one month after Levy&apos;s 2006 original was on its way towards its $574.5m worldwide haul, Fox called him in to discuss a follow-up. &quot;I saw the opening credit sequence of Night at the Museum 2 vividly in my head within a week of the first film going out,&quot; Levy says. Clearly his vision had wide appeal, because within barely three weeks of release, Night at the Museum 2 had amassed more than $226m worldwide. Levy counsels restraint in the early stages of franchise building. &quot;You can&apos;t try to launch a franchise right away; that&apos;s a dicey mindset. You try to make one very good movie that people will respond to and build on that. And there&apos;s no franchise without the main actor or actors, and the main actor doesn&apos;t tend to show up unless there&apos;s a key relationship with the film-makers. It was important for Ben to show up with me. The studio often has an appetite for a franchise and it requires a film-making team to do creative work to bring the talent.  &quot;Ben and I were only going to make a sequel that was better than the first one, so in the end it was gratifying to hear people respond to the movie and in particular the Amy Adams storyline [Adams&apos; aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart provides Stiller with a love interest and an ally against an evil Pharaoh]. A lot of sequels don&apos;t capture that emotional resonance. The journey of Ben&apos;s character back to his better self - which is what this movie was really about - was more important to Ben than throwing in a load of special effects. We will make Night at the Museum 3 if the movie continues to garner goodwill, but you won&apos;t hear about it unless we feel we have a story that&apos;s worth telling.&quot; A-list stars such as Stiller are paid handsomely for their efforts on franchises, but at a time when cost-conscious studios are fighting the agencies tooth-and-nail on compensation packages it is the visionary directors such as Levy and Bay, who often write and/or produce as well, who stand to gain the most. &quot;These days unless you are Tom Cruise or Will Smith, more and more event films tend to be sold off a director or a great conceit, preferably based on a property with built-in source material,&quot; says Scott Agostoni, a leading Hollywood agent with William Morris Endeavor. &quot;The deals for Transformers 2, for example, would have been built on the fact that you have a pre-existing brand. &quot;In these risk-averse times the studios are most interested in properties based on a comic book, novel or video game. It doesn&apos;t have to have a rabid following like Twilight. Wanted wasn&apos;t based on a huge comic-book and yet Universal hired a visually gifted director from Russia [Timur Bekmambetov, fresh off the smash Russian fantasy saga Day Watch] and it became a big hit.&quot; Wanted grossed $341m worldwide. With literally thousands of promising stories swirling around in the ether, the trick is to find the ones that lend themselves to visual adaptation. Harry Potter is arguably the jewel in the crown of franchise movie-making, and as the sixth instalment approaches, with the two-part finale scheduled for November 2010 and July 2011, it remains on course to become the biggest global franchise in history. The success of the Potter series illustrates the opportunities the best properties provide, but you can have a fantastic property and still not be able to develop the franchise you want - only to see it become a hit for someone else. In late 2006, when Paramount&apos;s MTV Films division gave up trying to crack the script to Twilight, based on the first of Stephenie Meyer&apos;s bestselling vampire romance novels, production executive Karen Rosenfelt instead placed it with Erik Feig, the head of production at a fledgling studio called Summit Entertainment. Feig and Rosenfelt were so passionate about the project that Summit was able to persuade Meyer to sign a rights deal for the novel just as the company came into money from finalising its initial round of corporate financing. It proved to be one of the great coups of modern Hollywood history. Summit assigned Melissa Rosenberg to write the screenplays, hired Catherine Hardwicke to direct and enlisted two perfect leads: the UK actor Robert Pattinson, whose most prominent role to date had been noble Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and Kristen Stewart.  &quot;Initially we wanted to do Twilight because of the story,&quot; says Summit co-chairman and CEO Rob Friedman, coincidentally a former vice-chairman at Paramount. &quot;That&apos;s where it all starts. We felt it was captivating and totally unique for a very defined audience - essentially Romeo and Juliet in a vampire world. As we got into the property and started to think about the movie we felt there was a franchise opportunity here.&quot; Friedman, Feig and Co took great care to reassure fans of the books that their beloved Bella Swan and her vampire love Edward Cullen were in safe hands. &quot;The fans were critical,&quot; Frideman says. &quot;We monitored Stephenie&apos;s fan site and their responses. We wanted the fans to become our cheerleaders and were sensitive to what we believed they would like. We worked closely with Stephenie since the first day and when we had stuff so show we would break it to the fans first so they felt they were participating. Quite often what happens with adaptations is people try to make the film different and key elements get changed. Our process was very clear - the love story doesn&apos;t resolve itself until the end of the fourth book and we were determined to honour that.&quot; Summit released a teaser trailer in May 2008 and in July of that year it staged arguably the US pop culture event of the year by taking Hardwicke and the cast to the Comic-Con convention in San Diego. The rest is history. Last November Twilight scored a thunderous $69.6m Thanksgiving Day opening weekend in the US, en route to a staggering $380m worldwide haul. Within days the company had announced it was moving ahead on the sequel New Moon. Chris Weitz was brought in to direct the returning cast after Hardwicke and Summit parted ways following amicable creative differences, and the movie will open around most of the world on November 19 and 20.

It was never meant literally of course \u2013 any errant member of the Indie Landfills could get Stella&apos;d up and land themselves a night in chokey at the drop of a trouser. No, it referred to the potential to get press coverage out of these brushes with the law.  Ten years ago I was the anonymous scribe behind NME&apos;s gossip column and hence one of the biggest arrest-story magnets in the rock media: often a band would use their one phone call to ring me instead of a lawyer. Barely a week went by without a &quot;Marion caught jaywalking&quot; exclusive or a hotel misdemeanour involving the 60ft Dolls. But the demise of the weekly gossip sheets left no media outlet for the z-list indecent exposures and for much of this decade only the highest profile cases have been widely reported \u2013 the Chris Browns, George Michaels, DMXs, Boy Georges, Phil Spectors, Michael Jacksons and Diana Rosses.  Until now. The last few years have seen a resurgence in musicians using arrests as publicity opportunities, from Iglu and Hartley feeling the long \u2013 and presumably rubber-gloved \u2013 arm of the law for streaking around a Hilton hotel at this year&apos;s SXSW to Kid Cudi getting tasered for wearing Nike trainers at a Reebok party.  This week alone has seen arrest stories ranging from the trivial (Patrick Wolf collared in San Francisco for spitting at a bouncer) to matters for the International Fraud Squad (a gang of DJs conducting an elaborate iTunes theft plot). As a former gossip hound I&apos;m thrilled by this development; I can believe that music isn&apos;t full of media-trained career rockers sticking to a label strategy and that there are actually gangs of reprobates out there who are in it for rock&apos;n&apos;roll larks. In fact, I hope more pop stars follow the example of Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, star of Japan&apos;s SMAP boyband, who was arrested in April after being found naked in a Tokyo park, shrieking at the top of his lungs like a crazed hybrid of George Michael and Robbie Williams. But what&apos;s behind this rozzer-bothering revival? Should we blame the virtuoso of the genre, Pete Doherty, himself back in the news for arrests over drugs and drink driving?  Certainly his example proves that the delinquent rock star can go to ludicrous lengths of illegality before actually being locked up; bands have living proof they&apos;ll probably get off lightly. Or could reduced royalties be driving artists to greater extremes of crime and desperation? Or is it that Twitter has reopened the gossip floodgates and become a favourite source of music news? Bands have created their own publicity outlet and with so many platforms for music news scrambling for a scoop, suddenly every band can &quot;get arrested&quot; again."}, {"sentences": ["Sounds like Sophisticated electric pop Try I Left My Heart in Tokyo 5."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Pixie Lott"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-13T23:01:00Z", "title": "Pixie Lott, Dolly Rockers and others line up to be the new Banarama", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/14/dolly-rockers-pixie-lott-girls-can-t-catch", "article": "1.

A scant few hours earlier, his Broadway musical Billy Elliot had won a record-breaking 10 Tony Awards, and even fewer hours earlier he returned from the party. He was presumably still asleep when I spoke to his PR, who said: &quot;I know he&apos;ll be delighted to see you, Gaby, it&apos;s just that, well ... he doesn&apos;t know that yet. But he&apos;s leaving for the airport at 10.30, so if you could just be outside his house, you could get in the car ...&quot; Call it what you will - charm, exhilaration, Stockholm syndrome - Daldry takes his kidnapping remarkably well. &quot;Come up, darling,&quot; he says over the intercom, and greets me cheerily in his sprawling, low-key New York apartment before taking me to a diner across the street. (His flight has been delayed; we now have time for breakfast.) Daldry is spindly and quick - to move, to think, to laugh. As we walk he pulls a crumpled packet from his pocket and lights up one of many &quot;last&quot; cigarettes. &quot;Today is a new day,&quot; he says purposefully. In the restaurant he orders an omelette and a coffee and throws his whole body on to the red vinyl seat. &quot;Ugh!&quot; he groans, &quot;I&apos;m dead!&quot;  He is recovering from a night he describes as one of the most stressful experiences of his life. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be glib about award ceremonies,&quot; Daldry says, &quot;but I&apos;m not their biggest fan.&quot; He was most nervous for the three teenage boys who alternate in the title role (David Alvarez, Trent Kowalik and Kiril Kulish), who ended up winning a unique joint Tony for best actor. Then they had a big party, and one thing Daldry loves about Billy Elliot are the parties that follow on its coat-tails. There are so many children in the cast that every party turns into &quot;sort of a Polish wedding&quot;. He left this one at 2am, whereupon he resisted the temptation to go to the party for Hair. &quot;Fewer kids at the Hair party,&quot; I suggest. He nods. &quot;A lot of smoking at the Hair party.&quot;  Daldry passes me his phone to show me a funny email he&apos;s just received from Richard Curtis. Curtis sends his congratulations, and ends with the suggestion that Daldry might consider running for prime minister next: &quot;There may be a vacancy.&quot; Daldry shakes his head and smiles. &quot;Sweetheart,&quot; he says. The New York Billy Elliot is a wonderful production full of incredible performers, but whatever its theatrical merits, it&apos;s hard to beat the magnificent weirdness of watching hundreds of Americans listening to an Elton John song called &quot;Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher&quot;, or the sheer surreal joy of seeing Arthur Scargill&apos;s face on Broadway.  Daldry finds this &quot;wickedly amusing&quot;, too. He&apos;s been working on Billy Elliot - first the film and then different incarnations of the musical - for 10 years now, and he still finds it very moving. &quot;It still takes me by surprise that it&apos;s a story about this little place in the north-east of England and what happened during the miners&apos; strike, and this little story about this town is a story on Broadway.&quot; The show was due to come to New York sooner but Daldry ended up working on The Reader, his most recent film, for two full years. &quot;As it happened,&quot; he says, &quot;the timing was good because suddenly the economy tanked and a story about a community fighting for its survival felt like it was topical.&quot; Though Daldry&apos;s success may be unique on Broadway - no British musical has ever won as many Tonys as this one did last week - it has been seen as proof of a boom in British theatre more generally. One might have expected the recession to hit theatres hard, yet people in the UK are going in droves this year; according to figures released 10 days ago by the Society of London Theatre, attendance at plays this past quarter is up by almost 30% on the same period last year. And the boom is not just about quantity: there&apos;s Helen Mirren as Ph\u00e8dre, Jude Law as Hamlet, Sam Mendes&apos;s Bridge Project at the Old Vic and Tom Stoppard&apos;s Arcadia at the Duke of York&apos;s. This has been hailed as an exceptional period for drama in Britain, the effects of which extend far beyond its shores: almost a third of all Tony nominations this year went to Brits. Whether this golden moment has come about despite or because of the political and economic apocalypse is up for debate. &quot;When times get bad, cinema becomes more conservative and the theatre becomes more imaginative,&quot; Daldry says. I ask him to give examples. &quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to go too far back,&quot; he replies, &quot;but Weimar Germany, turn of the century in England, turn of the century in Russia ... and I think that right now the theatre is more imaginative than it&apos;s been in a long time.&quot; Nevertheless, he thinks that on the whole the current confluence of British talent exists regardless of the recession. &quot;My honest answer is you can never underestimate the importance of inspired individuals who are running either organisations, buildings or companies,&quot; he says. &quot;And I think we&apos;re very lucky to have Nick Hytner at the National Theatre, Dominic [Cooke] at the Royal Court and Michael [Attenborough] at the Almeida. There are just a lot of really good, imaginative artistic directors out there at the moment, doing fantastic work.&quot; Beyond this happy coincidence, Daldry suggests, &quot;the reimagining of what a theatre audience is - that [executive director] Nick Starr has been doing for example at the National Theatre - is genuinely revolutionary.&quot; If all serious theatre is the theatre of dissent, he says, &quot;it&apos;s taken a decade or two to realise that that dissent has no coherence about it. The notion of dissent being essentially a liberal, left-wing thing is not true - dissent can be a whole variety of different things.&quot; So, where once there was a unified body of people who formed, say, a National Theatre audience, now, Daldry explains, &quot;people will come for individual pieces of work&quot;. Daldry ran the Gate Theatre in London for three years, then went on to run (and oversee a wholesale revival of) the Royal Court for six. &quot;The audience for one play at the Royal Court to the next play are not necessarily the same people at all,&quot; he goes on. &quot;Don&apos;t expect, require or yearn for a crossover - allow that diversity, celebrate the fact that you&apos;re going to get different people in on different nights for different shows, embrace it and allow that to be your policy. Once you get into that idea, it changes how you think about what you&apos;re programming, how you market it. It changes the age make-up of that audience, the race make-up of that audience.&quot; What this means is both that what&apos;s on offer is more varied and less risk-averse, and that a greater proportion of the populace has a stake in it. Theatre, Daldry asserts, is &quot;part of the national conversation - in a way that the movies are not&quot;. He interrupts himself to apologise for the generalisation before going on to say, &quot;Theatre is of the conscious mind, whereas movies are of the unconscious mind.&quot; That makes movies sound more interesting, I say.  &quot;Maybe they are,&quot; he replies. &quot;I&apos;m not pitching one against the other. I&apos;m just talking about the idea of being part of a national debate. In America, movies are more dominant because they&apos;re not so language-based, and this is a country with a cacophony of languages. In England we have, on the whole, one language and our theatre is more important.&quot; When Daldry made the film version of Billy Elliot nine years ago he became one of very few who have worked, with equal comfort and to parallel acclaim, on both stage and screen. One of the proudest achievements of his life remains, he says, the redevelopment of the Royal Court theatre, and his three movies - Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader, have totted up a good few Oscars and many nominations between them.  In both film and theatre he frequently works with David Hare (&quot;we are like a married couple,&quot; Daldry says). Hare praises Daldry&apos;s versatility. &quot;Theatre directors have always made terrible film directors,&quot; Hare told me recently. &quot;The two don&apos;t seem to mix - until this new generation of Stephen Daldry, Sam Mendes and John Crowley, who seem able to go from one to the other without strain. Best of all, having had success in cinema, none of them want to abandon theatre. Many of us in the theatre like them for that. They all have their values straight.&quot; Daldry has just directed a New York production of Hare&apos;s dual monologues, Berlin/Wall, and later this morning he&apos;s leaving for Tokyo, Melbourne and Shanghai to promote The Reader. Then he&apos;s embarking on another film - rumoured to be an adaptation of Michael Chabon&apos;s The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay, though Daldry won&apos;t confirm this because &quot;the movie industry is so fragile at the moment that I don&apos;t think you actually know you&apos;re going to make a movie until you&apos;re making it&quot;. Meanwhile, he&apos;s going to take advantage of the long-haul flights to catch up on some sleep, organise his photo albums and give up smoking. He gets up to go outside. &quot;Do you mind?&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;m going to smoke myself to death.&quot; He looks at his watch. &quot;I&apos;ve only got an hour.&quot; Daldry decided he wanted to be a director at the age of 15. His mum was a local amateur cabaret &quot;artiste&quot;, as he puts it, and he would go and watch her shows. That, combined with the influence of a schoolteacher, help from a woman who ran the local youth theatre, and a life-altering production of Hair, led him to believe directing was &quot;definitely the best fun&quot; you could have.  &quot;I never went to the cinema,&quot; he remembers. &quot;You know, film directors always have this Cinema Paradiso story about when they fell in love with the movies. I never had it. It was always theatre for me.&quot; Hair was the first professional show he saw, and &quot;me and my school friend thought it was the best thing ever. They were naked!&quot; he laughs, and adds: &quot;It was helped by the fact that I was in love with my friend.&quot; It was around that time, too, that Daldry&apos;s father died of cancer of the bladder. There was a long period when he was ill at home, the effect of which, Daldry says now, was that &quot;to me as a kid it allowed me a lot more freedom&quot;. Then he adds, unusually gnomically: &quot;More freedom than you might expect.&quot; Clever, coherent and unswervingly commercial as Daldry&apos;s artistic output has been, the style of his personal life is what you might call lived-in avant-garde. He doesn&apos;t come across as neurotic or even particularly complicated, but that may be because he has embraced so much of what anyone else might call complication. Daldry is a big advocate of communal living. In the flat I&apos;ve just visited, which appears to have endless rooms unfolding from a long, wonky corridor and where Ed Harris was filmed jumping out of the window in The Hours, Daldry lives with his wife Lucy Sexton (an American performance artist and his best friend of 20 years), their six year-old daughter Annabel, a younger girl named May-May they are bringing up as their own, one of May-May&apos;s biological parents, two mental healthcare workers, and an indeterminate number of semi-permanent inhabitants. &quot;It&apos;s literally an old-fashioned 60s commune,&quot; says Daldry, who plans to adopt some more kids now that he and Lucy are almost 50 (&quot;the more kids the merrier&quot;). His children go to the local state school, they don&apos;t have a nanny because they can all take the childcare in turns ... In short, it sounds idyllic. Just one thing: for 13 years Daldry was in a relationship with the set designer Ian MacNeil. How did he wind up married to a woman? How long have you and Lucy been married? I ask. &quot;About eight years,&quot; he says. Because you decided you wanted kids? &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, and pauses only slightly before adding, &quot;Well, you know, I mean: I&apos;m gay.&quot; There is no hedging with Daldry. He recently explained that yes, he does have sex with his wife, but if anyone asks, he always says he&apos;s gay because it&apos;s easier and people prefer it. &quot;They don&apos;t like the confusion,&quot; he shrugs. How does his wife feel about being married to a gay man? I ask. &quot;You&apos;d have to ask her,&quot; he says. &quot;But do you know what I honestly think? I think one of the great things about our marriage is, we&apos;re never going to get a divorce, and we don&apos;t have to worry about infidelity. To marry your best friend is one of the great gifts of life, and to have kids with your best friend is fantastic.&quot; The family travels frequently, shuttling between New York and a grand old home outside London. As for Daldry himself, he spends half his life in the air. I ask him if he minds flying, and his reply suggests a good deal about his casual exigency and the way he faces complexity with panache. He is, he confesses, a &quot;fussy&quot; flier. I expect him to say, perhaps, that he insists on a window seat, or that he always travels with a certain pair of talismanic socks. Oh no.  &quot;Seats aren&apos;t important,&quot; Daldry elaborates. &quot;It&apos;s airlines, and: how old is the aircraft? Is the aircraft leased or owned by the airline? I don&apos;t like leased aircraft because I know the maintenance contracts are subcontracted.  &quot;And sometimes, you know, like this trip, I sort of do want to see a picture of the aeroplane, to see whether I want to go on it. I have been on aeroplanes - I mean checked in, gone on and sat down, and gone: I don&apos;t like this. It doesn&apos;t feel right.&quot; I can&apos;t help laughing. That&apos;s happened to me before, too, but I call it a panic attack. To Daldry, it&apos;s just being a bit fussy. And with that, he jumps up from his seat. &quot;Now look,&quot; he says, dashing out of the door, &quot;I&apos;ve got to go to Tokyo!&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It&apos;s a great pity that there aren&apos;t more stories from Tokyo, Hong Kong and London in particular, as these cities are packed with people trying to maximise the use of small spaces."], "tags": ["Technology", "Internet", "Design", "Architecture"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-15T11:50:00Z", "title": "Netbytes: Saving the world, one small room at a time", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jun/15/netbytes-apartment-therapy", "article": "If you are the sort of person who likes smart home design magazines, and Ikea catalogues, then you&apos;ll probably love Apartment Therapy.

Last year, 40 of these were compiled into a book: Apartment Therapy Presents: Real Homes, Real People, Hundreds of Design Solutions by Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan.  Even more voyeuristic pleasures can be found through Apartment Therapy&apos;s annual Smallest Coolest Home Contest. Readers send in photos to enter one of the five categories which range from Teeny-tiny all the way up to Small. (There&apos;s also an International Division.) You won&apos;t get your stately home into Apartment Therapy, but you can be a star if you only have 16 x 10 feet to play with. Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan, the interior designer who co-founded and edits the site, has practiced what he preaches. In 2006, The New York Times reported that he lived with his wife Sara Kate in &quot;a 265-square-foot, one-bedroom rental on Bedford Street in the West Village [in New York], an apartment so preposterously miniature it could fit neatly inside the foyer of many apartments uptown.&quot; Readers helped remodel it to make room for their new baby. And there&apos;s more. Apartment Therapy is part of a Home Network that also includes Kids@Home, Home Cooking, Home Tech and Green@Home. They all have the same style and the content overlaps, so you feel as though it&apos;s all one site, in spite of the different web addresses. However, if you&apos;re at the green site, for example, clicking House Tours will only bring up the eco-friendly homes. Apartment Therapy also has links for coverage from half-a-dozen large US cities, including New York and San Francisco. It&apos;s a great pity that there aren&apos;t more stories from Tokyo, Hong Kong and London in particular, as these cities are packed with people trying to maximise the use of small spaces. However, international product coverage is clearly a problem, apart perhaps from Ikea. Apartment Therapy was launched in April 2004, and has a staff of 10, plus freelance contributors. It now attracts &quot;more than 3 million unique readers and 20m pageviews per month,&quot; it says. According to Quantcast, the site&apos;s US visitors are more likely to be female (58%) than male, and 69% don&apos;t have kids under 17. A large majority went to college (79%) and most are quite well off \u2013 59% earn more than $60,000 a year.  But money isn&apos;t essential. The site reckons that creating &quot;a calm, healthy, beautiful home \u2026 doesn&apos;t require large amounts of money or space. It requires inspiration, connection to resources and motivation to do something about it.&quot; Those are what it tries to provide. In some respects, Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan sounds like a yuppie version of British television&apos;s beloved House Doctor, Ann Maurice, who is also American. But Apartment Therapy concentrates on making better use of what you&apos;ve got, rather than dressing it up for sale and moving on. That&apos;s not a bad thing."}, {"sentences": ["Later this week, the four contenders to host the 2016 Games, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid, will have an opportunity to expand on their plans before the IOC membership vote in Copenhagen."], "tags": ["Colin Montgomerie", "Golf", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-15T23:26:00Z", "title": "Golfers crave Olympic gold, says Colin Montgomerie", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/16/golf-olympic-bid-colin-montgomerie", "article": "Colin Montgomerie insisted yesterday that winning an Olympic gold medal would mean more to top golfers than winning a major, as he led a final push for the sport to be included in the Games from 2016. Along with rugby sevens, golf is considered a strong favourite to be one of two sports put forward by the International Olympic Committee for inclusion in the Games after a series of presentations to its executive board at its headquarters in Lausanne today. The other sports competing for inclusion were baseball, karate, roller sports, softball and squash. Montgomerie was one member of a high level delegation that delivered golf&apos;s 45-minute presentation, which he said included &quot;one of the most moving videos I&apos;ve even seen on the game&quot;. The sport&apos;s high profile and commercial potential are likely to play in its favour as it seeks a return to the Olympic line up for the first time since 1904. The campaign has won the backing of top players including Tiger Woods, but like other lucrative individual sports including tennis, it will face questions over its importance to its biggest names. Montgomerie, who delivered golf&apos;s case alongside Annika Sorenstam, the winner of 10 women&apos;s majors, said motivation would not be a consideration, predicting &quot;100%&quot; of the top players would sign up. &quot;All the corporate logos would be off and you&apos;d be playing with a Great Britain shirt. I think that means an awful lot to anybody. I speak for all Olympic athletes,&quot; he said. Even for globally popular sports like golf and rugby, Olympic status will boost their popularity in new areas of the globe and open up new commercial opportunities. Conversely, the IOC is keen to broaden the appeal of the Olympic programme, particularly among young people, and boost its own revenue-generating appeal among sponsors and broadcasters. The European Ryder Cup captain, who will be 53 in 2016, sought to deny suggestions that an Olympic medal would mean less than a major championship and said he was confident that the top 60 players would want to compete. &quot;For every one chance we have the possibility of \u00adwinning an Olympic gold medal we have 16 majors to compete for,&quot; he said, adding that to win a gold would more than make up for his failure to win a major. &quot;It would make up for that and the rest. To be the first gold medal winner for 112 years would be a massive achievement for whoever wins.&quot; The International Rugby Board delegation, which had made a canny political move by offering to make the Olympics the pinnacle of its four-year cycle in place of the Sevens World Cup, said it was pleased with how its pitch had gone. IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset said its panel had stressed the suitability of Sevens as part of a multi-sport event and sought to reiterate that it was prospering in its own right as a distinct alternative to the 15-man game. &quot;The fans love it, it&apos;s great for TV, it&apos;s easy to understand,&quot; said the IRB chief executive, Mike Miller. He said top players from the 15-man game had also indicated their desire to play. The voting procedure for Olympic inclusion has been changed to avoid a repeat of the situation in Singapore in 2005, when baseball and softball were voted out of the London games but karate and squash failed to achieve the two thirds of votes required from the full IOC membership to replace them. Later this week, the four contenders to host the 2016 Games, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid, will have an opportunity to expand on their plans before the IOC membership vote in Copenhagen."}, {"sentences": ["Despite the encouraging news out of Tokyo, markets across Asia fell after poor manufacturing figures from the US dented hopes of a quick exit from the global recession.", "The Nikkei benchmark index fell 286.79, or 2.9%, to close at 9752.88 in Tokyo - its biggest fall in almost three months - while indices in Hong Kong and South Korea were down 3% and 0.9%.", "&quot;Although there has been some optimism on the economy after strong industrial output data, the BoJ is maintaining a very pessimistic view on the economy,&quot; Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters."], "tags": ["Global recession", "Global economy", "Japan", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-16T08:20:51Z", "title": "Japan 'may be over worst of recession'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/16/japan-over-worst-recession", "article": "Japan may be over the worst of the recession, the country&apos;s central bank said today, after rising exports and production fuelled optimism that the world&apos;s second biggest economy could return to growth during the current quarter.

The BoJ&apos;s guarded optimism was echoed by the finance minister, Kaoru Yosano, at a meeting of G8 finance ministers at the weekend. &quot;The economy is in recession but the pace of decline is slowing,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s a very cautious statement. Signs of stabilisation, that&apos;s also an expression with a question mark.&quot; The central bank&apos;s report comes amid a mixed picture for Japan&apos;s export-dependent economy. Last week the government said the economy had shrunk less than initially thought during the first quarter of this year, but the contraction was still the biggest on record, at an annualised 14.2%. Factory output, on the other hand, rose 5.9% in April, the biggest gain since 1953, signalling a modest rise in demand for exports. The bank said it remained wary of poor demand and other downside risks. Wholesale prices fell 5.4% in May from a year earlier, fuelling fears of a return to deflation, while households continue to bear the brunt of job cuts, which took unemployment to a seven-year high of 5% in April. Analysts warned against making too much of the BoJ&apos;s slightly upbeat assessment. &quot;Although there has been some optimism on the economy after strong industrial output data, the BoJ is maintaining a very pessimistic view on the economy,&quot; Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters. &quot;It said the economy has begun to stop worsening, but it didn&apos;t say it has stopped worsening.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["She also found inspiration sitting between two women in a subway car, one flipping the pages of a tiny Bible while the other spun a miniature globe \u2013 and there was a grim lyricism in her other setting, waiting with a friend and her mother at a bus stop in Tokyo, listening to the death throes of a cricket that had fallen from a tree to their feet."], "tags": ["Poetry", "Festivals", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-16T15:18:53Z", "title": "Poets reveal the strangest places they've 'done it'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/16/poets-strangest-places", "article": "Benjamin Zephaniah did it stuck in a lift with a drag queen, Phillis Levin in a car on the side of a mountain, Patience Agbabi 20,000 feet above sea level in a spasm of guilt about her carbon footprint, and Kenneth Steven did it in his head during a sermon in church. Poets don&apos;t need a tranquil room of their own to write, the Ledbury Poetry festival has proved, by asking this year&apos;s participants for the most unlikely physical location in which they have practised their art. On this sample they&apos;re far more likely to be inspired by being in a car than at sitting at an orderly desk or wandering among the dancing daffodils. The American poet Phillis Levin was halfway up Mount Aetna in Maryland in her Citroen, when she saw the words John F Kennedy spelled out in graffiti on the side of a mountain, and that was enough. She also found inspiration sitting between two women in a subway car, one flipping the pages of a tiny Bible while the other spun a miniature globe \u2013 and there was a grim lyricism in her other setting, waiting with a friend and her mother at a bus stop in Tokyo, listening to the death throes of a cricket that had fallen from a tree to their feet. Gez Walsh \u2013 author of The Spot on my Bum, Horrible Poems for Horrible Children \u2013 says he once wrote on during &quot;a motorway car crash&quot;, and Phillip Wells could well have caused one, when he began to write &quot;The Rock-Me Timing Bang&quot; on the steering wheel of the car he was driving, while negotiating sleeping policemen around the edge of Hampstead Heath. &quot;Thankfully the Bang did not refer to any imminent car smash, but usefully alerted me to Porlockesque waking policeman/imminent conviction issues, so I promptly stopped the car and finished writing the poem leaning against the steering wheel of my ageing black Golf.&quot; Kenneth Steven was inspired during a sermon, but had no pen or paper and therefore had to memorise his lines until he could scuttle off home, and Glyn Maxwell also composed in his head &quot;as I wandered the hills around Lumb Bank in pouring rain, in desperate flight from Arvon students&quot;. Benjamin Zephaniah recalled being &quot;stuck in a lift with a drag queen and a homophobic, claustrophobic weightlifter&quot; \u2013 so the slight, dreadlocked poet, who once attempted to be gay on political grounds but concluded he liked women too much, used the only possible recourse and began to compose a poem. The Ledbury festival has a record of bringing poets and public together in unlikely places including a midnight hillwalking poetry workshop. This year&apos;s poets include the new laureate Carol Anne Duffy, Ruth Padel, fresh from her brief but contentious time as Oxford poetry professor, Ben Okri and Roger McGough, in venues including a 1950s diner offering take-away poems.

Rogge, who also welcomed the recent compromise that will see the British football team at London 2012 composed entirely of English players, said today he would meet Blatter after the Confederations Cup in South Africa. Earlier this month, Fifa suggested changing the rules to lower the current under-23 age limit, plus three over-aged players, to under-21. But Rogge feared that would affect the quality of the Olympic football competition, prompting Blatter earlier this week to suggest yet another alternative \u2013 to allow anyone who has not featured in a World Cup to play. &quot;There will be no limit, but there will be not the best players,&quot; said Blatter. &quot;There will be, let us say, an opportunity for other players to come out.&quot; That suggestion is unlikely to find much favour with the IOC either, despite having been employed at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, as it would also dilute the quality on show. &quot;I have not heard from his mouth what exactly the proposal is,&quot; said Rogge, speaking after a meeting of the IOC executive board in Lausanne. &quot;I have a very good relationship with Mr Blatter. He&apos;s a very respected member of the IOC. I&apos;m not a frustrated man by nature, I&apos;m a problem solver. There is an issue on different interpretations of the eligibility of athletes between the IOC and Fifa and we are going to discuss this further.&quot; Rogge also welcomed the conclusion to the long-running row over the participation of a Team GB football team in the London Olympics. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs refused to supply players because they feared it would compromise their independence, but agreed to turn a blind eye to an all-English team. &quot;We are glad a solution was found because this was a process where there was a lot of uncertainty,&quot; said Rogge. &quot;We respect fully the decisions of our British friends. If they decide the home unions will be represented by England, that&apos;s fine for us. It&apos;s fine for Fifa too, so that clears the uncertainty and the problem.&quot; Ahead of a series of presentations on Wednesday from the cities bidding to host the 2016 Olympics \u2013 Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid \u2013 Rogge said they would not be judged on their commercial potential in terms of bringing in sponsorship and television revenues but on a range of other factors. It had been speculated that Chicago might have an advantage because of its ability to appeal to a prime-time TV audience in the most lucrative market and bring in sponsorship revenues during a recession. &quot;We have shown frequently in the past that we do not necessarily go for the richest city and I think we&apos;re right to do that,&quot; he said. &quot;I can speak about my criteria and I think mine are shared by the vast majority of IOC members. First of all, the games are for the athletes. They are there for a generation of athletes,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not very fond of geopolitical considerations around the games. We are there for the athletes.&quot; After each of the cities presents the details of its technical bid to the 92 of the 107 IOC members present in Lausanne, the focus will move on to the climactic IOC meeting in Copenhagen in October, when the 2016 host will be chosen."}, {"sentences": ["No-one goes for Tokyo, for all its gleaming towers, and I&apos;d have been tempted to consider S\u00e3o Paulo, as well, particularly after reading Ian McDonald&apos;s Brasyl."], "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Science fiction"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-18T11:11:26Z", "title": "Which cities are the most 'science fictional'?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/18/cities-science-fiction", "article": "London, or Reykjavik?

Looking out of my window at this moment, it&apos;s hard to see why \u2013 it&apos;s all very prosaic \u2013 but he has his reasons, and they&apos;re pretty convincing. &quot;London is a chaotic patchwork of history, architecture, style, as disorganised as any dream, and like any dream possessing an underlying logic, but one that we can&apos;t quite make sense of, though we know it&apos;s there. A shoved-together city cobbled from centuries of distinct aesthetics disrespectfully clotted in a magnificent triumph of architectural philistinism.&quot; Alright, then. Elizabeth Hand, whom I haven&apos;t read yet, but who&apos;s on my list, chooses Reykjavik, which is &quot;more like an off-world colony than any place on Earth&quot;, while Nalo Hopkinson picks her home town of Kingston, Jamaica, which every time she visits &quot;seems more and more futuristic, in that gritty, William Gibson, China Mi\u00e9ville, Blade Runner kind of way&quot;.

Not a solo artist - one man with an acoustic guitar, a line in heartfelt melancholia and, possibly, a beard - but a one-man band. Being a one-man band no longer means having cymbals strapped between your knees, a bass drum on your back, a mouth organ suspended around your neck and sleigh bells tied to your ankles. These days, one-man bands are using technology to realise their musical vision, and to take control of what they do. These new one-man bands are not novelty entertainments. But how do we define the one-man band? Adam Clitheroe, director of the documentary One Man in the Band, puts it this way: &quot;For me, it&apos;s someone willing to go and try to make the noise of a band. If you&apos;re a one-man band in your head, you&apos;re big enough to do it.&quot; The godfather of the modern one-man bands is probably Hasil Adkins, a rock&apos;n&apos;roller who claimed to have written 7,000 songs, was a forefather of the punk-rockabilly hybrid known as psychobilly, and who died in 2005. &quot;I saw Hasil Adkins, the founding father of the contemporary one-man band scene, and his rockabilly surf twang made me realise it was time to stop arsing around with other people,&quot; says Nicholls. As a child, Adkins assumed that the records he heard on the radio in rural West Virginia were all the work of one-man bands, and he never relinquished his individual approach to music - he once recorded an album of songs about chickens, entitled Poultry in Motion. But Adkins, obviously, was far from the first. There are records of multi-instrumentalists in England and France going back to the 13th century. By the 19th century, the social historian Henry Mayhew noted blind one-man bands busking on London&apos;s streets. In the following century, the one-man band was often part of a clown act, as well as being common among hillbilly communities of the sort that produced Adkins. What Adkins had that his successors share was a desire to be the centre of attention, even if there&apos;s also an element of necessity, given that few of these artists would be able to pay backing musicians. Bands just don&apos;t allow individual expression, says Johnny Halifax, who performs on his own as Honkeyfinger. &quot;The very nature of having a democratic songwriting process dilutes any ideas from individuals, and unless the warring egos create something as significant as Jagger/Richards or Lennon/McCartney, the concept has to come from the mind of one person.&quot; Where the Roland 303 gave acid house its sound, and the Roland 808 gave hip-hop its beats, the piece of technology that has done most to liberate a new army of one-man bands is the Boss Loop Station sampler. Combine that with a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection, and you&apos;ve got everything you need to make music as a band, without the hassle of bandmates, A&amp;R men, or distributors. &quot;It&apos;s amazing and revolutionary,&quot; says the Tokyo-based one-man band Merce Death. &quot;Since the Boss Loop Station sampler came on to the market seven years ago, it&apos;s opened up the scene. Before, there was only a delay pedal; this sampler allows us to create and control our own layers to play against.&quot; His setup means his improvised space-metal-jazz sets ricochet across the internet from his suburban home as he broadcasts online.  Johnny Halifax chose to become the one-man band Honkeyfinger four and a half years ago, fed up of the &quot;control-freak behaviour&quot; in bands. He, too, uses technology, but in his case it&apos;s to create new music from the roots of rock: the blues. He loops and layers lap-steel guitar, kick drum and harmonica, with his voice processed through a vocoder, while playing guitar solos on top - and it all goes through a single bass amp. Having the ability to sample and loop enables him to recreate the sound of a 60s power trio, like Cream or the Jimi Hendrix experience, without the hassles of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker spitting blood at each other, or Noel Redding wondering why he isn&apos;t the lead guitarist. But if technology has liberated some, others have chosen to remain resolutely lo-fi and insist on a purist approach to being a one-man band. Dennis Hopper Choppers, for example. &quot;I lug all the gear on and off stage and do not use any form of technology,&quot; says Nicholls. &quot;That&apos;s got to be part of the challenge, playing everything at once, all by yourself. That&apos;s what people want to see. I am a whole band - I do it without cheating. I make that much sound and it becomes part of the whole live experience watching someone create that. I think the sampler is a compromise: it lacks the true ingenuity which I deliver. It&apos;s the sound-defying logic of watching a one-man band struggle to deliver that&apos;s got to be a large part of the attraction.&quot; Thomas Truax, too, rejects electronics, preferring to invent his own instruments to provide the sounds he wants. The hornicator, for example, is made from the horn from an old gramophone, a kazoo, strings and a microphone. Something he calls Mary Poppins features two arms that fly out to provide a train-like rhythm. He travels from gig to gig by public transport, a wandering minstrel. And when he performs, it is a spectacle - the originality and seeming impossibility of what he does is much of the appeal. There&apos;s even a case to be made for human beatboxers being urban music&apos;s version of the one-man band. &quot;In another life, I would have been in a band,&quot; says Killa Kela. &quot;When I started I was going into drum&apos;n&apos;bass or a jungle clubs, and the DJ just stopped, it would go silent, and I&apos;d have to fill that - it was a bit of a circus act. Now I can deconstruct what I&apos;m doing, record it, and on my new album the song has to outweigh the concept.&quot; Kela, though, has moved on - he tours with live musicians and has just announced a new live band, but, he says, &quot;I still turn up at clubs and wait for that silence. The one-man band element is nostalgic, and the performance is intimate because it&apos;s so physical - it&apos;s come a long way from doing the Lambeth Walk with a kick drum on the back. I&apos;m still a one-man band, I like to collaborate, but there&apos;s a saying that with restriction comes creativity.&quot; Kela&apos;s journey is echoed by Amy Turnidge, whose debut album as Theoretical Girl is coming out soon on Memphis Industries. Theoretical Girl started as a one-woman project, but has expanded. &quot;I am a one-lady band, yes,&quot; she says, &quot;but I&apos;ve lately started to get a band because there&apos;s only so far you can go on your own, and outside input is good. It&apos;s a romantic feeling being on a train, alone on the road. It&apos;s freeing, but then it gets to a point when you want your friends with you and someone to share it with.&quot; Even the most committed one-man bands feel that sense of loneliness sometimes. After all, it&apos;s hard to be a rock&apos;n&apos;roller if there&apos;s no one else to indulge in rock&apos;n&apos;roll behaviour with you. As Johnny Halifax puts it, somewhat wistfully: &quot;The problem I now have is not being able to blame anyone else for smashing up the dressing room.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The head of the City watchdog told a press conference in Tokyo that banks whose collapse could threaten the whole financial system could be forced to store more cash than their smaller rivals."], "tags": ["Economic recovery", "Economics", "Economic policy", "Recession", "Bank of England", "Mervyn King", "Business", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-19T08:18:58Z", "title": "Mervyn King warns UK economic recovery will be slow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/19/mervyn-king-recession-slow-recovery", "article": "Mervyn King has warned against believing that the economy might stage a quick recovery, despite some signs that the worst of the recession is over.

It&apos;s very easy to lose confidence quickly and indeed it was lost in a very short period of time. You can&apos;t regain it quickly, so it&apos;s bound to take a lot longer to recover than it was to fall into recession, which was a very sharp fall in activity over the last six months. I don&apos;t think it would be sensible to expect activity to pick up as quickly.&quot; Economists have predicted that the UK could return to growth in the third quarter of this year, or possibly even the current quarter. But the latest economic data has undermined hopes of a V-shaped recovery. Lending to companies slumped last month, and retail spending has also fallen as shoppers cut back. Like Le Tissier taking a penalty As head of the UK&apos;s central Bank, King was closely involved in the rescue of Northern Rock and the subsequent bailout of several of Britain&apos;s largest banks \u2013 as well as setting interest rates each month. On a visit to Southampton yesterday, King compared his role in managing the financial crisis to local football legend Matthew Le Tissier taking a penalty. &quot;You and I would find it very stressful to take a penalty in those circumstances but that&apos;s his job and it was our job to deal with that,&quot; said King, who as an Aston Villa fan should be aware that Le Tissier famously failed to score only once from the penalty spot. King also reiterated comments made in his Mansion House speech in the City on Wednesday night when he set himself on a collision course with chancellor Alistair Darling by calling for the banks to be reined in. King, who believes that the Bank has not been given enough powers to prevent or manage crises, said that banks that were deemed &quot;too big to fail&quot; were too big and should be broken up. He told the newspaper: &quot;One of the lessons we&apos;ve learnt is that you can&apos;t expect a banking system to function properly if the very big banks feel like they&apos;ve got a state guarantee. So, we have got to find a way round that and one of the things I discussed was whether we can develop a resolution process, which is essentially a form of insolvency law for banks which is different from that of ordinary companies. It&apos;s important that somebody takes over the bank before it gets to the point of failure. &quot;Having an ability to wind down a very complex and big organisation that can cause problems elsewhere means that the managers of those organisations know they could be wound down. At present they can hold a gun to the authorities&apos; heads and we can&apos;t afford to have that happen.&quot; Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, weighed into the debate on how to rebuilt the financial sector this morning. The head of the City watchdog told a press conference in Tokyo that banks whose collapse could threaten the whole financial system could be forced to store more cash than their smaller rivals. &quot;We may need higher capital requirements for our largest banks, precisely to reflect the fact that if they ever do get into trouble they will be too big to fail and we will have to rescue them,&quot; said Turner. His comments appear to echo King&apos;s own concerns. Turner also said that he was happy with the &quot;general thrust&quot; of the plans for the new European banking regulator hammered out yesterday in Brussels.

He is short and slight, and wearing a truly terrible sports jacket - a check design made out of all the colours of an Easter basket, with shoulders that are somehow the opposite of padded, and seem deliberately to dip. He says hello in a shy, singsong voice that straddles three notes in two syllables - &quot;He-lo-o&quot; - and he walks like a child pretending to be an old man, or possibly the other way around, with dainty little steps. There is no charisma in his physical presence, and no heads swivel as we sit at our table - but I am more star struck than I think I have ever been in my life. I am having lunch with David Sedaris. Sedaris is the sort of writer who makes his fans feel like he is their personal Christmas present. When friends say they have never heard of him I send them copies of his books, like an excitable teenager swapping vinyl; at a recent reading in London, the audience had the fashionable look of Hoxton meets the British Library, and hung on to his words like groupies. A permanent fixture on National Public Radio in his native US, his five volumes of stories have all made the New York Times bestseller list, and sold more than 7m copies in 28 countries. So it is odd that he is so little known in this country - particularly as he lives here. Sedaris writes what he calls the comic essay; broadly autobiographical accounts of his childhood growing up in suburban North Carolina, of his years as a dropout doing odd jobs in Chicago and New York - working as an elf in a department store&apos;s Santaland, cleaning people&apos;s houses - and more recently of his life travelling the world on lecture and book tours. His material lies somewhere between that of Garrison Keillor, Bill Bryson and Armistead Maupin - observational tales of everyday strangeness, filtered through his very particular comic sensibility, which is a blend of waspish irony and gleeful delight at the absurdity of human life and himself. His latest book, When You Are Engulfed In Flames, features hitchhiking stories from his early 20s; when a middle-aged couple picked him up in a Cadillac, and &quot;drove in silence for a mile or two before the man turned in his seat and asked, as if enquiring about my health, &apos;How&apos;d you like to eat my wife&apos;s pussy?&apos;&quot; Another describes a foul-mouthed, hilariously vicious elderly neighbour in New York, Helen, who delighted in tyrannising the block, and once physically attacked a 14-year-old deaf-mute delivery boy for &quot;stealing my things&quot; - by which &quot;she meant that he had borrowed her pen&quot;. In another, Sedaris attends a murder trial, where all he can concentrate on is the defendant&apos;s mother&apos;s outfit - cut-off jeans and a Ghostbusters T-shirt. &quot;It couldn&apos;t have been easy for her, but still you had to wonder: what would she consider a dress-up occasion?&quot; In truth, though, Sedaris is not a little eccentric himself; until last year he had never looked at the internet, and typed with one finger on a typewriter. &quot;I found towards the end people in other rooms in hotels would complain about the noise.&quot; My questions often elicit a curious exclamation, halfway between interest and surprise - a short, high &quot;Hmm!&quot; - the sort of noise you make when you have taken a wrong turn, and find that you are not where you expected to be. He used to write only when drunk, but has quit alcohol and drugs, and in order to give up smoking (40 a day - &quot;oh, at least&quot;), he moved to Tokyo for three months.  &quot;I always used to reach for the cigarette when the phone rang, and I figured nobody would ever call me in Tokyo. The time difference is so profound it&apos;s, like, already September in Tokyo, and I figured nobody would be able to work it out.&quot;  He and his long-term partner, Hugh Hamrick, left America 12 years ago to live in France, and now divide their time between homes in Paris, Normandy and London. Having grown up one of five children in an outwardly conventional American family - whose internal eccentricities are the subject of so many of his stories - at 52 he is still finding infinite incident and humour in everyday life. How has he contrived a life, I ask, which seems to generate so much more comic material than most people&apos;s? &quot;Oh no,&quot; he says at once. &quot;I don&apos;t think my life is more interesting than anybody else&apos;s.  I think the only difference between me and everyone else is this ... [he reaches into his inside pocket and pulls out a small notepad] I write things down. That&apos;s all.&quot; Sedaris began keeping a diary when he was 20, travelling in the US with a friend. &quot;I&apos;d been writing letters to people, but I didn&apos;t have an address for them to write back to me so I started writing to myself. And I just turned over a placemat one day and I wrote stuff on the back. And then I&apos;m pretty good at doing the exact same thing at the exact same time every day, so I did it the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. And then I thought, what am I going to do with all these placemats? So then I got a little book.&quot; Yet even though he has had a home here for the past six years, British stories never feature in his writing. The reason, he smiles, is quite simple: &quot;To me a lot of what happens here is funny because of the way that it&apos;s said, and there are certain accents I can imitate, but I can&apos;t sustain any kind of British accent.&quot; Go on, I coax. Try. &quot;Oh no,&quot; he giggles, &quot;I would be too embarrassed. I just sound like what&apos;s-his-name in Mary Poppins.&quot; For most writers that would be neither here nor there, but Sedaris has an unusual way of working. He trials all of his material by reading it aloud on lecture tours, making coded notes of the audience response, then editing accordingly, before committing anything to publication. &quot;I go back to the hotel and look at my notes and think: all those were the laughs I got - and this was the audience coughing. Which is like throwing skulls at you.&quot; Coughing is a bad sign? &quot;Oh yeah. Not good. I read something a couple of months ago, and you would have thought I was the featured speaker at a TB clinic.&quot; Sedaris is on tour for at least two months of the year, reading to audiences of thousands, who can pay hundreds of dollars for a ticket. It is an awfully long way from his days in Santaland - and one of the criticisms of his work is that success has taken him away from the rich seam of strangeness that a less comfortable life once enabled him to mine. If he spends half his life in business class or five-star hotels, does he worry that his material begins to wear thin? &quot;No,&quot; he says mildly, &quot;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s true. That&apos;s like if you live in New York, people will ask you where you live, and if you say you live in SoHo they&apos;ll say, well the real people live on the lower East Side. No, I think that they&apos;re all real people. And I think that the incidents of bizarre and inappropriate behaviour is pretty much equal.&quot; I wonder, though, if he deliberately seeks it out. After all, most people&apos;s instinct, if they found themselves with a cantankerous bigot like Helen for a neighbour, would be to keep well away. If he was never going to write about her, would he still have made friends just for fun?  &quot;Oh I would,&quot; he smiles slightly mischievously. &quot;Because I&apos;ve always been a fairly nervous person. I&apos;m like my mom, in that something would happen to her and she didn&apos;t write it down, but she would keep it in her mind - and then when she met someone, she would tell them that story. And then when she met someone else, she would tell it again, so she&apos;d work that story for a couple of days until something else came around. So she would use it as a kind of ice-breaker. And I&apos;m the same way. So I would have enjoyed Helen even if I didn&apos;t write, because she did one outrageous thing after another.&quot;  With Helen, he adds, he left an awful lot out &quot;because there were certain things the reader would not have forgiven her for&quot;. And with his family, he always shows them what he has written before making it public - though they have never, he says, wanted to exercise their right of veto. Only once, he says, has he regretted writing something because it hurt someone. It was a story that appeared in Esquire, when he first moved to Paris, about his French teacher, and it never occurred to him she would read it.  &quot;Everything I&apos;d written in the article was true, but I didn&apos;t mention that we really liked her. Yes, she threw chalk at her pupils, yes she stabbed a girl in the eye with a pencil and told her to wake up or go back to Korea - but she also did some really good things. Anyway, I left all that out, and I left it out because I was being lazy; it was too hard.&quot; Isn&apos;t that, I suggest, the nature of comedy? &quot;Maybe, but it doesn&apos;t have to be either or. It could have been a richer story. So I hurt someone by being lazy, and I learned a lot from that. It happened 10 years ago and I think about it pretty much every time I sit down to write.&quot; The &quot;tongue lashing&quot; he received from her colleagues did make him laugh, though. &quot;They said if that was your teacher, and she was really throwing chalk at people, why would you not switch classes? And I thought, if you&apos;re a writer, and that&apos;s your teacher - are you crazy? That&apos;s gold! If someone&apos;s being nice to you, you can&apos;t do anything with it!&quot; More serious doubts have been cast over the veracity of his work, however. Two years ago, a writer called Alex Heard wrote an article in the New Republic magazine accusing Sedaris of embellishing the truth to the point where his claim to be a non-fiction writer was essentially fraudulent. &quot;But I&apos;m a humorist. I&apos;m not a reporter, I never pretended to be a reporter. I&apos;ve always been very upfront about the way I write, and I&apos;ve always used the tools humorists use, such as exaggeration. And then, all of a sudden, for someone to say he&apos;s using those tools - it just seemed silly to me. &quot;I went to a nudist colony, and so Heard called the colony and said he wrote about you and said you were all freaks, and the woman - who was completely naked - said no, we&apos;re just like everyone else. But actually - if she was honestly like everybody else - she would have had her clothes on.&quot; But if Sedaris isn&apos;t claiming to write memoir, the charge is that he should call his work fiction. He smiles, and sighs. &quot;You know, if you tell a funny story at the dinner table in front of 10 people, nine of them will laugh, and one of them will say that&apos;s not true. Now, I never say that to people. I&apos;m never the &apos;that&apos;s not true&apos; guy when someone tells a funny story. And I don&apos;t like the &apos;that&apos;s not true&apos; guy. I&apos;ve always hated that person. And all of a sudden those people are like the arbiters; in America, that&apos;s who we&apos;re hearing from.&quot;  Sedaris has been a regular contributor to the New Yorker for many years, and his relationship with the magazine&apos;s famously pedantic fact-checkers has not, unsurprisingly, always been an easy one.  &quot;I had a story in the New Yorker a couple of months ago about going to Costco with my brother-in-law and buying a box of condoms to give away as gifts on my book tour, and I wrote that the box was the size of a cinder block. So I dealt with the fact-checker, he called Costco and said do you actually sell these condoms? Yes. Now was the box of condoms actually the size of a cinder block? No. But when it&apos;s the only thing in your cart, and you&apos;re in a hypermarket surrounded by straight families, it feels like it&apos;s huge.  &quot;Now, as a humour writer, I reserve the right to say it was the size of a cinder block. If I tell you it was the size of a cinder block you will laugh. If I give you the exact dimensions of the box you will not laugh. Right? But I&apos;m not going to call it fiction because it was not the size of a cinder block. Fact-checkers,&quot; he says sadly, &quot;have no sense of humour whatsoever.&quot;  I have one last question as we get up to leave. You have got to talk me through your jacket, I say. He bursts into peals of delighted laughter. &quot;I loved how you put that!&quot; Then, as he is still laughing, he makes me happier than I can possibly say. He gets out his notepad, and writes it down. \u2022 When You Are Engulfed In Flames, by David Sedaris, is published by Little Brown at \u00a311.99.

Virgin Atlantic picked up the Grand Prix for radio for a bizarre campaign, called Plain Insanity, promoting fare deals from South Africa to London. The campaign, by South African agency Network BBDO Johannesburg, promoted Virgin Atlantic&apos;s Upper Class travel, stating that travellers could fly first class for business class prices.

A Japanese campaign that made sending a Kit Kat-shaped postcard wishing students good luck ahead of exams a must has taken the top prize in the media category at the Cannes Lions festival. The campaign, developed by WPP-owned agency JWT Japan Tokyo, beat competition including Channel 4&apos;s ground-breaking live sky dive for Honda developed by Starcom Mediavest. Honda&apos;s campaign, which saw a team of skydivers leap out of a plane over Madrid to make shapes to promote the Accord model, managed to win a silver lion in the media category. The Grand Prix winning campaign, called Kit Kat Mail, built on a previous ad campaign in Japan that positioned the Nestl\u00e9 chocolate bar as a good luck charm for those sitting school entrance exams. In Japanese the word Kit Kat sounds a lot like &quot;kitto katsu&quot; or &quot;surely win&quot;. Ad agency JWT Tokyo developed a special Kit Kat package that can be mailed like a postcard and was sold through the postal service, Japan Post, to allow friends and family to send good luck messages to students sitting exams. Kit Kat became available in 20,000 Japan Post outlets \u2013 with no competition from rival brands \u2013 with PR coverage from the initiative estimated to be worth $11m. UK ad agency Leo Burnett won a bronze lion in Cannes in the radio category for an anti-drink-driving campaign for the Department for Transport. In the media category, the highest-ranking UK entrant was AEG Electrolux&apos;s &quot;The world is noisy enough&quot; for its washing machine range. The campaign, which won a gold lion, was by Publicis Groupe&apos;s ZenithOptimedia&apos;s international division. On Monday Virgin Atlantic took a plane packed with media and celebrities, including England cricketer Kevin Pietersen, to New York to celebrate the airline&apos;s inaugural flight 25 years ago. The flight, called Birthday Girl, was preceded by a PR stunt featuring Branson on the wing of a Virgin plane at Heathrow with a red dress-wearing Kate Moss in his arms. Passengers on the flight were treated to &quot;specially themed music and meals with an 80s twist&quot; and watched spoof disaster movie Airplane, also shown on the first Virgin Atlantic flight 25 years ago. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Nick is also deceiving his employers. On his arrival in Japan eight years ago he obtained what he expected to be a temporary job teaching English by claiming he had a degree from Oxford University. He backed up the claim with a false degree certificate obtained in Bangkok. In reality Nick has one A level and no degree. He fabricated a university career because he felt that it would dramatically increase his chances of employment. He was right and Nick has no plans to return to the UK. Backed by his bogus qualification he is now, after eight years, the longest serving foreign teacher in his school. Yet he admits it can be hard to live the lie. &quot;Several years ago the school hand-picked me to accompany a group of students to Oxford on the basis that I knew the city well because I had spent three years studying there. In reality I had been there once for the weekend to visit some friends. Yet I had to maintain the charade: to come clean now would be unthinkable,&quot; he says. Getting a job can be highly stressful and candidates feel pressure to enhance their achievements to present themselves in the most favourable light. In their book Deception in Selection, Liz Walley and Mike Smith suggest that, in such circumstances, people are pushed to deception in the belief that &quot;everyone else is doing it&quot;. Certainly lying on CVs is on the increase. Surveys suggest as many as a quarter of job seekers deviate from the truth on their CV. The common distortions include bogus or exaggerated qualifications, changing the dates of employment to hide career gaps and exaggerating the pay received in a previous job. Every job-hunter faces the challenge of presenting their qualifications and past experience with as positive a gloss as possible. So just where does harmless exaggeration end and outright deception begin? It is a difficult question to answer, just as it is hard to define what are company perks and what is simple theft. While exaggeration is widespread and generally accepted, it is unwise to resort to outright lies. This is not merely moral advice, it is also expedient. Outright lies such as qualifications or invented jobs will work against you. At best, the cost of lying to future employers is the embarrassment of being found out. At worst, it can cost you the job. Under the terms of the contract of employment, prospective employees are required to tell the truth. A CV acts as a personal history form and if a job offer is made on the basis of information contained in a CV that the employer believes to be correct, then the employer is legally entitled to withdraw the job offer if they discover the CV contains false information. Take the example of a young man recently employed by a major household goods manufacturing company, who discovered this the hard way. He joined the company claiming his previous salary to be 25% higher than it actually was. Yet when the payroll system processed the tax details from his former employer the deceit was uncovered. Four hours after arriving at his desk he was marched from the building. In Deception in Selection, Walley and Smith put forward the theory that job candidates often fabricate an element of their CV in the belief that it will only be a short-term measure. Yet, if not discovered early on, they find it hard to turn back the clock and escape their deception."}, {"sentences": ["The 1995 nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult gave rise to Haruki Murakami&apos;s first non-fiction work, Underground, and now the novelist has admitted that they also inspired his new novel 1Q84.", "He fled after killing eight people, the biggest number, in the Tokyo subway attack."], "tags": ["Haruki Murakami", "Fiction", "George Orwell", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-26T12:25:16Z", "title": "Murakami reveals Orwell and Aum as twin inspirations for new novel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/26/murakami-orwell-aum-novel", "article": "The 1995 nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo cult gave rise to Haruki Murakami&apos;s first non-fiction work, Underground, and now the novelist has admitted that they also inspired his new novel 1Q84. The book was published in Japan last month to huge anticipation \u2013 Murakami had refused to reveal the plot after leaked details about his 2002 novel Kafka on the Shore were said to have spoiled its impact. Speculation had suggested that the title revealed an Orwellian influence \u2013 the letter Q is a homonym for the number nine in Japanese, pronounced &quot;kyuu&quot;; other rumours claimed it was a tribute to the Chinese writer Lu Xun&apos;s novella The True Story of Ah Q. Murakami has now admitted that he had &quot;long wanted to write a near-past novel similar to George Orwell&apos;s futuristic novel 1984&quot; and that this was one of the inspirations for the book. Another was the series of interviews with Aum victims which he conducted following the 1995 gas attacks, and published as Underground. &quot;My indignation against the incident remains undiminished. But my interest was piqued by Yasuo Hayashi, who is on death row. He fled after killing eight people, the biggest number, in the Tokyo subway attack. Hayashi joined Aum without knowing exactly what he was getting into and committed murder after being brainwashed,&quot; Murakami told Japanese paper the Yomiuri Shimbun. &quot;I think capital punishment is the reasonable decision when we consider Japan&apos;s penalty system and bereaved families&apos; anger and sorrow. But I fundamentally oppose capital punishment, and I felt a heavy sense of gloom when the death sentence was given. At that time I imagined the terror of being left alone on the other side of the moon where a Joe Blow unwittingly commits a felonious crime and ends up becoming a death row convict. I considered for years the meaning of this. This served as a starting point for my story.&quot; The two-part 1Q84 follows the story of a school teacher who has dreams of becoming a novelist, Tengo, and a single woman, Aomame, who works for a gym. Their lives are told in the third person in alternating chapters, as they search for each other aged 30 after parting at the age of 10. Running to 1,000-odd pages, the book also deals with cults \u2013 Tengo becomes fascinated by a girl who has escaped from a cult \u2013 rape and domestic violence. It proved an instant bestseller in Japan when it was published at the end of May, but there is no word yet about when an English translation will be forthcoming. Murakami said it took him two years to write the novel, after he started it during a stay in Hawaii in autumn 2006. At that point, he had only two thoughts in his mind: that the book would be about a man and woman searching for each other, and that he&apos;d make &quot;this simple story as long and complicated as possible&quot;. &quot;In my case, if I start out by thinking about the plot, things don&apos;t go well. Small points, such as my impression of what is likely to occur, do come to mind, but I let the rest of the story take its own course. I don&apos;t want to spend as long as two years writing a story whose plot I already know,&quot; he said. He&apos;d also wanted to &quot;delve deeper into how women feel or think&quot; in this latest novel, and admitted that violence and sex had &quot;become more important issues&quot; for him over his 30-year writing career. &quot;These two elements can be described as important doors for entering deep inside the human soul,&quot; he said. &quot;Peeling away human skin, chopping off a cat&apos;s head ... This latest novel doesn&apos;t have such cruel descriptions in it, but there are a considerable number of sex-related scenes. This may be a real turn-off for some people, but it&apos;s necessary in this story.&quot; Although 1Q84 has already sold almost 1.5m copies in Japan, Murakami said that &quot;what counts isn&apos;t the number of copies a book sells but how the novelist&apos;s messages can reach the readers&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Eric Martinot, a senior research director with the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo, and a former environment specialist at the World Bank, told the Huffington Post, an online newspaper, that the French manoeuvres should be resisted."], "tags": ["Business", "Nuclear power", "Renewable energy", "France", "Egypt", "Germany", "US news", "Environment", "Europe", "Africa"], "publicationDate": "2009-06-28T13:52:09Z", "title": "Nuclear industry accused of hijacking clean energy forum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/28/nuclear-industry-global-body-plans", "article": "The nuclear power industry has been accused of trying to muscle in on plans to establish a global body to represent the renewable energy industry at a key meeting in Egypt tomorrow. France \u2013 a major user and exporter of nuclear technologies \u2013 is accused by critics of trying to win the top job inside the renewable organisation so it can move the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) towards being a promoter of &quot;low-carbon&quot; technologies \u2013 including atomic power. The talks in Sharm el-Sheikh are already threatening to become a major standoff between Germany and the United Arab Emirates over which country should win the right to have the headquarters of Irena based in its country. France, which recently signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with the UAE, is supporting Abu Dhabi. It also wants one of its own civil servants, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Peloss, to be given the top role. Britain, which only signed up for membership on Friday, has given no indication whether it plans to cast its vote in favour of Bonn or Abu Dhabi, while the US is expected to join Irena in Egypt and then lend its support to Germany. Karsten Sach, an official in the German environment ministry with responsibility for Irena, said he was &quot;very optimistic&quot; that his country would be chosen but he refused to be drawn on the competition with Abu Dhabi or the role of France. &quot;I think we have an excellent offer in terms of experience, policy frameworks and vibrant research but we are not campaigning against any other offer,&quot; he argued. Bonn is considered by many to be the more obvious location because the renewables agency was the brainchild of the Germans, who have led the way in the clean technology sector through its determined championing of solar power. The promoters of Bonn are also suggesting that the Danish renewables policy expert Hans J\u00f8rgen Koch should be chosen as director general. But Abu Dhabi, in the UAE, is pushing its claims to host Irena by emphasising its new commitment to clean technology through the construction of the hugely ambitious, low-carbon Masdar City project. It is also arguing that a developing country rather than the west is better placed to pursue the vital north-south dialogue needed to beat global warming. At previous planning meetings for Irena, the French have talked about &quot;low-carbon&quot; technologies, encouraging speculation about its ultimate motives. Eric Martinot, a senior research director with the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo, and a former environment specialist at the World Bank, told the Huffington Post, an online newspaper, that the French manoeuvres should be resisted. &quot;An Irena located in Abu Dhabi under such circumstances would be &apos;nuclear tainted&apos; because the negotiating process used to select a host country would be based on support for nuclear power,&quot; said Martinot. &quot;Are the original goals of Irena being co-opted so that renewables become a mere appendage to a nuclear agenda? &apos;Sprinkling some renewables on top of our nuclear power&apos;?&quot; he asked. More than 100 countries have signed up to the new organisation, although the US and China have yet to do so. Sach said he was hopeful that the US might join in Egypt and that China would eventually come on board. The renewable agency will have a mandate to disseminate knowledge, develop regulatory framework and to actively promote the widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies around the world. It comes ahead of vital new talks in Copenhagen at the end of this year about how to tackle global warming and amid excitement that the US and China are finally starting to play more constructive roles compared with the past."}, {"sentences": ["If you pass an interesting game advert, find yourself outside Sega&apos;s HQ in Tokyo, or bump into Miyamoto in Lidl, take a snap and email it to us with the subject header &apos;Best Of Photo!&apos; at gamesblog + at + googlemail + com."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2009-06-29T20:03:40Z", "title": "Best of Chatterbox: June 15 - 26", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/29/chatterbox-blogpost", "article": "&quot;Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of its own self-congratulatory apocalypse, Chatterbox Best of returns.&quot; So says Imperfect Rex who&apos;s manning this concise return for the weekly Chatterbox round-up.

June 21-26: Office Pest Hot loving at Ascot, women&apos;s beach volleyball and zombie slaying... After the usual Monday morning &apos;what games we all played on the weekend&apos; discussions, BarryEans told us about his trip to Royal Ascot:  &quot;Brilliant. Saw a drunk guy so at home on the grass verge that he&apos;d taken his shoes off for that extra bit of comfort whilst he slept. Highlights included him waking up, vomiting, passing out again and then rolling over into his own vomit and his wife finding him after five hours. Also saw a couple enjoying each others company a little bit too much, in plain view of anyone leaving or queuing up for the toilet.&quot;  They didn&apos;t show that on the BBC2 coverage. Then CunningStunt threw us a question:  &quot;@SW19 \u2013 My friends were talking about trying to get into centre court on Saturday. Apparently you have to camp there overnight to get tickets AND then you have to pay \u00a358. They were going on about it for ages and were really excited and impressed by the cost. Would anyone else do this just to see a tennis match? Seems like far too much effort and money to me.&quot;  Mostly the answer was\u2026 No. This led to various lists of sports that people would never pay to see (thanks for that you lot) and CunningStunt&apos;s classy comment:  &quot;The only sport I would possibly pay money to see would be snooker. And maybe womens beach volleyball...&quot;  Apparently we all need to speak to smellavision as he is guaranteed tickets for the beach volleyball at the 2012 Olympics. Gamesblog day out anyone? In terms of games, there was some hint-swapping on Demons Souls between CBPodge and davefalse; zombie-slaying action being organised by the Left4Dead crew and moans over changes to Killzone 2 (people being killed immediately after spawning). Whingers. The joys of Home and dodgy soft rock Highlights of Tuesday included CunningStunt&apos;s baiting of chubster2010 over Home leading to chubster2010 stating that:  &quot;Home is good. Fact.&quot;   For something that&apos;s free, Home evokes a fair bit of bitterness! Loading times and realism of the avatars were criticised. Matt123&apos;s comment summed up the general feeling quite nicely though:  &quot;I don&apos;t mind Home, it would be better if there was some point to it though.&quot;  For some reason in the early afternoon, Crispycrumb decided to start singing Whitesnake&apos;s &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. Piratejuice then joined in:  &quot;I&apos;ve made up my miiiiiiiiinnnddNo more wasting my tiiiiimmmmmmeee(cue slide to knees and clench of fist)&quot;  Does it say a lot that I know he got the second line wrong? The blog then sank into dodgy soft metal discussions, with comments such as:  &quot;Jon Lord. Now there was a man who could play a huge bank of keyboards and still look tough and heavy metal!&quot;   &quot;John Lord. Saw him play with Deep Purple a few years back - he was awesome, but looked a bit like he needed some oxygen and a face mask by the end.&quot;   &quot;I actually saw them at Wacken in 2006 and almost hung myself because I could sing along to so many of their songs.&quot;   &quot;My ex-girlfriend&apos;s mum (tenuous relationship, I know) dated David Coverdale for a bit. Apparently &apos;he wasn&apos;t much of a looker back then&apos;. Going on the basis of the recent photo in Metro, that paints a pretty scary picture. And before you start, no, the said ex did not in any way resemble him.&quot;  The day was roundly topped off with discussions of: Iain M Banks&apos; work and that of various other authors; Left4Dead arrangements for that night; and where the next Gamesblog meetup should be. We got as far as deciding on some place called London. Anyone heard of it? Wednesday of woe Wednesday morning started with tales of woe from Shadowmind who was grieving over his PSN connectivity issues. This led to LostandFound asking the blog for advice on his broken PS3:  &quot;I got a UK PS3 off eBay a few months back and have been using it over in the Hague, last night after unplugging it and then plugging it again, it now doesn&apos;t power up. At all. Advice and guidance would be appreciated.&quot;  As you can probably imagine, this elicited some really helpful responses: CunningStunt: &quot;I&apos;d say you&apos;re screwed.&quot; and\u2026 &quot;Use it as a door stop?&quot; Sheep2: &quot;\u2026a gentle shake (think mildly brain damaged baby) may help.&quot; Limni: &quot;When my old VCR stopped working I would take it apart, blow all the dust out and put it back together, that usually worked.&quot; CunningStunt again: &quot;Have you tried a hammer?&quot; Sheep2 again: &quot;Is the socket switched on?&quot; BeardOfBees: &quot;Should&apos;ve bought an Xbox, much more reliable.&quot; The frightening thing was that CunningStunt was probably closest with his &apos;screwed&apos; comment, by the sound of things. Otherwise we talked about: how tiring cycling to work is (Lazybones was even glad that his wheel was stolen on Tuesday, as it meant he didn&apos;t have to ride home); whether all games will eventually be downloaded; whether tattoos are cool or not; and which game-related tattoos you would have if you were brave/sad enough. Catflaps and baby advice CraggyIsland got us going early on Thursday talking about his new electronic cat flap thingy. Much hilarity ensued: CunningStunt: &quot;Parents&apos; neighbours has one of them. The cat sits next to the door and lets his mates in.&quot; Then, after enough cat-based double entendre to make Mrs Slocombe blush, we were all glad to hear that LostandFound&apos;s PS3 started working after he replaced the cable. We had some further good news early afternoon regarding salubriousone&apos;s new baby boy \u2013 congrats fella! As the blog had clearly been feeling helpful over the last few days, we had more great snippets of advice:  &quot;Congrats on the wee&apos;un. Salubrioustwo?&quot;&quot;Inducing sleep in a baby? A bit of gin works wonders.&quot;&quot;Just remember, don&apos;t press the holes on his head.&quot;  I was going to write the names of the people next to the comment, but it turned out they were all from that ever helpful blogger CunningStunt!  We wiled away the afternoon with the usual Killzone 2 talk, whether CunningStunt&apos;s missus calling him a &apos;man-whore&apos; was a good or bad thing, and what words are best for describing something as good. Those being ace, skill, lush, awesome, bostin&apos;, quality, wicked, top, cracking, geil and bad (while snapping your fingers). Tragic loss and world&apos;s worst jobs Friday was filled with melancholy, what with the loss of Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett. The blog was understandably upset and most of the morning was taken up with people expressing their sadness and despair. Later we got to talking about peoples&apos; worst jobs. A few examples were: Limni&apos;s cutting Chinese Leaf in a field; SuperSmashIn&apos;s stapling receipts to invoices for eight hours a day; BeCool&apos;s Motorway service station caf\u00e9; cameroon95&apos;s popular toy shop chain in the bike section; and Cmidrfti&apos;s crisp round. This went on and on with tales of increasingly disgusting jobs that people once had. For full details, see Chatterbox Friday. That about wrapped it up for the week. Good times. Quote of the week &quot;My friend was telling me about a guy he went to school with. Apparently his Gran walked in on him with a struggling cat on his lap and only wearing a t-shirt.&quot;CunningStunt, were you that &apos;guy&apos;? Or, indeed, that &apos;cat&apos;? Other Quotes &quot;Weird weekend, power cut almost all day yesterday. It was like living in fecking Victorian times. I had to read stuff for entertainment. Shocking.&quot;Poor foolsgold74 \u2013 &apos;tis a tragic tale. &quot;You know we haven&apos;t shot zombies together since Wednesday. That&apos;s like forever!&quot;CunningStunt misses Automatic and her crackshot zombie killing skills. &quot;I like both kinds of music, Hip and Hop.&quot;We know that Limni is trying to be funny, but unfortunately he succeeded here. &quot;Hello, my name is Beard of Bees, and I am confused by European spirit measures...&quot;BeardOfBees realises that his IKEA booze measurer is getting him far too drunk, far too quickly.Everything else Also discussed: Did OJ really do it?

Photography and cycling: Umbria Northern Umbria is a very untouristy part of Italy, a bonus for language learners as locals are unlikely to revert to English when you chat, and because they have more time to do so. Guests at the Labbazia school in the Upper Tiber Valley will meet plenty of them on trips to local markets and bars in the nearby medieval villages, where they&apos;ll put into practise all they learned that day in class (three levels available).

Mandarin Live-in learning: Beijing Moving in with your teacher would have been an abhorrent notion when you were a teenager, but now it could be the best way to develop your language skills. Instead of trawling through a textbook twice a day, you can chat to your tutors from breakfast to bedtime while staying in their home on Go Learn To&apos;s &quot;home language courses&quot;. These suit all levels and give the option of staying with your teachers, couples and families around Beijing as well as informal tuition. Guests get a set of keys and are free to come and go as they please, but are usually invited to join in with their teacher&apos;s life, to meet relatives and friends, go shopping and explore the nightlife.  \u2022 Seven days from \u00a3864pp per week full board, 08445 020 445, golearnto.com. Russian Culture: St Petersburg Russia is one place where you&apos;re unlikely to pick up much of the language without some serious tuition. A course that includes 20 lessons per week in St Petersburg is a good place to start. After class, it&apos;s time to absorb the city&apos;s rich culture at its many sites.  Bi-weekly group activities include visits to the theatre and ballet and to other places such as the riverside city of Novgorod. Go in the summer and you can join in many vercherinkas - small parties with caviar, vodka and Russian folk songs. Beginners&apos; and advanced courses are available, but everyone is asked to learn the Cyrillic alphabet before arriving. \u2022 Two weeks from $2,170pp all inclusive, but excluding flights, languagesabroad.com. \u2022 Don&apos;t miss our free phrasebooks every day next week, plus Italian the week after"}, {"sentences": ["He began his career with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before moving to Tokyo and becoming a close adviser of successive governments as they battled with Japan&apos;s never-ending recession of the 1990s and early 2000s."], "tags": ["Credit crunch", "Recession", "Business", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economic policy", "Economic recovery", "Global economy", "UK news", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-04T23:01:00Z", "title": "Hail the man who argues Britain should stop worrying about its debt | Will Hutton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/05/will-hutton-recession-britain-debt", "article": "Economics is a discipline for quiet times. The profession, it turns out, may be quite good at understanding the day-to-day routines of normally functioning market economies, but it did not see the credit crunch and Great Recession coming, and even now has little idea of where we are heading. It has no grip on understanding how the abnormal grows out of the normal and what happens next, its practitioners like weather forecasters who don&apos;t understand storms. The great leaps in economic understanding have come with individual political economists struggling with the abnormal. Adam Smith wrestled with the strange new phenomenon of industrialisation in the 1770s. John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s fought to understand depressions. Milton Friedman tried to explain stagflation in the 1970s. Today, some of the world&apos;s best economists - Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, Larry Summers - are pointing to another figure who is opening up economic understanding in the same dramatic way. He is Richard Koo, chief economist of Japan&apos;s Nomura Research Institute. He too has been wrestling with the abnormal - the fallout of a credit crunch in the \u00a33tn Japanese economy. His prognosis is alarming. The Americans, British and especially the mainland Europeans are far too complacent. We simply don&apos;t understand what happens to firms and economies after a credit crunch.  We are anticipating green shoots and sustained recovery far too early. Indeed, unless western governments spend and borrow beyond anybody&apos;s current imagining, the risk is that the west - and Britain with it - could still topple into a 1930s-style depression. David Cameron&apos;s Tories insist Britain has to reduce its budget deficit fast - just like German fiscal conservatives - but they are basing their judgments on fair-weather times and fair-weather economics. What we are living through is so abnormal it requires abnormal responses. Koo&apos;s thinking is informed by witnessing at first hand Japan&apos;s credit crunch and post- credit-crunch recession. A diminutive and neat figure, he talks with the quiet conviction of an economist who has developed a model of the world that works. He began his career with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before moving to Tokyo and becoming a close adviser of successive governments as they battled with Japan&apos;s never-ending recession of the 1990s and early 2000s. The market fundamentalist Americans lectured the Japanese on the necessity of tackling their structural problems - overstretched banks, commitment to lifelong employment, too much government influence over the economy, etc, etc. All were wrong - and completely missed the drama that was going on before everyone&apos;s eyes if they had the wit to see it. Koo observed that Japanese firms in the 1990s and early 2000s had changed from profit maximisers to debt minimisers. Between 1970 and the early 1990s during the long yang (&quot;sun&quot; or &quot;light&quot;) upswing, they had steadily built up their debts to finance investment and growth; from the early 1990s on they used every spare yen to pay these off. Even as interest rates fell to zero and firms seemed to have profitable opportunities for growth, they would still pay off their debts rather than invest. Japan&apos;s $15tn collapse in asset and share prices - equivalent to three years&apos; GDP - traumatised them, because it meant that their grossly devalued assets no longer matched their liabilities. To restore their balance sheets to health they had to reduce their debts. Demand from Japan&apos;s corporate sector dropped by 20%. Economies move in long upward and downward cycles, and in the yin (&quot;moon&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;) downswing, firms&apos; behaviour changes so completely that the impact of interest rates and fiscal policy changes completely as well. Monetary policy loses its traction. There is no demand for money at any interest rate, because firms in the yin phase are debt minimisers.  Japan is criticised widely for allowing its national debt to rise to 180% of GDP after year after year of high budget deficits. Koo&apos;s reply is that, given the scale of the shock, without government deficits Japan would have experienced a 1930s-style US depression. Indeed, in The Holy Grail of Macro Economics (2008), he explains the Great Depression as a result of US companies becoming debt minimisers in the wake of a property crash and banking collapse that was not compensated by sufficiently large increases in federal spending and borrowing. Koo&apos;s &quot;super Keynesianism&quot; applies in the downward yin phases of the cycle; he is much more orthodox on yang phases. Don&apos;t worry about debt-rating agencies marking down high-spending governments&apos; debts, he says; investors will buy public debt in yin phases - just as they will Britain&apos;s or the US&apos;s.  In Britain it is plain that a large number of companies are moving from being profit maximisers to debt minimisers. We have suffered a value collapse approaching \u00a32tn - equivalent to 18 months&apos; GDP. Less than Japan, but still traumatising. Companies may be less indebted than Japan&apos;s in the 1990s, but by British standards debt is high. Lending to companies fell in both April and May. Part of the problem is that loans are astonishingly expensive because of Britain&apos;s monopolistic, risk-averse banks charging the highest margins and fees in the G7. The result is that companies are repaying debt and not investing. As in Japan, low interest rates are having little traction. The pound&apos;s huge devaluation and starting with low levels of public debt means that we are better placed than others. Yet, looking around the North Atlantic economy, it is clear that debt minimisation strategies are becoming commonplace. This is the story in the US and in Germany. Indeed, as Paul Krugman argued in my interview with him last month, Germany could become &quot;Nipponised&quot;, relying on exporting its problems to the rest of Europe. Even if Koo is only partly right, the economic debate in Britain and beyond is out to lunch. The consensus is to assail Gordon Brown for dishonesty and political disingenuity for still arguing that the state can maintain spending and borrowing despite a budget deficit this year of \u00a3175bn; leader-writers across the political spectrum congratulate themselves for their economic literacy in damning him for not saying where and what he is going to cut. A more telling criticism is that he is not spelling out how serious the situation is - and has lost his nerve over the radicalism that will still be needed to get through. Obviously Britain cannot run deficits of 12% of GDP indefinitely - but cutting them aggressively in a world of debt minimisers will prompt a depression. The correct policy is three-pronged. The government must spend and borrow radically until the downward phase stabilises - but in such a way that spending commitments can then be radically reduced in stabler times. New banks need to be created and old banks broken up to deliver more competition, more credit flows to business and less systemic risk.  This is the yin leg of the cycle. It needs yin responses. Tough talk about deficit reduction must wait until calmer times."}, {"sentences": ["Let&apos;s face it, we all know it&apos;s not going to happen.&quot; Three suggestions for 2013 1) Play two games in Asia (Tokyo, Hong Kong or Singapore) on the way out to Australia."], "tags": ["Lions Tour 2009", "South Africa rugby team", "Rugby union", "Sport", "British & Irish Lions"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-05T10:35:32Z", "title": "My Lions tour highlights | Robert Kitson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jul/05/my-lions-tour-highlights", "article": "Best match The second Test at Loftus Versfeld was one of the classic Lions encounters.

Squarepusher has flown in to headline the illustrious Taico Club, which limits its capacity to 7,000, even though it could sell twice as many tickets and still have no trouble accommodating the extra fans at the Yabuhara ski resort where it takes place. Not that being the biggest is the focus here \u2013 Taico Club is more about getting the sense of harmony just right. Packing the place out would only undermine people&apos;s appreciation of the stunning location. And what a location. As the sun rises, snow-capped mountains appear dramatically through the early morning mist. The music of Squarepusher \u2013 tonight performing with a drum/bass/cacophonous laptop set-up \u2013 is a truly surreal soundtrack to these scenes.

UK festival-goers might consider Taico Club&apos;s location as a great spot for tripping on mushrooms, but apart from alcohol the only highs here are those provided by the environment. Judging by the relentlessly playful nature of the crowd, it&apos;s all the buzz they need. This year saw Squarepusher&apos;s label Warp celebrate its 20th anniversary, and Taico Club perfectly captures their frontier-pushing attitude towards music. While Summer Sonic and Fuji Rock, Japan&apos;s Reading and Glastonbury counterparts are hoping for bonanza years, the former celebrating its tenth anniversary and the latter set to right the wrongs of last year&apos;s fiasco where Primal Scream ended up headlining two nights in a row, the real innovation remains with smaller boutique events like Taico and Greenroom.

The pavilion, designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of Tokyo-based architecture firm SANAA, has been described as a reflective cloud or a floating pool of water; it was just that today, holding a torrent of water and showing a shimmering vision of towering black clouds about to release the next flood. &quot;The reality is more beautiful than I imagined it,&quot; Sejima said, looking up as the roof reflected muddy dogs and dripping horses and riders peering in curiously as they passed by. The Serpentine&apos;s annual temporary pavilion has become a fixture in the art calendar: the only criterion is that the architects must never have completed a building in the UK before. The first was created by Zaha Hadid in 2000, and the rules are now unbreakable. Whether obscure or mega-famous \u2013 the tumble of giant Jenga blocks installed last year by Frank Gehry became one of the most popular art installations in the world \u2013 the architects always design a playground for balmy summer days and mild blue evenings, and then it always pours. The ramp wrapped around the previous year&apos;s copper pyramid by Olafur Eliasson and Kjetil Thorsen became a spiral waterfall, against which joggers in the park pitted themselves for extra exercise. There is no budget and no public subsidy for the pavilion. The gallery&apos;s directors think of a name, phone and ask the architects, who then have a hectic six months not only to design and build the structure, but to raise the money to pay for it, both in sponsorship and sponsorship in kind. This year&apos;s backers include the posh estate agents Knight Frank, who will offset some of the cost by auctioning the pavilion when it closes in October; Perspex, whose plastic panels will partly shelter the shivering visitor; and Ainscough Crane Hire, who proclaim their pride &quot;in providing the lifting solutions&quot;. Come rain or shine the public will embrace the new free space, which will have a cafe by day and a wide range of art, music and film events by night. Every summer the gallery staff watch visitors picnicking determinedly in an architectural masterpiece providing ample inspiration \u2013 but very little shelter. \u2022 The Serpentine Gallery pavilion is open to the public from Sunday until 18 October."}, {"sentences": ["Other well-known Sanaa works include the Christian Dior store, situated in Tokyo&apos;s most fashionable street."], "tags": ["Serpentine pavilion", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-08T20:30:00Z", "title": "Sanaa's summer pavilion brings sunshine to the Serpentine | Jonathan Glancey", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/08/sanaa-summer-pavilion-serpentine", "article": "It is a chilly, grey, wet morning at the Serpentine Gallery, but it doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;m sheltering under its summer pavilion, a delightful structure that&apos;s really more umbrella than building \u2013 or parasol, of course, when the sun comes back out. Meandering happily between the trees in the Serpentine&apos;s grounds at Kensington Gardens, it is the architectural equivalent of a stroll in the park. Made of enormous sheets of aluminium polished to a mirror finish, and supported by slender stainless steel columns, the structure makes the raindrops look quite beautiful: the ceiling reflects them as they fall, so they seem to go up to the heavens, as well as down to earth. All we need is some trippy music and the pavilion, designed by the Japanese architectural collaborative Sanaa, will be complete. This is clearly a good way to experience the structure, which was unveiled yesterday. As Ryue Nishizawa, one of Sanaa&apos;s two founding partners, says: &quot;The pavilion is designed to amplify the way things look.&quot; But, as well as playing visual tricks, the swooping roofs, rising up from the ground to the canopies of trees and back down again, also amplify incidental sound: birdsong, the clip-clopping of horses, the thrum of passing traffic. Seen from up high \u2013 from the Serpentine&apos;s roof terrace, or even from a passing aeroplane, say \u2013 the pavilion has another trick up its sleeve. It looks like a pool of water, a man-made lake perhaps, or a giant piece of jewellery, especially when sunlight gleams down on to its roof. It is easy to imagine miniature versions being sold in the Serpentine&apos;s shop. But, above all, this plaything, with all the games it plays on visitors&apos; senses, feels as if it has embraced the park. Apart from a ring of transparent screens around its auditorium, the structure is open-ended, as if delivering a warm welcome to nature, visitors and the city beyond. &quot;When we started sketching ideas,&quot; says Nishizawa, &quot;we thought of water, rainbows and leaves.&quot; This is one of the nice things about designing a summer pavilion: natural elements can be discussed without fear of embarrassment, or of being accused of green gimmicks. Sanaa&apos;s pavilion, the ninth at the Serpentine since Zaha Hadid kicked things off in 2000, will shelter the gallery&apos;s 24-hour Poetry Marathon, a whole day of poets reading their work, before being taken down and sold to a buyer with, presumably, a very big garden. With each passing year (save for 2004, when a proposal by Dutch architects MVRDV to place a mountain over the gallery proved too ambitious) the Serpentine summer pavilions have generated increasing excitement. This is because they have all been designed by feted and fashionable architects who, for all their artistry and fame, had yet to build in London \u2013 or indeed, with the exception of Frank Gehry&apos;s Maggie&apos;s Centre in Dundee, anywhere in Britain. Also, because these aren&apos;t permanent buildings, they can afford to be experimental, playful, perverse or even, as Sanaa has set out to prove this summer, ethereal. Sanaa has certainly designed some of the most extraordinarily ethereal buildings of recent years, including museums and art galleries in Japan and the US. The best known is 2007&apos;s New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York: each one of its six storeys, which all sit askew, seems like a box covered in steel mesh, apparently without windows. For the most part, daylight seeps into the galleries through skylights set into the parts that jut out. The effect is strange, as if visitors are walking through veiled space. Although some find this claustrophobic, I think it has a curiously contemplative character, as traditional Japanese buildings often do. &quot;We may be influenced by Japanese architecture subconsciously,&quot; says Kazuyo Sejima, Sanaa&apos;s other founder. &quot;But we don&apos;t think of ourselves as particularly Japanese architects.&quot; Sanaa do seem to revel in creating otherworldly buildings that appear to touch the ground lightly, or rise from it as gently as summer blooms. As Nishizawa says: &quot;When architecture falls away into the background, it can be incredibly beautiful. Sometimes, though, the background can fold into the building. Lightness sometimes translates into a feeling, certainly an atmosphere.&quot; This does seems especially true of their floating, looking-glass pavilion, which both sits in and captures its surroundings. Other well-known Sanaa works include the Christian Dior store, situated in Tokyo&apos;s most fashionable street. At first glance, the Dior store seems to be a fairly conventional steel and glass tower. Close up, though, you notice that each floor is a very different height. The effect is striking \u2013 as is the fact that silky curtains run right round every floor, so the building shimmers all day and glows at night. No less impressive is the Zollverein School of Management and Design in Essen, Germany. If transparent, translucent structures are Sanaa&apos;s trademark, the Zollverein School shows them in an entirely different mode: the building is a concrete cube cut into by a seemingly random pattern of identically sized windows. These let in daylight in a profusion of changing patterns. Even when working with concrete, imposing buildings, Sanaa manage to build in a little gentleness. Evidently, though, the Serpentine Pavilion has been the perfect commission for Sejima and Nishizawa. The structure is as light as any covered space this side of a tent. &quot;We are interested in relaxing the boundaries between inside and out,&quot; says Sejima. The pavilion should feel as gentle and contemplative as a magical woodland grove \u2013 although its inevitable popularity, coupled with the fact that it boasts a cafe, might make it hard to grab much more than a few quiet moments there. Of all the Serpentine pavilions, Sanaa&apos;s ranks as one of the best not just because it is rather beautiful, but because it attempts to be no more and no less than a canopy set between trees, albeit one made of aluminium. Some past pavilions have been, perhaps, a little too substantial. Sanaa, who are currently working on the Louvre&apos;s forthcoming outpost near Lille in northern France, are clearly on a roll. Despite the gentle and modest qualities of this parkland pavilion, it is easy, and indeed tempting, to see them growing into a substantial practice, with a stuffed order book. The pair look aghast at such an idea. &quot;There are 30 in our office,&quot; says Sejima, &quot;and this seems nice. We want to keep the work and the office very personal.&quot; By way of explanation, she adds: &quot;We begin designing with paper models and pencil drawings. Lots of them.&quot; At the Serpentine, in the lightest, most appealing way, one of these has come to life. The Summer Pavilion is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2, from 12 July-18 October.

Aso told leaders of his Liberal Democratic party he was planning to dissolve the lower house of parliament next week and hold a general election on 30 August, the prime minister&apos;s office said. Opposition parties immediately issued a no-confidence motion against the prime minister and the cabinet, although it is not expected to pass, given the Liberal Democrat dominance in the lower house. The moves came after Aso&apos;s party and its coalition partner suffered a crushing defeat in Tokyo local elections at the weekend. The Tokyo vote was seen as a sign of how Aso&apos;s party would fare against the opposition Democratic party of Japan in a general election, which must take place by October. Aso has suffered low poll ratings as Japan&apos;s economy stumbles towards deflation and political infighting has delayed the implementation of new laws. Tokyo election results showed the Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats in the Tokyo election, while their coalition partner, the New Komeito Party, gained just one, giving the coalition 61 seats. For a majority, 64 are needed. &quot;Voters are fed up with the Liberal Democratic party. Its economic and social welfare policies are all deadlocked. Voters are hoping that the Democratic party of Japan can bring change to Japanese politics,&quot; said Takayoshi Matsuo, emeritus professor of political science at Kyoto University. Since taking office in September last year, Aso has struggled to shore up sagging public support, which remains at 20%. The 68-year-old premier has been diminished by a string of political gaffes and by weak leadership. Voters are also frustrated with Aso&apos;s handling of Japan&apos;s economy, which is in the worst recession since the second world war. Newspaper opinion polls have suggested the opposition party is well placed to make major gains or even rise to power in national elections, with its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, likely to replace Aso. That would mean the end of rule by the Liberal Democratic party, which has governed Japan for all of the past 50 years except for a brief period in 1993. Prior to the Tokyo election, the Liberal Democrats held 48 seats and the New Komeito had 22, giving the coalition a comfortable majority. The Democratic Party of Japan, which has longed clashed with Aso&apos;s Liberal Democrats on major issues, gained 20 seats, increasing its share to 54. Together, parties aligned against the Liberal Democrats now hold a slight majority in Tokyo&apos;s local parliament. Aso has become so unpopular that politicians in his own party have called for his removal before the election. The Liberal Democrats currently have 303 seats in the 480-seat lower house, and its partner Komeito has 31. The Democratic party has just 112. The opposition party has promised to change what it calls Japan&apos;s bureaucrat-led politics, improving welfare measures and lowering the cost of education."}, {"sentences": ["So you&apos;d probably expect me to go with a Japanese city, but it&apos;s not Tokyo or Kyoto that I pine for on a daily basis, but Japan&apos;s often overlooked third city, Osaka.I originally went to Osaka on the recommendation of Anton Ego - the restaurant critic in Ratatouille (or rather Fran\u00e7ois Simon of Le Figaro, on whom, rumour has it, Ego was based)."], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Osaka holidays", "Japan holidays", "Food and drink", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-13T10:50:00Z", "title": "Osaka - the world's greatest food city", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/jul/13/osaka-japan-best-food-city", "article": "Simple question: what&apos;s the most greatest, most exciting, most dynamic food city in the world today, the culinary It City of our age?

This is a city entirely at ease with its culinary identity but open to foreign influences (in this case, largely Korean), with several unique dishes, and a population possessed of an admirable gluttony for life. They even have a word for their insatiable gluttony, &apos;kuidaore&apos;, meaning &apos;eat until you burst / go bust&apos;. The city has an irresistible triumvirate of highly addictive, indigenous fast foods: okonomiyaki (thick, filled pancakes, made with yam flour batter, seafood, pork and kimchi); tako yaki (octopus doughnuts); and kushikatsu (deep fried, breaded skewers - invented at the restaurant Daruma, and much loved by Ferran Adri\u00e0, so the chef there told me), each of them slathered in a sweet, savoury, mahogany-coloured sauce. And let&apos;s not forget that kaiten sushi and instant ramen noodles were both invented in the city in the same epochal year (1958 - the latter are rather better than Pot Noodles, I should add).  This is also where you&apos;ll find the world&apos;s greatest (largest, most expensive, best equipped, toughest etc) cooking school, the Tsuji Culinary Institute; and a fish and produce market to rival Tsukiji.

One of the more tedious canards involved the mobile phone. In the future, telecommunications companies assured us, the communal, cinema experience would become extinct, a thing of the past; instead, we would watch feature films on our handsets \u2013 never mind that the experience of viewing Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen on a 3.5in iPhone screen is even more disorienting and depressing than watching it in a multiplex. It fell to the Japanese, those perpetual innovators, to up-end this proposition. Instead of using cinema to bolster their already formidable mobile phone market, they&apos;ve used the latter to reinvent the former, via the keitai shosetsu, or cellphone fiction, that represents the country&apos;s most remarkable publishing success this decade. Japanese film and TV studios have been snapping up the rights to these mobile phone-written bestsellers, hastily adapting them into multi-part series for local television, and typically leaving the narrative poised on a cliffhanger \u2013 before releasing the &quot;resolution&quot; into cinemas. (Though this, in turn, might prove to be simply an intermediate chapter, directing viewers to look out for a concluding TV series \u2026 the marketing is nothing if not inventive.) Take Threads of Destiny. Based on a popular 2007 mobile phone novel by &quot;Mei&quot;, Fuji TV aired a version in early December 2008, while the venerable Shochiku studio, lifelong home to Ozu, premiered the cinema version \u2013 same actors/characters and a continuation of the plot \u2013 just before Christmas. By all accounts, the first mobile phone novel was written in 2002, by one &quot;Yoshi&quot;. For reasons of social etiquette, as much as modesty or shame, keitai shosetsu authors tend, as a rule, to be anonymous, hiding behind a tag. In this regard, however, they are no different from many Japanese women writers throughout history, from Abutsu-Ni in the 13th century, to Banana Yoshimoto today. They are usually adolescent girls, writing for readers the same age as themselves. Yoshi&apos;s Deep Love: Ayu&apos;s Story detailed the struggles of a teenage prostitute in Tokyo. A riot of imitators followed, aided by the easy user interface at telecom websites such as Maho i-Land (&quot;Magic Island&quot;, which reportedly carries in excess of a million titles. Soon the trend was a social phenomenon: in 2007, four of the five bestselling Japanese fiction releases were keitai shosetsu, as book publishers rushed to make print versions available (in its print incarnation, Deep Love has sold almost 3m copies). Still, the majority of texts continue to be disseminated in the digital mediums that spawned them, either via the internet or as incoming SMS messages. With their distinctive voice (short, declarative sentences \u2013 that 160-character limit! \u2013 with a minimum of writerly &quot;style&quot;), and melodramatic narratives (most keitai shosetsu are peppered with rapes, abortions, prostitution, drug addiction and suicide attempts), they already read like unusually lurid screenplays; actual translation to film or TV is an obvious step. But they&apos;re also bankable commercial hits, with a fervently loyal audience: Mika&apos;s 2007 novel Love Sky: A Heartbreaking Love Story has apparently been read by over 20 million Japanese, and Toho&apos;s adaptation remains one of the best-loved teen romances of the past few years. Clearness - An Eternally Pure Love Story by &quot;Towa&quot; won a literary award, and was released by Dogado Pictures in February 2008, directed by Tetsuo Shinohara. More are currently in production. A deluge, perhaps. The question is, can this movement translate to the west? Will there be a plethora of Twitter-based, Anglophone e-novels and movies coming soon? I hope not. Fascinated as I am by the social phenomenon of the keitai shosetsu, it has yet to produce an indisputably great work.

Ah, the book by Ben Dirs and Tom Fordyce which should at least see you through a couple of visits to the bathroom and save you \u00a37.19.  Spain&apos;s red wine swilling, cigar smoking Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez scored 64 yesterday to lead the Open overnight on six-under, but like many of the golfers this morning, he has dropped shots and struggled in the bracing wind. All this means that, without even swinging a club, the 59-year-old Tom Watson is leading the Open again.  A bit closer to home, Ross Fisher is on one-under after 11 holes and going well. He has vowed to drop everything and fly back to London should his wife go into labour. If this were to happen with him a couple of shots off the lead on the final day with just a few holes to go I imagine junior Fisher would be unloved.  To view the full leaderboard click here.   10.38am: A quick re-cap on what has happened this morning. Jim\u00e9nez has had a nightmare. He&apos;s +4 for the day and -2 for the tournament having found the sand on a couple of occasion and missed the ball completely trying to get out of a tight lie in a sand trap on the sixth hole. Similarly, Paul Casey, who was -2 overnight, has lost his way in the wind and is +4 today, whicxh makes him +2 for the tournament. Only one player has completed teh opening nine holes under par: Daniel Gaunt of Australia, who is -2 after 16 holes, but +4 for the championship.  10.45am: I will be sticking around for Tiger&apos;s round this afternoon. He gets underway at 2.20pm. Incidentally, I got a puncture coming into work today and spent half an hour tramping through north London with my bike. As I did I pondered animal-related sporting names like Tiger Woods. The best I could come up with was Wolfgang Wolf, a footballer who went on to manage Wolfsburg. Your suggestions please? I will keep you up to date on the the top 15 on the leaderboard shortly.

So ren Kjeldsen (again) and big, bad John Daly who is wearing a pair of trousers so grotesque that look like they&apos;ve been vomited on by a clubber who has just swallowed a glo-stick.  11.01am: Padraig Harrington has just made par at the seventh to remain +1 for the day and level-par for the tournament. We have a new leader of the Open. Japan&apos;s Kenichi Kuboya has made a birdie on the first after a brilliant approach shot got him within 12ft of the flag. That takes him to -6, one shot ahead of Tom Watson.  11.04am: Fisher has just dropped a shot on the 14th. He miscalculated the slope on the green completely and sent it scooting past the hole to the left. The wind appears to be blowing from left to right in my headphones. I&apos;ve got a feeling it&apos;s doing likewise on the back nine at Turnberry. On the front nine, they are firing straight into it.  11.08am: Ian Poulter has left his Union flag waistcoat in the locker room today and opted for a pair of pink trousers and blue jumper. There&apos;s good reson for his modesty: he&apos;s +5 for the day after eight holes (+10 for the championship) and in danger of missing the cut.  11.11am: The leader, Kuboya, has angled another fine iron-shot into the second green. The ball lands with a dull thud, hops a couple of times past the flag and gives him another birdie chance from 15ft.  11.14am: The American, Steve Marino, has just scored a fantastic eagle on the 17th. He guides a 12ft putt from right to left into the left hand side of the cup and goes joint second on -5 for the tournament.  11.17am: Kuboya misses his chance of a birdie on the second so stays -1 for the day, -6 for the championship. An email. &quot;Good morning Gregg.&quot; Good morning Neville Greener. &quot;It&apos;s great to see John Daly playing good golf and looking healthy. I wonder how many tour players drink regularly on tour and often play hung-over? I have a friend Laino Jnr, who swears playing with alcohol onboard delays his inevitable NR by three to four holes.&quot; Judging by the state of his attire, Daly that is not your mate Laino Jr, I reckon he&apos;s still drunk, never mind hungover.  11.22am: More predictions for lowest round today. Sergio Garcia, Camilo Villegas, Lee Westwood and Tiger Woods. And in response to OzzyMandias, I honestly had a puncture. Cycling through the glass-strewn streets of East London can be hazardess for bicycle tyres! And as for Rory McIlroy&apos;s round: he is +5 for the day after 10 holes and struggling in the gathering gale. That makes him +4 for the tournament and requiring a bit of magic on the back nine to get back into contention.  11.28am: Steve Marino has driven straight and true on the 18th as he attempts to join Kuboya at the top of the leaderboard.  11.33am: Ross Fisher has sunk a birdie on the 16th and now moves to -2. How much would he resent his first born if he/she decided to make an appearance in the final round? More predictions: Kenichi Kuboya, Darren Clarke, DJ Trahan and Robert Rock. Marino has just made par with ballsy 10-footer on the 18th. That keeps him in second place on-5 with Tom Watson.  11.38am: Harrington has dropped three shots coming out on the breezy front nine. He couldn&apos;t control his approach shots into the eighth and ninth and three-putted on both. Meanwhile, Kuboya is going great guns. A fantastic tee-shot has landed within birdie range of the par-three 166-yard fourth.

Sir Nick Faldo actually. He&apos;s +11 for the tournament so that&apos;s the last we&apos;ll see of him.  11.50am: &quot;Interesting that you are giving a book away written by people who are also doing a live text (admitting cricket) at this very moment on another well known website,&quot; notes James Rowe. We like to give our rivals a leg up now and then James.  11.52am: Sandy Lyle will miss the cut at +8 for the tournament. He&apos;s just spoken about his ongoing row with Colin Montgomerie. To paraphrase what he said: It&apos;s all been taken out of context. Everybody&apos;s talking. His manager&apos;s talking to my people, I&apos;m talking to his people. It was just a comment. I was walking away. We&apos;re good friends me and him etc and so on.  11.56am: Kuboya&apos;s birdied again! He&apos;s whistling in the wind. He holes his putt on the fourth to move to -7, two clear of Watson and Marino at the top of the leaderboard.  12.01pm: &quot;Re your pondering whether there are other sporting people with animal names,&quot; writes Ernst Grosskopf. &quot;There were the Dutch swimmers (twins I believe) called Mildred and Marianne Muis (Muis = mouse in Dutch). However isn&apos;t &apos;Tiger&apos; a nickname rather than a real name? There are bound to be quite a few animal nicknames in other sports.&quot; It is a nickname. His real name is Eldrick Tont, but the fact that it is what goes up on the leaderboard validates it for me. If nicknames were the case, of course there would be Eddie the Eagle among others.  12.04pm: The cut-off point for the best-round predictions has passed. I&apos;ll compile a list shortly. Meanwhile, Fisher has just finished his round with a score of 68 to put him in the hunt for the Claret Jug (barring the birth of his first child) on -3 for the championship.

He&apos;s +3 for the tournament now and needs something special to complete the hat-trick of Open titles. He taps that one in for par on the 11th. As you will have seen on the leaderboard below, Kuboya dropped a shot at the fifth.  Best round predictionsHenrik StensonSergio GarciaCamilo VillegasLee WestwoodTiger WoodsKenichi KuboyaSoren KjeldsenJohn DalyBrandon GraceDarren ClarkeDJ TrahanRobert RockMy prediction: Tiger Woods  12.19pm: One-time Open runner-up, Wayne Grady, is commentating for the BBC this week. If you&apos;re interested in why he wants to be an astronaut read our SmallTalk with him.  12.23pm: The leader on -6, Kuboya, has narrowly missed a birdie at the sixth with an uphill putt from left to right. He&apos;s done well in the wind, but that appears to be dropping somewhat now, so he could really put a score together this afternoon.  12.26pm: &quot;Oiyyyy Roughley! WHAT&apos;S THIS?&quot; screams Jason Glenister like Donald Sutherland in The Bodysnatchers. &quot;My first post of predicting Henrik Stenson as top scorer doesn&apos;t get included....typical more oppression heaped on my people by the British! I demand a tribunal to be set up for this!&quot; Blimey. No need for that Jason. I can just add it, you know? Jeez, it&apos;s only We Could Be Heroes...  12.32pm: McIlroy&apos;s ball has made a rare appearance on the fairway on the 16th hole. He hasn&apos;t handled the breeze well today, which is odd, considering his upbringing on the windswept links courses of Northern Ireland. He&apos;s still +5 for the day and +4 overall. That&apos;s likely to be around the cut off point, I think.  12.35pm: Germany&apos;s Martin Kaymer has had a cracking round. He&apos;s made par and stayed -1, which has been beyond most of the players today. Justin Rose is worth a mention too. He&apos;s just eagled the 17th with a wonderfully directed 25ft half-moon putt to get him back down to level par for the championship. He&apos;s steadily gone about his business off the radar.  12.38pm: England are at it in the cricket. Australia are just 10-2. But that&apos;s enough plugging. Back at Turnberry, the leader Kuboya, has just legged it after his second shot with a grin like a marble banana having clattered it into the wind and got it within a chip&apos;s distance of the flag on the par-five 538-yard monstrous seventh.

View the full leaderboard.  12.49pm: Kuboya has kept his name at the top of the leaderboard with a gutsy parr-putt on the seventh after making a meal of his third shot from the edge of the green. Rose three-putts on the 18th to finish the round on level par, +1 for the tournament. It&apos;s still a decent round, but I fancy that the emergence of the sunshine and bluer skies on the west coast of Scotland will suit the players setting off this afternoon.  12.54pm: &quot;Gregg, Is Vijay Singh sporting anything Stanford related, or has his PR person finally had a word with him?&quot; asks Ian Copestake. He doesn&apos;t set off till 1.31pm, but if he has an England cricketer&apos;s wife with him, then I suppose the answer is yes.  12.56pm: Jim\u00e9nez looks to have benefited from the easing up of the wind. He plays a beautifully weighted short-iron 140yards into the 16th hole. It thumps into the green and rolls off down the hill towards the flag to give the Spaniard a chance to get back in the thick of it with a birdie.  1.05pm: Goosen, who looks like a cool customer clad in black, swings leisurely at his ball on the 18th tee and sends it hurtling into the ether. It finds the fairway comfortably and gives him a good chance of improving on his tournament score of an impressive -3.  1.08pm: One of the stranger incidents today was Tomohiro Kondo&apos;s aberration at the 10th in which he lolloped one off the course onto the beach. As you can see in the picture above, he scrambled down onto the shale and whacked it back up towards the fairaway. He&apos;s currently on th 17th and +11 for the tournament.  1.12pm: I wasn&apos;t even born when Tom Watson had his &apos;Duel in the Sun&apos; with Jack Nicklaus at Turnberry, but he&apos;s teeing off with a chance of the title if he keeps it steady. I imagine that was said many times back in the 70s. His second into the first green gives him a chance of a birdie. Good on yer Tom.

He&apos;s been there bought the tee-shirt and may have the best of the weather now to mirror Greg Norman&apos;s similar feats at The Open last year. That&apos;s him joint leader once more.  1.23pm: Kuboya has just over-shot the green with his third shot at the par-four ninth. He&apos;ll have to chip in from 40ft to save par. One word: unlikely. However, Watson has found the rough with his tee-shot on the second so he may find the going tough himself.  1.26pm: &quot;Alright Gregg,&quot; says the ever-so-chipper Seun Oduwole. &quot;Following the coverage from Lagos, Nigeria. I&apos;m at work so can&apos;t watch it on the telly. I reckon its between Camillo and Tiger for the lowest score. What&apos;s the weather like in blighty. It&apos;s raining cats and dogs here.&quot; It&apos;s sunny in bonny Scotland now Seun, but similarly grey and moody in London. The weather at Turnberry will suit Camillo and Tiger. They&apos;re out on the practice range now. Tiger gets going at 2.20pm so stay logged on.  1.30pm: Watson has chipped out of the rough onto the fairway, which many of the younger golfers often and ill-advisedly choose not to do as they hack it out towards the pin. His third shot gives him a 20ft uphill putt to stay out on his own at the top, as Kuboya has dropped a clanger (well a shot actually) at the ninth. He is now -5.  1.33pm: Sergio Garcia has got it together with the putter on the first and second. He&apos;s birdied the opening hole and left his ball staring into the cup after a terrific putt over the contours of the second green. He waits 10 seconds to see if it drops and the taps it in for par. The Spaniard, who is a contender for lowest score of the day in our competition, is in the hunt on -1.  1.36pm: Watson has dropped a shot at the second. He is still the leader of the Open on -5, but shares that honour with Kuboya and Marino, the latter being the clubhouse leader having completed his round. Incidentally, Marino is playing his first ever links course this weekend. Impressive!  1.39pm: Scotland&apos;s Gary Orr has just dinked an eagle against the pin and into the hole on the par-five seventh. It was a wonderful shot from 30 yards which hopped once before finding its way into the cup. He&apos;s +2 for the tournament and, given the nature of the Beeb&apos;s TV coverage, is unlikely to feature again unless he scores a similar eagle or has a chance of lifting the Jug.  1.43pm: Kuboya sent a long-iron hurtling towards the 10th flag. It drifts to the right in the wind and lands neatly in the centre of the green. The Japanese golfer is 37, but looks like a mere whippersnapper.  1.45pm: &quot; Be acceptable!&quot; shouts Garcia as he launches one off the third fairway towards the green. One of the stranger golf shouts that one. It seems to work, mind, as it bounces and scoots along the neatly-trimmed stuff and finds ahome 20ft from the flag. He&apos;ll have that for a birdie.  1.48pm: Garcia&apos;s partner Watson, two putts tidily on the third to make par and stay joint top of the leaderboard. the 16-year-old amateur Italian Matteo Manassero is sharing the walk with them today. He&apos;s a respectable +2 and gunning for the Silver Medal.  1.51pm: &quot;I hate to be a party pooper,&quot; writes Gary Naylor who has probably emerged from his bedroom, turned the music down and confiscated the beer from a few revellers in his time, &quot;but has Tom Watson got the yips yet? We all know it&apos;s coming. Once Sergio started doing that stupid re-gripping stuff, I wrote him off as a Major winner \u2013 he&apos;s not quite as good as he thinks he is, Sergio \u2013 mind you, he&apos;d be shooting 59 every round if he were.&quot; There&apos;s no sign of the yips at all Gary. For those who may not be aware here is your explanation as to what the yips are. He has just overshot the green on the par-three third though. Nothing to do with the yips - just bad judgement. Oh, and Steve Stricker has joined the leaders on-5.

He mightn&apos;t have got the yips, but poor old Watson found the rough at the third and bogeyed; and landed in the sand at the fourth and similarly dropped a shot.  2.03pm: There won&apos;t be any updates for the next 15 minutes as I&apos;m ravenous and need to re-fuel. I&apos;ll be back for Tiger&apos;s round.  2.23pm: One tuna and mayonaaise sandwhich and a can of Coke later I return to find that Watson is back down to -4 and VJ Singh was an inch from a hole in one on the fourth. He will tap in for birdie an join Watson on -4.  2.26pm: Woods, Westwood and Ishikawa have teed off. All three find the fairway.  2.27pm: &quot;Has the young Columbian Villegas teed off yet then?&quot; asks John Quinn. &quot;I see this guy as Rory&apos;s nemesis over the next couple of years.&quot; He teed off when I had half a sandwich down my neck. He&apos;s made a tidy start and is even for the day after two holes, -4 for the tournament.  2.29pm: Watson is back down to -3 having Gary Naylored the fifth. Meanwhile, Kuboya has lost is ball on the unlucky 13th. He will have to tee off again and will drop at least two shots. Tiger has made par on the first.  2.32pm: John Daly almost holes a beautiful chip on the 18th fora birdie. He taps in and ends the day with a highly respectable level-par score for the tournament. Meanwhile in email land: &quot;Watson had a four on three according to leaderboard, not a five.&quot; Apologies Kevin Mannerings. I got a hole ahead of myself. The coverage failed to show his first bogey and I presumed he&apos;d doubled at the fourth. Must do better, must do better ...  2.37pm: On Sergio Garcia&apos;s shout of &apos;Be Acceptable!&apos; Jon Millard offers this: &quot;Strange golf shout perhaps, but is there one of us who doesn&apos;t mutter it to ourselves as we go out the door in the morning? I know I do. Perhaps that&apos;s why I&apos;m enjoying top level sport through the medium of a distant computer in a grimy day job. Perhaps Sergio will be manning a phone for a large insurance company or some such, sometime soon. With all of us in mind .&quot; Good point Mr Millard. Being acceptable is a standard. Unfortunately, meeting that standard is a struggle. And struggling is a challenge. Ad infinitum ...  2.41pm: Tiger gets a handy kick as he hoists an iron into the second green. He yelps at his ball to &quot;Bite!&quot; His ball listens and bounces to the right, to give him an outside birdie chance. Westwood and Ishikawa both land their balls within five feet of Tiger&apos;s.  2.45pm: Watson has dropped another shot at the sixth so he&apos;s back down with the group on -2, while Kuboya, who started so well, had a mare at the 12th and is back in the group on-3. Vijay Singh is one-under for the day and is now just a shot off the lead at -4.

It cuts through the breeze and romps past Tiger&apos;s ball into a brilliant position on the left of the fairway. Ishikawa does likewise and sends his ball to within 10 yards of Westwood&apos;s. Tiger&apos;s ball is some way behind his playing partners&apos; having opted for caution with his five-wood.  2.55pm: There&apos;s all kinds of movement at the top. Watson misses a 12-footer for par on the seventh and taps in for his fifth bogey of the day. He hides his disappointment behind a polite smile for the following crowd. Calcavecchia has moved into the second-placed group on-4 having birdied the 13th. He&apos;s finding the greens particularly well today.  2.58pm: Out on the third Tiger finds the left hand side of the green with his approach shot. Westwood, meanwhile, barks at the ranks of photographers following Woods and Ishikawa that won&apos;t get out of his sight-line. He eventually lofts a disappointing short-iron to the front of the green which doesn&apos;t pick up. He should still make par however. Apparently this hole is playing at 4.15 which means most players are making par on it.  3.03pm: Singh has just had a shocker with the putter on the sixth. He left himself short and failed to make par and then didn&apos;t settle on his bogey-putt and shoved it an inch past the cup. He&apos;s completely unravelled his earlier good work. He&apos;s +1 for the day and -2 for the championship.  3.06pm: Tiger hasn&apos;t birdied yet but, he looks pretty well focused as he makes his par on the third. Isjikawa and Westwood do likewise. &quot;I&apos;m at work in an office in the north-east and it&apos;s lashing down. I&apos;d still rather be here reading your coverage than perched in front of the TV listening to that smug get Lineker, though.&quot; That&apos;s very kind of you Staurt Angus. But to be honest I&apos;ve hardly seeen anything of Lineker this afternoon. He only pops up once an hour for a couple of minutes to talk really deliberately over a dull montage. He&apos;s just there on a jolly ...  3.10pm: The par-three 166-yard fourth is the next challenge for Woods, Westwood and Ishikawa. It&apos;s as though their balls are connected (disgusting imagery, I know!) as each lands with in a yard of the others&apos; in the centre on the green. Eee! I can&apos;t get that image out of my head. I&apos;ll update the leaderboard now - that&apos;ll be dull enough to clear my mind.

Tiger has threatened to score a birdie at all four holes and missed by inches. The next five holes are the toughest on the course today so this will test the threesome, particularly 17-year-old Ishikawa. Out on the 14th the rotund 1989 Open winner Calcavecchia has just hit the pin and narrowly missed taking the lead outright. He&apos;ll tap the remaining putt in for a birdioe and tie the lead with Marino. Good stuff, big man.  3.22pm: &quot;They&apos;ve just started the night&apos;s TV coverage here in Tokyo, and are showing Ishikawa&apos;s highlights from yesterday with what sounds like the Superman theme song as the backing music,&quot; writes Toby Joy. &quot;Anyone would think he&apos;d broken the course record ...&quot; I think he&apos;s broken the course record for photographers-in-toe.  3.24pm: &quot;Never mind the connected balls Gregg,&quot; writes Michael Hatcher, &quot;Tiger&apos;s expected to *unsheath the big one* at the next. Have they got Sid James on the BBC commentary team or something?&quot; I didn&apos;t catch his drive so I&apos;ve no idea how big his wood was (puerile, I realise). But it went 260 yards over on th eright hand side and made the fairway, so I&apos;m guessing: three-wood.  3.28pm: Tiger uses a three-iron into the wind for his second shot. He&apos;s 230 yards from the pin and goes straight at it. The wind forces it back and it drops into the bunker just in front of the green. Westwood finds the going tougher than Tiger - his ball nestles in the sand 40 yards in front of the flag. Ishikawa lands his to the right of the green in the semi-rough. He&apos;ll be reasonably chuffed with that, although it won&apos;t get the Superman treatment on the Tokyo highlights tonight.  3.33pm: There&apos;s only been 23 birdies on this 474-yard fifth hole. Playing into the wind it is a beast. Speaking of beasts, Tiger has just played a peach of a bunker shot. He scooped the ball out with his clubface fully open so that the ball came out sideways and rolled within 5ft of the hole. Westwood, meanwhile, shunts his bunker-shot onto the green and saves par with a gutsy 25ft putt. Out on the ninth Watson makes a birdie to go -2 and put himself back in contention.  3.37pm: Tiger rolls a tricky left-to-right putt into the centre of the cup and strolls off for a chat with Westwood. Ishikawa drops a shot, but we&apos;ll forgive him that, he was born in 1992 for Pete&apos;s sake.  3.39pm: Calcavecchia has dropped back down to -4 after three-putting from the back of the green on the 15th. Meanwhile a man I haven&apos;t mentioned for a while is Kuboya. He&apos;s birdied the 17th to move onto -3 for the tournament. I&apos;ve just realised that Gary Lineker&apos;s voice is so laboured it reminds me of listening to the surgeon having been fed six Temazepam prior to having an operation when I was 17.  3.44pm: Tiger&apos;s smashed a five-wood to within 20ft of the flag on the par-three 231-yard sixth. Westwood plays a beauty too. It bounces off the ridge to the right of the green and rolls into the centre.  3.46pm: A wrathful has arrived at Turnberry. This is great news for Marino sat in the clubhouse clutching his -5 close to his chest. That&apos;s yours to keep, as Jim Bowen might say. Ishikawa is also on the sixth green.

Their overall scores are:Lee Westwood ENG -2Ryo Ishikawa JPN -1Tiger Woods USA +1 And in case you&apos;re interested, the cut is rumoured to be around +4.  3.54pm: &quot;Mark Calcavecchia is 50/1, and -4, same price as Harrington who may miss the cut. Woods is 7/2, 5 shots behind Mark.&quot; That post is from kmvs. Interesting. I remember watching Woods needing to hole a 200-yarder to win the Masters and his live betting odds were 25-1. He must be the worst value sportsman out there. He&apos;s just pinged a drive through the rain onto the centre of the seventh fairway. Westwood finds the left-hand side of the good stuff with his tee-shot but Ishikawa lands his in some trifid-looking stuff. Adonius points out that the young Japanese star was born in 1991 not 1992 as I suggested. He therefore deserves none of our symapthy if he bottles it apparently.  4.00pm: Tiger opts for caution as he uses a mid-iron to punch his second shot to within 60 yards of the flag on the 538-yards par-five seventh. Westwood draws his five-wood and blasts his onto the green, but its just slides through and rolls 10 yards off to the right. Ishikawa punches his ball out of the rough and will have a 100-yard pitch up to the green. So Westwood has the better chance of a birdie from that trio.  4.04pm: The young Colombian Villegas, who is going well at -2, has just walloped one into the rough on the ninth. He looks like he&apos;s made of rubber when he swings at the ball. He trots up towards the nasty stuff where he&apos;ll have five minutes to find it or face a penalty.  4.06pm: Tiger justifies his short second shot by pitching a brilliant wedge to within 5ft of the hole. Westwood, who had the better position just off the green, makes a hash of his putt as it rolls back down the hill to its starting position. With his second attempt he almost holes it and will at least get par. Ishikawa leaves a seven-footer for par having carried his third shot to the left-hand side of the green.  4.10pm: Watson is back on the move. He birdies the 11th to move up the leaderboard to the group on-3. Tiger eyes his three-footer for a birdie on the seventh. He takes a moment to compose himself, plants his feet, takes two practice swings, and then rolls it home to move up to level par for the tournament. Westwood makes par to remain at -2.  4.13pm: Villegas has escaped the rough on the ninth. He finds the green too. And then from a mere three feet he rattles home his putt for par. A nonchalant toss of the club to his caddie suggests making par was never in question. Watson strikes an accurate drive straight down the middle of the 12th fairway. &quot;Go on Tom,&quot; shouts one person. Well me, actaully, in my head, just now.  4.17pm: A quick glance back at the predictions tells me that We Could Be Heroes is likely to roll over until tomorrow. Calcavecchia will have to make an almight cock-up on the last hole to damage his -4 for the day which he has shot after 17 holes. Nobody backed the big man.  4.20pm: Out on the eighth hole the camera has broken apparently so they&apos;ve lost coverage of Tiger&apos;s approach shot. It might have something to do with Westwood, who sliced his ball into the TV gantry (and possibly decked the camera operator) before the ball landed in the rough below. He&apos;ll do well to get up and down in two for par.  4.23pm: Panic over. Tiger is back on the telly so the gazillion viewers who switched off can return now. He&apos;s in a bunker though so perhaps it was a similar Nike-controlled PR stunt like Dunkgate. Woods escapes the trap and leaves himself a nerve-jangling 10ft putt for par.  4.26pm: Westwood hacks out of the rough and leaves a 20ft putt off the fringe at the back of the green for par. It is beyond saving though, as his ball pulls up short by 5ft. Woods follows suit and makes his first bogey, but Ishikawa rattles his putt home to make par.Westwood -1Ishikawa -1Woods +1Leaderboard top 10 to follow.  4.30pm: &quot;Re Mark Calcavecchia,&quot; writes Kevin Mannerings. &quot;Backed the big man an hour ago at 40/1, thanks.&quot; No problem Kevin. That&apos;s a cracking price. He&apos;s just holed out on the 18th to stay -4 for the tournament. He has all the experience to do well over the next couple of days.  4.32pm: Ishikawa has just pinged his ball into the light rough on the eighth where the wind is probably blowing at its strongest. He&apos;s got a little Manga-esque picture of his face on his golf balls. Tiger petulantly smacks his tee out of the ground after slicng his drive like an amateur hacker way out right over the gathering crowds. Westwood smacks his into the light rough and will be reasonably happy, I&apos;d have thought.  4.37pm: One of the Beeb&apos;s on-course reporters, Maureen, has just watched Tiger Woods hack out of the rough with a wood, bizarrely. When asked where his ball went she replies with a hint of surprise, &quot; I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m behind a dune.&quot; Brilliant Maureen, brilliant !  4.40pm: Ishikawa takes a low grip on his six-iron and tries to reach the green with a thrashing swing. His ball gets to the front of the green and gives him a fighting chance of saving par. Tiger, however, has bumped his third shot up out of the rough and left himself a 20ft putt for par. As for Westwood, he opts to bump his up towards the pin from 30 yards with a wedge. The wind catches it slightly and he has a difficult 12ft putt to save par.  4.44pm: The oldest swinger in town, Watson, is still, er, swinging. And swinging well. He tharrumps one off the tee down the 15th smack bang into the middle of the fairway. If he picks up a couple of birdies on the final three holes he&apos;ll be back on top.  4.46pm: Westwood judges his 12ft par-putt to perfection. with a tip of the cap he acknowledges the crowd&apos;s applause and will be glad to get to the turn at -1 for the championship. Tiger, however can&apos;t make par. he bogeys, just, and wears an expression like last night&apos;s thunder.  4.49pm: &quot;Ian &apos;Hey, look at me&apos; Poulter is tied 151st at +14,&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;You&apos;ve really got to do a bit more than play like a tw*t if you choose to look like a tw*t.&quot; I presume by tw*t you mean twit, don&apos;t you Gary? Don&apos;t you? Oh.  4.51pm: Westwood chooses his club with caution in mind on the 456-yard par-four 10th. He powers a three-wood away straight down the middle of the fairway and avoids the rocky beach off to the left. He&apos;ll have a good 220 yards to the flag though. Ishikawa enthusiastically draws the driver, before over-enthusiastically slicing his tee-shot off into the rough on the right. I can&apos;t tell you where Tiger ended up as the Beeb didn&apos;t show it.  4.56pm: Right. Tiger&apos;s had a nightmare on 10 and the BBC&apos;s Maureen can&apos;t help us out in understanding where his ball might have ended up. &quot;I can&apos;t answer these questions,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s mayhem down here.&quot; Tiger hits a provisional ball before romping up into some thick gorse. He eyeballs the crowd and asks if &quot;anybody heard or saw it?&quot; It&apos;s like a TV treasure-hunt. One plucky spectator says he heard something. Tiger inspects the ball. It&apos;s not his. He then tosses it off into the crowd in disgust. While this palava is going on I&apos;m going to knock out a top 10 leaderboard.

His ball could not be found and he&apos;s had to play his fourth stroke, which has landed about 30 yards shy of the flag, in front of the green. If he double-bogeys he&apos;ll be +4. The cut is likely to be +3. His playing partners have got tangled up in the rough stuff too. Ishikawa&apos;s ball is tangled up in some huge weeds on an island in the middle of a bunker just in front of the green, while Westwood is buried in the rough off to the right of the green.  5.10pm: Ishikawa&apos;s ball is deemed unplayable. He takes a penalty stroke and knocks his fourth shot up to within 15ft of the hole. He&apos;ll have that for a bogey. Tiger plays a neat pitch up to within 8ft. And needs that for a double-bogey. Correction on Westwood. He has in fact got within a foot of the hole in three so will make par. All those people tramping about in the rough confused me.  5.13pm: Tiger holds it together with the putter and sinks his eight-footer to double bogey. He&apos;s up to +4 now. He&apos;ll have to fight back to avoid the unthinkable - an early flight back to Florida.  5.16pm: Westwood chooses to hit a six-iron off the tee on the par-three 11th. He makes the left-hand side of the green. Tiger fares much better with a mid-iron than he has with his driver, plonking the ball within 15ft of the pin.  5.21pm: Watson has just holed the shot of the day! A monstrous 60ft putt on the 16th to make a birdie and move back up to join Calcavecchia on -4 in joint-second. It was a wonderful right-to-left attempt that arced its way towards the hole as if it belonged there.  5.24pm: Tiger struggles to control his ball on the 11th green where the wind barracks it, even on terra firma. He holes out for par, as does Westwood. Ishikawa drops a shot.  5.26pm: Manassero, who will definitely win the Silver Medal, sinks a 15ft putt for a birdie on the 16th. In his group the scores are:T Watson USA -4 S Garcia ESP Par M Manassero ITA (am) +1  5.29pm: Tiger&apos;s in more bother at 12. He&apos;s found a bunker off the tee. Westwood pings his tee-shot into the centre of the fairway, as does Ishikawa.  5.33pm: Westwood punches an eight-iron up onto the 12th green. He takes a low grip and avoids sending it sailing into the air to make the distance. Ishikawa gets an unlucky bounce as his approach doesn&apos;t quite kick on. As a result, his ball just sticks on the front of the green. Tiger shovels his second shot out of the bunker and then knocks a tidy iron to within 12ft of the flag. He might escape with par. Well, he needs to escape with par.  5.38pm: Adam Scott, who was my tip yesterday has just holed out at +5 and will be on his way home. According to the Beeb&apos;s Wayne Grady  his girlfriend, Ana Ivanovic, &quot;might cop a serve tonight.&quot; Is that a well know saying in Australia? Readers?  5.41pm: Tiger drops another shot. He&apos;s +5 now and needs to rally to start picking up birdies ASAP. Westwood makes par at 12, but Ishikawa drops a shot. This group&apos;s scores are as follows:Westwood ENG -1Ishikawa JPN +2Woods USA +5  5.47pm: Woods, Ishikawa and Westwood get their tee-shots off safely.

He scoops it out and leaves a 10ft putt for par.  5.58pm: Typical. I nip away from the desk for a toilet break and Tiger scores a double-bogey. It looks like he&apos;s on his way home.  5.59pm: Garcia has just played a delightful long-iron into the 18th green. The pin is positioned behind a bunker tight ot the left so to hit the centre of the green and hold it is a tricky challenge. Watson is a little further to the right, so expect him to make par and keep up his challenge.  6.02pm: The five-time Open champion gets a wonderful round of applause as he strolls up to the final green. He&apos;s rolled back the years and entertained the galleries over the past couple of days and deserves every ounce of gratitude from the spectators. Mannasero putts first and allows Watson to take a look at the line. It seems to be going from left to right.  6.05pm: Brilliant! Watson birdies from fully 50ft to go back to the top of the leaderboard with Marino on -5. Extraordinary stuff! What price Watson going all the way this weekend?  6.10pm: Watson has been dynamite with the putter today. His putt on the 18th bettered his montrous effort on the 16th. Let&apos;s hope his hip holds out for the next couple of days.  6.11pm: Right, after all the fun and games at the 18th, I can return the story of Tiger&apos;s fight to avoid missing the cut. He&apos;s made par on the 14th and requires a a birdie and an eagle or at least three birdies from four holes.  6.14pm: I must thank Michael Meagher, whose Tom Watson knowledge far exceeds mine. &quot;Watson was Open champion in 1975, 1977, 1980, 1982, 1983 and it was almost six (tying the record) but Seve turned on the magic at St Andrews in 1984,&quot; says he. Westwood made par on 14 and has been as steady as a rock in the wind.  6.16pm: Tiger plays a decent iron onto the middle of the green on the par-three 15th, but he needed to get it within at least 10ft to give himself a real birdie chance. Ishikawa winds up in the bunker at the back of the green, while Westwood plonks his ball dead-centre.  6.19pm: Villegas birdies the 17th to move up the leaderboard into the pack on -2.  6.21pm: Tiger doesn&apos;t hit his putt with any conviction and leaves a couple of feet for par. Westwood shows Tiger the way. He powers his putt home from 25ft to join Villegas and co on -2. If it were a 1500m race, Westwood would be five runners back on the outside waiting to burst through. However, seeing as he&apos;s a big lad from Worksop and he plays golf, that&apos;s a ridiculous analogy.  6.25pm: Graeme McDowell keeps himself in contention by putting for par to keep himself at +1 for the championship. Singh does likewise and will fancy his chances of lifting the Claret Jug. He&apos;s an eagle off the leading two on -3.  6.28pm: Tiger opts to thwack a three-wood off the 16th. For once he fares better in the wind and lands it on the fairway.  6.29pm: Tom Watson: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here if I didn&apos;t think I could win it. It&apos;s as if the spirits are on my side.&quot; Due to some bright spark in the R&amp;A golfers over the age of 60 can no longer take part in the Open. I hope Watson makes a mockery of them. He hit a drive 330 yards today - it&apos;s hardly like he&apos;s going to embarrass himself when he&apos;s 61.  6.35pm: Tiger&apos;s knocked a decent approach shot into 16. He&apos;s got a 15-footer for a birdie - and boy does he need it.  6.37pm: Westwood bunts a little iron off the hill at the back of the 16th green and leaves a 15ft putt for par. He&apos;ll have to use his nerve to get that. Meanwhile, Ishikawa has gone right off the boil. He&apos;s +6 for the tournament now having bogeyed every hole on the back nine.  6.39pm: A birdie for Tiger. As cool as you like, he plants his feet either side of his ball, grips his putter, and sends his ball rattling into the hole. He joins Ishikawa on +6. Both players need to make a couple more birdies - at the least.  6.42pm: Tiger mutters to himself after thrashing a three-wood out into the middle of the par-five 559-yard 17th. It looks good to me. Westwood opts for a long iron, but given that the wind is at their backs now, he should reach the green in two. The 17th is playing at 4.45 so all three players in the group should be looking to pick up at least a birdie.  6.47pm: Darren Clarke and Luke Donald hole out at the 18th. Clarke has had a decent day and shot another 71. He&apos;s +2 for the tournament seven shots behind the lead, which, in links golf, only takes a great round to retrieve.  6.50pm: Woods gets a stroke of luck which could keep him in the tournament. His second shot bounces over a sand trap 30 yards to the front-left of the pin and hops onto the green. He has an eagle chance now. Westwood plops his ball onto the green without the drama. Ishikawa, however, finds the bunker which Tiger avoided.

If he makes a birdie he&apos;ll be on +5. The cut is likely to be +4 but could go out to +5 if the players behind Tiger struggle on the way in. Westwood appears to be putting from another town in Scotland. He sends a 60ft putt (at least) well out to the right of the brow of a little hill before watching it dribble back down to within 10ft. Ishikawa escapes the bunker and putts for birdie from 12ft. He&apos;s back to +5 and has a fighting chance of staying for the weekend and ensuring the writyer of the Superman theme tune continues to pick up cheques from Japanese TV stations.  7.01pm: Westwood sinks his putt for a birdie, as does Tiger. This group: Westwood -2, Ishikawa +5, Woods +5  7.03pm: Tiger sends his long-iron into the light rough with American shouts of &quot;Get &apos;em Tiger!&quot; ringing in his ears. He&apos;s probably going to need a birdie to guarantee making the cut. So his second shot needs to be Grrrrrrrrreaaaat!!! Sorry, it&apos;s late, I&apos;m tired, I couldn&apos;t resist.  7.07pm: Tiger touches his cap, takes a look at the flag and steadies himself. He&apos;s 199 yards from the flag. This shot will either make or break his hopes of making the cut. He whacks an eight-iron and somehow manages to send the ball through the back of the green whre he&apos;ll need something extraordinary to make a birdie. Ishikawa lands short on the left, while Worksop&apos;s Westwood sends his straight for the pin with a bit of check. He has a great chance of a birdie.  7.12pm: The Woods-Westwood-Ishikawa three-ball get a rousing reception as they stroll onto the green. Ishikawa is demed to be furthest away and opts to chip up the little hill towards the flag, but unfortunately his ball rolls away from the flag and leaves him facing a difficult par to stay in the championship. Tiger is deemed to be furthest away and opts to chip rather than putt.  7.16pm: Tiger plays a controlled chip towards the flag but it&apos;s not strong enough. He&apos;s left with a three-footer for par, but will have to rely on the players behind him dragging the cut-off score back to +5 which isn&apos;t likely.  7.17pm: Westwood shoves his birdie putt to the edge of the cup, but it pulls up on the precipice. He taps home for a round of 70 and remains -2 for the tournament. Ishikawa misses his par-putt so it&apos;s curtains for him, but he has shown glimpses of real talent here. Tiger taps home but it&apos;s near-enough certain that he&apos;ll miss the cut.  7.21pm: Well that&apos;s all from me folks. What a brilliant day&apos;s golf. The papers will be full of dejected shots of Tiger Woods tomorrow, but in my opinion, we should be focusing on the brilliant and unexpected resurgence of Tom Watson. The two putts he holed on the 16th and 18th were magnificent. Let&apos;s hope he can keep it up tomorrow. Thanks for your emails. Right, I&apos;m off to fix a puncture.

The lineup: Frankee (vocals, sweet inspiration), Britt (vocals, pop justice). The background: When there were still feathers to be ruffled, when there were still sides to be taken, when there was still an &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and it meant something when one team made incursions into the territory of the other, Kim Wilde appeared on the cover of NME. In the spring of 1981. Just as light was starting to pour over dour post-punk and the dark world of rock was being transformed into something brighter, bubblier and altogether more funklicious called &quot;new pop&quot;. It was a fabulous moment that marked a subtly seismic paradigm shift from one set of aesthetic principles \u2013 one pop consciousness, if you like \u2013 to another. No, wait, come back, it really did. Before that Kim Wilde Moment, the ambition of most bands was to register somewhere on the indie charts. Afterwards, groups of men who would otherwise have been in scruffy, scratchy guitar outfits all wanted to work with big name producers and be shiny pop stars. Apres Kim, le deluge: ABC, Heaven 17, Human League, Altered Images, Orange Juice, Associates et al. But it was great because there was a sense of dual engagement: of indie bands using pop techniques to infect the mainstream with &quot;awkward&quot; ideas, and of pop acts seeking the edge and cred of rock. What is the point of all this? Well, Mini Viva, a pop duo, the new Mel and Kim, and the latest addition to the Xenomania stable, were in NME this week, and it got us thinking about how wonderful it would be if there was more two-way traffic between indie and pop; about how wonderful it would have been if the Strokes had worked with Pharrell not Gordon Raphael, if Franz Ferdinand had finished that album with Xenomania, or if Girls Aloud had ever decided to make a record with Radiohead. Why? Because it would have been interesting. Because it would have kept us entertained. Because sometimes it&apos;s nice to be surprised. Mini Viva (remember them?) strike us as the act most likely to encourage a productive dialogue between indie and pop, between the art world and the chart world. Frankee and Britt are, respectively, 19 and 20 years old, they&apos;ve been on tour with the Saturdays, and they&apos;re managed by Simon (Spice Girls) Fuller, but there&apos;s something about them, a glimmer of playful energy amid the dazzle and sparkle of their debut single Left My Heart in Tokyo, that suggests they are going to be more than just the new Shampoo, that better things await them than being booed off, Daphne and Celeste-style, at next year&apos;s summer festivals. They&apos;re rough and raw for the polished-pop milieu, which is good, and they&apos;ve got a lot to learn, but there are groups, plenty of them, who could learn a thing or two from them, even at this early stage in their development, even this late in the game. The buzz: &quot;The next biggest girl band in the universe!&quot; The truth: Apparently, Left My Heart in Tokyo is but one of five future-pop classics already in the can. The Saturdays, for one, might as well, er, call it a day. Most likely to: Go to Hollywood (Frankee). Least likely to: Befriend Rod Stewart (Britt).

Monday morning kicked off as it always does; whilst the regular denizens of the Gamesblog yawned their way into gear and slowly brought themselves up to full operational speed after the excesses of the weekend, a chipper few found themselves full of beans (coffee beans perhaps) and posed bright and early. The chat kicked off with the weekend&apos;s gaming, and a few words were shared about the Crysis franchise \u2014 the consensus seeming to be that, although it gets the Chatterbox thumbs-up, most of us are not insane enough to have bought computers good enough to play it. Shewrog2 made the proud announcement that his other half was expecting again, which was met with both some words of congratulation and this from TonyHayers:   &quot;...the old bill paid us a visit on Saturday night. Big fancy dress/bbq at a mates that got quite lively. Some bloke turned up with a pack of huge rockets. We experimented with tethering these to the floor with string, and snapping the sticks off. Explosive.&quot;  This tangential outburst reassured all of the &apos;boxers \u2014 who may have been sobered by these thoughts of familial commitment \u2014 that the average maturity of the Gamesblog continues forwards (backwards?) on an even keel. Aside from outright condemnation of critics and radio presenters (Kermode and Whiley are still reeling), this then set the tone for the rest of the day until CunningStunt dropped this bombshell:  &quot;Finally got my dungeon big enough to attract the Otter Wizard. With all my anti-water armour I managed to dispatch him first time, although once again the girl was knocked out. Still, the mayor was happy and I got some more olive oil for the shovel. Think he has 25MP now.&quot;  ... and there was no saving Monday after that. As we wheeled into Tuesday it was clear that the theme of the day was to be outright vitriol. Starting with films; Transformers 2, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor were all denounced by the masses. Even CraggyIsland admitted that he&apos;d turned Watchmen off half way through due to boredom. Luckily, Cameroon95 was fighting a lone campaign to cheer up the blog and inject some enthusiasm into the proceedings with a positive review. His one line summary of Requiem for a Dream: &quot;While an excellent film, it is utterly depressing.&quot; Talk of poor films soon dominated, with those petitioning for a higher standard of cinema pitted against those standing up for the right to enjoy a bit of rubbish every now and then. It was all fun and games until Piratejuice confessed that he&apos;d been to see both Alien Vs Predator films at the cinema, revealing at once the appropriate target for the scorn of anyone bemoaning the output of Hollywood these days. As mid-week lazily rolled up, a change in the waters could be detected. After months of talk about Xbox 360s and Playstation 3s, some Chatterboxers found themselves reaching down to waggle something most hadn&apos;t used in a very long time: a wiimote. Grand Slam Tennis, with the shiny new wii motionplus attachment, is here and apparently meeting with rising murmurs of approval.  Ever the cheeriest of communities, the Gamesblog then embraced with gusto a significant discussion of serious medical conditions suffered by readers and their loved ones. In these moments of sombre reflection, however, somebody saw fit to bring up the topic of the TV programme Deadliest Warrior (after Charlie Brooker&apos;s flirtation with the material) and soon energy levels were restored as titanic questions such as who would win in a fight between a pirate and a knight were squabbled over furiously. As we limped into the last portion of the week, there was only one question on everyone&apos;s lips: is there a better way of running our local authorities and what exactly do we pay council tax for anyway? Luckily Henrypootle was straight out of the blocks with the definitive answer: &quot;bins and sh*t&quot;. With that matter resolved, the afternoon&apos;s chat was ripe and full of potential to progress. The important issues of the day would not go without a fight though, and topics such as the NHS, privatisation of public services, the works of Ayn Rand, and the availability of &apos;legal highs&apos; in the U.K were danced around for a short while by those with the energy remaining to debate them. One was CBPodge, who was the only &apos;boxer man enough to take up Crispycrumb&apos;s challenge to name a decent railway, anywhere in the world, that is not state owned: &quot;The Monorail at Alton Towers,&quot; he confirmed with knowing authority, &quot;is excellent.&quot; And so into Friday, where CunningStunt attempted to kick off the day with a piece of fashionable lingo: &quot;Feeling a bit Crunchie about tomorrow,&quot; he enthused, before having to explain, upon questioning, that it was, you know, from that old advert. For the chocolate bar. As with all Fridays, the general lack of joie de vivre amongst the tired and downtrodden was relieved by the discussion of potential gaming purchases for the weekend. Grand Slam Tennis was talked about again, as was Sacred 2 \u2014 both in slightly hushed tones as if the Gamesbloggers felt just a little dirty about the thought of picking these titles up.  As the weekend approached, the only things more pressing than games chat would of course be the carefully planned regime of alcohol abuse and sleep deprivation planned by the bloggers for the forthcoming weekend. After some back and forth, we can all now be confident that we know why energy drinks are bad for you, whether there&apos;s any difference between a White Russian and a &apos;Caucasian&apos;, and what the best science fiction TV shows ever made are. That last one admittedly derailing the afternoon&apos;s conversation somewhat. Finally, a die-hard cadre of the Chatterbox&apos;s finest took it upon themselves to see the comments hit ten pages before Friday was out. In a shocking display of discourtesy towards the selfless heroes who condense the comments into a &apos;Best-of&apos; each week, item after item was poured forth onto the page without restraint. An effort deserving of mention? Yes. But that was all it will get.See you next week, Gamesbloggers. Quote of the week&quot;I&apos;m so depressed today I might buy Spongebob Squarepants season 1 &amp; 2.

Racked with infighting and policy confusion during Aso&apos;s 10 months in charge, the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) trails the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in opinion polls by what many believe is an insurmountable margin. Aso, the manga-addicted scion of a wealthy political dynasty, has presided over one of the LDP&apos;s most miserable periods in power since he took office last September. He has managed to insult teachers, the elderly and Alzheimer&apos;s sufferers with ill-judged comments, at one point likening the opposition to the Nazis. His cabinet has been dogged by scandal, including the resignation in February of his finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, after he turned up drunk at a G8 press conference in Italy. A poll in yesterday&apos;s Mainichi newspaper put support for the DPJ at 56%, with 23% backing the LDP. At a meagre 11%, support for Aso trailed well behind that for the DPJ&apos;s leader, Yukio Hatoyama, on 28%. Though his party&apos;s policies are short on detail, Hatoyama has struck a chord with disaffected voters with promises to take on the reform-resistant bureaucracy, lower taxes and set aside cash for families, the sick and the elderly. The DPJ has also vowed to pursue a more independent foreign policy after decades of subservience to the US, and to increase its involvement in UN peacekeeping missions. Hatoyama told party members that the election would be a &quot;revolutionary&quot; opportunity for politicians to wrest control from bureaucrats, who have dominated policymaking under the LDP. &quot;We should face it with a sense of historic mission,&quot; he said. Japan has effectively been in a state of political paralysis since the DPJ took control of the upper house in 2007, giving it the ability to block and delay government legislation. Yet despite its comfortable lead in the opinion polls, the DPJ are by no means assured of taking control of the more powerful lower house. The LDP holds 303 seats in the 408-seat chamber \u2013 and its junior coalition partner New Komeito holds 31 \u2013 while the DPJ has just 112. The result, analysts say, will be determined by the roughly 30% of voters who remain undecided. Aso, 68, has been criticised for his handling of Japan&apos;s recession with the economy faring even worse than those of the US and the EU. Record stimulus packages have been derided as wasteful, at a time when Japan is lumbered with a public debt equivalent to 180% of its GDP. His party also appears poorly equipped to address pressing social problems, including how to fund the creaking state pension and healthcare for the elderly. Public disaffection with the LDP, one of the most successful electoral machines in modern political history, culminated in a resounding defeat at last weekend&apos;s elections for the Tokyo assembly, the party&apos;s first loss in the capital for 40 years. That defeat triggered an attempt by LDP rebels to out Aso before the election, but the move was frustrated by party executives desperate to impose a semblance of unity in the run-up to the general election. After insisting that the LDP&apos;s drubbing in Tokyo was not an indictment of his administration, Aso apologised to party colleagues for his mistakes as leader. &quot;I&apos;m sorry for my lack of ability and that I couldn&apos;t fully unite the party,&quot; he said. &quot;We must sincerely accept the public&apos;s criticism, humbly reflect on our performance and start afresh.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["We&apos;re loving Dizzee Rascal&apos;s Holiday and Mini Viva&apos;s Left My Heart in Tokyo now."], "tags": ["Dizzee Rascal", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-22T20:30:00Z", "title": "What makes a great summer pop hit? | Jude Rogers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/summer-pop-hits-dizzee-rascal", "article": "What makes a song perfect for the summer? Britain&apos;s first No 1 holiday hit was Jerry Keller&apos;s Here Comes Summer. Topping the charts in 1959, it celebrated teenage innocence and escape: &quot;School is out, oh happy day/ Here comes summer/ I&apos;m going to grab my girl and run away.&quot; Strangely, the American&apos;s song reached the top spot in the UK in the rather unseasonal month of October, but perhaps this shows us that some summer singles are more about dreams than sweaty, sunburnt reality. This year, the big hit is expected to be Dizzee Rascal and Calvin Harris&apos;s imminent Holiday, a dancefloor-stormer about the typical British experience abroad, featuring the lines: &quot;Don&apos;t judge my passport photo/ I know I look a bit\u00a0loco.&quot; From the Beach Boys going surfin&apos; USA, to the Kinks lazing on a sunny afternoon, from Grease&apos;s summer lovers to the Isley Brothers&apos; summer breeze, summer pop has always been about escape \u2013 and, for buttoned-up Brits, mainly about having a party, a singalong and buckets of booze. Mungo Jerry&apos;s In the Summertime, the first No 1 summer song from a British artist, directed us in 1970 to &quot;have a drink, have a drive&quot;, before sensibly suggesting that we should &quot;signal a cab&quot; and bring our &quot;bottle waggin&apos;\u00a0back&quot;. And then a decade later came the daddy of them all, Wham!&apos;s Club Tropicana, which took us to a sunshine wonderland where the drinks were free. George Michael tipping his cherry-red cocktail into a sky-blue pool became the ultimate expression of that decade&apos;s cheesy decadence. There&apos;s also the summer novelty song. Evidence that we all go a little daft in the sunshine, the phenomenon was kick-started by Barbados in 1975, a song by a band called Typically Tropical about the delights of Coconut Airways (can you see a theme here?). It was reworked by the Vengaboys for their 1999 hit, We&apos;re Going to Ibiza. How do you cook up a summer hit \u2013 and is it easy as it sounds? We asked a producer, a pundit, a radio boss and musicians from pop&apos;s past and present to tell us what gets them in the holiday\u00a0mood . . . The chart-topper Elly Jackson, singer in La Roux  Our song Bulletproof has sort of become a summer song. I don&apos;t really know why. We did write it in the summer, though. I think sunny weather drives you towards certain tempos and melodies that work well booming out of open windows. It&apos;s a fairly aggressive song in terms of its mood and character, though, whereas lots of summer songs tend to be light and flippant, like Club Tropicana. We demanded that our next single, I&apos;m Not Your Toy, came out in summer for that reason. It has a brightness that wouldn&apos;t work in winter. I always remember Toploader&apos;s Dancing in the Moonlight coming out early in the year when it was cold and raining. How stupid. Favourite summer song: Eddy Grant&apos;s Electric Avenue. It reminds me of summers growing up in Brixton. Reggae always works at this time of year. But then again, any music made somewhere sunnier than Britain usually does. The music mogul Pete Waterman, producer, songwriter and Pop Idol judge  Summer songs became big in the 1950s and 60s, when people started to holiday abroad and hear the music there. Spain is much sexier than Clacton! That&apos;s why Sylvia Vrethammar&apos;s Y Viva Espana became a big hit in the autumn of 1974. Everyone came back from their package holidays and got misty-eyed. Summer hits are as much about image and the way people perceive pop stars as anything else. Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan helped [my production company] Stock, Aitken and Waterman have hits with The Loco-Motion and Sealed With a Kiss because they were from Australia, a country everyone thought of as permanently sunny. It&apos;s also a time when the fewest records are bought, so we took full advantage of that: it was easier to get a No 1 in those months. It&apos;s a shame there are fewer novelty singles these days. Record companies are obsessed with sophistication and coolness, which is bloody rubbish. It&apos;s not as if novelty singles don&apos;t work. Tom Hark by the Piranhas [a cover of a South African kwela song] was a summer hit in 1980. It&apos;s still played in at football matches. Summer should be about having a laugh. Favourite summer song: Carole King&apos;s It Might As Well Rain Until September. It reminds me of when I was a 15-year-old lad, fancying a girl and dreaming his holidays away. The best summer songs play on that, especially if they focus on unrequited love. Everyone&apos;s favourite summer songs come from that time in their lives. The radio boss George Ergatoudis, Radio 1&apos;s head of music Songs that get people dancing are held back for the summer by record labels. I don&apos;t blame them. Listeners respond to dance music when it&apos;s warm. We&apos;re loving Dizzee Rascal&apos;s Holiday and Mini Viva&apos;s Left My Heart in Tokyo now. They have that poppy-trance sound that works at the moment, perhaps because it echoes early-90s rave culture, which people associate with being outside and having a good time. We like to play mood-changers on Radio 1 in the summer, to promote euphoria and good sensations, and take you away from your desk or your car. There&apos;s no rules as to how that works. In radio, you just learn to feel it: a raw, primitive, irresistible connection of music to the emotions. Favourite summer song: Madonna&apos;s Into the Groove or Snap!&apos;s Rhythm Is a Dancer. Brilliant pop that sounds great coming out of car speakers. The pundit  Peter Robinson, editor of Popjustice.com People relax. Knobbly knees and love handles appear. And musical tastes relax, too. I don&apos;t mean standards slip. I mean people stop trying to cover up the fact that they like simple pop music. Pretending you don&apos;t like music with a very catchy tune is tiring, so people take the summer off. Songs aiming for big summer status appear in our office every year., It&apos;s like press release bingo. Claims of &quot;sun-kissed vocals&quot; and &quot;lilting Beach Boys harmonies&quot; usually mean they sound a bit bouncy and there&apos;s a reference to sunshine in the second verse. Then again, being able to launch someone like Lily Allen off the back of a summer single is a good marketing strategy. That&apos;s what happened with Smile in 2006. Lily&apos;s label is trying it again this year with MPHO&apos;s Box N Locks. To ram the point home, it features a very beachy Martha and the Muffins sample. Favourite summer song: La Isla Bonita by Madonna, even though it was released in April. It must have been a warm spring. At the moment, though, nothing beats Dizzee Rascal&apos;s Holiday. It&apos;s a Club Tropicana for 2009. And like the best summer holidays, it ends with a massive rave-up. The 80s star Sara Dallin, singer and songwriter in Bananarama  The best summer songs remind you of your youth: what you did in your holidays, how it felt when you first kissed a boy, going away without your parents. For me, our hit, Cruel Summer, played on the darker side: it looked at the oppressive heat, the misery of wanting to be with someone as the summer ticked by. We&apos;ve all been there! It was a huge hit in the US. I&apos;ll always remember coming out of our hotel in LA when we first became famous and seeing Mike Tyson sitting there. He burst into Cruel Summer when he saw us. It was unbelievable. Summer songs do that to people. When the sun&apos;s out, anything goes. Favourite summer song: Anything by Blondie or Roxy Music because of their sound. They were glamorous, and they take me back to those teenage summers when anything was possible. Five ingredients for a guaranteed summer smash \u2022 Any instrument that comes from outside the British Isles. Bonus points for Spanish guitars (the Spice Girls&apos; Viva Forever, Madonna&apos;s La Isla Bonita), marimbas (Bananarama&apos;s Cruel Summer), calypso rhythms and Brazilian samba beats. Note: bagpipes and Welsh harps do not get the pavements sizzling. \u2022 A video that clearly costs a great deal of money and has to be watched through sunglasses. Ideally, it will feature a beach, an ocean lit up like a thousand sparkling sapphires, a snazzy form of transport (yacht on sea, Jeep on beach), a few attractive foreigners, and a scantily clad woman. See Duran Duran&apos;s Rio. \u2022 Any mention of sunshine or summeriness. Even when the sky is the colour of sludge, torrential rain is filling your shoes and the wind has blown your barbecue into the neighbours&apos; garden, the mere mention of hot weather will get the skin tanning. \u2022 Promotional CDs distributed around clubs in Ibiza, east London and Doncaster, DJs kissed and petted, and the song pouring out of car windows strategically left open outside sweaty offices and schools. Hey presto \u2013 guaranteed summer lovin&apos;! \u2022 Any mention of youth and freedom that takes listeners back to the hazy days of their school holidays. Longer narratives about nostalgia work, too. This explains why Bryan Adams&apos;s Summer of &apos;69 gets hyperactive kids dancing with drunk grannies at weddings.

The sexy-talk starts at $3,000 (\u00a31,800) for 21 letters reportedly faxed by Madonna to boyfriend James Albright between 1992 and 1994. The faxes were sent from hotels across the world, including Tokyo&apos;s Hotel Okura and London&apos;s Regency Club. Albright is reportedly referred to with names like &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Booty Man&quot;, whereas Madonna herself prefers &quot;Lil Booty&quot; or the pseudonym &quot;Lola Montez&quot;. Montez was a famous courtesan of Ludwig I of Bavaria. The letters from Albright to Madonna, handwritten on the back of one fax, paint a picture of a loving relationship.

However, it&apos;s not clear who the seller of the intimate items is and how they obtained the material. The auction also includes &quot;a very personal and intimate amateur video&quot;, featuring Madonna and some of the cast from the 1993 film Dangerous Game (also known as Snake Eyes).

Bidding begins at $10,000 (\u00a36,000). But the most archaic of all the auction items \u2013 more than the faxes and the videotape \u2013 are a pair of microcassettes allegedly from Albright&apos;s answerphone.

That got your attention, didn&apos;t it? And that was precisely the intention of the Manhattan Airport Foundation, a mysterious organisation that has outlaid its proposals to bulldoze Central Park in New York city and build an airport instead. The foundation put out a press release earlier this week saying that the &quot;Triborough Association for Fair Treatment&quot; - a group it says lobbies to get legislation drafted to help protect migratory birds from aircraft strikes - was putting its full support behind the building of a new airport in the heart of Manhattan as it would reduce the kind of bird-related incidents that brought down US Airways Flight 1549 back in January causing it to bellyflop into the Hudson. It&apos;s all nonsense, of course. The whole thing is a hoax \u2013 one that&apos;s been getting plenty of attention all week and managing to snare a few suckers along the way, too. The Manhattan Airport Foundation is pure fiction, as are its plans for an airport. Only a few nanoseconds of consideration lead you to realise the last place on earth that would ever be concreted over to make way for an airport would be Central Park (although, as Plane Stupid noted last year, there was a time not too long ago when people were seriously considering building an airport in London&apos;s Hyde Park). So who is behind the hoax? And why have they spent a considerable amount of time and effort (and, presumably, money) creating such a professional-looking website? Chances are the site will soon morph into an advert for something or other, as has happened with other web hoaxes in the past. Or it could be some web-savvy comedians looking for some viral marketing? No one yet, though, seems to have undercovered the real identity of those behind the Manhattan Airport Foundation, or their motive. The website&apos;s domain name was registered back in April (even though the foundation claims to have been founded in 2006), but the identity of the domain&apos;s owner has been withheld. The foundation&apos;s Twitter page has only been live since 8 June, and its address is listed as being on the 58th floor, 233 Broadway. Yet the building only has 57 floors. A press release dated April of this year says the foundation is to receive &quot;significant financial backing over the next five years&quot; from the &quot;Waalwijk Charitable Trust&quot;. In addition to this, the &quot;Tokyo-based holding company Yamanote Ltd&quot; will be making a &quot;substantial gift&quot;. Again, both these organisations are fictional \u2013 Waalwijk is the name of a town in the Netherlands and Yamanote is an affluent area in Tokyo. The only person&apos;s name mentioned anywhere on the site is a press officer called &quot;Audrey Cortlandt&quot;. Again, nothing of note shows up online for that name, although it does throw up some interesting anagrams - &quot;Lady Dancer Tutor&quot; being one of them. Not that this really helps us, though.

At face value, Fukuoka, the largest city of the country&apos;s third largest island, Kyushu, looks just like any other Japanese metropolis: ghastly grey office buildings above ground, endless identikit shopping malls below, thousands of people quietly shuffling about the urban slipstream and maintaining Japan&apos;s faceless efficiency. But turn a few corners and there lurks an unexpected antidote to the dull concrete sprawl. A multicoloured underground arts movement is bringing together music and design with internationalism and innovation. Fukuoka&apos;s youth are finding a broad new voice.  The city first captured the nation&apos;s attention over a decade ago when the success of indie band Zazen Boys put Fukuoka&apos;s rock scene in the limelight. In 2009, the city is nurturing a vibrant electronic-dance division who are as engaged with the visual arts and internationalism as they are with squeezing exciting new sounds out of their well-worn microKORGs.  &quot;I want people to make new connections through my music,&quot; says Shiho the Purplehaze, the DJ/producer at the epicenter of the electro-enlightenment, &quot;I want to help to free people&apos;s minds. The Japanese need this more than anyone.&quot;  Turning Japanese has come to meet Shiho in the headquarters of Oilworks, the music and graphic design den headed by brothers Olive and Popy Oil. Hidden on the fourth four of a centrally located complex, upon entering, Popy&apos;s giant canvases, which merge street art with a contemporary computer-design aesthetic, whip you out of the city and into a dream-like technotopia.  Both Shiho and Olive are regulars on the underground club circuits in Fukuoka and Tokyo. &quot;There is a real different vibe in Fukuoka,&quot; says Shiho, &quot;people are so much more open to their surroundings.&quot; At popular clubs like Base and Graf, you don&apos;t just go to dance or get drunk, you go to see visual artists at work. &quot;I saw the guy who designed my album cover, Wok22, painting in a club and asked him if he&apos;d like to collaborate. You don&apos;t get that in Tokyo.&quot; Another well-known name around the clubs is Juza, aka Moochy, a DJ and producer who has travelled to Cuba and Vietnam to discover music to merge with traditional Japanese elements. Turning Japanese wants to meet him, but he&apos;s currently in Trinidad and Tobago recording steel-drum players. Across town at Dois Lagos bar and restaurant, the city&apos;s openness to other cultures takes on another form. Inside everyone looks Japanese, but instead of bowing, they throw their arms around you, kissing both your cheeks, before greeting you heartily in Portuguese. Fukuoka has a large community of Japanese Brazilians, ethnically Japanese but culturally South American, who returned to the country after an exodus of families in the early-20th century seeking riches on the coffee plantations around Sao Paolo. Wilson is a Japanese-Brazilian radio DJ on Fukuoka city&apos;s Love FM, which broadcasts in Japanese, English, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Thai and French. Plugged right into the heart of the Fukuoka club scene he espouses the city&apos;s virtues with Latino charm, saying: &quot;It is safe, tolerant and the women are beautiful.&quot; As night rolls on people head for the clubs, but despite the buoyancy, Shiho casts some realistic words of warning. &quot;The scene is growing, which is great, but now is an important time. I worry that people are so open-minded about everything that it all passes us by and nothing lasting happens. With this scene I don&apos;t want people to just see themselves and the work they are producing. I want people to use our art as a way of seeing the whole world.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Asia Japan Illegal cycle parking is a major issue in Tokyo, where 704,000 people commute to work by bike - more than in the entire US."], "tags": ["Culture", "Cycling", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "From Salvador Dal\u00ed to the Nazis, Rebecca Seal goes round the world by bike", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jul/26/cycling-around-the-world-dali-nazis", "article": "Europe Spain Salvador Dal\u00ed had an Italian Bianchi cycle in his studio and said he would have liked &quot;the whole of France&quot; to cycle: &quot;The Tour de France on bicycles produces in me such a persistent satisfaction that my saliva flows in imperceptible but stubborn streams.&quot;  France Queen&apos;s song &quot;Bicycle Race&quot; was born when Freddie Mercury was holidaying in France and the Tour went past his hotel window.

Each advert features a picture of a different sports star celebrating victory. Tiger Woods pumps his fist, an ecstatic Serena Williams jumps in the air, Lewis Hamilton joyously sprays champagne. Then there is 19-year-old Pamela Jelimo. She is winning the 800m, a flock of opponents trailing in her wake. She looks stern, hardly a flicker of emotion crossing her face. Winning, the picture seems to say, is normal. At the start of 2008, Jelimo was a struggling sprinter who by her own admission had &quot;lost hope&quot;. By the end of the year she had become the world&apos;s best middle-distance runner, winning every single 800m race she entered. Kenya has produced athletics greats from Kip Keino to Paul Tergat, but few have captured the country&apos;s imagination like Jelimo. An Olympic gold in the 800m last year in Beijing brought her fame; a month later she won her fortune. After the Olympics she returned to the Grand Prix circuit. She was a serious contender for the Golden League jackpot, a $1m prize shared between the female athletes who won all six of their Golden League meetings. Jelimo had won five out of five, as had the Croatian high jumper Blanka Vlas\u00edc. In the final meeting of the series in Brussels Jelimo won her race, but Vlas\u00edc came second. The jackpot was all Jelimo&apos;s. The response back in Kenya blew her away. Jelimo wasn&apos;t just an Olympic hero, she was a rich Olympic hero. Her prize is more than 2,500 times the average monthly wage in Kenya. On arriving back in Nairobi, she was whisked off to meet the president, Mwai Kibaki, and prime minister Raila Odinga. Then it was on to Kapsabet, the farming town high in the North Rift Valley where Jelimo grew up with six sisters and three brothers.\u00a0Thousands filled the streets, chanting her name. Men waved placards screaming &quot;Pamela, Marry Me!&quot; and children sang songs praising her. The main thoroughfare was renamed Pamela Jelimo Street. &quot;It was strange,&quot; she recalls, &quot;but it was marvellous.&quot; For a millionaire, Jelimo lives an austere life. The house she shares with her husband, 22-year-old fellow athlete Peter Murrey, is simple: a one-bedroom bungalow on a patch of farmland high up in the Rift Valley. Calendars and family pictures hang from the walls of the reception room, as do certificates noting Pamela&apos;s triumphs. There is a wooden dresser with gold plastic handles and a patterned brown three-piece suite. The only sign of wealth is a 42-inch plasma television. Jelimo is trying to keep her life as normal as possible but she is stopped for autographs almost every day and on her rare forays into Nairobi her agent, Barnaba Korir, has to hire bodyguards to protect her from an eager public. She has shunned the media, refusing all requests for interviews, bar one which she did with Murrey to put off the placard-waving, marriage-proposing men who hoped Jelimo might be their meal ticket. It took several weeks to persuade Jelimo to agree to an interview with OSM \u2013 the first time she has sat down with a foreign journalist. &quot;I just want to concentrate on my training,&quot; she says by way of apology, when we finally meet at her Kapsabet home. She is just back from her second training run of the day. It is late afternoon and the brilliant green hills of the North Rift, which back onto her garden, are bathed in sunshine. She disappears into the kitchen to boil the kettle, returning after a few minutes with a flask of hot, milky tea. While she is gone, Murrey tells me about the book he is reading, Richard Dawkins&apos;s The God Delusion. It&apos;s an unusual choice in a country where church and daily prayer are an almost unquestioned part of life. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with it, but it is good to challenge your views,&quot; he says, putting Dawkins down on the coffee table next to a copy of the Bible. The two have known each other since they were children and married in 2007. Murrey still has ambitions of being a successful athlete but, so far, he is more than happy to play second fiddle. It is a refreshing attitude in a country where wives are still expected to stay at home and raise a family while husbands go out to work. From an early age, Jelimo knew she could run fast. She excelled in school athletics and was talent spotted three years ago at a meet in Eldoret, the commercial capital of the North Rift, some 25 miles from Kapsabet. In Kenya the main athletics teams all belong to state institutions. The police force signed her up, although she didn&apos;t have to do too much actual policing. &quot;You have to at least do one or two things but they give you enough time to train. They cannot give you too much work.&quot; So, no arrests then? She laughs. &quot;No! No! I\u00a0couldn&apos;t do that.&quot; She won her first big event, the 400m at the Africa junior championships in Burkina Faso, in 2007, but failure in the final of her other event, the 200m, caused her to think again. &quot;I was last,&quot; she says with a laugh and a shake of the head. Even her times at 400m, while impressive for a junior in Africa, were off the pace internationally. Kenyans have traditionally excelled at middle and long distances \u2013 not sprinting. &quot;The middle-distance runners were my role models. I discussed it with my coaches and we decided to move to 800m.&quot; It was a smart choice. She won her first gold at the All Africa games last year, beating Mozambique&apos;s former Olympic champion Maria Mutola along the way, before entering her first race in Europe, a grand prix meeting in the Dutch town of Hengelo. Few of those who lined up alongside her knew who the Kenyan teenager was. Less than two minutes later they were trailing in her wake as Jelimo stormed home in first place in 1:55.76, breaking the world junior record. &quot;They were surprised, for sure,&quot; she says of her opponents. The victories kept coming, but the Olympics was her target. &quot;I co-ordinated my training programme so I\u00a0did not get burnout. I wanted to win at the Olympics. I had that motivation. I thought, &apos;If I win that gold, it will be something to be remembered.&apos;&quot; It will be remembered, but perhaps not as much as the million dollars. Mention Jelimo in Nairobi and the subject of money immediately comes up. She doesn&apos;t like talking about it though. &quot;No no no, nothing concerning my money!&quot; she says when I\u00a0bring it up. She put it in a bank account in Monaco and, so far, hasn&apos;t spent a penny. Within hours of her victory, her agent was fielding so many calls from businessmen and opportunists eager for her to invest in a new property or company that he had to turn his phone off. For now, Jelimo is happy to watch the interest accumulate. &quot;After a few years I can maybe start my own project,&quot; she says. &quot;In Eldoret we have so many supermarkets, so many rental houses. I cannot go to Eldoret and decide to build rental houses there because we have so many. I have to choose some new things.&quot; A decade ago there were nowhere near as many supermarkets, rental properties or office blocks in Eldoret, the largest town in the North Rift with a population of nearly 200,000. In the past few years it has seen a huge amount of investment, almost all of it from Jelimo&apos;s fellow athletes. Most of Kenya&apos;s athletes come from the North Rift and as they have returned home, often clutching tens of thousands of pounds in appearance fees, sponsorship and winnings, many have started investing in property. &quot;Eldoret has a completely new face,&quot; says Barnaba. &quot;Almost all the tall buildings are built by athletes.&quot; Our driver, Joshua, takes us on a tour of the town, pointing out which properties belong to which athletes. We pass a school belonging to Daniel Komen (3,000m world record holder), a five-storey shopping centre owned by Joyce Chepchumba (winner of the London, New York and Tokyo marathons) and office blocks recently built by Tegla Loroupe (world record holder at 20, 25 and 30km cross country). &quot;There was nothing here before,&quot; Joshua says, as we pass another large house protected by a seven-foot-high concrete wall. He gestures towards it. &quot;Janeth Jepkosgei,&quot; he says. The Kip Keino stadium in Eldoret is where Jelimo&apos;s athletics career began. The stadium, halfway up a hill outside of the town centre, has small brick and iron-sheet stands along two sides and grass embankments at the ends. It was here in 2006 that she won the 200m in a weekend race open to schoolgirls and amateurs. On a recent Saturday, more than a thousand athletes took part in a similar event, hoping to catch the eye of the coaches, agents and sponsors who sat on white plastic chairs in the VIP section of the main stand. While athletes have poured money into Eldoret real estate, little appears to have been spent at the stadium. The track is laid with red dirt, fresh white chalk divides the lanes. By the end of the 10,000m the runners&apos; legs are splattered with chalk and clay. The hurdles used for the steeplechase are old and crooked. The starting pistol stops working, so the starter bangs two bits of wood together. There are problems at the end of the races too. A team of eight timers, stopwatches in hand, collectively provide the official times for each athlete. After each race one of the timers shouts out &quot;number one&quot; and everyone else yells back with the winner&apos;s time. Then he does the same for the runner-up, and so on. For the 100m heats the disparity between one timer&apos;s number and another&apos;s is as much as three-tenths of a second. The main official chooses a number roughly in the middle and moves on. One of those sitting in the VIP area is Daniel Komen. At the height of his career, in the mid-1990s, Komen was earning several thousand dollars each race. In a single grand prix, he says, he won $250,000. Komen bought properties in Nairobi and the UK, as well as several in Eldoret, where he now owns a 300-acre farm, a six-storey block of flats, and two private schools. His parents were both farmers, not particularly well-off. &quot;Sports has changed my life,&quot; he says with some understatement. The money, and the way they have spent it, has made athletes here part of the establishment. Mothers ask them to pay school fees, elders ask them to help fund funerals. When the community asks for a contribution, they see it as their duty to help. Those communities have suffered terribly in recent years. More than 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes following the flawed presidential elections at the end of 2007. Reports later indicated that much of the violence in the Rift Valley between the Kikuyu and Kalenjin peoples had been planned by leading politicians and financed by local businessmen. International Crisis Group alleged that rich Rift Valley athletes had helped to bankroll some of the militia groups. Athletes vigorously denied any involvement in the violence and pointed out that many of them were unable to stick to their training schedules because of the unrest. More than a year on, it is a subject no one in Eldoret wants to talk about. A deal struck in February 2008 between Kibaki and Odinga, then the opposition leader, saw the two men agree to share power. The deal ended the violence but the underlying problems have not gone away. The coalition has been rocked by corruption scandals and a failure to deal with land issues. Jelimo&apos;s meeting with Kibaki and Odinga was one of the few occasions when the two rivals have been seen in public together. On the surface things appear to have returned to normal in Eldoret, but it wouldn&apos;t take much to light the fuse again. &quot;It is like a volcano,&quot; Barnaba Korir told me. Those involved in athletics here insist that there has been no trouble between coaches and runners from different parts of the country. During the post-election violence, Jelimo was training in Embu, a majority Kikuyu area, without any problem. &quot;In Kenya we have differences,&quot; Jelimo admits. &quot;But when you unite, do the right thing, everything is going to be fine.&quot; The team which represented Kenya at the Olympics included athletes from several different communities. &quot;One of the things that unites Kenyans is athletics,&quot; said Jelimo. And it&apos;s true that her celebrity is not limited to Kalenjin areas \u2013 Kikuyus are just as proud of her achievements. Her goal this summer is to provide more moments of unity. The world record for the 800m currently stands at 1:53.28. By the end of last summer Jelimo&apos;s personal best was down to 1:54.01. &quot;I have tried several times but it&apos;s not easy. Can you imagine? Taking one second off it is a problem.&quot; She leans back in the armchair and laughs. &quot;It&apos;s not easy, it&apos;s not easy.&quot; She doesn&apos;t think breaking her personal best will be too hard though. &quot;For sure, I&apos;d be very disappointed [not to]. By the end of June. Maybe by the beginning.&quot; It doesn&apos;t quite work out that way. By the middle of June she has lost her 100% record, coming sixth at an event in Rabat and seventh in Eugene, Oregon. Her time in Eugene is a full 11 seconds outside her personal best. Korir and her coaches withdrew her from the European season and brought her back to Kapsabet to focus on August&apos;s World Championships in Berlin. Jelimo&apos;s poor times pierced the aura of invincibility she built up in 2008 but her team are not worried yet. &quot;She will be ready for the World Championships,&quot; Korir says with confidence. &quot;You&apos;ll see, she will be ready.&quot; After we finish talking Jelimo wanders outside to hang up the washing, placing clothes over the wire fence that surrounds the compound. Unlike most Kenyans with money, she has no domestic staff. Her life is as normal as it can be for a millionaire Olympic champion who is still a teenager. &quot;My career comes first. Why do I need to invest? Some people here do not understand. For now, I want to focus on my training and my running, but nothing else at the moment.&quot; One project can&apos;t wait though. There are too many children in Kapsabet and too few schools to educate them. Jelimo pays school fees for several of her siblings and a handful of cousins but her plan is to build a school: &quot;A very nice school that will motivate people.&quot; Parents tend to give the education of boys priority over the schooling of girls. &quot;A girl might go to primary school for one, two, three years and then drop out. They have no money so they say, &apos;Oh I might get married.&apos; It&apos;s a big problem. What can we do?&quot; She answers her own question. &quot;Investing in education is not expensive.&quot; The school, and an education charity that will pay school fees for local girls, will be launched later this year. For all her talk about focusing on her career, she is already planning for the future. Korir thinks Jelimo and her husband should try for scholarships at an American university. He used to be an athlete too, a 1,500m runner with Olympic dreams. He picked up an injury at the national trials for the Barcelona Games in 1992 and never raced again. His university education helped him move into business. Even if Jelimo retires tomorrow she shouldn&apos;t ever have money worries. But she knows what she will do when her career comes to an end. &quot;I\u00a0will sit in an office and work, a profession. That is what I want to do. It will be normal.&quot; \u2022 Steve Bloomfield has written on cycling in Rwanda and South African football for OSM this year."}, {"sentences": ["When Rio, Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid line up to contest the 2016 bid later this year, there will be echoes of London&apos;s pitch in all of them."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics & the media", "London", "Regeneration", "Sport", "UK news", "Politics", "Society", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-26T21:08:28Z", "title": "After the Olympic games: Tough task to change the outlook in east London", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/26/olympics-2012-regeneration-east-end", "article": "Barcelona stands alone among modern Olympic hosts in succeeding in using the games to not only boost its profile and host the biggest sporting show on earth but to regenerate rundown parts of the city. What was promised in Singapore in 2005 was bolder still \u2013 to use the London games to completely overhaul a rundown corner of east London and boost employment, raise ambitions and change lives. At the heart of the bid that won the games for London was a vow not only to change the nation&apos;s attitude to sport but to &quot;transform the East End&quot;. When Rio, Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid line up to contest the 2016 bid later this year, there will be echoes of London&apos;s pitch in all of them. In the battle to secure political and public backing for the games once won, the argument that they could provide an engine for wholesale redevelopment of one of the most deprived parts of the capital was regularly heard. &quot;I remain supremely confident that in the summer of 2012 we will wow the world with a spectacular fortnight of great sport, entertainment and fun,&quot; said London mayor Boris Johnson ahead of milestone. &quot;However, I am extremely proud that, even now, the world can witness the immense skills and technical expertise that is transforming a wasteland into a brand-new quarter for our great city in breathtaking time.&quot; Those constructing the venues say thinking about what they will be used for afterwards has been built into the planning in a way no previous games has managed. The Olympic Delivery Authority chairman, John Armitt, said: &quot;How people judge the London Olympics in 2020 is the most important thing. We want them to feel that the games left a lasting legacy and not just a two-week party.&quot; The Olympic Park Legacy Company chaired by Lady Ford, the former English Partnerships chair who oversaw the sale that transformed the Millennium Dome to the successful O2, and due to be headed by chief executive Andrew Altman, an American whose redevelopment work in Washington DC has been lauded, will have to hit the ground running when it officially begins work in October. Ford has caused ripples by suggesting she will look again at plans to reduce the \u00a3538m stadium to a 25,000-capacity athletics stadium immediately after the games. She wants to keep the idea of it remaining at 55,000 or 80,000 open while options including the 2018 football World Cup bid are explored. Robertson believes the idea of a Premier League football club becoming the anchor tenant for the stadium must be re-explored if the park is to be economically viable. But Jowell is firmly against reopening that debate, insisting the plan for a 25,000-seat capacity athletics stadium is the right one. Ford has also called for big ideas and bold thinking to make the park attractive enough to draw visitors from around London and the rest of the country and has talked ambitiously about it becoming the equivalent of New York&apos;s Central Park, with sport at its heart. The project will take decades rather than years but there is also an acknowledgement that temporary reasons will have to be found to keep the park busy and interesting in order to avoid a post-games lull. But significant tensions bubble away beneath the surface. The surrounding boroughs are adamant that they don&apos;t want to be saddled with the costs of running venues that will almost certainly require ongoing subsidy. Instead, Ford will look for commercial partners and anchor tenants. Newham&apos;s mayor, Sir Robin Wales, is still sore about the decision not to include a leisure pool element within the spectacular \u00a3244m Aquatics Centre and angry that local boroughs have not been consulted about the mix of housing within the \u00a31.1bn athletes&apos; village that will host 17,000 athletes during the games and be converted into flats afterwards. The ODA and the boroughs are agreed that the venues and park in themselves will not drive regeneration. More important for Wales is the focus and attention the Olympics has brought to the area and the possibility of using it as a tool to create jobs and bridge the gap with more prosperous parts of the capital. &quot;As far as I&apos;m aware, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s ever changed a local community. But it does get your attention and you need to grab the attention,&quot; said Wales. &quot;Will we succeed? We have a chance. It&apos;s up to us to seize the moment.&quot; Jowell is adamant that the \u00a3350m allocated within the \u00a39.3bn budget to transform the park for post-games use will be sufficient. &quot;Of course there will be a sense of anti-climax when the games have ended,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s when the excitement of recasting this park as a national destination for sport, leisure, culture and business starts. We have already anticipated the legacy needs in a way no other Olympic city has.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Strange but true: In Tokyo in 2005, while Morrison was exhibiting in a group show, he and fellow Rockwell founder Christian Ward were asked to make an intricate castle out of sugar cubes stuck together with icing, which was then sunk into a giant vat of tea in front of a cheering crowd."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-29T11:25:46Z", "title": "Artist of the week 51: Alex Gene Morrison", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/29/artist-alex-gene-morrison", "article": "Levitating relics, exploding skulls and ectoplasm \u2013 the paintings of Alex Gene Morrison are undeniably creepy. A self-confessed fan of low-budget slasher movies, Morrison&apos;s pictures exude a disconcerting atmosphere of schlock horror in a cloying pastel palette. Pallid colours emerge from bleached-out, vaguely radioactive backgrounds. Slimy acid rain coagulates into sticky pools, forming queasy images of a post-apocalyptic world where reason and reality are subsumed in a gory science fiction. Born in Birmingham in 1975, Morrison describes himself as a child of gaming and skate culture, having witnessed technological advances from Pong to PlayStation. His work draws on this influence in several ways. Many depict soulless interiors, in which faux-religious symbols or artefacts are given iconic significance, as if the viewer were a participant in an action-adventure game. In his animated film Surfin&apos; the Apocalypse (2006), comic-looking ghosts straight out of Pac-Man glide across the screen before melting into liquid; an atomic cloud erupts and fluorescent circles sail across the sky like a pic-n-mix meteor shower. Morrison describes his art as tragicomic. He enjoys the dumb humour of a Hammer horror and purposely focuses on the gauche special effects \u2013 pickled corpses, melting faces \u2013 rather than the spine-chilling atmosphere that became such a fixture in, say, Peter Doig&apos;s early paintings. By combining low and high art \u2013 disposable culture and oil paint \u2013 he reveals the seductive and repulsive qualities of both. Why we like him: For Black Bile, painted in 2007, a monstrous picture of two blue eyes peering out of a shroud against a pale rainbow background.

But in\u00a01945, at the RKO production company, Jane returned to Africa in the shape of Brenda Joyce, who has died aged 92. The wholesome, athletic Joyce, who would always be known as &quot;the second Jane&quot;, made four Tarzan movies opposite Weissmuller. She was first introduced in Tarzan and the Amazons (1945), wearing fashionable London clothes before stripping down to the familiar jungle attire, a loin cloth. Unlike the Irish-born O&apos;Sullivan, Joyce had an American accent, despite the fact that Jane was supposed to be English. There were also slight differences in the character of the two Janes. Boy (Johnny Sheffield) always called O&apos;Sullivan &quot;Mother&quot;, while he addressed Joyce as &quot;Jane&quot;, but the fictional relationships remained as warm as ever. However, Joyce disliked Weissmuller, who would continually make (unrequited) sexual advances. &quot;How Johnny holds all that manhood tamed under his loincloths defies the laws of nature,&quot; she once told a friend. Brenda Joyce (the name given to her by 20th Century-Fox after Alice Joyce, one of the earliest film stars) was born Betty Leabo in Missouri and raised in Los Angeles. While attending college, she worked as a photographer&apos;s model to help pay her tuition fees. A Fox talent scout noticed her photos and she was immediately offered a contract. She made an instant impact in her screen debut in The Rains Came (1939), playing the flirtatious daughter of American missionaries in India who wants to create a sexual scandal to escape her sheltered life. According to the New York Times, which felt the film betrayed the Louis Bromfield novel, &quot;Brenda Joyce alone among the principals fits the ingenuous Fern Simon role, probably because she is an ing\u00e9nue herself.&quot; She went on to make three films in 1940: Little Old New York, a biopic of Robert Fulton (Richard Greene), inventor of the steamboat, in which she played the daughter of his patron; Maryland, one of Fox&apos;s many Technicolored equine films, in which Joyce has to vie for the love of John Payne with a horse called Cavalier; and Public Deb No 1. The latter is a real curiosity, with Joyce playing a spoiled society girl who is given a public spanking by a red-blooded American waiter (George Murphy) for attending a communist rally. She refuses to abandon her ideology, which she considers fashionable, until becoming disillusioned by Russia&apos;s invasion of Finland. Her rejection is symbolised by a dog lifting his leg on a communist pamphlet. Because the studio promoted Joyce as a sexy, single girl, they were rather miffed when she married a soldier, Owen Ward, in 1941. It seems as though they punished her by casting her in B\u00a0movies with titles such as Private Nurse and Marry the Boss&apos;s Daughter (both 1941). In 1942, both Whispering Ghosts, with an eye-popping cowardly Willie Best facing jokes about him being black, and Little Tokyo, USA, which had white actors yellowed-up to play traitorous Japanese Americans, would be deemed unacceptable today. Thankfully, Tarzan swung to Joyce&apos;s rescue. Tarzan and the Amazons was followed by Tarzan and the Leopard Woman (1946), Tarzan and the Huntress (1947) and Tarzan and the Mermaids (1948), although in all of them Joyce paled beside more exotic heroines.

Between the Tarzan movies, Joyce made several B films for Universal, two with Lon Chaney Jr, Strange Confession and Pillow of Death (both 1945), based on episodes from the Inner Sanctum mystery radio series; The Spider Woman Strikes Back (1946), pitted against Gale Sondergaard in the title role; and Little Giant (1946), with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, playing it straighter than usual as a foil to the comedians. After a painful divorce in 1949, she retired into obscurity, working for a decade (under her real name) in Washington for the department of immigration. She also concealed her cinematic past from staff at the nursing home in Santa Monica where she spent her last years.

Sony&apos;s main rival in the videogaming sector, Nintendo, reported a 66% fall in quarterly operating profit amid a slump in demand for its Wii game console. Sony&apos;s losses marked a reversal from the same period last year, when it posted a profit of \u00a535bn. From April to June this year, the maker of the PlayStation game consoles, Bravia flat-screen televisions and Cyber-shot digital cameras said sales had fallen 19.2% to \u00a51.56tn. The losses were smaller than predicted thanks to the success of cost-cutting enforced by Sony&apos;s chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer. It was also helped by a tailing-off in the yen&apos;s surge and a fledgling recovery on the Tokyo stockmarket. But Stringer, who is cutting 16,000 jobs and closing about 10% of Sony&apos;s plants, is now under pressure to improve sales and catch up with rivals such as Samsung, Nintendo and Apple. Sony admitted it faced an uncertain future and kept its full-year forecast unchanged at a \u00a5110bn operating loss, its first consecutive annual losses since it was listed on the stockmarket in 1958. However, Sony&apos;s chief financial officer, Nobuyuki Oneda, said executives were quietly confident of a much better performance this year. &quot;We are keeping our official forecast but internally we are aiming to at least break even,&quot; he told reporters. Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said Sony had been expected to trim its losses, but added that it could have done more to cut costs. &quot;My first impression is that the results were basically within expectations,&quot; he said. &quot;The figures themselves are no surprise, though of course it&apos;s not positive. Sony is making changes to adapt to the current environment but it still seems to be having trouble keeping up and perhaps should have been a bit more aggressive about cost-cutting.&quot; Sony&apos;s TV business received a boost today with the announcement that it has agreed a joint venture with Sharp to produce and sell large liquid-crystal display panels, with an initial investment of \u00a510bn. Its gaming division had a poor quarter with sales of the PlayStation\u00a03 console falling to 1.1m from 1.6m last year. Sales of its handheld version, the PlayStation Portable, plunged from 3.7m to 1.3m. Nintendo, which has resisted challenges from Sony and Microsoft thanks to the global popularity of its Wii and DS game consoles, said it expected profits to decline this year for the first time in four years. Like other Japanese manufacturers, Nintendo has seen overseas earnings hit hard by the yen&apos;s rise against the dollar and the euro. Its first-quarter operating profit of \u00a540.4bn compares with a \u00a5119.2bn profit last year. Nintendo expects to sell 26m Wii consoles and 30m DS consoles worldwide this year, with analysts predicting a boost in sales when the firm releases new software titles in the run-up to Christmas. Factory output A slew of earnings reports came as data showed Japan&apos;s industrial output achieved its biggest quarterly increase since 1953, fuelling optimism that the country is emerging from its deepest recession since the war. Factory output from April to June rose 8.3%, the economy, trade and industry ministry said, and by 2.4% in June from the previous month. The ministry said the world&apos;s second biggest economy &quot;continues to show an upward movement&quot; thanks to a slight improvement in global demand. Domestic demand is likely to remain flat, however, with retail sales falling 3% in June \u2013 the 10th monthly fall in a row. Firms are expected to continue cutting costs, particularly in personnel. Unemployment, currently at 5.2%, is expected to rise again when the government releases job data tomorrow."}, {"sentences": ["In other words, deflationary expectations are taking hold in both businesses and households.&quot; The availability of cheaper goods sounds attractive, particularly for residents of Tokyo - the world&apos;s most expensive city - but it can lead to over-cautious consumption, and cuts in wages and production."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Japan", "US unemployment and employment data", "Deflation", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-31T09:22:15Z", "title": "Japan: Unemployment rises to six-year high", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/31/japan-unemployment-deflation", "article": "Unemployment in Japan has risen to its highest level for six years, sparking fears that the country&apos;s recovery is being hampered by deflation and weak demand at home. The number of people out of work has risen 31% in the last year to 3.48 million, pushing the jobless rate up to 5.4% in June from 5.2% a month earlier. Job availability also fell to a record low of 43 positions for every 100 job seekers, the government said today. The grim unemployment data was accompanied by a warning that prices fell at a record pace last month, showing that deflationary pressures are haunting the world&apos;s second biggest economy. Core consumer prices, which do not include food, dropped by a record 1.7% in the year to June. But the Nikkei stock average defied the gloomy data and gained 1.9% to close at a 10-month high of 10356. The gains were seen as a reflection of better-than-expected earnings results from some major Japanese companies this week. While recent upturns in exports and factory output suggest that companies may be over the worst of the recession, the effects have yet to be felt among workers and families. Figures showed that average monthly household income fell 3.2% in June from last year, although spending rose by a modest 0.2%, mainly due to higher housing, transport and healthcare costs. About 70% of the fall in consumer prices was attributed to lower fuel costs, but with those omitted, the cost of living still dropped 0.7%. Fears of job losses, coupled with falling wages, have locked spending in a downward spiral for the past four months. Analysts expect the trend to continue, even after the full impact of lower fuel costs is felt. Azusa Kato, an economist at BNP Paribas, said: &quot;The problem is that price falls are spreading to various categories such as food and household items. &quot;Consumers are increasingly leaning towards low prices. In other words, deflationary expectations are taking hold in both businesses and households.&quot; The availability of cheaper goods sounds attractive, particularly for residents of Tokyo - the world&apos;s most expensive city - but it can lead to over-cautious consumption, and cuts in wages and production. Depressed consumer spending is a particular problem in Japan, where it accounts for more than half of the economy. Unemployment is edging closer to the postwar record of 5.5% seen in April 2003. The official figure ignores an estimated 6.07 million excess workers identified in a government report last week. Many of those workers will be at risk of losing their jobs unless production makes a sustained recovery soon. In addition, a labour ministry survey published today said that as many as 290,000 workers on part-time or temporary contracts have lost, or are at risk of losing, their jobs by September. One of the prefectures with the highest numbers of at-risk workers is Aichi prefecture, home of Toyota City."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking from his home in Tsukuba, near Tokyo, Yamada said: &quot;I offer my thanks, but I have no intention of accepting it, even if a formal invitation arrives.&quot; The restaurant debacle aside, he said he and his fiancee had enjoyed a terrific holiday and planned to return to Italy, but at their own expense."], "tags": ["Japan", "Italy", "Restaurants", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-31T11:19:28Z", "title": "Japanese tourist turns down free holiday offered by Italy as apology", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/31/japanese-tourists-italy", "article": "It is the sort of offer that most tourists would jump at: an all-expenses paid return visit to a dream destination, as amends for a sleight by an unscrupulous host.

Layered mountain peaks shrouded in forests capped with smoky wisps of clouds and tiered rice paddies, a dazzling shade of green. So far, so haiku-inspiringly perfect - apart from one unexpected intrusion on the landscape. Centre stage in the tableau of pastoral perfection is a square frame the size of a small house from which are suspended dozens of giant wooden pencils in a rainbow of colours. Contemporary art may be a surprise find in a remote corner of the mountainous Niigata prefecture in central Japan, but the isolated rural region - famous for its heavy snowfall, rice paddies and declining elderly population - is the unlikely setting for the most innovative of art projects, the Echigo-Tsumari Triennial.     Hachi & Seizo Tashima Museum of Picture Book Art. Photograph: Keita Yasukawa    It is the world&apos;s biggest open-air art festival and the fourth Triennial opened last weekend with more than 350 artworks by artists from 38 countries. Sculptures, paintings and installations pepper the landscape and are set amid rice fields, forests, in abandoned schools and vacant wooden houses. Visitors will stumble across trees with staring blue eyes in the heart of a forest and life-sized red figures dotting the rice fields, a postmodern zen garden fashioned from rusted steel refuse and a sea of psychedelic canvases in a school gymnasium.     For Lots of Lost Windows by Akiko Utsumi. Photograph: H.Kuratani    The festival&apos;s geographical dimensions are as vast as its creative ambitions: the 760 sq km site spans a larger area than the 23 wards of central Tokyo, making an exploration of the region a giant art treasure hunt. The best way to explore? Jump on a train in Tokyo for the two-hour ride to Tokamachi and join one of a number of daily group tours, or simply pick up a rental car at the station along with a festival &quot;passport&quot; that provides access to all the artworks, a much-needed art map of the region and an English-language guidebook.  Most visitors use Tokamachi, a small, sleepy city of wide streets, low-rise buildings and lowkey restaurants as a starting point for their art explorations.     Tamugi\u2019s Book by Bili Bidjocka    Opting for the freedom of driving, I set off on a four-wheeled art-searching mission in the area last weekend, negotiating steep winding lanes lined with hydrangea that curved around vivid green rice fields and dense forests set against the layered silhouettes of mountain peaks.  The beauty of the landscape is astonishing and distracting, and so, even though the artworks are indicated by yellow festival road signs, it came as a surprise when one suddenly shifted into focus: a small wooden Hansel and Gretel-style house covered not in sweets but small circular mirrors shimmering in the wind.      Antony Gormley\u2019s Another Singularity. Photograph: Keita Yasukawa    An elderly man with a farmer&apos;s cap was sitting in his makeshift office beside his car and stamped my passport so I could join a young Japanese couple already exploring the artwork. The house - created by Harumi Yukutake - had no back wall, just a space opening onto a view of the fields, reflected endlessly in the thousands of mirrors that lined the inside walls. Further along from the frame of giant pencils, by the Cameroon artist Pascale Marthine Tayou, were mirrors and golden pebbles; and a vast abstract window frame in a field with a curtain flapping in the breeze.  The area the festival covers is so vast that even with a couple of days it is impossible to see all the artworks so, rather unscientifically, I chose to stop at places I liked the sound of or whenever a yellow sign or roadside artwork caught my eye. The works are varied, but of a consistently high quality, with a few names recognisable from galleries in London, Paris and New York. The piece I really wanted to see was a traditional wooden house which has been transformed by Antony Gormley for his piece, Another Singularity. I slipped off my shoes to step inside the quiet, dark space, where the interior division walls have been removed and the building&apos;s shell filled with countless bungee ropes, arranged to create the outline of a human form in the centre. I caught a minute with Gormley as he was opening the artwork during my visit. &quot;I spent time drinking sake with some locals and the former residents of the house last night,&quot; he said. &quot;They were all lovely and I was delighted at their reaction. One 83-year-old woman who was born in this house lay down on the floor and stared at it for a long time before declaring that she liked it.&quot;  Many of the empty buildings taken over by artists were once schools, an eerie fact that has been used to appropriate effect by some of the artists involved, such as Christian Boltanski and Jean Kalman, a French pair who have created a sinister world of empty classrooms, where fans whirl and the ominous sound of a heartbeat plays. I left clutching the unexpected souvenir of a CD recording of my own slightly raised heartbeat.  In another, Tomoko Mukaiyama has made an ethereal, swirling maze of 12,000 white silk dresses, with red clothes stained by the menstrual or &quot;moon blood&quot; at the centre. And elsewhere Seizo Tashima, has created a sculptural version of a pop-up picture book from candy coloured driftwood, which tells the tale of its last three young pupils. That so many vacant buildings are available is a rather sad outcome of the area&apos;s depopulation. As in much of rural Japan, the decline in the farming industry has carried youngsters away to the cities, leaving these remote villages with a shrinking elderly community to fend for itself. I stopped for lunch back at Tokamachi for a mixture of freshly made soba noodles, tempura and vegetables. Although most of the human life I had seen while driving between the artworks were older folk, here it was clear from the clientele that the area has changed from a sleepy backwater since the triennale launched here in 2000. Older locals sat beside scruffy Tokyo art students and European artists.  The next stop on my art route was Fukutake House - another former school in Myokayama village which now hosts nine of the leading Asian art galleries.  Its original green boards, lockers and stark corridors, are offset by vast psychedelic etchings in the gymnasium, a sea of butterflies floating below a classroom ceiling and camouflage paintings on the walls of the former staff storage room. Outside the school, a crowd of smiling elderly villagers was standing behind a stall serving homemade soy powder rice cakes, homegrown tomatoes and mountain vegetables in miso, and a slightly less palatable pond weed delicacy. Among them was Kazuko Kokai, a 66-year-old grandmother dressed in a flowery apron and pink wellies, with a bowl of potatoes in hand who burst into laughter when I asked how she felt about the invasion of artists. &quot;Modern art? I haven&apos;t got a clue what it means,&quot; she said. &quot;I went to this school as did my grandparents, my husband and my children. But the school closed down many years ago and there are only three children in the village today. So if artists want to come and use this building and other spaces and it brings people to the area, then we welcome them.&quot; It has not always been that way. In 1996 Fram Kitagawa, a well-known Tokyo gallerist, was asked by the prefectural authorities in Niigata to come up with a proposal to bring art to the region to help revitalise it. But according to Kitagawa, it was not a smooth journey.  &quot;Every single politician in the area was opposed to the festival at first. It took four years and about 2,000 meetings to change their minds. But art can play a very important role in revitalising elderly people who have lost their hope, identity and vision of the future.&quot; Light housesArt exhibits cum hotels To take your experience of the exhibition to a more involved level, it&apos;s possible to spend the night in two of the artworks \u2013 homes that were turned into hotels by international artists for previous exhibitions. At the Dream House, Serbian artist Marina Abramovic has transformed an atmospheric, rickety old wooden house, with four single bedrooms. I ate dinner at a low table with three other guests (all young, art-loving Tokyoites) before taking a dip in a hot copper bath filled with fresh herbs. Next, I was dressed in a red all-in-one body suit, not dissimilar to a Teletubbies outfit, and led to the &quot;red room&quot;. Centre stage was a coffin bed, with a pillow made from marble (and thankfully no lid) where I spent a surprisingly comfortable night until the sun came shining through the red-tinted window, infusing the room with the shade. All guests are asked to record their dreams in a big black book beside the bed. At the second hotel, The House of Light, created by American artist James Turrell, a modern-built traditional Japanese house sleeps 12 in three rooms. It&apos;s a haven of clean lines, atmospheric light installations and traditional tatami floors, with a large bath and valley views. After a delicious bento box dinner, we unrolled the futons in the main room, lay down \u2013 and waited for the rain to stop so we could press the big button in the hall that would roll back the ceiling to reveal a perfect signature Turrell sky space. It took several attempts of rushing outside each hour to see if it was still raining, but eventually the skies cleared and we were able to lie back on our futons and drift in and out of sleep while watching clouds rolling endlessly through a square frame.  Another accommodation option, though unrelated to the festival, is Hinanoyado Chitose, one of the best hot-spring &quot;onsen&quot; inns in the region, in Matsunoyama Onsen village.

An urban catwalk of bizarre fashions and manga pixies with eyes like dinner plates. Tokyo: stamping ground of Godzilla, land of flat-pack commuters. A cultural fracture in Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story; a postmodern glitch in fiction by David Mitchell and William Gibson; a 24-hour high-tech dreamwork. But what was Tokyo before it became the future? That question runs through Occupied City, the second part of a projected novel trilogy, and David Peace&apos;s sequence is heading towards an unsettling conclusion: that the dream was built \u2013 or rebuilt \u2013 on a nightmarish substrate of postwar brutality. Tokyo Year Zero \u2013 set in 1946 \u2013 was the Year of the Dog: scavenger, pack animal, beast in the house. A series of young women was sexually assaulted and strangled, while a corrupt police force was caught between an abject population and a thriving organised crime syndicate. Dog ate dog and developed a taste for it, in this shattered city, to which Peace brought the grit-flecked eye he had trained on 1970s Yorkshire. Some things, like the unleavening gallows humour of the Red Riding quartet, didn&apos;t quite translate, but Year Zero was a gripping performance: crime fiction as grime fiction, propelled by a kind of experimentation so unusual in the genre that one sharp critic promptly dubbed it &quot;avant-noir&quot;. Now, in 1948, the Year of the Rat is about to arrive. Verminous, solitary, a vector of disease, the Rat rules a Tokyo occupied twice over, by the army of General MacArthur and by the unquiet\u00a0ghosts of murder victims. We begin with\u00a0the facts.\u00a0Dressed as a government medical officer, a man walks into a downtown branch of the Teikoku bank.\u00a0Warning against an outbreak of dysentery, he explains that he\u00a0has been\u00a0sent to inoculate the bank&apos;s staff, who then willingly\u00a0drink the poison he pours into\u00a0their teacups. Sixteen drink. Twelve suffer a\u00a0wretched, painful death. With the structure of the book, Peace pays homage to the conflicting narratives of Akutagawa&apos;s short story &quot;In a Grove&quot; and to Kurosawa&apos;s filmed version, Rashomon. &quot;This city is a seance,&quot; declares one character and so is the novel, split between 12 ghosts in a distribution of narrative that, surprisingly, makes Occupied City a tighter read, with greater momentum, than its predecessor. Toning down the hammering repetitions and bewildering first-person confusions of Tokyo Year Zero has made for a more accommodating book, though at times characters are reduced to mere conduits for hearsay and supposition. In Occupied City, the military scientist and the detective, the killer and the victim are all swept along in the flow of contaminated data through a contaminated polis. A residue of myth and conspiracy theory still clings to the Teigin incident, as the Japanese call the Teikoku bank murders, and painter Sadamichi Hirasawa spent almost 40 years on death row after recanting a doubtful confession. Some \u2013 and David Peace is of this number \u2013 proclaim Hirasawa&apos;s innocence, believing that the method of poisoning points to the involvement of Unit 731, Japan&apos;s covert wartime chemical and biological weapons division. Military-industrial conspiracy; police cover-up. No room here for chance, for the lone wolf, or the rat. That may well be the point, but this apophenia, the hyper-associative thinking that fuels Peace&apos;s imagination, is such that its wilder flights can sound like a paranoid riff on Forster: only connect\u2026 everything.

A dinner hauled on to the pier by fishermen, simply served according to local traditions, and eaten within sight of the breakers, is the quickest way I know to escape from the tourist ghetto. For the length of a meal, at least, I feel like I am living like a local. In my career as a roaming piscivore, I&apos;ve enjoyed some fairly extreme cuisine. In Madrid, I once paid far too much for a bowl of baby eels, known as pibales or angulas (killed the traditional way, in an infusion of tobacco, fried in olive oil with chiles and garlic, and eaten with a wooden fork), and it&apos;s a meal I&apos;ve regretted ever since: eels should be allowed to grow to their full length of a metre and a half, not scooped up in their millions at the mouths of rivers when they&apos;re still the size of matchsticks. I&apos;ve supped on hairy crabs in Shanghai (their claws are covered with golden filaments), gooseneck barnacles in Galicia (half a foot long, with blackened leathery shafts that end in a pink-and-white mosaic shelled tip, like alien phalluses), and shiokara in Tokyo (fermented squid entrails, an acquired taste). And as much as I enjoyed eating the Proven\u00e7al dish friture - hundreds of anchovy-like sand-smelts, deep-fried and served like so many chips with eyes - there was something awesomely decadent, in a Goyaesque way, about consuming entire generations with every mouthful.  These days, I am far more selective about my fish eating. In 1988, we hit peak fish, with the worldwide catch topping 78 million tonnes; it has been in decline ever since. Stocks of species after species have crashed, from cod in the Atlantic to bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. Gourmet trends have spelled doom for such formerly obscure species as Chilean sea bass, monkfish and orange roughy. Almost half the fish on our plates is now a product of aquaculture - and many farmed species, including shrimp and salmon, are fattened with the ground-up bodies of smaller, but perfectly edible species. These days, I tend to favour the middle and bottom of the oceanic food chain, eschewing tuna, swordfish, and salmon, and chewing on mackerel, sardines and herring. That doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;ve lost my sense of adventure. Many European cuisines make a virtue of using small, and delicious, species from the lower reaches of the food chain, so a trip to a seaside shack or a chippy need not induce guilt. Here&apos;s my address book for eight sustainable seafood eating experiences in Europe that, as the Michelin guides put it, valent le voyage. Chez Jacky, Riec-sur-Belon, France Raising oysters is a form of aquaculture that actually benefits the oceans: the bivalves feed on phytoplankton, which, if left to proliferate, can lead to harmful blooms of algae. For my money, the flat Belon oysters of Brittany - Ostrea edulis, Europe&apos;s original oyster, which once grew in vast natural banks from Denmark to Portugal - are the best. A great place to sample them is on the terrace of Chez Jacky, an oceanfront restaurant on the southern shore of Brittany. Savor a dozen slightly metallic Belons, with their hint of hazelnut, served on a bed of seaweed (never ice) over a pichet of muscadet, as you watch the sailboats passing at the mouth of the Belon River. \u2022 One dozen Belons: \u20ac23.

Restaurant Auguste, Paris In North America, a growing number of restaurateurs are championing sustainable seafood, which means you can buy faux-nagi (unagi made with Canadian black cod rather than eel) at Casson Trenor&apos;s Tataki in San Francisco, blackened arctic char from environmentally correct farms at Rick Moonen&apos;s RM Seafood in Las Vegas, and line-caught albacore tuna from Robert Clark&apos;s C Restaurant in Vancouver. European chefs have been slower to catch on, but in Paris, at least one toqued head is paying attention: after years in three-star kitchens, Ga&apos;l Orieux is now trying to avoid such overfished, staples of French cuisine as sole, turbot, and cod. At his seventh-arrondissement restaurant Auguste (the name is a hommage to Escoffier, his inspiration), Orieux, who hails from Brittany, is one of the few Parisian chefs to experiment with lesser known, but more sustainably-fished species such as red drum, tacaud (poor cod), and black mullet.

As much as I love anchovies, one of the signature foods at Txepetxa, stock levels in the Bay of Biscay are at an all-time low. So give these flavourful little fish a break, be adventurous, and reach instead for a plate of erizo de mar - literally, hedgehogs of the sea. The sea urchins are served only a few hours out of the water here, and the taste is a burst of saline, mitigated by the winey, umami flavour of the plankton-infused flesh.

Restaurante Mira Mar, Peniche, Portugal Sardines, those abundant schooling fish that are too often ground up to feed pigs and salmon, make an excellent meal - and not just in sandwiches. North of Lisbon, the port of Peniche is famous for its fat, fleshy sardines, served barbecued within sight of the wooden fishing boats that net them just off the coast. Almost all of the seashore restaurants in Peniche grill sardines to perfection, but I favour the down-to-earth Mira Mar. Dinner comes with soft buns, black olives, sardine paste, a tub of soft, mild cheese, and butter; the waiter bills you only for what you use.

Inside, six people chosen at random from millions of voters became the first Japanese people for three generations to decide whether a fellow citizen walks free or pays for his crimes. The jurors \u2013 five women and a man \u2013 were chosen from a pool of 47 people this morning to take their seats in court later in the day. Their task: to decide an appropriate punishment for Katsuyoshi Fujii, a 72-year-old man accused of stabbing a neighbour to death earlier this year. They and three professional judges at Tokyo district court will sentence Fujii, who has admitted killing 66-year-old Haruko Bun. The lay judges must arrive at a majority decision and have the assent of at least one professional judge for the sentence to stand. Until today the only exposure Japanese below a certain age have had to genuine courtroom drama has been textbook accounts of historical trials or cross-examinations by Raymond Burr in TV repeats of Perry Mason. Modern Japanese trials, by contrast, managed to turn potentially dramatic murder trials into something approaching the public reading of a weighty legal text. Japan introduced trial by jury in 1928 but abolished it in 1943, when its leaders tightened their grip on power at home as the tide of war began to turn against them. While justice officials today hailed a new era of openness, the men and women expected to dispense justice have mixed feelings about their new role. Some look forward to the prospect of handing out justice to their fellow citizens, while others live in dread of the day they might be called on to consider sending another human being to the gallows. A recent survey found that one in four potential jurors were unwilling to serve, even though their absence could land them a 100,000 yen (\u00a3600) fine. The landmark legal change came amid widespread criticism of the glacial pace of trials for serious crimes and the absence of lawyers during the questioning of suspects \u2013 a practice police have exploited to force confessions that are later used in court. Verdicts and sentences were decided by panels of judges, with 99% of criminal trials ending in a conviction. Penal reformers hope the &quot;citizen judges&quot; will be more sympathetic to defendants who say they were forced to confess. &quot;With the change, trials will become more democratic,&quot; said the justice minister, Eisuke Sato. &quot;We hope to achieve a justice system that is speedier, more accessible and reliable.&quot; Protesters outside the Tokyo district court said the new emphasis on speed \u2013 a verdict in Fujii&apos;s case is expected on Thursday \u2013 would allow miscarriages of justice to continue. &quot;Lay judge trials only force unwilling people to take part in trials, and their conclusions will be the same as those made by professional judges [under the old system],&quot; said Shunkichi Takayama, a lawyer. Legal experts have conducted hundreds of mock trials in recent years to allay fears among potential jurors. The public&apos;s fascination with western-style justice will intensify when lay judges are asked to rule on a case in which the death penalty is an option. Although capital punishment enjoys wide public support, progressive lawyers believe jurors will find the noose a punishment too far. In recent years Japan has come under fire for its enthusiastic use of capital punishment, just as the practice is being abandoned in other countries. Last week it executed three men on death row, bringing the number of hangings to seven this year. It hanged 15 people last year, the highest number since 1975."}, {"sentences": ["Dr Takashi Tsuji, from the Tokyo University of Science, and his colleagues first removed the upper first molars from five-week-old mice."], "tags": ["Tissue engineering", "Medical research", "Science", "Japan", "World news", "Stem cells", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-03T21:00:00Z", "title": "Scientists use stem cells to grow fully functioning teeth in mice", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/aug/03/bioengineered-teeth-grown-in-mice", "article": "Fully functioning teeth have been grown from stem cells planted in the mouths of mice, scientists said today. The researchers in Japan hope the breakthrough could prove not only to be an important step towards being able to replace teeth in humans but eventually replacing organs, lost or damaged as a result of disease, injury or ageing. The technology has already been used to develop limited tissues that could be transplanted into animals. But the new experiment was the first time a fresh three dimensional organ had been grown in a living animal from just a few cells. &quot;Tooth germs&quot; \u2013 the tiny buds that appear before a tooth grows \u2013 were developed by the Japan-based team, according to a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr Takashi Tsuji, from the Tokyo University of Science, and his colleagues first removed the upper first molars from five-week-old mice. Then three weeks later, after confirming that no remaining components of the tooth root were present, they transplanted the germs into the jawbones of the mice. The seed-like tissues contained all the cells and instructions necessary to grow a tooth. A green fluorescent protein was used to track the genes in the buds, which eventually grew into fully formed teeth with all the usual structures including enamel and blood vessels. Tests confirmed that the bioengineered teeth were &quot;fully functioning&quot;. The study said their hardness was comparable to normal teeth, enabling proper chewing. Nerve fibres could grow throughout and responded to pain stimulation, an important protection mechanism for the teeth. The study said the technique could provide a prelude to &quot;the ability to grow new, fully functional bioengineered organs inside the body from stem cells or other germ cells. &quot;Current approaches to the development of regenerative therapies have been influenced by our understanding of embryonic development, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering technology. &quot;The ultimate goal of regenerative therapy is to develop fully functioning bioengineered organs which work in cooperation with surrounding tissues to replace organs that were lost or damaged as a result of disease, injury, or ageing. &quot;We propose this technology as a model for future organ replacement therapies. This study represents a substantial advance and emphasises the potential for bioengineered organ replacement in future regenerative therapies.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Now, the first trial using this system \u2013 a case of murder involving elderly neighbours \u2013 has just started in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-05T15:30:43Z", "title": "Courting controversy in Japan | David Murakami Wood", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/05/japan-courts", "article": "Japan&apos;s courts are not usually the subject of massive popular interest in the country. Salacious details of criminal cases fill the pages of the popular weekly magazines and provide fodder for cheap TV shows, but the court system itself is seen as distant, formal and, above all, dull. The courts have long been seen as a rubber-stamping exercise for cases already decided by confession (often coerced) in police cells, and the minutely detailed dossiers of public prosecutors. Added to this was a growing feeling that the courts were too remote from people. So in 2004, a law was passed to introduce a new method of adjudication for some criminal trials, beginning in May 2009. Now, the first trial using this system \u2013 a case of murder involving elderly neighbours \u2013 has just started in Tokyo. Some have characterised this saiban-inas a &quot;jury&quot; system, but it is actually a lay-judge system. Whereas in the UK 12 ordinary people are called by the courts to hear evidence and make a judgment on the guilt of the accused, in the new Japanese system six citizens join three professional judges. They not only hear evidence, but are also able to question witnesses and help decide the sentence. It seems an onerous task. So it is not surprising that many who were originally shortlisted for lay-judge duty but did not make the final six for the first trial are relieved to have escaped \u2013 not because, they found it inconvenient, but because of the burden of responsibility they felt. This has particular cultural components. Strongly stated opinions and absolutes are not favoured in Japan, and people like to keep options open. But why this particular, strange, hybrid system? The answer is that Japan had an almost identical system from 1928 to 1943. Progressives had tried to introduce a full Anglo-American style 12-person jury, but judges, and conservative and nationalist politicians opposed this and forced a compromise: the saiban-in system. The old system was in place for a very short time: it was hardly suited to the militarist regime that gained control in the 1930s, and was eventually ended. However, opposition seems rather different this time around. In the UK, civil libertarians have been fighting to defend jury systems, but in Japan civil liberties arguments have been marshalled by protesters against the new system. Opponents argue that the selection process violates privacy by forcing citizens&apos; personal views to be exposed, and is authoritarian because citizens cannot refuse to serve except for health reasons. Some have even likened the system to a lynch mob, because Japan still has the death penalty. However, dig deeper, and underlying these arguments are conservative concerns and the once-again rising influence of nationalists akin to those of the late 1920s: defence of the &quot;professionalism&quot; of judges, and the arguments about the quasi-sacred integrity and necessary distance of courts from popular influence. More generally, even though this system is the result of a bill passed five years ago, it seems to reflect populist desperation from the increasingly unpopular ruling Liberal Democratic party, which faces defeat for the first time in decades in the general elections this month. If nothing else, the controversy over the legal system has excited Japanese people about the courts, and whatever happens in the future, goings-on in court that result in interest and engagement in criminal justice has to be a good thing."}, {"sentences": ["The first bullet train, the shinkansen, was introduced just in time for the Tokyo Olympics in 1964.", "The new E5 series, to be introduced in 2011, will reach 199mph, making it possible to travel from Tokyo to Aomori \u2013 419 miles away \u2013 in three hours.", "More than 150 million people a year use the bullet train service between Tokyo and Osaka \u2013 the most popular route \u2013 while Japan Airlines (JAL) flew 3.9 million people from Tokyo to Osaka, Kobe and nearby Kansai International airports in the same period.", "In 2025 Japan plans to launch its next generation of bullet trains: a service that will connect Tokyo and Nagoya in around 40 minutes using maglev \u2013 magnetic levitation \u2013 trains which are much faster than conventional trains.", "The original said that the N700 series entered service in 1999, and gave 2020 as the launch year for the Tokyo-Nagoya maglev train."], "tags": ["Rail transport", "Japan", "World news", "Technology", "Travel and transport", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-05T22:11:13Z", "title": "High-speed rail in Japan: From bullets to magic leviathan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/05/high-speed-rail-japan", "article": "Travellers in Japan have enjoyed the luxury of high-speed rail travel for more than four decades.

Intelligence agencies around the world are reduced to poring over photos of Kim to ascertain his\u00a0state of health and therefore the country&apos;s stability. Much of what we know about him comes from the memoirs of his former sushi chef. But over the years, more information has emerged. The border with China has become porous, with people moving back and forth and some in the area using Chinese mobile phone networks with smuggled handsets. Until 1987 no visitors from &quot;non-aligned&quot; countries were allowed; by 1993, around 50 western tourists a year were visiting.

And then there are the defectors, who paint an alarming picture of widespread human rights abuses, although many of their accounts date back to the 90s. According to a report from the UN High Commission for Human Rights this year: &quot;The UN General Assembly has recognised and condemned severe Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea human rights violations including the use of torture, public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, and forced labour; the absence of due process and the rule of law; death sentences for political offenses; and a large number of prison camps. &quot;The government operates a semi-hereditary system of social discrimination whereby all citizens are classified into 53 subgroups under overall security ratings \u2013 &apos;core&apos;, &apos;wavering&apos;, and &apos;hostile&apos; \u2013 based on their family&apos;s perceived loyalty to the regime. This rating determines virtually every facet of a person&apos;s life, including employment and educational opportunities, place of residence, access to medical facilities, and even access to stores.&quot; Leadership North Korea is the world&apos;s only communist dynasty: Kim Jong-il inherited power on the death of his father Kim Il-sung in 1994, although the latter remains eternal president and his son is instead Dear Leader. Official biographers say that the 67-year-old was born in a military camp on Baekdu Mountain, his birth foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow over the mountain and a new star in the heavens. According to Soviet records, however, he was born in a Siberian village. In addition to his celestial endorsement, Kim is a three-time elected member of the country&apos;s rubber-stamp parliament. The country goes to the poll once every five years and there is one candidate per seat; turnout in 2003 was 99.9%. Kim is said to have a fear of flying; his state visits to Russia and China have been made by armoured train. Only once is his voice thought to have been broadcast: in 1992, during a military parade, he told the crowd: &quot;Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People&apos;s Army!&quot; While many have portrayed him as a clownish and eccentric figure \u2013 an image no doubt reinforced by his characterisation in Team America: World Police \u2013 others say he is smart and even witty. Shin Sang-ok \u2013 a South Korean film director who was kidnapped with his actor wife in 1978 so that he could build a North Korean film industry \u2013 has described a man naive in some ways but shrewd in others. He said Kim, a huge film buff, tended to regard Rambo and James Bond films as records of reality. Yet at one party, when band members rapturously applauded their leader, Kim turned to Shin and told him: &quot;That&apos;s all fake.&quot; His former sushi chef described a man with a violent temper and a love for large quantities of Hennessy VSOP cognac. Banquets used to last up to four days; his Pleasure Brigade, handpicked young women, provided the entertainment, sometimes ordered to dance naked. And that&apos;s about it. Although, according to North Korean media, Kim&apos;s accomplishments are legion. His official biography says he has composed six operas and according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, he has described himself as an internet\u00a0expert. He is thought to have finally annointed the youngest of his three sons Kim Jong-un as his heir and &quot;Brilliant Comrade&quot;, following his reported stroke last year. Even less is known about this leader-in-waiting. Educated in Bern, Switzerland, the 25-year-old is said to be a basketball fan. His former classmates say he also spoke highly of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The Dear Leader&apos;s eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, is believed to have fallen from favour after Japanese authorities caught him trying to enter their country on a fake passport in 2001, apparently seeking to visit Tokyo Disneyland. But most analysts suggest that whoever takes over will be essentially a figurehead or arbitrator rather than a sole ruler. They suggest the elite is composed of three broad interest groups rather than factions \u2013 the Kim family, the military and other officials \u2013 who know that their fates are intertwined and who all wish to maintain the status quo. Whether their planning for life after the Dear Leader works in practice will be another matter; some believe factionalism or a military takeover could lead to the collapse of the state. History The Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea was\u00a0formally established in 1948. Korea had been divided at the 38th parallel following the defeat of its occupier Japan in the second world war; the Soviet Union administered the North and the United States the South. When they were unable to reach a deal, separate governments were established \u2013 both maintaining they were the legitimate rulers of the whole peninsula. Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese resistance fighter, took the reins in the North. In 1950, following a series of clashes along the border zone, the North invaded the South with the approval of the Soviet Union, but only limited military support. Despite initial successes, UN forces led by the US pushed the troops back and captured Pyongyang. China&apos;s entry into the war led to a bloody stalemate; around 2.5 million people are believed to have died. A ceasefire was eventually agreed in 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed and the Demilitarised Zone is one of the most heavily militarised places in the world. Relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly in the 60s , leaving the country more reliant on China, but Kim developed an ideology known as juche or self-reliance \u2013 as well as a personality cult \u2013 which thrives to this day under his son. Culture, sport and the media North Korea is famed for its Arirang mass gymnastic display \u2013 particularly the moments when thousands of perfectly choreographed performers hold up coloured cards to create huge and rapidly changing mosaic images. &quot;The mass events are mindblowing \u2013 it&apos;s like nothing else,&quot; says Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours in Beijing, which has been running trips to the country since 1993. &quot;The Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing was great, but it was a one-off. North Korea pulls that stuff out of the hat six weeks every year. A full scale mass games has 100,000 performers and God knows how many in logistical support.&quot; Football is extremely popular and the national team has just qualified for the World Cup, for the first time since 1966. They will be hoping to surpass that notable event; to much surprise, that team beat Italy 1-0 at a match in Middlesbrough, gaining a spot in the quarter-finals where they lost to Portugal. North Koreans also like volleyball and there&apos;s a flying-saucer shaped baseball stadium in Pyongyang. Other landmarks include the 105-floor pyramid-shaped Ryugyong Hotel, which has been under construction since 1987, several revolving restaurants and two huge boulevards \u2013 110m wide \u2013 in the city. Crossroads are overseen by female traffic police, reportedly hand-picked by Kim Jong-il for their beauty \u2013 although men manage the roundabouts. Traffic lights are in place, but rarely used. Pyongyang&apos;s eight cinemas are said to be frequently closed due to lack of power; when open, they screen domestic propaganda movies with inspiring titles such as The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man. The state news agency KCNA runs a curious combination of brief news items such as its coverage of Clinton&apos;s visit, angry denunciations of the treachery of &quot;puppet authorities&quot; in South Korea and long tales of the leadership&apos;s care for ordinary people. Tuesday, for example, saw the publication of a story about Kim Jong-il inspecting the cabbage harvest in autumn 1979. &quot;The meticulous care shown by the leader for winter kimchi [pickled cabbage, a dietary staple] is still conveyed as an epic of great love,&quot; it concluded. Economy In the 60s, North Korea was one of the most industrialised of East Asian nations. But there is no clearer way to see its stagnation than to compare it to its neighbour, China \u2013 once a poor relation, now a capitalist powerhouse. Travel down the river which marks the two countries&apos; border and the disparity is striking. On one side, neon blazes at night; on the other, there is almost complete darkness. &quot;The scarcity of cars, the early nights, the almost total absence of entertainment places, combined with the electricity shortages, means that by midnight Pyongyang is effectively a ghost city until six the next morning,&quot; writes Paul French in his book North Korea: The Paranoid Peninsula. Fuel shortages, exacerbated by sanctions, mean that heating can be problematic in a country where temperatures can fall to \u201310C or lower in winter. Possessions are limited; only around half of households have bicycles, leaving most to walk to work. From 2002, the country has experimented with economic reforms, such as opening markets \u2013 although stock is usually very limited. Higher-ranked citizens can enter the department stores for foreigners and senior officials, although foreign currency is often required. Although Chinese goods are now available, most products are unique to North Korea \u2013 such as Vinalon, a widely used synthetic textile made from limestone. But many analysts suggest that the North has now virtually given up on such reforms. And in May, as tensions on the peninsula escalated, it announced that it was tearing up the contracts for the Kaesong joint industrial complex it established with the South \u2013 a rare source of much-needed income, which employed 30,000 North Koreans. In the countryside, the situation is more pressing than in the towns. A crippling famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands of people and although the situation has improved, the country remains highly dependent on food aid \u2013 the World Food Programme estimates that 8.7 million of its 23 million inhabitants need assistance. The range of food items is extremely limited and meat is a luxury. Because of the strict controls on where tourists can go, and what they can see, it is hard to assess the true state of affairs. &quot;Pyongyang itself outwardly presents quite a smart image to the world \u2013 there were people with SLR cameras,&quot; said one recent visitor. &quot;But we entered by train and when we were travelling through the countryside we did see some people in rags. We kept having power cuts and a guesthouse we stayed in \u2013 even though it is for foreigners \u2013 asked us what time we would like to have hot water.&quot; Security North Korea has a long history of tense relations with other regional powers and the west \u2013 particularly since it began its nuclear programme. China is regarded as almost its sole ally; even so, relations are fraught, based as much as anything on China&apos;s fear that the collapse of the current regime could lead to a flood of refugees and growing US influence on its border. Although North Korea is thought to have begun seeking nuclear weapons as early as the 60s, because it feared attack, the issue first began making waves in 1993, when it said that it planned to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to allow inspectors access to its nuclear sites. As relations deteriorated, the US braced itself for war \u2013 averted when a visit by Jimmy Carter helped to pave the way for a breakthrough deal. Despite ups and downs in the relationship, Madeleine Albright \u2013 then secretary of state \u2013 visited Pyongyang in 2000 and an arms control treaty was agreed. With the arrival of George Bush \u2013 who deemed the North the third member of the &quot;axis of evil&quot;, alongside Iraq and Iran \u2013 all bets were off. In 2006 the North&apos;s first nuclear test brought international condemnation. But not long afterwards, six-party aid for disarmament talks began. Those hit a wall last year after Washington and Pyongyang clashed over how to verify disagreement. Tensions were also rising on the peninsula thanks to the South&apos;s election of Lee Myung-bak, who ended his predecessor&apos;s &quot;sunshine policy&quot; of free-flowing aid. Since then, the North has ratcheted up its rhetoric, tested another nuclear device and launched a Taepodong 2 long-range rocket (the international reaction being neatly summarised in the Sun&apos;s headline, &quot;It&apos;s All Gone Pete Tong: Kim Jong in Taepodong Ding-dong&quot;). Though the rocket flew rather further than on its first test three years ago, when it disintegrated within seconds, it was far from successful. Experts believe North Korea has not yet been able to miniaturise an atomic weapon to place on a missile, but it may not be far off. The main fear is not that it will use such weapons itself, but that it will sell them to other states. On the plus side, most experts regarded its escalating actions this year as a bid for attention from Barack Obama&apos;s administration \u2013 a\u00a0bid that appears to have been successful, given Bill Clinton&apos;s visit. While primarily concerned with the fate of the two US reporters, and billed by the White House as &quot;solely private&quot;, analysts believe it will in time lead to renewed talks."}, {"sentences": ["Some years ago, a friend in Tokyo sent me three seeds of the lotus flower, Nelumbo nucifera.", "From Ueno Park in downtown Tokyo to the remotest rural fastness, lotus-viewing festivals will take place, turning a flower show into a mass spectator sport during what is known as the Time of the Lotus."], "tags": ["Life and style", "Gardens"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-06T10:59:31Z", "title": "The edible, incredible lotus flower", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2009/aug/06/lotus-flower", "article": "Some years ago, a friend in Tokyo sent me three seeds of the lotus flower, Nelumbo nucifera. Fearing that I would make too much of a fuss of them, she waited until after I had succeeded in germinating and flowering them before telling me their story. They had come from a lotus that sprouted from a 3,000-year-old seed found in a Jomon-era excavation in Japan. For me this revelation was the beginning of a quest. I set out to discover all I could about the world&apos;s most famous flower. What I found was a species that left other iconic plants such as the lily, rose and tulip standing. The lotus provides foodstuffs, medicines and natural chemicals (such as those that ensure the seed&apos;s astonishing longevity) which have long sustained indigenous peoples and now intrigue modern biologists. It furnished Hinduism, Buddhism and numerous extinct religions with symbols of the mother goddess and reincarnation and lessons in ideal conduct. Its flowers, fruit and foliage proliferated in some of the greatest religious artworks of all time.  Across Japan in the next few weeks, in lakes and tubs, ponds and paddyfields, the massive buds of the lotus flower will open in the dawn. From Ueno Park in downtown Tokyo to the remotest rural fastness, lotus-viewing festivals will take place, turning a flower show into a mass spectator sport during what is known as the Time of the Lotus. Already fixtures in the Japanese diet, lotus rhizomes and seeds will be devoured in even greater quantities than usual; rice wine will be poured onto the plate-like leaves and their hollow stalks stuck between the lips to act as metre-long drinking straws. Around the middle of the month, a vast harvest of flowers and leaves will bring the lotus into millions of homes where it will play an essential role in Obon, Japan&apos;s great annual celebration of the returning dead. A century ago, enchanted by the plant&apos;s preternatural beauty and myriad classical and oriental connections, the British grew Nelumbo nucifera in conservatories; bought wallpaper, fabrics and objets d&apos;art inspired by it from Liberty and other bazaars; devoured books and articles on the plant and its Japanese haunts. Our lotus craze came to an end with the Great War. This magical flower, which has touched so many civilizations and reconciled nature and culture, science and spirituality, disappeared from our gardens and consciousness. Yet Nelumbo is easy to grow in a tub filled two thirds with soil, one third with water, and we have conservatories and sunny terraces aplenty. It is time for a revival.

A dearth of fashion news this week (we can only assume everyone&apos;s taking a break before fashion week madness begins) leads us once again in a downward direction. Last week it was control underwear for men; this week, brand Simpson is getting in on the act. You might think these topics are unrelated, but you&apos;d be wrong. See, they&apos;re both pants \u2026 We know Jessica is an easy target, but we were never ones to insist on doing things the hard way. Back in May, Jessica (or more likely her dad, Joe I-plan-to-squeeze-as-much-as-possible-out-of-my-daughter Simpson) joined the same clique as the Pussycat Dolls, Dita von Teese and Peaches Geldof. She signed a deal with Van Dale Industries, an underwear manufacturer, to launch her own lingerie collection. All well and good, you might think: since when did having absolutely no design credentials stop celebrities from cashing in on something they know nothing about?  However, then we discovered the name of this new underwear range: Intimates. Which clever dick came up with that? As well as sounding like a &apos;feminine hygiene&apos; product, it is also the exact same name as Elle Macpherson&apos;s hugely successful range of lingerie. So is this just a cunning trick to lure Elle&apos;s customers over, or is there something else to it? Maybe the answer to this question lies in Jessica&apos;s response to an inquiry from WWD magazine: WWD: How would you describe the signature look of Jessica Simpson Intimates when it comes to your personality?JS: My intimates are feminine and sweet with a hint of fun.  We don&apos;t want to delve too closely into exactly what Jess means by this, but we can&apos;t help wondering if the girl just likes airing her dirty laundry in public.  BANG ON TREND One shoulder     A one-shoulder look from Lanvin. Photograph: Lanvin PR office    This week, work some 80s magic on your wardrobe with an asymmetric silhouette, as seen on the autumn/winter catwalks at Chloe, Herve Leger, Oscar De La Renta and Ungaro. This look is surprisingly versatile and comes in all shapes and sizes. Go body conscious with stretch fabrics and panelling, or try sleeveless bright cotton prints for a perfect summertime look. For evening, big, bold and glamorous is the way to do it, with bright colours and chunky accessories. We cannot condone the heinous bodysuit, but be warned, the one-shoulder version has returned from the wardrobe in the sky with a vengeance. Avoid at all cost and loudly berate your friends in public if you spot them wearing one. That&apos;ll learn &apos;em. Just so you know what to watch out for we&apos;ve found two high street examples. This Peacocks version is a (cough) bargain at \u00a312, and has a diagonal black and gold stripe, or there&apos;s this colourful, geometric-patterned one from Topshop for \u00a322. For an infinitely more sophisticated (and a lot less uncomfortable) look, go bold and decadent with Emanuel Ungaro&apos;s striking teal suede dress. Mind you, it costs a whopping \u00a33,125 so looking is probably all you&apos;ll be doing.  Disco queens among you - and fans of the film Splash - should slip into a silver sequin mini by Ashish (\u00a3525) and emerge like a mermaid sans tail on to the dancefloor. Warehouse has a one-shoulder belted dress in mauve that could almost double as office wear for \u00a355.  Then there&apos;s French Connection&apos;s short-sleeved, girly dress, which comes in a vivid scarlet and makes us think of something Diane Kruger would wear on the red carpet. At \u00a380, it&apos;s not too bad a price. For floral fans we&apos;ve found a dress from Topshop for \u00a350 that will be great for those last days of summer. And for those who prefer a fiercer look, we&apos;ve found a tiger-print one for \u00a322. Big bows are still in. Julien MacDonald has designed a leopard-print dress for \u00a360 with a bow over the shoulder for Debenhams. If the nautical look is more your style, New Look has a simple striped navy dress with one long sleeve for \u00a318. Finally, another body-con look from Miss Selfridge comes in at a bargain-tastic \u00a332 and also indulges in a spot of colour blocking.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK &quot;If you have a really strong sense of style and people want to aspire to being like you, I can understand that, but if you really are doing it just because you think of yourself as a brand and you haven&apos;t had the training and you know nothing about clothes, it kind of demeans all the training that designers have had.&quot;Hussein Chalayan speaks his mind on models turned designers.

You seem to have woken up this morning and, perhaps still in a dream-like state, donned a white jumpsuit and bumbag. In your befuddled mind it was 1990, a time when these garments were in fashion (and by &apos;in fashion&apos; we mean &apos;acceptable for the kind of person who enjoys bus tours of European cities&apos;).  Or maybe it was just the practical element of holding up your unzipped jumpsuit (yes, we know those things are a bugger to go to the loo in) with a belt that could double as a purse. We shall never know as, alas, we are not attuned to the inner workings of your mind.

News of the company&apos;s first profit for six quarters sent AIG&apos;s shares up 11% during early trading on Wall Street. The group, best known in Britain as Manchester United&apos;s shirt sponsor, was the largest insurance company in the world until it suffered catastrophic losses on complex financial derivatives. AIG&apos;s chief executive, Edward Liddy, said the results reflected &quot;stabilisation&quot; in certain businesses: &quot;While our insurance companies&apos; operating results remain challenged, largely driven by weak economic conditions and the lingering effect of negative AIG events earlier in the year, performance trends stabilised from the first quarter.&quot; The company has been battered by controversy over bonuses for executives at its disastrously performing financial products division and over the use of taxpayers&apos; money to finance an expensive get-together for salesmen at a lavish Californian beachside hotel. In an effort to avoid the stigma surrounding its financial woes, AIG has been downplaying the use of its brandname. But premiums written in its general insurance division still fell by 19.2% to $7.9bn, hit by the weak economy, a decision to defend pricing and &quot;the effect of AIG&apos;s challenges on the business across the entire portfolio&quot;. The company has sold assets to raise money. It has offloaded a life insurance business for $680m and a subsidiary called 21st Century Insurance for $1.9bn. The sale of an office block housing AIG&apos;s Japanese headquarters in Tokyo raised $1.2bn. Michael Holland, a money manager at Holland &amp; Co, said: &quot;The reality is that the numbers are getting better and as a result it could be viewed as a potentially constructive first step towards financial success.&quot; At the end of June, AIG owed $44.8bn to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and had drawn down $1.2bn from a $29.8bn credit line from the treasury. It also had $41.6bn of preference shares outstanding. The roots of AIG&apos;s difficulties lie in its financial products arm, largely run out of an office in Mayfair, which developed a niche in insuring financial institutions against the risk of default on seemingly low-risk derivatives including mortgage-backed securities. When the credit crunch began, AIG found itself facing huge claims on these policies which it struggled to pay. Since its bailout, AIG has been gradually dismantling this division. The sum total of its derivatives portfolio dropped from $1.6tn in December to $1.3tn in June. Liddy is due to stand down next week to make way for a former MetLife insurance boss, Robert Benmosche, who will become AIG&apos;s fifth chief executive since 2005.

But for Mervyn King and his colleagues at the Bank of England last week, the perils of the Japanese experience must have been on their minds. Long before China&apos;s rise threatened the hegemony of the west, Japan&apos;s hi-tech, hi-spec exports helped to generate a massive boom in the 1980s, reminding consumers around the world of its economic muscle. As John Updike&apos;s American everyman, Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, says in the 1981 instalment of the tetralogy, Rabbit is Rich, when he has switched from selling US gas-guzzlers to compact Toyotas: &quot;Japan can&apos;t make enough of these cars to keep the world happy. Here we&apos;re supposed to be automotive heaven and the foreigners come up with all the ideas.&quot;  So wholeheartedly did the world&apos;s investors buy into the Japanese &quot;miracle&quot; that by the late 1980s firms whose shares were traded in Tokyo made up 45% of the entire world stockmarket, even though Japan produced only 10% of global GDP. Land prices in Japan&apos;s big cities tripled between 1985 and 1990. It wasn&apos;t a miracle, of course, but a bubble: stockmarkets fell by almost a half in nine months from their peak in 1989, and banks that had lent money hand over fist to fuel the corporate boom were saddled with monstrous bad debts. What will have been on King and others&apos; mind last week, however, is not that bubbles can burst - we&apos;ve known that since tulip mania - but that a catalogue of policymaking folly can turn what begins as a crash into more than 10 years of stagnation. As Japan&apos;s crisis spiralled out of control, Tokyo repeatedly rammed together loss-making banks in a series of rescue mergers, without cleaning up the bad loans on their books, and encouraged them to keep up the flow of lending to struggling companies, many of which were technically bust. Several of these &quot;zombie banks&quot; eventually collapsed, as did the firms they were propping up. At last October&apos;s meeting of G8 finance ministers and central bankers in Washington, with the world&apos;s financial system on the brink of failure, the Tokyo delegation argued vehemently that the US and Britain must learn from Japan&apos;s mistakes and fix the flailing banks urgently.  Multibillion-dollar banking bailouts, even in the free market United States, and the part-nationalisation of great swathes of the financial sector, revealed how determined today&apos;s leaders in the White House and Downing Street were to avoid the banks suffering a long and lingering death. But the biggest scope for policy error - and the biggest lesson from Japan&apos;s experience - comes at the fragile moment when recovery seems to be under way. In 1997, years after the stockmarket crash, Japan&apos;s leaders, keen to get their public finances back under control after years of trying to prop up the economy, decided to raise taxes. Their timing could not have been worse: not only were consumers and businesses still too weak to withstand the hit, but the Asian financial crisis was about to sweep through Japan&apos;s neighbours, causing havoc. Again in 2001, when recovery seemed assured, the Bank of Japan tightened interest rates, the government tightened fiscal policy - and the economy slumped back into recession. It was only then, when the Federal Reserve, too, was slashing interest rates to offset the impact of the dotcom crash, that Japan finally embarked on its drastic experiment with quantitative easing, buying back bonds in a massive operation known as &quot;Rinban&quot;, a policy that lasted until 2006. As is their wont, economists are divided about how effective quantitative easing was in securing Japan&apos;s recovery. But there is more of a consensus that it was because the remedies came too late - and policymakers kept snatching away the medicine before the patient&apos;s recovery was assured - that deflation took hold and became endemic.  Workers watching their wages and the value of their homes plunging are reluctant to spend money; savings pile up; businesses find it impossible to thrive. For more than a decade, Japan&apos;s economy was bumping along the bottom and central bankers were all but impotent. By 2007, land prices were still only at the level they reached in the mid-1980s. And that&apos;s the spectre that was surely haunting members of the monetary policy committee last week, when they opted to extend quantitative easing, instead of putting the brakes on, as many in the City expected. As ex-member Danny Blanchflower has pointed out, we have the tools to deal with inflation: ramping up interest rates. There is no simple recipe for tackling deflation once it gets a grip. Hawks in the Square Mile may already be worrying about inflation, but with redundancies, pay freezes and wage cuts, and import prices falling despite the relative weakness of the pound, it&apos;s hard to see where inflationary pressure is going to come from any time soon. After several years of healthy export-led growth, the legacy of the lost decade is evident even today. The hefty Chinese stimulus package may be helping to boost demand, but prices in Japan are falling once more, and voters finally appear to have lost patience with the long years of economic drift and are expected to dislodge the sclerotic LDP - which has ruled for all but 10 months since the second world war - at elections his month. In these strange economic times, there are few pointers from history. But the moment when everything seems to be looking up, and relieved politicians banish nightmares about the dustbowls and soup kitchens of the Great Depression from their minds, is exactly the right time to remember the lessons of Japan. King and his fellow MPC members were slow on the uptake when the downturn took hold, but last week&apos;s bold move showed they won&apos;t take the risk of repeating the Japanese experience."}, {"sentences": ["But American manpower, technology and guts proved greater than anyone in Tokyo or Berlin had imagined possible."], "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-08T23:05:20Z", "title": "The Storm of War by Andrew Roberts: Book Review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/09/storm-of-war-andrew-roberts", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday 16 August 2009 Below we said that after France had fallen in 1940, &quot;the United Kingdom fought on alone against Germany and Japan&quot;, but the UK did not declare war on Japan until December 1941 after its attack on Pearl Harbour brought the US into the war. It is a safe bet that at any given moment there is someone in the United Kingdom writing a general history of the Second World War. Andrew Roberts&apos;s latest offering is a sparkling addition to the groaning shelves. The British have almost a monopoly in the subject. Go into any bookshop in Italy and there are always plenty of publications about the fighting in the Apennines. In Warsaw, the same is true of the Soviet massacre of Polish troops in the Katyn forest. Russian military historians produce an annual stream of books on the battles of Stalingrad and Kursk. American authors write endlessly about FDR, Patton and even Churchill. But it is in this country that most accounts have appeared about the war as a global phenomenon from September 1939 right through to the Japanese surrender in August 1945. There is an obvious reason for this. Once Hitler had invaded Poland, it was the British and the French who opened hostilities against him. In less than a year, France had fallen. The United Kingdom fought on alone against Germany and Japan at a time when the USSR had a near-alliance with the Third Reich and American internal politics prevented Roosevelt from entering the conflict. This changed in 1941 after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and the Japanese air force attacked the American fleet in Pearl Harbour. Immediately, the &quot;Big Three&quot; \u2013 America, the Soviet Union and Britain \u2013 came together to smash militarist imperialism west and east. Russian rulers to this day have dealt with their country&apos;s less than glorious history before Operation Barbarossa by focusing on the &quot;great patriotic war&quot; of 1941-1945 to the exclusion of the years of collusion with German power. Roberts offers refreshing judgments on the politicians and commanders in lively prose and his denunciation of the murder of millions of Jews is as measured as it is moving. His pride in the British national performance is frequently on display, but he is not shy about puncturing the bubble of reputations. General Montgomery&apos;s foibles are exposed alongside his virtues as a field commander. Roberts also freely acknowledge the importance of the American military contribution without failing to point out the scary vanity of General Patton. He also refrains from the conventional praise for Marshal Zhukov, instead highlighting how brutally he and fellow Soviet commanders treated their troops. The thread binding the book together is the question of historical contingency. Roberts indicates how often Hitler would have done better, and even won the war, if he had made different choices. This is not an original thought, nor is it claimed as such. No one in 1940 needed to tell Churchill that the Germans stood a good chance of crushing the United Kingdom. In the long summer of 1941, as the German armies streamed as fast as their tanks could carry them towards the outskirts of Moscow and Leningrad, it was the belief of nearly every Soviet citizen that the USSR was on the brink of complete defeat. Such was Roosevelt&apos;s feeling that the Third Reich was about to gain definitive victory in Europe that he twisted arms in the Washington political establishment to send food and armaments to the United Kingdom even before America&apos;s entry into the war. Hitler as a military leader was Stalin&apos;s blood twin. He accepted only forward movement from his generals and regarded tactical withdrawal as a shameful betrayal of the Fatherland. When advancing, he often lost his sense of strategic realism. Thus he foolishly fiddled around with the planned distribution of his forces on the Eastern Front in August and September 1941, when a more sensible idea would have been to amass German strength for a decisive thrust against Moscow. If Stalin had had to evacuate his capital, the damage to Soviet morale, communications and industrial capacity would have been tremendous. Then there was Hitler&apos;s disastrous handling of operations around and in Stalingrad. His insistence that Paulus&apos;s army should fight on and die rather than save themselves and their equipment by effecting a temporary retreat consigned hundreds of thousands of Germans and their allies to their graves or to the gulag. As Roberts emphasises, Churchill could not resist poking fun at &quot;Corporal Hitler&quot; for his ineptitude. Hitler had form as an inflexible commander. When Rommel, outnumbered in men and tanks, wanted to undertake a strategic withdrawal in North Africa in 1942, he got short shrift from the F\u00fchrer. Large quantities of experienced German and Italian soldiers fell into captivity who could otherwise have fought the enemies of the Third Reich in Italy. Hitler also damaged his cause through his political management. The book makes the interesting point that German Jews would probably have fought patriotically in his army if only he had not spurned them. A feeling that Germany, after the Versailles treaty of 1919, deserved to expand its territory again was not peculiar to the Nazi party. The scientists who invented the American atomic bomb included several Jewish refugees from the Third Reich. It is also well known that many Ukrainian villages in 1941 greeted the German invaders with the traditional welcome of bread and salt. The Germans allowed churches and private shops, closed under Soviet rule, to be reopened. For a while, it looked as though the Third Reich was exploiting &quot;the national question&quot; in the USSR to great advantage. But Ukrainians soon learnt the truth about Hitler. Grain requisitioning by the Germans was as ruthless as under Stalin. Young, able-bodied people were conscripted for labour service in German factories. Mass executions of Jews, Roma, communists and other suspect groups became a routine affair. Whether it would have been possible to govern Ukraine gently while continuing to impose a brutal occupation of neighbouring Poland is not clear. But Roberts makes a strong case that Hitler&apos;s interventions turned eastern Europe against him. He puts the same arguments about the Japanese army in the Asian territories it conquered from the north Pacific down to Burma. Colonial peoples who might have welcomed them as liberators from white imperial rule were savagely suppressed and exploited. The British, French and Dutch did poorly in the initial stages of the war in the east. But American manpower, technology and guts proved greater than anyone in Tokyo or Berlin had imagined possible. After Pearl Harbour, Roosevelt had little difficulty in carrying his people with him in aiming at a total triumph over Japan and its ally Germany. Although his health declined in 1944-1945, he never lost sight of this objective. He made mistakes, especially by failing to deal more robustly with Stalin, but he played a crucial role in enabling Britain to survive its ghastly isolation in 1940. The central character in the book&apos;s drama, inevitably, is Hitler. Roberts&apos;s suggestion seems to be that he could only have won the war if he had not allowed it to spiral into a global struggle. Hitler missed his chance to knock out the USSR early on and provoked the US into entering the ring on the side of the opposition. He may have won the war if he had kept it as &quot;the First European War&quot;; the gamble that did not pay off was to make it global."}, {"sentences": ["The prints have caught on in Japan, where Tokyo, Nagoya and Yokohama have outlets, though a foray into US market was less successful."], "tags": ["Homes", "Recession", "Life and style", "Business", "Design"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-09T20:29:14Z", "title": "Queen of florals Cath Kidston bucks the recession to profit from love of nostalgia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/09/cath-kidston-recession-floral-empire", "article": "First it was just the tea towel and cute polka-dot plates, then the sewing box and tent. Now the unchecked growth of floral print is taking over the high street, according to new figures. Sales and profits have jumped more than 60% at Cath Kidston, the purveyor of &quot;kitchenalgia&quot; that has become as much a part of the (chintzy) fabric of British life as the late Laura Ashley. Accounts filed at Companies House reveal profits at the fashion retailer increased from \u00a32.9m to \u00a34.6m in the year to March, as its rosebud-covered ironing boards and floral biscuit tins proved a tonic for recesssionistas. While not everybody&apos;s cup of tea, the eponymous designer&apos;s heavy floral prints have become as ubiquitous over the last 10 years as Ashley&apos;s romantic prints were in the 70s. Sales have grown at break-neck pace for Kidston, increasing from last year&apos;s \u00a319.2m to \u00a331.3m as new stores opened around the country and the retailer made its first attempt to crack the Irish market. Kidston&apos;s teapots and oilcloths, which embrace the image of the 1950s housewife, celebrating baking, afternoon tea and knitting, have become addictive for a generation of women whose busy working and home lives have led them to idealise rather than practise domesticity. &quot;Cath Kidston is the new Laura Ashley,&quot; claimed Lorna Hall, the retail editor of the fashion trends website WSGN. &quot;The brand keys into the same aesthetic, with its dreamlike nostalgia. For many women it is a way to nest, without all the hard work involved in nesting.&quot; Kidston is not just a &quot;global lifestyle brand&quot; she&apos;s a real woman (and cousin of the style guru Kirstie Allsopp) who says her childhood &quot;of ponies, boarding school and a rambling house on Hampshire/Wiltshire borders&quot; provides the palette for her stores. The vintage fabrics and brightly-painted junk furniture sold at her first Kidston store, which opened in 1993, proved an instant hit with &quot;yummy mummies&quot; at the shop&apos;s location, in London&apos;s Holland Park. The success encouraged the designer to create her own signature products. One of the first designs, for an ironing board cover \u2013 practical, quirky, with a distinctive floral print \u2013 came to epitomise the &quot;Cath Kidston look&quot; and its desire to put a cheery spin on day-to-day chores. &quot;We work hard to ensure that our products are pretty, practical and affordable,&quot; said Kidston, of the brand&apos;s success in the teeth of the economic downturn. &quot;We also try to make the shopping experience fun and light-hearted, which we hope will give our customers a reason to be cheerful regardless of the economic climate.&quot; Breast cancer in her mid-thirties encouraged Kidston to give up interior design and devote herself to what would become Cath Kidston Inc. Over the last 15 years the flowery empire has spread like ivy. Her dots and roses are now wallpapered over everyday items, ranging from Tesco carrier bags, to Sky boxes and Roberts radios. There is also a Cath Kids clothing brand. There are 27 Cath Kidston stores in the UK and Ireland, with 10 new openings in the last year. The prints have caught on in Japan, where Tokyo, Nagoya and Yokohama have outlets, though a foray into US market was less successful. But Kidston has not been alone in selling nostalgia on the high street. This year retailers, ranging from Marks &amp; Spencer to Sainsbury&apos;s, have run heritage campaigns, trying to coax shell-shocked consumers to part with the cash. &quot;Nostalgia always becomes more important when times are tough,&quot; said Steve Sharp, marketing director of Marks &amp; Spencer. Kidston&apos;s success defies a dowdy high street, where homewares retailers have been among the hardest hit \u2013 many purchases in this sector are triggered by people moving house or sprucing up before selling. Amid a frozen property market, homewares chains as a group endured 12 consecutive months of sales declines, according to the accountancy firm BDO Stoy Hayward. BDO said the &quot;rot&quot; stopped in July, when sales turned positive, climbing 1.2% and reflecting the recent pick-up in the property market. This year&apos;s bumper results saw shareholders in Kidston, a privately owned business, reap a \u00a31m dividend. The retailer has no debt and, if sold, Cath Kidston, who remains a major investor, would be in for a substantial windfall. Indeed it would seem the only threat to her empire is overload. &quot;She&apos;s got to be careful not to venture too far beyond the brand&apos;s comfort zone because ubiquity is what felled Laura Ashley in the 90s,&quot; said Hall."}, {"sentences": ["The agency said the storm, which is expected to strike Tokyo tomorrow, was forecast to produce winds of up to 78mph, heavy rain and stormy seas."], "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "China", "Japan", "Philippines", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-10T08:23:04Z", "title": "Deadly typhoon Morakot and tropical storm Etau pummel east Asia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/typhoon-morakot-china-taiwan-etau", "article": "     At least 34 people have died and millions of others been affected in the Asia-Pacific region after a typhoon and a tropical storm battered China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan.

The ruling conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has held power for 52 of the past 53 years. It is the political linchpin of the US-Japan alliance. Now, largely due to lamentable domestic policy failures, opinion polls suggest it is all but dead in the water. The centre-left Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), ahead by up to 20 points in some surveys, is committed, on paper at least, to a radical reappraisal of Japan&apos;s postwar defence partnership with Washington. Its manifesto pledges to &quot;re-examine the role of the US military in the security of the Asia-Pacific region and the significance of US bases in Japan&quot;. Questions have been raised about the continuing presence of roughly 50,000 American troops on Japanese soil and more broadly, about Japan&apos;s military support for US operations in Iraq and now in Afghanistan. At the same time, DPJ leaders are advocating improved ties with former adversaries, notably China and South Korea, strained during the 2001-2006 premiership of Junichiro Koizumi. Party chief Yukio Hatoyama has vowed not to follow Koizumi in paying respects to Japan&apos;s war dead at the Yasukini shrine in Tokyo, seen in Beijing as a symbol of unrepentant Japanese militarism. Speaking in Tokyo today at a Thomson Reuters conference, Katsuya Okada, the DPJ&apos;s second-in-command, said the party wanted an equal relationship with the Obama administration. &quot;There are various issues of concern between Japan and the US. It is necessary \u2026 to work on changing systems based on trust,&quot; he said. Japan lacked independence, he complained. &quot;If Japan just follows what the US says, then I think as a sovereign nation that is very pathetic.&quot; Okada expressed impatience with the pace of international nuclear disarmament, always a sensitive issue in Japan. Although his party welcomed Barack Obama&apos;s call for a nuclear-free world, he suggested Japan should pursue its own disarmament and non-proliferation policies. These and other apparently game-changing DPJ positions have led to talk of a generational shift in Japanese politics, bringing to office leaders who have no personal memories, guilty or otherwise, of the war, and no particular reason to thank the US for the postwar alliance. For all the chit-chat about mould-breaking, a sharp reality check may await the DPJ. Take the nuclear issue: as prime minister Taro Aso noted in Hiroshima last week, Japan continues to benefit from the US &quot;nuclear umbrella&quot; when it comes to threats from North Korea, just as during the cold war. While most Japanese supported the abolition of nuclear weapons, he said, such a development was unlikely in the foreseeable future, whatever the DPJ might do or say. Despite its talk of Asian outreach, the DPJ has already confirmed it will adhere to Aso&apos;s tough line on North Korea&apos;s nukes and missiles and the long-running issue of Japanese citizens abducted by Pyongyang. It will also continue with a $3.1bn missile defence programme jointly developed with the US. In a similarly realistic vein, the DPJ admitted this week that notwithstanding growing economic inter-dependence, China&apos;s rapidly rising military spending was a concern. But there was not much it could do about it.&quot;There is no option for us to be in a military conflict. We should not be in an arms race but rather aiming to reduce arms in the future,&quot; Okada said almost plaintively. Japan is currently struggling with its worst postwar recession while China is its top two-way trading partner and its biggest 2008 export market \u2013 after the US. The DPJ reacted cautiously last week to a government defence review that recommended easing constitutional constraints to allow Japan&apos;s military to expand global co-operation with the US. In truth, its circumspection reflect splits within the party about how far to go in loosening the US leash \u2013 or whether to try at all. Nor will the US voluntarily relax its close embrace, just because some new faces show up at Tokyo head office next month. According to Harvard professor Joseph Nye, Washington attaches high priority to its Japanese alliance, &quot;a central feature of stability in east Asia&quot;. Shared concerns ranging from China to trans-national pandemics, terrorism and the threats posed by failed states would bind the US and Japan more closely than ever in the 21st century, he predicted. It&apos;s a lesson other useful long-time US allies, such as Britain, have learned over the years. Whatever DPJ leaders may fondly think, there&apos;s no escaping America when it doesn&apos;t want to be escaped."}, {"sentences": ["More than 30 British companies are in Tokyo this week on a government-sponsored mission to break into the huge, but notoriously tough, Japanese music market.", "The enduring popularity of British bands \u2013 from Oasis to Franz Ferdinand \u2013 was in evidence at Fuji Rock last month, while headline acts at the Summer Sonic festival in Tokyo and Osaka included Kasabian, the Ting Tings, Razorlight and the Specials.", "In March, the Xcerts became the latest emerging UK band to play at British Anthems \u2013 a fixture on the Tokyo concert calendar \u2013 after appearing on a dedicated MySpace profile launched by the British embassy."], "tags": ["Music industry", "Japan", "Business", "Music", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-10T17:47:00Z", "title": "British music executives head to Japan to drum up business", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/10/british-music-executives-japan-mission", "article": "More than 30 British companies are in Tokyo this week on a government-sponsored mission to break into the huge, but notoriously tough, Japanese music market. Executives from small independent UK labels are hoping to build on the success of major British acts to carve out a niche in Japan, the world&apos;s second biggest music market after the US. The consumer mission, organised by UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), the government body, and trade group the BPI, comes at an uncertain time for the British record industry. In the first six months of this year UK music sales shrank by 7.3% from a year earlier, according to the BPI. CD album sales were down 13% from the same time last year, although a boom in digital downloads softened the blow. While British artists have increased their share of the US market over the past four years, they have struggled to gain a foothold in Japan. Homegrown Japanese artists account for 80% of sales, but even in the country&apos;s international music market, UK artists account for only 25% \u2013 well behind US artists. Organisers of the mission, now in its sixth year, say their aim is to secure record and marketing deals and help smaller UK labels navigate a market that would otherwise be out of bounds. &quot;British music companies still need to know the right people to talk to,&quot; said Phil Patterson, UKTI&apos;s music industry specialist. &quot;The aim of this mission is to help them network with power brokers in the Japanese industry.&quot; The potential reward is a bigger slice of a market that is defying the downward spiral seen in the rest of the world. While other countries were counting their losses last year, total music sales in Japan were up 0.9% at \u00a5425bn (\u00a32.6bn) \u2013 thanks largely to downloads by the country&apos;s 100 million mobile phone users. The number of firms taking part in the mission has swelled from fewer than 20 to more than 30 in the past six years: a sign, Japanese executives say, of the potential benefits of doing business face to face. &quot;It&apos;s vitally important that British labels come with government backing because in Japan, the international market is declining year on year,&quot; said Kimitaka Kato, international managing director at Universal Music Japan. &quot;To sustain and expand, indie labels need to keep coming and to understand what this country is really about.&quot; Britain&apos;s most recent saviours were Coldplay, whose Viva La Vida sold 400,000 copies in Japan last year, making it the biggest-selling UK album and bringing its total album sales in the country to 1m. The enduring popularity of British bands \u2013 from Oasis to Franz Ferdinand \u2013 was in evidence at Fuji Rock last month, while headline acts at the Summer Sonic festival in Tokyo and Osaka included Kasabian, the Ting Tings, Razorlight and the Specials. In March, the Xcerts became the latest emerging UK band to play at British Anthems \u2013 a fixture on the Tokyo concert calendar \u2013 after appearing on a dedicated MySpace profile launched by the British embassy. &quot;British music punches massively above its weight, despite the so-called collapse in the music industry,&quot; said Julian Wall, the BPI&apos;s director of independent member services. &quot;I have high hopes for UK labels that haven&apos;t put a foot in the water in Japan but are here now to make contacts.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The agency said the storm, which is expected to strike Tokyo tomorrow, was forecast to produce winds of up to 78mph, heavy rain and stormy seas."], "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Taiwan", "World news", "Flooding", "Environment", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-10T18:24:07Z", "title": "Mudslides bury hundreds in storm's wake", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/taiwan-mudslide-typhoon", "article": "     Rescuers were struggling to find hundreds of Taiwanese villagers tonight after their homes were buried by a mudslide when a powerful typhoon pummelled the island at the weekend.

At least six people died, including a four-year-old boy who was buried when his home collapsed. Authorities said 7.8 million people in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces were affected by the typhoon, although it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it approached Shanghai. Village officials in Zhejiang cycled through floodwaters to take drinking water and instant noodles to stranded residents, while rescuers tried to reach eight sailors on a cargo ship blown onto a reef off Fujian, Xinhua reported. The typhoon killed at least 22 people as it struck the Philippines, before making landfall at Taiwan late on Friday and sweeping across the island on Saturday, claiming at least 15 lives and leaving 55 missing, including two policemen who were washed away while helping to evacuate residents. In the southern county of Kaohsiung, a police official called Wang told Associated Press that about 400 people from Hsiao-lin were missing. Wang said about 100 people had been rescued by military helicopter. Another official, Yang Chiu-hsing, said rescuers could not approach by road because bridges and roads were damaged. Lin Chien-chung, a rescued resident, said he believed 600 people were buried in the mudslide and that it covered &quot;a large part&quot; of the village. &quot;No small number of single-storey houses have been covered in mudslides,&quot; Richard Hu, an army major-general, told Reuters: &quot;We don&apos;t know how many people are there, but homes have definitely been buried.&quot; Tens of thousands are stranded in other areas, Taiwan&apos;s fire service said. In Japan, 13 people died as an approaching tropical storm triggered floods and landslides in the west of the country. More than 47,000 people in western Japan have been told to leave their homes. The meteorological office warned that tropical storm Etau could bring &quot;extremely heavy rain&quot; to many parts of Honshu \u2013 Japan&apos;s main island \u2013 as it moved northwards. The agency said the storm, which is expected to strike Tokyo tomorrow, was forecast to produce winds of up to 78mph, heavy rain and stormy seas. At least 12 people died and eight others were missing in Hyogo prefecture in western Japan. Local reports said a 68-year-old woman was killed in a landslide while a nine-year-old boy was reported missing. &quot;Cars that were parked on the road got all washed away all the way to the station,&quot; one resident said. Another said: &quot;Everything toppled over in the house.

Five crew members and a nurse were on board the flight over Pingtung county. The news came as the military rescued 260 villagers from a neighbouring county where a massive mudslide buried a village. Hundreds of people were still missing. In mainland China, a landslide buried seven four-storey apartment blocks at the foot of a mountain in the town of Pengxi, in Zhejiang province. The state news agency Xinhua said an unknown number of residents were affected. An official from the Pengxi government said six people were there at the time and all had been pulled out alive, although two later died. Around 80 people have died across the Asia-Pacific region after typhoon Morakot battered the Philippines, China and Taiwan and tropical storm Etau pummelled Japan. The death toll includes 38 in Taiwan, 23 in the Philippines, 13 in Japan and six in China. Morakot has now weakened to a tropical storm, but high winds and torrential rain have affected millions of people and caused hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage. One million people were evacuated along China&apos;s east coast as Morakot brought winds of up to 75mph, torrential rain and waves as high as 8 metres (26ft), toppling 6,000 houses and causing 9bn yuan (\u00a3800m) of damage. Among the dead was a four-year-old boy who was buried when his home collapsed. Authorities said 7.8 million people in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces were affected by the typhoon. Morakot struck the Philippines before making landfall at Taiwan late on Friday and sweeping across the island on Saturday. Among the dead and missing in Taiwan were two policemen who were washed away while helping to evacuate residents. With rain still falling in Kaohsiung county, helicopters lifted survivors from the area around Hsiao-lin village. Several had escaped the mudslide by running to higher ground. Land access has been cut off by the collapse of a bridge and the blocking of a back road. Taiwan&apos;s national fire agency said 100 villagers were buried alive when the mudslide hit, but rescued residents said the figure was as high as 600. One, Lin Mei-ying, begged the military to step up efforts, telling the television station ETTV: &quot;There are still a lot of people trapped inside ... Please go faster so they can be saved.&quot; Another woman said she fled with her husband and their baby from their two-storey home minutes before the mudslide buried it. &quot;We heard two loud bangs ... The sky was filled with dust like a volcanic eruption, and flood waters, mud and rocks streamed onto the roads,&quot; she told Taiwan&apos;s China Times newspaper. According to news reports, a 51-year-old man from an area near Hsiao-lin was swept 1.2 miles (2km) as the mudslides rushed down a nearby mountain, surviving by holding on to a log. It is thought the typhoon hit at around 6am local time, as many householders were sleeping. One of the rescued villagers told police his family of 10 had been wiped out, the Associated Press reported. &quot;They are gone,&quot; he said, according to a local photographer who overheard the exchange.

Hu Jui-chou, a Taiwanese army major-general involved in rescue operations, said the 700 or more still trapped included residents trapped by a massive landslide in Hsiao-lin and a second village, Namahsia, in Kaohsiung. &quot;Trapped means they could be dead or alive,&quot; Hu said by telephone. &quot;It very likely covers people buried in the Hsiao-lin mudslide.&quot; Lee Chin-long, 50, told Associated Press he watched as walls of mud and rock wiped out most of the village. &quot;I was watching from my house upstairs.

Local media also suggested ten other villages may have been seriously damaged, but poor communications and the destruction of roads and bridges is making it hard to assess the scale of the problems. Earlier today Taiwan&apos;s fire service reported that tens of thousands were stranded. Footage showed the streets of a village near Hsiao-lin covered by thick mud and rubble. According to reports, a 51-year-old man was swept 1.2 miles (2km) as the mudslides rushed down a nearby mountain, surviving by holding onto a log. It is thought the typhoon hit at around 6am local time, as many householders were sleeping. One survivor told police his family of 10 had been wiped out, the Associated Press reported. &quot;They are gone,&quot; he said, according to a local photographer who overheard the exchange. In China, Morakot destroyed 10,000 homes and caused an estimated 9.7bn yuan (\u00a3860m) of damage, state media said. The finance ministry offered 102m yuan (\u00a39m) in emergency aid. Hui Liangyu, the vice-president, warned that big floods were still likely as heavy rain continued and more than 20 rivers reported water levels above flood-alarm lines in Zhejiang, Fujian and Anhui provinces, although Morakot has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. In Japan, Etau approached the island&apos;s central area and Tokyo, hours after a 6.5 magnitude earthquake tossed food and bottles from store shelves, disrupted transport and shut down a nuclear power plant for safety checks. Japan&apos;s weather agency warned of possible landslides and flooding, as the quake followed heavy rain.

Look closely at a label on the gallery wall and you&apos;ll notice a little note saying &quot;On loan from \u2026&quot;. The larger touring exhibitions read like a high-fashion social diary, galloping across the globe from New York to Paris, London to Tokyo, while smaller shows criss-cross their way from Pittsburgh to Bogot\u00e1, Figueres to Melbourne. Art travels around the world in myriad ways: in and out of galleries and auction houses, to and from private collections. The question is: how does it get there? My journey begins at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where Anna Jackson, deputy keeper of the Asia department, has been delving into the royal collections of India&apos;s maharajas over the last 18 months. She&apos;s preparing for the museum&apos;s autumn exhibition, Maharaja: The Splendour of India&apos;s Royal Courts, which will open in October 2009. The original idea was floated more than two years ago, and the museum officially announced the show some months later. Jackson first set out for India in February 2008, to see what treasures the royal collections would yield.     The Patiala necklace    Her enthusiasm for putting together the exhibition is infectious \u2013 Jackson is determined to go beyond the general history of the maharajas: &quot;We tried to show [the keepers of the royal collections] that what we really wanted to do is tell the whole story about who these rulers were, why they were important and why their culture was so important.&quot; Bizzarely, perhaps, Jackson&apos;s first stop wasn&apos;t India but Geneva, where the legendary Patiala necklace, a ceremonial item commissioned by the Maharaja of Patalia in 1928 from the French jewellers Cartier, is housed in a high-security vault. Originally containing 2,930 diamonds (including the infamous, golf-ball size, yellow De Beers diamond), the necklace has been stolen, smuggled, sold and restored, long before it was ever entrusted to the V&amp;A. Like a magpie fixated with a sparkling find, Jackson was determined to negotiate the necklace&apos;s loan and exhibit it in Britain for the first time. &quot;It&apos;s such an iconic object for us,&quot; she says \u2013 as &quot;jewellery is such an important aspect of royal splendour.&quot; Only once the Cartier loan was approved did Jackson set off to visit the royal collections of Udaipur and Jodhpur. As word of the visit spread, she and a colleague gained access to previously unknown collections and made several trips, viewing hundreds of pieces, to select the final 50 \u2013 thrones, jewel-encrusted swords, even a Rolls-Royce ordered by the Crown Prince of Mewar in 1927. There followed a labyrinthine series of paperwork to enable the works to travel. This meant persuading descendants to send their treasures out on loan \u2013 for the first time, in many cases. Negotiation is often the hardest part of putting together an exhibition \u2013 no payment is involved and the relationship between lender and receiver is based entirely on trust.\u00a0 Some works, as Philip Rylands, director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice explains, will never be loaned due to their fragility. Other factors that colour a decision to lend are the value of the proposed exhibition and whether the lender wants to borrow from the borrower in the future. &quot;If you are going to be a borrower you have to be a lender, so some of it is obligatory,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s true that exhibitions can be very good for works of art. They can put works in a context, make people understand their position in an oeuvre of an artist.&quot; None of the people I spoke to could think of \u2013 or were willing to reveal \u2013 any incidents where art on the move had been damaged or lost. Tales of transit horror (crates left on runways, valuables dismantled en route, say) are either well-kept secrets or the stuff of urban myth. In any case, prior to the objects being packed up, curators assess their condition and carry out any necessary work using local conservators \u2013 in the V&amp;A&apos;s case, the Indian Ministry of Culture offered to underwrite the expense, recognising that the exhibition would be telling its country&apos;s history. Only after several parties have been involved in the sign-off can the transit \u2013 carefully \u2013 begin.     Artworks in storage    This is where global fine art movers such as New York-based Crozier Fine Arts come in. Formed by Bob Crozier in 1976, the company was originally set up to help his sculptor brother and friends move artworks between studios and galleries in New York. Since then, Crozier has held and transferred $6bn worth of art to museums, private collections and auctions. Some pieces have rested in his storage facilities for years, stored with the kind of discretion that keeps the company on speed dial for much of the art world. The New York storage facility nestles alongside the city&apos;s newest and hippest art galleries in the former meat-packing district of Chelsea. Stepping off the street through a nondescript doorway, the sweltering heat is offset by the cold floors; the art stored out of sight in windowless rooms. There are special rooms for artworks that are on sale. So secret is the process by which buyers view these works that code words\u00a0are used instead of the real names of sellers and buyers. One viewing room, housing a Donald Judd sculpture, resembles a pristine, climate-controlled prison cell, all white walls and concrete flooring. Potential buyers file in to sit on the chair placed in front of the sculpture while they decide whether to bid or not. It is a world in which confidentiality agreements abound \u2013 from the staff unpacking, stacking and loading the art to the movers themselves. If you&apos;re expecting burly removal men you&apos;d be wrong \u2013 all of Crozier&apos;s employees have a background in the arts and many are artists. At the head of it all, Crozier manoeuvres each step of the international journey. With a mixture of strict professionalism and caginess essential for his job, Crozier is unwilling to divulge the tiniest detail on the number of artworks shipped each week or the type of objects coming into the storage facility; the fear of art thieves, it seems, makes the journey of an artwork the most complex and closely guarded aspect of organising an exhibition. The recession may have put holes in the schedules of many touring shows, but there&apos;s little doubt as to what is driving much of this trade: the growth of the blockbuster exhibition. Curator Brendan Moore from the British Museum says that when he arrived 15 years ago, &quot;the [museum] was doing a lot of international loans, but the increase in the level, the sheer volume of things, is phenomenal.&quot; Between 2002 and 2008, the number of touring international exhibitions drawn entirely from the British Museum&apos;s own collections has increased by more than 100%, he says. The number of individual loans to international venues is up by about a quarter in the same period. Another factor is technology: climate-controlled trucks and new crating methods that keep air flowing and banish humidity have greatly improved the safety of objects in transit. Rylands, however, believes there is &quot;something remorseless&quot; about exhibition programming. Jackson, of the V&amp;A, outlines the pressure on museums: &quot;You always have to think you are as good as your last show, you always have to do something more interesting.&quot; But it is the blockbuster exhibition that has fostered this growth. &quot;There is extraordinary enthusiasm and appetite for culture in whatever form,&quot; Brendan Moore concurs. More exhibitions equals more art on loan, which in turn means more art in transit from location to location under the strictest veil of secrecy. As Crozier explains it, the entire industry is based on a merry-go-round of &quot;who&apos;s got what and wants what&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Chicago and Rio de Janeiro are considered favourites, with Tokyo and Madrid also in the running."], "tags": ["Sport", "Rugby union", "Golf", "Boxing", "Olympic Games 2012", "Rio 2016", "International Olympic Committee", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-12T19:50:57Z", "title": "Golf and rugby sevens considered strong favourites to be included for 2016 Olympics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/12/golf-rugby-sevens-olympic-games", "article": "The International Olympic Committee will tomorrow recommend two new sports to be added to the Games from 2016, with golf and rugby sevens considered the strong favourites. Meeting in Berlin, the IOC executive board will also consider a total of 33 changes to the 26 existing sports for London 2012, including the addition of women&apos;s boxing for the first time and a decision on adding another women&apos;s cycling sprint that will dictate whether Victoria Pendleton can target a second gold in the velodrome. Despite having been rejected last time it was considered for inclusion in 2005, boxing officials are &quot;quietly confident&quot; that IOC president Jacques Rogge, a former boxing doctor, will confirm that women will be allowed to compete for the first time since it was included as a demonstration event in 1904. The move will be hailed as a victory by those who have campaigned for more equality between the number of medals available to men and women, and make London 2012 the first Olympics to have women competing in all sports. Rebecca Gibson, national women&apos;s boxing development manager at the Amateur Boxing Association of England, said the sport had experienced a surge in popularity since 2005, with the number of women boxing competitively swelling from 50 to around 700. It was a perceived lack of competition around the world that led to its bid for inclusion being rejected in 2005, but the number of international federations with competitive women boxers had grown from around 70 to 120 in the past four years. Coincidentally, 1904 was also the year that golf was last included in the Olympics, while rugby has not featured since 1924. The board will select two sports from a list of seven following an exhaustive selection process, which will then go forward to be ratified by the full IOC membership in Copenhagen in October at a meeting that will also decide on the venue for the 2016 Games. Chicago and Rio de Janeiro are considered favourites, with Tokyo and Madrid also in the running. Although rugby sevens and golf have long been considered frontrunners, partly for their revenue potential in terms of sponsorship and TV rights, board members said the field remained open for the other five: baseball, softball, squash, karate and roller sports. Golfs supporters have made a strong case on the grounds of its commercial potential and global popularity but there is likely to be fierce debate around the boardroom table about the merits of making golf an Olympic sport with European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie and Annika Sorenstam, the most successful woman in the game, fronting a presentation in June aimed at assuaging fears that the sport&apos;s top names would not attach enough importance to winning Olympic gold. Golf proposes a 72-hole stroke-play competition for men and women, with 60 players in each field. The world&apos;s top 15 players would qualify automatically, and all major professional tours would alter tournament schedules to avoid clashing with the Olympics. R&amp;A chief executive Peter Dawson, leading the bid in his capacity as joint secretary of the International Golf Federation, promised the sport&apos;s biggest names would take part. &quot;We have major championships that are the pinnacle of golf, but the Olympics are the pinnacle of sport and golf also deserves to be represented there,&quot; he said. Tiger Woods has vowed to play in the 2016 Games if he has not retired by then. The International Rugby Board is considered to have made a persuasive case for the inclusion of sevens, seen as easier to stage and schedule for television than the 15-a-side game. Executives have worked hard to counter the perception that it is dominated by just a few nations and promised to drop the Sevens World Cup in order to give the Olympics primacy.It is hoped that the inclusion of the sport would help grow the game in new markets including America and Asia and encourage investment in schools. &quot;I read and heard that golf and rugby were the favourites, but I&apos;ve heard some reservations as well,&quot; board member Denis Oswald said. &quot;It&apos;s pretty open and difficult to predict.&quot; Other proposed changes that could be ratified in time for 2012 include the addition of mixed doubles in tennis, 50-metre sprints in swimming, BMX freestyle events in cycling and a new format for modern pentathlon."}, {"sentences": ["FASHION GRAVEYARD     Blah Blah in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Celebrity", "Victoria Beckham", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-13T11:30:53Z", "title": "Fashion Statement: Return of the Wags", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/13/victoria-beckham-fashion-wags", "article": "FASHION DILEMMA The Wags are back, or are they? Another August, another Premiership football season. This is a subject we thought Fashion Statement would never cover, but actually we&apos;re quite looking forward to seeing the Wags - Coleen, Victoria, Whatserface, Thingummy - again this Saturday. Our confident predictions include a national shortage of fake tan; several new reality TV programmes featuring fame-hungry wannabes; tonnes of hair extensions shipped in from eastern Europe; and a certain air of &apos;eau de desperation&apos; titillating our quivering nostrils. A heady mixture indeed \u2026 However, much like the wind inexorably shapes the landscape of a desert, so time has wrought its changes on the original Wags. Wag number one, Victoria Beckham, has moved on to pastures new and is now firmly established in Los Angeles as an actual fashion designer. Indeed, her last two dress collections have been received with critical acclaim.  She has recently decided that she will no longer appear in the Armani underwear ads, which is such a shame as they gave rise to some excellent quotes from Daily Mail readers. Our personal favourite comes from Lilla in Reading, who described Posh as a &quot;praying mantis&quot; in the latest one where she is perched on a ladder.  Victoria recently did a guest judging slot in place of Paula Abdul on American Idol and, more upsettingly for us at least, she is rumoured to have had her breast implants taken out to achieve a more &apos;couture&apos; look. We always liked her chest - it reminded us of the lifejacket demonstration on board an aeroplane. We were convinced that Posh had concealed a little red tube somewhere about her person, ready to blow into and inflate her chest whenever the need arose. There is a final piece of evidence to prove that Victoria is Waggish no more. According to internet rumours, Anna Wintour is putting her on the front cover of US Vogue in October. Can we still class Victoria as a Wag then when she shares the same accolade as Michelle Obama?  We&apos;re not sure, but it doesn&apos;t matter anyway because we still have Coleen. Admittedly she&apos;s been rather out of the limelight lately, but this is simply down to her impending motherhood. According to the ever-reliable Now magazine, she&apos;ll be partying again as soon as Baby Rooney is born.  On to the question of what the child will wear: if it&apos;s a girl, we expect her to be in high heels before she can walk. Heelarious products should do the trick. If Coleen matches this with a Baby Dior silk dress (it only costs \u00a3395), Baby Rooney will be sorted.  The fun will be in watching the rest of the Wags scrabbling to keep up with the Rooneys by getting their very own baby accessory.  BANG ON TREND     Izzy Lane's autumn/winter collection 09. Photograph: PR    Tweed Formerly reserved for foxhunters, the elderly, and professors with a penchant for leather elbow-patches, tweed is the go-to fabric for autumn and winter. Seen on the catwalks for Gucci, Luella, and Burberry Prorsum, next season&apos;s twist is to wear it in shades of grey - or &apos;salt and pepper&apos;, as Vogue put it. We think the best way to wear tweed (and the way most of the catwalks were doing it) is in the form of a coat or jacket. Don&apos;t be tempted by tweed trousers. Please. There&apos;s not much around at the moment, what with it being August and everything, but we&apos;ve managed to dig out a few examples for you. Marni&apos;s version of the tweed coat has an interesting deconstructed feel to it, and might do well for those of you who don&apos;t want to go with a traditional look. However, at \u00a3905 it&apos;s certainly an &apos;investment piece&apos;, and not one for the faint-hearted (or empty-walleted). Izzy Lane&apos;s long coat has an empire line cut, with bold shoulders, interesting buckles and a high neck to keep you warm in the winter. Costing \u00a3395 it&apos;s made with wool taken from British flocks, and is a conscience-pleasing buy.  Jaeger&apos;s take on a tweed double-breasted coat is pretty similar to Gucci&apos;s catwalk look: if you want to make it that bit more authentic, fasten a wide patent black belt round the waist. Good news: it&apos;s also been reduced from \u00a3450 to \u00a3157.50. Perfect for the office or the evening is Karen Millen&apos;s fitted grey tweed jacket. Their website gives you a couple of ideas of how to wear it. It costs \u00a3180 from karenmillen.com. Firetrap is currently stocking a brown woollen coat that nips in at the waist and flares out at the hips. It&apos;s a flattering cut, made more interesting with wider-than-average lapels. At \u00a3145, it&apos;s not a bad price either.  To be totally on-trend, go for men&apos;s tailoring - Christian Lacroix&apos;s catwalk show had models wearing oversized blazers with broad shoulders and big buttons. Net-a-porter.com has a Chloe wool blazer in tweed for the princely sum of \u00a31,335 (we do love a ridiculous price tag in Fashion Statement). Finally, Whistles has a much more affordable short-sleeved summer blazer for \u00a340.  FASHIONISTAS OF THE WEEK     A perfect pair.

SHOPPING NEWS We have recently become aware of a new trend towards using unconventional leather. We&apos;re not talking goats or sheep here; instead we&apos;ve seen products made out of chicken feet, whale and eel. The company that has alerted us to this is BoBelle, which makes beautiful purses and handbags out of eel skin. The eel skins are a byproduct of the Asian food industry and would normally be thrown away. Instead, they are gathered up and transformed into striking accessories. The leather is soft and finely patterned, and it we can testify that it definitely doesn&apos;t smell of fish. Visit bobelle.co.uk for more details.  To celebrate the 125th anniversary of Jaeger, the heritage brand has launched a capsule collection of limited edition menswear for winter. Taking inspiration from their archives, vintage pieces have been re-worked to give them a modern twist.

OUT AND ABOUT We mentioned the Little Do Lectures a few weeks ago. Well, now it&apos;s the turn of the big Do Lectures. If you fancy a trip down to Cardigan Bay in west Wales, go and check them out. The idea is to inspire people who have an idea, giving them practical tools or new ways of thinking that will help them to realise their dreams. Each speaker is from a different field, from business to science, politics to the environment. The lectures run from 3-7 September; for more details and to buy tickets visit thedolectures.co.uk. If you&apos;re a Londoner, pay a visit to the Thames Festival Classic Rally, a brand-new three-day event taking place in St Katharine Docks, London, from today. Lots of classic boats will moor up for the occasion, and the sailors will be in classic costumes particular to the era of their boat. On Saturday evening Tower Bridge will open and each boat will take part in a twilight procession up the River Thames. For more information, visit the website.

Bit while he is lionised at home as the master of anim\u00e9, the director has struggled to capture the public imagination in the US. Miyazaki&apos;s hopes for a breakthrough in the biggest movie market in the world now rest with Ponyo, the tale of a playful goldfish who longs to be a little girl, released by Disney in the US today. Positive reviews of his previous work have failed to prompt more than a lukewarm response from moviegoers in North America. In 2003, the year his Spirited Away won an Oscar for best animated film, box office sales in the US and Canada reached a modest $10m, compared with $356m in the rest of the world. The pattern was repeated two years later with Howl&apos;s Moving Castle, which made $4.7m in North America but $230m elsewhere.     Ponyo director Hayao Miyazaki. Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP    Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen&apos;s The Little Mermaid, Ponyo earned $160m in Japan and sealed Miyazaki&apos;s reputation as the country&apos;s foremost living director. After sneaking away from her underwater home, Ponyo befriends Sosuke, a five-year-old boy who lives in a cottage overlooking the coast, and her transformation into a human begins. While much of the film&apos;s charm hinges on its fanciful storyline and impeccable production values, there is room for consideration of the weighty theme of environmental destruction as the plot takes a darker turn. Chastened, perhaps, by past disappointments, Miyazki, 68, has taken no risks in preparing for Ponyo&apos;s US release in partnership with the Pixar and Disney creative guru John Lasseter. Audiences will be treated to an English-language original produced by Lasseter, the animation wizard behind Toy Story and Cars. In an attempt to broaden the film&apos;s appeal the makers have recruited an all-star cast of character voices including Liam Neeson, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett. The inclusion of Frankie Jonas, the younger brother of the Jonas Brothers, as Sosuke, and Noah Cyrus, the younger sister of Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus as Ponyo, should help attract the youth market. Miyazaki&apos;s ability to tap into a child&apos;s fevered imagination, coupled with his richly colourful, hand-drawn frames, have been rewarded with almost universal critical acclaim in Japan and huge earnings for his Studio Ghibli, near Tokyo. Experts say he deserves more credit for his record in the US. &quot;The US box office figures aren&apos;t great compared with Pixar and Disney, but compared with other Japanese films in the states they didn&apos;t do badly,&quot; said Mark Schilling, an authority on Japanese cinema. Few Japanese movies have travelled well in the US in the past 30 years, with the notable exceptions of Tampopo (Juzo Itami, 1985), Shall We Dance (Masayuki Suo, 1996) and Dreams (Akira Kurosawa, 1990). &quot;If the people behind Ponyo can get the number of screens, the publicity and TV advertising right, then it could do better than Spirited Away,&quot; Schilling said. Despite his lower profile in the US, Miyazaki, instantly recognisable from his shock of white hair, has been nicknamed the Japanese Walt Disney, a comparison he is said to find discomfiting. In an interview in Los Angeles shortly before Ponyo&apos;s US premiere, the self-effacing Miyazaki was typically nonchalant about the film&apos;s prospects. &quot;Since John [Lasseter] is right beside me, it&apos;s hard for me to say this, but I&apos;m not that concerned whether it&apos;s going to be a success or not. I came here to show that I am responsible for what I made,&quot; he told Reuters. In the US it has received mixed reviews. The film critic Christy Lemire suggested it would appeal most to children under five and adults on hallucinogenic drugs. For everyone else, Lemire said: &quot;Ponyo will seem beautiful but surprisingly boring: a children&apos;s film that&apos;s at once overly simplistic and needlessly nonsensical.&quot; The New York-based film critic Ethan Alter was more generous. &quot;If you have never seen a Miyazaki film before, now&apos;s a great time to start.&quot; Profile: Miyazaki Hayao  Born in 1941 in Tokyo, Miyazaki honed his skills in childhood drawing aeroplanes and battleships. He started drawing human forms after seeing the groundbreaking Japanese animated film Hakujaden as a teenager. After graduating from Gakushuin University with degrees in politics and economics, he worked as an artist at Toei animation, where he became involved in the trade union movement. After a string of successes with Toei and A Pro, he co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985 with the director Isao Takahata. Miyazaki gained recognition with Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbour Totoro (1988) and Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service (1989). His 1997 film Princess Mononoke was for a while the highest grossing film of all time in Japan. In 2003 he won an Oscar for best animated feature with Spirited Away, which broke Japanese box office and attendance records. Miyazaki&apos;s 2004 film Howl&apos;s Moving Castle, an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones&apos;s fantasy novel, earned 1.4bn yen in its first two days. Ponyo, shown on a record 481 screens in Japan, is entirely hand-drawn."}, {"sentences": ["In fact, Ozu was never simplistic: he made mischievous black comedies in the 1920s, and his heroine Noriko truly battled with marriage in his Tokyo trilogy."], "tags": ["World cinema", "Jean-Luc Godard", "Film", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-14T23:01:00Z", "title": "Emilie Bickerton on Nagisa Oshima's In the Realm of the Senses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/15/nagisa-oshima-godard", "article": "Nagisa Oshima has always had a kamikaze streak. The 77-year-old Japanese director&apos;s filmography counts over 25 features, and each serves to contradict the next. &quot;After every film,&quot; he says, &quot;I am compelled to destroy it by making another, completely different.&quot; This has been Oshima&apos;s way of avoiding any kind of classification. International critics called him the Japanese Godard but he snapped back: &quot;Godard is the French Oshima.&quot; And forget comparisons with his predecessors Yasujiro Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi and Mikio Naruse. His whole career has been a battle against that tradition, starting with banning the colour green from his mise en sc\u00e8ne - too evocative of gardens, softness and nature - along with any scenes involving actors sitting on tatami mats. In his 1995 documentary 100 Years of Japanese Cinema, Oshima reserved just a few seconds for the grand masters, and placed his work, with that of his peers Yoshishige Yoshida and Shohei Imamura, at the forefront. In the 1960s, he was tipped as a leading light in Japan&apos;s New Wave, though he couldn&apos;t stand the term. It was coined partly because he emerged at the same time as the nouvelle vague in France; Oshima made his first film in 1959, the year Truffaut triumphed at Cannes with The 400 Blows. Both groups wanted to throw national &quot;quality cinema&quot; in the bin. They experimented with form and narrative structure, and exploited lighter cameras and direct sound. They all wrote film criticism before becoming directors. But Oshima found the work of the Young Turks in Paris &quot;too light&quot;. He was far more taken with the new, politically charged cinema burgeoning in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Brazil. Unlike the French kids, who at first were all about fast cars and gangsters, Oshima was a militant. His fourth film, Night and Fog in Japan (Resnais was one Frenchman he did admire), was an anatomisation of the Communist party just after the 1960 student rebellion. But his studio deemed it too politically sensitive and kicked him out. Outraged by this &quot;massacre&quot;, he spent 1962-65 travelling around Vietnam and Korea and making documentaries for television on such discomfiting subjects as Korean-Japanese relations.  Many of Oshima&apos;s works will be on show at the BFI&apos;s retrospective in September. Selected for the extended run is In the Realm of the Senses, a product of Oshima&apos;s 1970s period when, true to form, he again de-routed his route. In 1976, he became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre with his study of Sada the housemaid, imprisoned in 1936 after cutting off the genitals of her lover and carrying them around in a silk purse. Oshima&apos;s film was almost entirely set in the bedroom, and scene after scene showed the couple enjoying various sexual games, before their bond twisted to its extreme conclusion. In the Realm had to be produced in France to avoid Japanese censors, but Oshima promptly faced an obscenity trial back home when the script and stills were published. He was acquitted after the jury were left speechless, unable to answer Oshima&apos;s demand that they define what they found obscene.  After In the Realm, Oshima reinvented himself as a popular talk-show host advising distraught housewives on national television, and advertised a brand of insect repellent. In the 1980s, back with the movies, he took on more international collaborations as funding in Japan grew increasingly difficult. He attacked genre cinema through his anti-Apocalypse Now, Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, starring David Bowie as a British officer in a Japanese POW camp. The love-affair-with-a-chimp saga, Max Mon Amour, was scripted by Luis Bu\u00f1uel&apos;s long-time writer, Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, and shot by Raoul Coutard, but all this couldn&apos;t save it from being an appalling film. In the 1990s, after his 100 Years documentary, Oshima suffered a stroke. In 1999, however, he managed to contradict ailing health to make what is likely his last film. Taboo would be a worthy one to go out on. It is an elegant, unique rendition of the samurai genre, centred on the declared and repressed passions between warriors at a training school. It has been an extraordinary career, sketching a history of Japan from the viewpoint of one of its original postwar artist rebels. Oshima&apos;s oeuvre is impressive on the grounds of reinvention and productivity alone. But the BFI&apos;s retrospective also allows one to draw out a number of threads binding the whole together. In particular, Oshima&apos;s sympathy for criminals and outcasts: the scheming boys and young lovers in A Town of Love and Hope (1959), Cruel Story of Youth (1960) and Boy (1969), the &quot;daylight demon&quot; rapist in Violence at Noon (1966), the convicted Korean in the terrific Death By Hanging (1968), insatiable Sada from In the Realm. A society, Oshima says, gets the criminals it deserves, and a crime is a desperate act by someone who feels he has no power. Political frustration - from disappointed revolutionary hopes to the failure to change inhibiting social mores - is at the heart of Oshima&apos;s work. But though Oshima&apos;s darkness and pessimism runs deep, like his hero Bu\u00f1uel&apos;s, it is also restless and cannot stand wallowing. Oshima was born in Kyoto in 1932. His father was a civil servant. He picked up Marx and Freud from the family library, and his political formation came through the immediate postwar tensions in Japan: the general strike of 1947; the Pacific war; Emperor Hirohito&apos;s capitulation after the atomic bombings, and America&apos;s subsequent occupation; and, especially, the mass student struggles against the Korean war and Japan&apos;s renewal of the Security Treaty with the US. In retrospect, Oshima locates the dashed ideals of his generation in their failure to block the Treaty&apos;s ratification. After studying law, he was hired in 1955 as an assistant director at Shochiku studio. It was an exciting time in the industry: the &quot;sun tribe&quot; films - so called for being adaptations of the popular novels centred on the shenanigans of teenagers on the beach - were causing a real stir. Punishment Room and Crazed Fruit especially shocked Japanese audiences for their raw, lurid portrayals of rich-kid delinquency - a new demographic in the country, and certainly on cinema screens. To the young Oshima, the films marked a shift away from the dominant production-line mentality of directors. One of his most famous early works of criticism came after seeing the latest sun tribe offering in 1958, when he wrote the article &quot;Is This a Breakthrough? The Modernists in Japanese Cinema&quot; for the film magazine he ran for three years with fellow director Yoshida. Oshima concluded there was, &quot;in the sound of the girl&apos;s skirt being ripped and the hum of the motorboat slashing through the older brother, the tide of a new age . . . a powerful irresistible force had arrived in Japanese cinema.&quot; The director quickly contributed to this tidal change with A Town of Love and Hope. (The saccharine title was not his own: the studio rejected his The Boy Who Sold Pigeons.) The film follows a child as he chases a fast buck by selling pigeons in the knowledge they will fly back to him so he can &quot;sell&quot; the birds anew. Oshima&apos;s deeper artistic project was to mount a full-scale attack on traditional Japanese cinema. The &quot;holy trinity&quot; of Ozu, Mizoguchi and Naruse were undisputed masters the world over, but to the 27-year-old Oshima they were merely an expressionof the cinema he despised. The Japanese had experienced defeat not once but twice: in the forced opening up to the west as the Edo era came to an end at the 19th century; and in the second world war. Victimisation, Oshima believed, was ingrained in the national psyche, and such films as Ozu&apos;s taught audiences - through their dignity, still camera, domestic-based plots and meticulous composition (Ozu forced one actress to pick up a cup dozens of times over to get the action just right) - that all struggles against the grain, against the seasons, against the &quot;way things are&quot;, were futile. True wisdom and maturity would only be achieved when one accepted this. In fact, Ozu was never simplistic: he made mischievous black comedies in the 1920s, and his heroine Noriko truly battled with marriage in his Tokyo trilogy. But Oshima did not care for the subtleties of interpretation, and audiences usually took away one clear message. Japan&apos;s claustrophobic studio system meant he immediately embraced the auteur role. French critics at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma had given the notion a history and a future, tracing a lineage from Griffith, Murnau and Lang through to Hawks, Hitchcock and Preminger, and then reinvented it on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Oshima, however, understood the term in his own way: subjectivity was key, but this could and should change with every film, rather than being an eternal essence leaving its discernible mark in each work. An aesthetic revolution alone was never Oshima&apos;s goal. Like the Young Turks, he wanted passionately to throw off the shackles of the dominant cin\u00e9ma de papa of the time, but Godard, Rivette and the rest also wanted to establish film&apos;s autonomy in France against its use as an ideological tool in the cold war. Oshima, however, was already politicised when he started making films, and always saw his work as a &quot;social act&quot;. His primary struggle was against the very fact that film in Japan was considered an art and yet he couldn&apos;t bear its rule book. Formal brilliance could still convey conservative messages. Because Oshima&apos;s filming techniques were not wholly different from those of Godard or Rivette, he initially received a lukewarm reception: he was &quot;mediocre&quot; and had &quot;nothing new to tell us&quot;. Violence at Noon, for example, based on the true story of a rapist who terrorised Japan in the late 1950s, is made up of some 2,000 shots, involves skewed camera angles, jump cuts, pans and hand-held sequences, and is held together by a narrative reminiscent of Last Year at Marienbad, as it follows the jumbled memories of two traumatised women. The characters all have the icy quality of Belmondo in Breathless or Moreau in Jules et Jim: restless, attractive but never endearing. The apolitics of the New Wave lasted until 1965. Godard started to think more about the possibility of militant film-making, Chris Marker collected short films for the anti-auteur Far from Vietnam and Rivette shook it all up by booting out the old reverence for mise en sc\u00e8ne and telling audiences he would pull them out of their cocoons: the golden age of cine-clubs and cinephilia is dead! It was at this point that French critics really started to take notice of Oshima&apos;s work, along with that of Glauber Rocha in Brazil, Andrzej Wajda in Poland and John Cassavetes in the US. The French Maoists-to-be decided these political, narrative-busting works from independent directors were the future of film. The importance of France for Oshima increased as his career developed, most notably in the making of In the Realm of the Senses in 1976. This was his first collaboration with the maverick nouvelle vague producer Anatole Dauman, who funded the film. Dauman was capitalising on the lifting of censorship laws in France in the 70s (which led to an influx of porn films made and screened in the country) and offered to back Oshima&apos;s project of putting onto the screen the erotic tragedy of Sada and her lover. Bertolucci&apos;s popular success with Last Tango in Paris in 1972 proved audiences had an appetite for the risqu\u00e9, and Pasolini had just raised the bar for graphic artistry so high with Sal\u00f2 that just about anything seemed possible. In the Realm was very much of its time. From a director such as Oshima, it was provocative because it was so apolitical. This was deliberate. By choosing a purely physical, narcissistic subject-matter, Oshima was making a point about the retreat of collective political movements by the mid-70s. Misleadingly, the film is often seen as art-house porn and as a high point in Oshima&apos;s career; but really it&apos;s a pity the BFI selected it for the extended run. It is easy to get hold of - Criterion have just released a Blu-ray version - and there is not that much to see. To Oshima&apos;s credit, though, the constant run of sex scenes are not just stylised pornography. You watch and think - the latter being what porn denies - as the increasingly complicated dynamic between Sada and the rather sweet but disturbingly passive Kichizo works itself out. The film grapples with what Simone de Beauvoir might have called the infuriating otherness of the other. If you love and desire your partner, how can you bear their independence? How, in short, can love be anything but masochistic? In the Realm is interesting for showing how these problems play out in a Japanese context, but it is by no means Oshima&apos;s masterpiece. Luckily, the real gems are also on show in London. What makes Oshima an exceptional figure in modern cinema is not two hours of erotica culminating in genital mutilation; anyone can show that, and lately many have. Far more important are Oshima&apos;s sharp analyses of Korean-Japanese relations, explored in the television works. Until now, no programmer had managed to clear the rights to show them. Formally experimental documentaries, they reveal the historical depth to Oshima&apos;s rebellion against Japanese tradition: he uses a wealth of newsreel footage and builds in criticisms of the imperial system and the rise of militarism. Among the unpalatable subjects he took on was the fate of &quot;the forgotten army&quot;, the injured Korean veterans living in Japan who had fought in the Japanese army. Alongside this, the BFI will screen his feature on Korean-Japanese relations, Death by Hanging; and then Boy, The Ceremony, Diary of a Shinjuku Thief and Three Resurrected Drunkards. These films represent the peaks in Oshima&apos;s oeuvre, and after viewing them one might just about forgive his airbrushing Ozu, Mizoguchi and Naruse from the history of Japanese cinema to make way for his own work. It is possible, though, to admire Oshima along with the &quot;holy trinity&quot;, because Ozu and his peers have so much to teach us about aesthetics, as well as Japanese history and culture. Ozu once said he could only make &quot;tofu&quot; movies, and Oshima agreed: &quot;Bean curd was the only thing he knew how to cook. He could not make a &apos;beefsteak&apos; movie. I feel that what I&apos;ve been doing in my films is something much closer to making sake. Sometimes my films approach the full blends and rich flavour that the sake should have, and at other times they&apos;re very raw and become the kind of sake that burns your throat as it goes down.&quot; Bean curd we shouldn&apos;t do without, but sake makes the whole picture of modern cinema that much more interesting. \u2022 The Nagisa Oshima season is at BFI Southbank, London SE1, from 28 August to 25 September.

Rio Ferdinand is out of today&apos;s game. He came back from the England friendly with a back injury but has, apparently, tweaked a calf in training as well. That leaves John O&apos;Shea and Jonny Evans in central defence, which at least gives Birmingham a glimmer of a chance. However, they haven&apos;t won at Old Trafford since sometime in the dark ages (or 1978). They&apos;ve also yet to score a goal at Old Trafford in the Premier League. Ever.  Antonio Valencia will start for United, as will Nani, and Birmingham will give Joe Hart his debut in the Blues goal after he joined them on loan from Manchester City. Michael Owen won&apos;t start, he&apos;s on the bench. The more important question, however, is whether Fergie will keep up his 100% record. One match into the season (well, if the Community Sheild counts as the season) and the following day was dominated by headlines of the Manchester United manager hectoring the referee. Can he do the same today?  Teams: Man Utd: Foster, Fabio Da Silva, O&apos;Shea, Jonathan Evans, Evra, Valencia, Fletcher, Scholes, Nani, Berbatov, Rooney. Subs: Kuszczak, Brown, Owen, Anderson, Giggs, Gibson, De Laet. Birmingham: Hart, Carr, Roger Johnson, Queudrue, Vignal, Larsson, Ferguson, Carsley, Fahey, McFadden, Jerome. Subs: Maik Taylor, O&apos;Connor, Phillips, Benitez, McSheffrey, Parnaby, O&apos;Shea. Referee: Lee Mason (Lancashire, as if anyone really cares where he&apos;s from.)  Wayne Rooney says he wants to play up front, in the middle and says it&apos;s more likely to happen this season. He says he wants to score more than 23 goals up there too. Standing behind him, while he tells all of this to the Sky cameras, is Michael Owen. He still has a look on his face like he can&apos;t quite believe his luck. He&apos;s probably right not to either.  An email: Paraphrasing (either wittingly or unwittingly) what they&apos;ve just said on the telly, Luis has this to say: &quot;I&apos;m predicting a boring draw as per the last few seasons at Old Trafford, which will inevitably lead to Birmingham getting relegated. Newcastle and Reading also drew there on the opening day of the season in the past two years and see where that got them. Key for Birmingham is, if at 85 minutes gone it&apos;s still a draw, just let United score.&quot;  Meanwhile, on the telly, Jamie Redknapp is aiming his crotch unerringly at the cameras in a vaguely threatening way. I have a genre-defining hangover. That&apos;s not helping.  Fergie says he doesn&apos;t know how long Rio will be out, Carrick gets the chop because the manager wants to try a different combo in midfield, he adds. He then says well done to the Sky interviewer for asking him three tame questions.  God, Jamie Redknapp&apos;s crotch is shiny. It&apos;s glimmering under the studio lights. I feel unbelievably sick. So very, very sick.  Is Valencia the new Ronaldo dept: No, says Lou Roper. &quot;As a Wigan Athletic supporter (since we were denizens of Division Four), may I say that the \u00a316m Sir AF gave us for Luis Antonio Valencia was a fine piece of business for us. While useful, he must surely be the world&apos;s greatest one-footed player: I have never seen him use his left foot (aside from standing on it) except to score against Derby two seasons ago (which provided yet more redundant evidence of the abject character of that side).&quot;  Another email: &quot;Re. the question of whether Fergie can maintain his record of hectoring the referee?&quot; emails Patrick O&apos;Brien, &quot;I take it that was rhetorical?&quot; A question that isn&apos;t rhetorical is this one: how do you solve a problem like this hangover? Any cures gratefully received.  Big Sam is in the crowd, adding his weighty claps to the minute&apos;s applause in memory of Bobby Robson that precedes the kick off.  We&apos;re off: Birmingham kick off and play it long, where it goes out for a goal kick. Everton have a five man midfield with Cameron Jerome up front and McFadden charged with joining him up there in attack when necessary. Meanwhile Berbatov gets a bang on the head.  3 min: It&apos;s a start best described as inconsequential, until Fletcher tries to head the ball very tamely back to Foster. It doesn&apos;t even get past O&apos;Shea who gives him a panicked look before hoofing it upfield.  4 min: Berbatov tries to work an opening on the left of the box but his cross can&apos;t find Rooney. Valencia then beats Vignal on the right wing but his cross is cleared too. On the subject of hangovers, Lou Roper has this to say: &quot;Gallons of Irn-Bru or, since you&apos;re south of Hadrian&apos;s Wall, perhaps you&apos;ll have to substitute another really fizzy drink.&quot; Tried it; didn&apos;t work.  7 min: Birmingham fashion a chance when Fabio dives into a challenge, getting himself out of position in the process. McFadden swings over a cross from the vacant left wing slot but there&apos;s no-one in the box. Nani then does the same up the other end of the pitch, to similar effect, before a cross does eventually find its way to someone - Rooney, who heads gently up into the air.  9 min: Berbatov has started quite brightly, as he sometimes does, and he charges at the Birmingham box. The ball is knocked back to Fletcher, who shoots from distance, straight into the back of the striker&apos;s heels. Meanwhile Carr gets out of position, allowing Nani to get on the end of a Fletcher pass. His cross cum shot is easily saved by Hart, though.  10 min: Carr gets away with bringing Berbatov down just outside the box before full scale pandemonium ensues in the Birmingham penalty area. Berbatov and Rooney combined to scare the bejesus out of the Blues defenders. Hart came rushing out and prodded the ball into Rooney&apos;s path, where Johnson did some good work blocking. Still, though, Rooney kept at it and who knows how that didn&apos;t go in the goal. &quot;Re: &apos;We&apos;re off ... Everton have a five-man midfield.&apos; Not on the evidence yesterday they don&apos;t,&quot; points out Doug Morrison of my idiocy. Ahem. Apologies. Booze-knack.  13 min: From 25 yards out, Rooney bends a dipping, looping shot towards the top right hand corner. Hart tips it over spectacularly. Your hangover cures, so far, suggest drinking more booze. This man, AR Irving, is clearly a professional. &quot;Having been a bartender for years and suffered several hangovers a week as a result, the best cure I can recommend is greasy food, a large glass of whatever you were drinking last night (hard liquor hopefully) and the third you have already done, which is go to work.&quot; Unfortunately, I&apos;m not sure the powers that be would be happy were I to be sat here with a large pint of booze next to me.  16 min: Birmingham have not really been in this. Jerome is completely exposed up front. He gets onto the end of a pass and simply has to run at the United defence as there is simply nothing else on. Chances are, that&apos;s not going to work very well. &quot;I know what&apos;s good for a hangover \u2026 drinking a lot the night before,&quot; boom booms Chirs Brock.  18 min: McFadden swings in a great cross from the left wing. It&apos;s one of those low swinging ones that goes in between the back four and the keeper. Jerome rushes towards it but it just eludes him. Still, that&apos;s how Birmingham are going to have to do this - on the break and relying on McFadden&apos;s service and Jerome&apos;s legs.  20 min: Vignal crosses from the left now and it seems that&apos;s where Blues are concentrating their attacks. This, in the meantime, sounds almost scientific from Mike: &quot;First of all at least a litre of liquid, preferably water. Next you need some modern anti inflammatories (Diclophenac, Aulin, stuff like this). At a push guzzle an industrial dose of Ibuprofen. Then some sugar for your poor brain, honey by the dollup is best. Bon Maman high fruit jam on dry toast is good for me. Next food. And coffee.&quot;  21 min: Scholes has a dig after some good work from Fletcher, but his shot hits Berbatov&apos;s foot again (he does seem to keep getting in the way of things) and the ball dribbles through to Hart.  23 min: Vignal and McFadden combine up the left again before Fahey drifts a lovely chip over the United defence, which Ferguson just manages to keep in. He can&apos;t do a lot with it, though, allowing United to break. Berbatov has a shot but it&apos;s tame and straight at Hart.  25 min: Scholes pings a long ball at Valencia but it goes over his head and, fortuitously, tees up Berbatov in the box. He&apos;s ludicrously offside and must surely know it, yet still he fires a shot into Joe Hart. &quot;Tried and tested over and over again: Aquarius sports drink! Any serious drinker in Belgium uses it,&quot; says Michael in Belgium, a place where drinking is, indeed, taken very seriously.  27 min: Fabio takes the ball up the right wing and Vignal scrambles itl from him, where it goes behind for United&apos;s first corner. They play it short to Fletcher, who drives the ball on, allowing Berbatov to strike. It&apos;s scrambled back out and United lurk menacingly outside the penalty box. This, by the way, is very clearly not going to happen. I can barely see, let alone do this: &quot;In my youthful hangover days, I found about 90 minutes of energetic squash or raquetball cured me completely,&quot; emails the maniacal Craig McEwan. &quot;At first playing was horrible and almost dangerous, but by the end, all the nasty chemicals had been burned off. Unless you have something else better to do. Good to have a bucket handy too.&quot;  28 min: Nani fires one in from wide on the left. There wasn&apos;t much chance of that going in. &quot;How about hair-shirt, birch across the back, and vow of future abstinence? Alternatively, post-it-notes on your desk reminding you never to be available for the MBM on a Sunday and a list of convincing excuses for the boss,&quot; reckons David Wall, apparently unaware this MBM is a metaphorical hair shirt.  29 min: Vignal and Quedrue are fortunate not to give away a free kick on the edge of the box after taking it in turns to, variously, tug Valencia&apos;s shirt, scrape their studs down his leg and push him over. Instead United get a corner, from which they earn another corner, which they waste.  31 min: Scholes unleashes a Scholes special. After the referee had already awarded a foul against Nani, the ginger midfielder took a massive swipe at Barry Ferguson&apos;s legs, sending him flat on his &apos;arris. Classic stuff from a man who has made tackling a fine art. &quot;The photo above highlights the real impact of Michael Owen&apos;s prowess as a horse tipster,&quot; reckons Ian Copestake.  32 min: Fabio beats Vignal and sends across a cross that Hart clears by thrusting out a hand. The ball could have gone anywhere but, instead of falling to the lurking Rooney, it goes to a Brum defender who puts it behind. From the corner, Nani drifts to the back of the box. The ball comes to him, where he&apos;s entirely unmarked, but he snatches his shot and sends it ballooning over the bar. United should go in to the break a goal up, if they keep this up.  GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Birmingham (Rooney, 34 min): Rooney leaps up to nod a cross at goal. It beats Hart but not the post, however the striker is on hand to tuck it away. I, in the meantime, am clearly some sort of mystic given my comments of, oh, 30 seconds ago. Hangover secret powers.  38 min: Rooney looks dangerously excited now. He runs up the left and tries to ping in an ambitious through ball to Berbatov but can&apos;t thread it through. Jerome, at the other end, keeps the United defence on their toes. He fires in a howitzer from outside the area which goes wide thanks only to the fact it takes a nick off Scholes&apos; heel. From the corner, Birmingham head towards goal and the only thing that prevents them from equalising is Patrice Evra, heading clear on the line. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of nonsense talked about hangover cures ... fizzy drinks, fry ups, badgers tails, walking under ladders etc ... there are only two cures: sleep or more booze,&quot; says Richard Saunders. &quot;I should know I&apos;m a prolific alcoholic. I&apos;m hungover now but at least I can work out the name of the team that&apos;s not United.&quot; Yeah, yeah.  40 min: Rooney comes deep to get the ball, thus breaking United&apos;s more or less rigorous 4-4-2 and Fletcher takes his place up front but he can&apos;t get a shot away. Instead, a few seconds later, he tries to feed Valencia but the onrushing Hart dives on the ball and prevents a strike. This, from Nazim Dikbas, sounds more like a torture than a hangover cure. &quot;Apply gentle, sustained pressure on your eyelids with the palms of your hands. Lights, blobs, blurry shapes will begin to appear, gradually covering your visual sphere, this is normal. Release pressure when your eyes feel like they&apos;re popping out of their sockets. Repeat three times. Not for glaucoma sufferers. Good luck.&quot; Luck? I&apos;ll need a bloody doctor after that.  44 min: Birmingham win a free kick deep into United&apos;s half, wide on the left. The ball is swung over and evades more or less everyone. The worry, though, is that Foster is caught in no man&apos;s land, not claiming, punching nor remaining on his line. He doesn&apos;t look the world class keeper Fergie claims he is.  Peep, peep: Nani and Rooney combine on the left to feed Fletcher, who can&apos;t get a shot off. They then toy with Birmingham outside the box, threading a series of beautiful passes together. Evra then cuts the ball back to Fletcher, alone on the penalty spot, he somehow sends the ball wide. How did he miss that? The referee is so bewildered, he blows for half time so we can all go and have a think about it.   Hangover cure dept: Ben McFarland, a man who is infrequently of this parish and a booze hound, writes ostensibly to offer his advice. In reality, he&apos;s trying to plug his book. &quot;I imagine much of your discomfort this afternoon can be attributed to the industrial, chemical-clad, yellow fizzy giggle juice that masquerades as beer in pubs these days. Had, you launched your laughing gear into liquids of a more discerning nature, you&apos;d be feeling in far finer fettle. Where, I hear you ask, can I find information about these magic brews? Why, by buying World&apos;s Best Beers by Ben McFarland, available in all good bookshops priced \u00a325 (less on Amazon).&quot; \u00a325? No wonder you&apos;ve got money to throw around on fancy beers.  WILL SOMEONE DO SOMETHING ABOUT REDKNAPP&apos;S CROTCH! It&apos;s back again in all its shiny monstrosity. Will someone not think of the children? Or my head. &quot;No crotch-action in the Norwegian Canal Plus-studio,&quot; writes someone whose name, I think, is Torbj\u00f8rn. &quot;There are two former United-Rons in the form of Ron Atkinson and Ronny Johnsen. The latter flogging his biography ...&quot; The former, no doubt, desperately trying to get his career back on track.  More cures: This one, from Damon McMenamin comes far too late. &quot;Been in Tokyo for a year and the local secret which never fails is to have sashimi before bed. Much easier to say than do, I can tell you.&quot; Certainly easy to do the night before than the day after, which is where I find myself.Meanwhile this, from Sarah Lawton, makes me feel like an unbelievable wimp. The pain of typing out the odd few words about a football game through a fug of day old booze is as nothing compared to this: &quot;I&apos;m feeling your pain. Am at work surrounded by about 300 small children all having a whale of a time. One of them has a megaphone. Staying out til 4am boozing probably wasn&apos;t the best idea I&apos;ve ever had.&quot;  Another cure that won&apos;t be happening: &quot;It&apos;s part physical, part psychological,&quot; says Dave Slater in Dublin. &quot;Put on your iPod, and play some metal/grunge louder than you can bear. Down an egg cracked into a pint of orange juice. After ten minutes, turn off iPod. Hangover will not be gone, but will APPEAR to be gone. Works every time.&quot; I bet it doesn&apos;t.  We&apos;re off again: Giggs is on for Nani, who&apos;s got problems with the shoulder injury that forced him off against Chelsea last week. An email not about hangovers. &quot;What do you make of Joe Hart today? He&apos;s been pretty insecure on everything crossed into the box and he was just walking to Rooney&apos;s header as it came back off the post,&quot; asks David Wall. He hasn&apos;t looked great but he still looks more certain than Foster, I think. The United man just doesn&apos;t look decisive at all.  47 min: From somewhere near the car park, Wayne Rooney fires in a blisteringly good shot that is dipping into the top corner. Hart makes another acrobatic and spectacular save. After a second look, perhaps the shot was going wide, but Hart has to push it out anyway.  49 min: Valencia tries to run the ball into the box but James McFadden comes back for some defensive duties and Birmingham scramble the ball away. Again Birmingham are trying to attack up the left, targetting Fabio. He&apos;s looked solid enough, though, except for occasionally being caught out of position.  51 min: Carr crosses along the ground after beating Evra. But the Frenchman gets a touch on the ball, which means it rolls harmlessly across the turf and into Foster&apos;s arms. At the other end, Giggs crosses to Berbatov, who attempts a ridiculous jumping, turning flick, rather than the more normal trap-and-shoot techinique favoured by people who actually score goals. Another cure that sounds good in theory but, in practice, could be perilous. &quot;A friend, all 19 stone of him, swears by a cocktail of Paracetamol, Imodium, and two sports drinks of your choice,&quot; reckons Aran Scutcher. What&apos;s the Imodium for? On seconds thoughts, I don&apos;t want to know.  53 min: Rooney chips the ball over the Birmingham defence and Queudrue (who has too many vowels in his name) just gets the very top of his head to the ball. Had he not been there, Berbatov was in.  55 min: Jerome chases a long ball with admirable commitment and blistering pace but Evans simply passes the ball back to Foster who wangs it clear. &quot;Just noticed that Birmingham have &apos;F&amp;C something-or-other&apos; on their shirts. Given the season they&apos;re likely to have, and how they&apos;ll be talking about it at St. Andrews, shouldn&apos;t that be &apos;eff &amp; cee&apos;?&quot; asks David Wall  58 min: United are just knocking the ball about between themselves, before Birmingham get the odd foot in. The visitors are left hitting long-range efforts, as Fahey does then, most of which are going wide. More advice from a professional ... well, a former cocktail waitress, Lynda from San Francisco. &quot;You need to be kind to your liver which means 1) B Complex vitamins ... provided you can keep them down. 2) Something sweet. This acts as a tranquiliser for the stomach - honey is about the best. This suggestion was used by the Romans (but I think they also used boiled cabbage which I can&apos;t recommend). 3) Lots of fluids. 4) Salt or a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) in a glass of water will not just provide sodium but also help settle an unsettled stomach.&quot;  60 min: Giggs goes tearing up the left wing and finds Rooney, who flicks it on to the unmarked Berbatov. However, as he did so, Vignal absolutely clobbered him. Free-kick just outside the D and a yellow for Vignal.  62 min: Just over from Giggs&apos;s free-kick, largely thanks to a deflection off Jerome&apos;s head. Giggs goes deep with the corner and Scholes tries a screamer from distance which is hoofed back out. United send in a series of crosses, none of which are much cop, until a final one from Fabio goes out for yet another corner.  63 min: Giggs&apos;s corner is cleared with ease. Elsewhere, soup: not good for hangovers. &quot;My Czech friends, who booze constantly, suggest garlic soup to cure the hangover,&quot; says Chris Hadfield. &quot;Strangely enough it doesn&apos;t work.&quot; And: &quot;I&apos;ll just say this; don&apos;t wake up with a monumental hangover to find the only food in the house is parsnip soup, which then goes lukewarm as you eat it. Believe me,&quot; says Lorcan Mullen.  65 min: McFadden wangs one in from just outside the box having wriggled free in a good position. Foster saves comfortably but it does suggest there&apos;s life in Birmingham yet. Meanwhile Jerome is off for O&apos;Connor. He&apos;s worked tirelessly but ineffectually today.  67 min: McFadden sends in a wide free-kick that Foster fists out. He gets good distance but he probably could have caught that. He&apos;d argue that his punch clear enables Gigs to set up a counter attack, which it does.  69 min: Manchester United get away with what looks like a handball just outside their own area. O&apos;Connor was making life hard for O&apos;Shea and Evans and the ball seemed to glance of Evans&apos;s hand. Birmingham are just beginning to get back into this. Vignal swings over a cross for Larsson but he can&apos;t capitalise. However, it&apos;s a sign that United have gone off the boil a little.  71 min: Berbatov, as Michael Owen warms up on the touchline, pops up from his second-half snooze to have two decent shots saved on the line. Scholes then has a long distance effort, before Berbatov goes down in the box before getting straight back on his feet to have another shot. There&apos;s been more life in him in the last minute than in the entire of this game and last season put together. &quot;Has anyone got any pre-emptive remedies?&quot; asks Neill Brown, who clearly doesn&apos;t like the look of Damon McMenamin&apos;s sashimi cure. &quot;For example, let&apos;s say I&apos;m halfway through my third bottle of red, it&apos;s midnight where I am, and I have to be up for work in seven and a half hours. Have I any hope of coherence and lack of pain tomorrow morning?&quot;  73 min: Ferguson then aims a shot at the Manchester United goal, shortly after Foster punched clear a cross again. He doesn&apos;t look very certain under those. At the other end, Scholes and Rooney exchange a pass or two, before the midfielder dinks the ball straight into Joe Hart&apos;s arms.  75 min: Benitez is on for Carlsey, while Michael Owen is on for Berbatov. Wes Brown has replaced Jonny Evans too. Rooney tries to find Owen straight away but the ball is cleared. Fletcher then earns himself a yellow card in trying to win it back. Benitez, meanwhile, has his nickname Chucho on the back of his shirt, which isn&apos;t going to make things easier for anyone.  78 min: Birmingham break via Carr but Larsson, who is in support, gets blocked by Evra, much to the away supporters&apos; angst. Carr can do nothing with it on his own. After a brief United foray back, Benitez races onto a through ball, cuts the ball back to evade Fabio and sends a shot across goal from six yards out, left of the goal. Foster makes a reaction save to tip the ball wide for a corner. Birmingham were very, very nearly in there.  80 min: Owen has had more touches since getting on the pitch than Berbatov managed in the entire second half. He and Rooney are linking well together - and they&apos;ll need to because Birmingham have just sounded a warning that a one goal lead is not enough.  82 min: A replay of Berbatov going down in the 73rd minute suggests he probably should have earned a penalty. He didn&apos;t make much of it, to his credit, and that&apos;s perhaps why it wasn&apos;t given. O&apos;Shea is on Birmingham. I have no idea who went off. Apologies. This, meanwhile, is the most Guardian-centric hangover cure in the world. &quot;With a hangover, your body needs liquid, salt and glucose, also B-vitamins. Drink isotonic sports drinks (Powerade), and follow up with Marmite on toast. If you can&apos;t stand Marmite, try taramosalata,&quot; suggest Paul Bradley. Taramosalata?  85 min: Giggs wriggles clear on the left and somehow manages to get a cross over, despite the close attentions of Carr. Rooney gets his head on the ball and sends it an inch wide of the right hand post. Sarah Lawton, she of the screaming hangover and screaming kids, says that it&apos;s easy to prevent a hangover the night before - just drink a glass of water. Given the state of her, though, it didn&apos;t work last night. &quot;I fell asleep with the water clutched in one hand and spilled it all over myself, though.&quot; Ah.  87 min: Valencia runs strongly from the halfway line, deep into the Birmingham half. He dinks a ball over the top for Owen but gets too much on it and sends it skidding into touch. United have been curiously half-hearted in the second half except for Rooney who&apos;s been exceptional.  89 min: O&apos;Connor finds O&apos;Shea wide on the right and he gets plenty of room from which to cross. On his Premier League debut, he aims his cross straight into the arms of the keeper.  90 min: Rooney goes left, then right, looking to shoot. The person he was trying to evade was Michael Owen who was shimmying about in front of him. Eventually Rooney gives up and simply slams his shot into Owen&apos;s back.  91 min: Owen puts the ball into the net but is a yard offside after running onto a defence-splitting through ball. Half of the crowd roar but the striker knew that was never going to count.  Peep, peep: This time Owen&apos;s onside. He was played through by the immaculate Rooney and, completely in the clear, he can&apos;t evade Joe Hart&apos;s boot and the ball bobbles wide for a corner. As United take it, the referee blows the whistle and the home side open their season with a 1-0 win.  Manchester United were hardly dominant there but, having said that, Birmingham fashioned very few real chances. Rooney should have scored a hat-trick but was, nonetheless, very impressive. However, much as a regulation 1-0 win looks, on paper, a little poor from the home side, this was more or less a B-team squad. Only Evra was first choice in the defence, Scholes and Fletcher are probably not number one picks in the centre of midfield and Nani and Valencia are yet to cement their positions as well. So it&apos;s perhaps a bit soon to read too much into this.  I&apos;m off. Thank God. Stay with us to read James Dart&apos;s account of Tottenham v Liverpool here. He, like me, was at a wedding yesterday, so feels fairly frail too. Unlike me, he didn&apos;t get smashed. He did rip his contact lens in half this morning, though, so it&apos;s not all good for him. Expect plenty of one-eyed commentary gags.  Thanks for all your hangover cures. I&apos;m off to neck a raw egg-equipped sports drink, before playing a game of squash, while munching taramosalata, sashimi and vitamin B on toast. That, or I&apos;m going to drink some rum."}, {"sentences": ["Hiroshi Watanabe, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo, said: &quot;When you look at the numbers, the contrast between external demand and internal demand is as clear as night and day."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Global recession", "Japan", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-17T07:16:36Z", "title": "Japan emerges from deep recession", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/17/japan-beats-recession-exports", "article": "    Japan has emerged from its worst recession since the end of the second world war, recording its first quarter of growth for more than a year amid a rise in exports. Japan&apos;s fledgling recovery saw gross domestic product (GDP) rise at an annualised rate of 3.7% from April to June, and by 0.9% from the previous three months, the cabinet office said. Exports rose 6.3% from three months earlier, the first increase since the start of 2008 and the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2002. The emergence of the world&apos;s second-largest economy from recession follows last week&apos;s news that Germany and France \u2013 the two biggest economies in the eurozone \u2013 returned to growth in the second quarter. Freefalling global demand for the consumer durables on which Japan built its economic success \u2013 notably consumer electronics and cars \u2013 were to blame for dragging it into a recession from which few believed it would emerge so quickly. The guarded optimism now surrounding Japan is shared elsewhere. The US economy shrank at an annualised 1% last quarter, its smallest contraction in a year, while the 0.1% contraction seen in the eurozone was its best showing for more than a year. China&apos;s economy, helped by a vast $586bn (\u00a3357bn) stimulus package, grew 7.9% from a year earlier. The figures appear to bear out prime minister Taro Aso&apos;s assurance that Japan would be one of the first major economies to emerge from recession, although polls suggest they probably will not be enough to save his Liberal Democratic party from defeat in the general election in a fortnight&apos;s time. Though parts of his \u00a525tn (\u00a3160bn) stimulus package were derided \u2013 in particular the cash handouts to all residents \u2013 those, together with subsidies for fuel-efficient cars and green electrical appliances, have produced at least some short-term benefits. Experts warned, however, that the recovery could quickly fizzle out without improvements in demand at home, where falling wages and job fears have hit household spending. Unemployment is at a six-year high of 5.4% and could rise to a record 5.8% next year. In addition, wages fell 1.7% in the last quarter, while consumer spending, which accounts for 55% of the economy, rose just 0.8% from the previous three months. Public investment, buoyed by the government stimulus, was up 8.1%. Private capital investment dropped 4.3% from the previous quarter, while housing investment fell 9.5%, the government said. Hiroshi Watanabe, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo, said: &quot;When you look at the numbers, the contrast between external demand and internal demand is as clear as night and day. With payments falling, it&apos;s really hard to expect individual spending to hold up.&quot; Still, even modest, export-led growth offers respite after more than a year of contraction that included a record 13.1% annualised drop in GDP in the last quarter of last year and an 11.7% fall in the first quarter of this year. Yoshimasa Hayashi, the economic and fiscal policy minister, warned of continued threats to sustained recovery. &quot;Production is still at a low level, and worries remain that employment conditions will worsen,&quot; he said. &quot;So we must watch the downside risks.&quot; The Asia-Pacific region has surprised many analysts with the speed of its recovery. China, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong reported growth in the three months to June."}, {"sentences": ["The co-operative Pokemon-style adventure is almost as popular among Chatterbox contributors as it is on the streets and in the public parks of Tokyo."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2009-08-17T20:46:59Z", "title": "Chatterbox vs The Gathering Hall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/aug/17/chatterbox-blogpost", "article": "Along with Blood Bowl, Monster Hunter has become a defining RPG-themed pastime of the summer for Gamesblog readers. The co-operative Pokemon-style adventure is almost as popular among Chatterbox contributors as it is on the streets and in the public parks of Tokyo. Last week, a bunch of &apos;box veterans headed down to the Gathering Hall, a temporary meeting place in London&apos;s West End, where Monster Hunters can gather, play and swap tactics. Set up by Capcom in July, the venue is shutting down soon, but it&apos;s been an interesting experiment in creating a Japanese-style micro-culture, based around a single game title. There was also free beer. We&apos;d like to see more of this sort of thing. Now that publishers are pushing the community element of their games, it&apos;s time they came out from behind their server admins and community managers, and met gamers face to face. There should be FIFA, Rock Band and even Wii Fit hang-outs around the country - and surely the Rockstar Social Club should mean more than just an online leaderboard. Anyway, regular &apos;Best of&apos; editor OfficePest, kindly emailed in a report of the Gamesblog Gathering Hall invasion. For those interested in the extra-curricular activities of other readers - or the formative community experiments of modern videogame publishers - here&apos;s what they all got up to... &quot;Thursday 13th August was a momentous day \u2013 the geekfest known as The Guardian Gamesblog Monster Hunter Gathering Hall Meet Up. Crispycrumb was first to arrive and sat in the window of the Royal George quaffing a pint, swiftly followed by OfficePest, Henrypootle, Lazybones, CommodoreSchmidlapp, Chubster, Smellavision and CunningStunt. A special mention goes to Lazybones for actually waving a copy of The Guardian in our faces! The others just sidled up muttering things like &quot;blog&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; and then looked very relieved when it turned out to be the right group. After the awkward introductions, several beers were consumed over conversations surrounding such topics as stolen 360s, GWX [A Gamesblog regular and fanatical Nintendo fan - Keith], drunken gaming and CunningStunt&apos;s trousers. Then we all wandered over to the Gathering Hall to find another blogger waiting for us \u2013 RustyJames!  Crispycrumb was the bravest of us and approached the desk admitting that we were, &quot;The Guardian Gamesblog lot&quot;. Thanks go to Capcom for letting us all in, despite only about half of us actually owning PSPs! We all signed in at reception and admired the art on the walls \u2013 huge cut-out pictures of the weapons from Monster Hunter. Apparently they will be giving them away, along with the bean bags, when they close at the end of August \u2013 so if you want one, get along there! We then wandered upstairs into the Gathering Hall proper. It&apos;s situated over two floors, which are basically big open halls with bean bags strewn everywhere and power points around the walls for those who need a charge up. Leo [Tan] \u2013 the Capcom PR guy was on the top floor, so we headed that way. Leo was a top fella \u2013 very friendly and willing to help out the top hunters or the newbies. We split into two groups and hit the bean bags and started doing some missions together. Crispycrumb, Leo and I helping out the new bods. Then Crispycrumb and I deserted the newbies and got Leo to help out with some higher level missions. The rest of the bloggers gave up on the whole gaming idea and just stuck to drinking. I like to think we helped reduce their stock of beer and wine, ready for closing night. There were several groups hanging around the hall doing missions together, but it was still quite quiet in there \u2013 particularly as it got closer to closing time. Apparently on the first few nights it was open, there was barely any floor space left! Hopefully it&apos;ll be something similar for the closing night as well. We all left the Gathering Hall at 10pm (kick-out time) and Leo suggested we head to a local pub to carry on the gaming. Unfortunately us bloggers were all far too wasted at that point and just stuck to drinking. Leo escaped at about 11pm with a good few handshakes and thanks from the bloggers! The rest of us slipped away over the next hour. CunningStunt&apos;s train went the wrong way though. The state of the underground nowadays, eh?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei turned positive after earlier declines, edging up 16.35 points to 10284, a gain of 0.16%."], "tags": ["Pendragon", "British Land", "Rio Tinto", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-18T07:37:04Z", "title": "Market Forces breaking news: Footsie rises after yesterday's sell-off", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/marketforceslive/2009/aug/18/pendragon-britishlandcompany", "article": "The London stockmarket staged a small recovery this morning after recording its biggest one-day fall in six weeks yesterday. The FTSE 100 climbed 40.13 points to 4685.14 in early trading, a gain of nearly 0.9%. Yesterday it closed down 68.96 points at 4645.01, a fall of 1.46%. Asian stockmarkets were mixed this morning, following heavy losses on Wall Street last night. The Dow Jones dropped 186.06 points - a fall of 2% - to 9135.34, its lowest close since the end of July.  Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei turned positive after earlier declines, edging up 16.35 points to 10284, a gain of 0.16%.

Uncertainty abounds.&quot; On the corporate front, the UK car dealer Pendragon saw profits halve in the first half but predicted an upturn in the second half on the back of the government&apos;s &apos;cash for bangers&apos; scheme. Pendragon, which sells new and used vehicles, said the car market was still tough but pointed to the turnaround it had made from a loss incurred in the second half of last year, helped by cost cutting. It reported a profit before tax of \u00a311.4m for the six months to June, compared with \u00a321.1m last year. Chief executive Trevor Finn said the UK car market &quot;seems to have stabilised&quot; and saw &quot;signs the worst is behind us&quot;. Pendragon shares rose 0.25p to 45.25p in early trading. &quot;Used car margins have improved significantly and we anticipate growth in our sales volumes in the second half. The new car market has risen for the first time year on year in July which gives us reason for some guarded optimism in this area,&quot; he said.  New car sales in Britain rose 2.4% last month, boosted by the government&apos;s scheme which rewards motorists trading in old models for a new, greener car with a \u00a32,000 discount. Real estate group British Land today posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter, fuelling hopes that the property market is on the road to recovery.

Hospital officials in Seoul said he died today from respiratory distress, a pulmonary embolism and multiple organ failure, after being admitted with pneumonia last month. His wife, three sons and former aides were at his side. Kim survived a death sentence in his years as a political and human rights activist, enduring imprisonment and exile as he challenged military dictatorship and helped to steer South Korea&apos;s course from authoritarian rule to democracy. His election as president in 1997 was the first time power had shifted from a ruling party president to an opposition leader. He was best known on the world stage for his &quot;sunshine policy&quot; of engaging North Korea, which led to an unprecedented rapprochement culminating in the first summit between the two states and his iconic handshake and embrace with his counterpart, Kim Jong-il in 2000. Later that year he was awarded the Nobel peace prize for his efforts, becoming South Korea&apos;s only such laureate. The Nobel committee cited his &quot;great moral strength \u2026 as a leading defender of universal human rights against attempts to limit the relevance of those rights in Asia&quot;. As ties deteriorated after last year&apos;s inauguration of President Lee Myung-bak \u2013 who made aid conditional on Pyongyang&apos;s commitment to disarmament \u2013 Kim continued to call for closer co-operation. This year he urged Koreans throughout the peninsula to be mindful of their &quot;painful and tragic&quot; history and work together to establish peace and security. &quot;The South and North have never been free from mutual fear and animosity over the past half-century, not even for a single day,&quot; he said. &quot;When we co-operate, both Koreas will enjoy peace and economic prosperity.&quot; This week, North Korea said it would remove border restrictions to allow tours by South Koreans and family reunions \u2013 a conciliatory gesture after months of rising tensions over Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear and missile tests and its withdrawal from aid-for-disarmament talks. Kim survived several suspected assassination attempts, including a dramatic 1973 abduction at a Tokyo hotel, allegedly by South Korean agents. He was born to a middle-class farming family in south-west Korea, while the country was still under Japanese occupation, and began his career in business. After the peninsula was divided and South Korea&apos;s fledgling government veered towards authoritarianism, he became involved in politics. He won a seat in the National Assembly in 1961. A decade later, he ran for the presidency and nearly defeated the strongman president Park Chung-hee, prompting Park to alter the constitution to guarantee his future rule. Weeks later, a truck rammed his car off the road in what Kim believed was an attempt to kill him. For the rest of his life, he walked with a limp and sometimes used a cane. His death follows that of his successor, Roh Moo-hyun, who stunned South Korea by killing himself this spring after becoming mired in a corruption scandal."}, {"sentences": ["In August 1973 he was kidnapped from a hotel in Tokyo by agents of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA)."], "tags": ["South Korea", "World news", "Nobel peace prize"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-18T17:12:09Z", "title": "Kim Dae-jung | Obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/18/obituary-kim-dae-jung", "article": "Two months after Kim Dae-jung was inaugurated as president of South Korea in 1998, he came to London to receive an honorary degree. He told the old Korean hands assembled there that the time had come for reconciliation with the North. Over their drinks afterwards they smiled, shook their heads and said: &quot;If only ...&quot; Kim, who has died aged 85, knew perfectly well that there was widespread scepticism abroad towards his &quot;sunshine policy&quot;, which sought to &quot;lead North Korea down a path towards peace, reform and opening through reconciliation, interaction and co-operation with the South&quot;. He knew that many of his own officials in Seoul were sceptical, too \u2013 the so-called Ministry for Reunification in Seoul would often complain in the months ahead that it did not understand what the president was up to. Two years later, however, in June 2000, Kim was at Pyongyang airport, reviewing the North Korean guard of honour with the Great Commander Kim Jong-il at his side. As always, he walked unsteadily \u2013 the consequence of an accident thought to be an attempted assassination years before. His awkwardness only added to a supremely dignified and emotional moment. Suddenly, Kim Jong-il was no longer the sex-crazed film buff as portrayed by Seoul&apos;s intelligence propaganda, but a fellow-Korean with whom business could be done. Millions of South Koreans watching on television south of the 38th parallel gladly suspended their disbelief. The foreign diplomats in Seoul continued to smile, and continued to be sceptical. In another two years, as Kim approached the end of his presidential term, the &quot;sunshine policy&quot; was again obscured by clouds. Kim Jong-il prevaricated, the economic reforms that Kim Dae-jung had urged remained on paper at best, while millions of North Koreans remained short of food. Progress had been blighted further by the election of another president \u2013 George W Bush. While Bill Clinton, the outgoing American leader, had contemplated visiting Pyongyang, the new administration made its scorn clear, giving ready ammunition to the hardliners in Pyongyang and making North Korea one of the three countries labelled by Bush in his State of the Union speech in 2003 &quot;an axis of evil&quot;. Dialogue returned, even under Bush, with the six-party talks after 2005, which included China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. Progress appeared to be made towards a deal to trade off Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear ambitions for US recognition and aid. But the momentum had been lost, the negotiations were not pursued consistently by the US, there were internal issues in the North, and Pyongyang became a self-declared nuclear power. Appropriately it would be Kim Dae-jung, now in retirement, whose advice at a meeting in May 2009 with Clinton encouraged the former US president to make his dramatic &quot;private&quot; visit to Pyongyang earlier this month and open the door once again. Kim was born on the remote island of Haui-do off the south-west Korean coast. When he was 10, his father, a farmer, moved to the mainland port of Mokpo, where he ran a small inn \u2013 apparently so that his son, already showing signs of talent, could go to a good school. Little is known of Kim&apos;s early life under the Japanese rule that had oppressed Korea since 1905. According to some sources, he was born on 3 December 1925, but others suggest that his date of birth was falsified (and that he was really born nearly two years earlier, on 6 January 1924) to avoid conscription into the Japanese Imperial Army. The most daring act mentioned in official biographies is the writing of a short essay criticising the Japanese that led to him being &quot;removed as class captain&quot;. After graduation, he got a job at a shipping company and, after the Korean war, ran his own small business. Kim was not tainted by collaboration, unlike many other postwar Korean leaders. Growing up in the impoverished south-west, he also had a better understanding of ordinary Koreans. He was, as the US journalist Don Oberdorfer has noted, &quot;an outsider to the mainstream of Korean elite society. To my surprise, I learned in 1987 that despite his fame and his important role in so many historic political developments, many leading Koreans had never met him in person.&quot; In 1954 he made his first unsuccessful bid for election to the national assembly, finally succeeding at a byelection in 1961, just days before the assembly was closed down in the military coup led by Park Chung-hee. In the elections of 1963, held by Park under US pressure, Kim won again and soon became spokesman for the Democratic party \u2013 later merged with others to form the New Democratic party (NDP). He denounced Park&apos;s plans to revise the constitution to serve a third term, and in 1971 became the NDP&apos;s presidential candidate, winning 46% of the votes, despite widespread fraud. When Park declared the Yushin constitution in 1972, giving himself unlimited power for life, Kim sought support in the US and Japan. In August 1973 he was kidnapped from a hotel in Tokyo by agents of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). The details of this dramatic and near-fatal episode remain obscure. It is possible that the role of the US, which had backed Park&apos;s coup but now balked at the murder of his opponent, still requires discretion. However, it is known that Kim was seized by South Korean agents, dragged out of the hotel, then transferred to a Korean ship that headed out to sea. The ship was intercepted by a plane and/or helicopter \u2013 presumed to belong to the US forces \u2013 conveying the message that Kim must be kept alive. He was taken to Seoul and dumped in a street a week later. He was then placed under house arrest, remaining there or in prison until the assassination of Park in 1979 \u2013 at the hands of Kim Jae-kyu, the KCIA chief. Kim was soon back in prison after a second military coup in May 1980 put Chun Doo-hwan in power. He began his rule with the bloody suppression of civilian protest in Kwangju city, Kim&apos;s home base. This time Kim was threatened with execution after being convicted of treason. But again, US officials intervened. By their account, Chun agreed to spare his life in return for being granted a private meeting with the incoming US president, Ronald Reagan. Kim spent more than two years in jail before he was allowed to leave for the US. Most of his prison writings, which movingly display both his Christian faith and his love for his family, date from this period. By the mid-1980s the ruling elite had become less cohesive, society less docile and Korea&apos;s new business community impatient with the restrictions of military rule, while student protests dramatised the demand for democracy. Kim returned to Korea and though repeatedly subject to house arrest, finally regained his political rights in 1987. In the presidential elections, the first since 1971, the elite&apos;s candidate Roh Tae-woo won easily over a divided opposition. Kim&apos;s failure to unite with his rival opposition leader, Kim Young-sam, revealed a weakness for factionalism in the new politics and Kim Young-sam would form an opportunistic coalition with Roh in 1990, winning the next presidency in December 1992. However, Kim Dae-jung&apos;s 34% vote, in which he gained 1.8m more votes than in 1987, placed him in a strong position. Buffeted by party dissent, renewed popular protest and the Asian financial crisis, the ruling elite that had absorbed Kim Young-sam saw its candidate narrowly defeated in December 1997 by Kim Dae-jung, who gained 40.2% \u2013 half a percentage point more than his rival. Yet, even to achieve this victory, Kim Dae-jung had been obliged to form an opportunistic alliance with the United Liberals led by Kim Jong-pil \u2013 the man who had founded the KCIA that nearly murdered him. At last in power, Kim faced a familiar set of problems in a system that, although formally democratic, had not yet significantly altered its underlying power structures, based on the big conglomerations and an opportunistic political culture deeply infected by corruption. The high point of his five-year term was the award of the Nobel peace prize, in October 2000, during the afterglow of the North-South summit. Within months his administration was hit by the first of a series of corruption scandals. Though his own probity was beyond reproach, all three of his sons and several aides became involved. The painful reforms needed to tackle the conglomerates meant alienating the blue-collar workers who would lose their jobs. Like previous administrations, Kim reverted to bail-outs, notoriously paying out millions to prop up Daewoo. In May 2002, he resigned from the ruling Millennium Democratic party, hoping that by distancing himself and his family, it would improve its prospects. Within weeks, it had lost important parliamentary elections, and only South Korea&apos;s unexpected progress to the World Cup semi-finals offered Kim temporary comfort. On the day before the sensational quarter-final when the national team beat Spain, the president went on television to make a personal apology, begging for forgiveness for failing to fulfil his election promise that no one in his family would be involved in corruption. He left office in 2003, to be replaced by Roh Moo-hyun, who was to commit suicide after the end of his own five-year term, in May 2009. Kim is not the first leader to have triumphed over dictatorship only to fumble the chance when he achieved a democratic mandate. There was a strong desire for more radical reform, but a political system based on co-option, deformed by partisanship, backed by a persistent elite, proved too strong. Kim&apos;s concept of democracy was grounded, as he often explained, in the ancient philosophy of China&apos;s Mengzi (Mencius) and the example of Abraham Lincoln, somewhat remote models for the 21st century. Once in the presidential Blue House, he was accused of himself becoming too remote. His narrow power base in the south-west, and reliance on the Korean disease of faction-building, thwarted any real transformation of the political culture. Yet Kim&apos;s story remains one of unusual persistence and bravery in the face of death, and he will be remembered as a moral hero of modern Korea. He is survived by his second wife, Lee Hee-ho, and three sons. \u2022 Kim Dae-jung, politician, born 6 January 1924; died 18 August 2009"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Via forums and feedback, the PES Productions team in Tokyo has canvassed opinion on elements fans hoped to see included in PES 2010, and 360-degree control was part of the long list,&quot; says the press release."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Events", "PlayStation", "Sony", "Xbox", "Microsoft", "PC", "Games consoles"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-19T19:38:10Z", "title": "Gamescom: PES 2010 to feature 360 degree controls", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/aug/19/games-events", "article": "In the perennial top of the league clash between FIFA and PES, the former has clawed ahead over the last couple of iterations, with Konami&apos;s in-house dev team seemingly running out of ideas.

As Japan grapples with rising unemployment, population decline and a creaking state pension, the certainties of the postwar era have disappeared, and with them the LDP&apos;s sense of entitlement as the natural party of government. For the first time, the LDP is contending with an attractive opposition, boosted by its control of the upper house and a growing sense, even among conservative voters in its rural heartland, that the party that steered Japan out of the ashes of war into an economic miracle must finally make way. Aso appeared to concede as much, telling voters in Osaka today: &quot;We have failed to make clear the virtues of conservatism. We regret that we haven&apos;t sent a clear message in recent years.&quot; Despite its dominance in the polls, the DPJ remains an unknown quantity. The party has been criticised for its failure to explain how it will pay for ambitious spending plans that include a minimum wage, child allowances, subsidies for farmers and more money for education and welfare. It also plans to reduce oil taxes, do away with road tolls and mount an assault on the elite bureaucracy that has dictated postwar economic policy. Its leader, Yukio Hatoyama, has quietly modified early promises to end Japan&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to US foreign policy, but he remains committed to enhancing his country&apos;s Asian identity through closer ties with China and South Korea. And while he has yet to augment his antipathy to US-led &quot;market fundamentalism&quot; with a clear alternative, the ambiguity that is the luxury of opposition parties looks certain to keep him safe until after the election. &quot;Rather than supporting the Democrats because [voters] think their policies are good, the biggest factor is the negative evaluation of the LDP&apos;s performance,&quot; said Professor Kazuhisa Kawakami, of Meiji Gakuin University. If Aso represents the status quo, then Hatoyama has attempted to cast himself as the agent of change in the mould of Barack Obama. Election day, he said recently, would offer voters the chance to &quot;change the history of Japan. Let us have the courage to step into a new era&quot;. It seems that little \u2013 save for a major scandal involving Hatoyama \u2013 can spare Aso from a weekend of unrelenting misery. It will begin tomorrow, less than 48 hours before the polls open, when new figures are expected to show an unprecedented drop in consumer prices and record unemployment of 5.5%. Shinjiro Koizumi&apos;s presence on the ballot paper has only served to remind voters of the scale of the LDP&apos;s decline since it was led by his father, the Elvis fanatic with the shock of silver hair. &quot;Unless something big happens, it&apos;s possible that we&apos;ll see a change in government,&quot; the elder Koizumi said. &quot;It&apos;s not so bad to be the opposition party from time to time.&quot; That is a prospect he never had to countenance, of course. The last time his party was imperilled, eight years ago, he convinced voters that he would reform the LDP, or else destroy it. On Sunday, it looks likely that it will be left to Aso, the epitome of the LDP old guard that Koizumi so despised, to finish the job. A family affair Sunday&apos;s election marks the resumption of a bitter feud between two of Japan&apos;s most powerful political dynasties. Both Taro Aso and Yukio Hatoyama are related to former prime ministers who had little time for each other, despite their shared conservative roots. Hatoyama&apos;s grandfather, Ichiro Hatoyama, became the Liberal Democratic party&apos;s first prime minister in 1955, taking over from Aso&apos;s grandfather, Shigeru Yoshida, who led a forerunner to the party. That the two families should be competing again more than half a century later is hardly surprising. The ballot papers are peppered with the names of so-called hereditary politicians, including Shinjiro Koizumi, son of former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. Roughly one in five Japanese MPs is the child or grandchild of a senior politician, and the country&apos;s last four leaders have been hereditary politicians. About 30% of LDP candidates are related to current or former diet members, compared with about 7% among DPJ candidates, according to the Asahi Shimbun. Public criticism of nepotism led the Democratic party of Japan to announce it would ban immediate family members from inheriting constituencies. The LDP, perhaps understandably, has postponed a decision on the issue."}, {"sentences": ["As Olivier Hoedeman from lobbying watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory says: &quot;From Washington DC to Ottawa, Brussels to Tokyo, the most influential governments in the climate negotiations are facing an unprecedented corporate lobbying offensive, aiming to weaken greenhouse gas reduction targets.&quot; There has also been a recent rash of corporate-funded fake grassroots (or &quot;astroturf&quot;) campaigns."], "tags": ["Climate Camp", "Climate change", "Activism", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon footprints", "Environment", "Protest"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-27T19:33:00Z", "title": "The tactics of these rogue elements must not succeed | Katharine Ainger", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/27/climate-camp-takes-on-lobbyists", "article": "A small, unaccountable group of climate activists of uncertain provenance and nefarious purpose are plotting widespread destruction in the City\u00a0of London this week. Yes, it was business as usual for the corporate lobbyists who are in overdrive in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit in December. For, as Nasa&apos;s leading climate scientist James Hansen recently warned, corporate lobbying is gravely undermining democratic attempts to curb carbon emissions.\u00a0 While many companies have moved from outright denial, they are mobilising enormous political pressure to avoid taking concrete action. The Carbon Disclosure Project reported that the Global 100 firms are 39\u00a0years behind achieving the levels of emissions reductions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. It&apos;s clear that action is being dictated by money, not science.\u00a0 In the absence of any real political scrutiny or control of corporate lobbying, direct action of the kind carried out by Climate Camp activists this week is crucial not just for the environment but for democracy itself.\u00a0 In the days to come, Climate Campers will be carrying out non-violent direct actions aimed at the corporations and lobbyists which they see as being major perpetrators of climate change. Targets include BP, who are extracting oil from Canadian tar sands, a process that produces four times as much CO2 as conventional drilling, and the World Coal Institute which promotes coal \u2013 with the highest carbon emissions of all \u2013 as a &quot;progressive fuel&quot;.\u00a0 One significant lobby group in the Climate Camp&apos;s sights is Edelman PR, acting on behalf of the German energy firm E.ON, which is lobbying to build the UK&apos;s first coal-fired power station in decades at Kingsnorth. The inclusion of a PR firm is interesting: for 20\u00a0years public relations agencies have used tactics drawn from the smoking lobby to sow doubt among the general public over climate-change science, as well as working to greenwash their clients while gutting regulatory action. Shining light on these players will be especially important in the months leading up to Copenhagen.\u00a0 As Olivier Hoedeman from lobbying watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory says: &quot;From Washington DC to Ottawa, Brussels to Tokyo, the most influential governments in the climate negotiations are facing an unprecedented corporate lobbying offensive, aiming to weaken greenhouse gas reduction targets.&quot; There has also been a recent rash of corporate-funded fake grassroots (or &quot;astroturf&quot;) campaigns. The American Petroleum Institute has been mobilising &quot;Energy Citizens&quot; \u2013 most of whom are oil lobbyists \u2013 to oppose Obama&apos;s climate change bill. The EU\u00a0has granted sweeping exemptions for industries such as aluminium, steel, iron and cement producers who, via lobbies like Business Europe and the European Chemical Industry Council, have argued that tighter emissions controls will drive factories to relocate abroad. In May, corporations and lobbyists were given unprecedented access to UN climate negotiators at the World Business Summit on Climate Change; the resulting &quot;Copenhagen call&quot; is a document which the summit host, the\u00a0Danish government, is expected to refer to as the official unifying declaration for business during the negotiations in December.\u00a0 The solutions these business lobbies are promoting will create massive loopholes that could undermine any agreement. They see the global carbon market as the solution, in which they buy and trade permits to pollute. This despite the fact that the European Union&apos;s Emissions Trading Scheme has resulted in no net reductions in carbon emissions to date. No coincidence, then, that the same people who have no desire to move beyond fossil fuels are also the biggest fans of carbon trading.\u00a0 For all these reasons, climate activists plan to expose and blockade corporate lobbyists at the Copenhagen summit in December. These are the kind of practical skills they will learn at Climate Camp over this week. In confronting the lobbyists, they hope to open political space for indigenous people, those affected by fossil fuel extraction and processing, representatives of small island states threatened by rising sea levels, and others whose voices are being marginalised, to get a meaningful agreement.\u00a0 This is difficult political terrain, and there&apos;ll be those who spin this as a story of activists disrupting sincere attempts to get a climate deal.

Your album sells 200,000 copies; not only does your single spend five weeks at No 1, but it is adopted as the theme tune for a primetime TV show. In fact, it&apos;s predicted that you&apos;ll be the biggest-selling artist of 2009. You even start a minor fashion trend as fans copy your natty spats-and-waistcoat look. It happened to Suffolk-born singer-songwriter Charlie Winston \u2013 but it happened in France. In Britain, where he&apos;s spent most of a decade trying to get a break, he remains\u00a0unfamous. Winston \u2013 who will be trying his luck here again in September by putting out the album that took France by storm, Hobo \u2013 is one of a coterie of artists who make it big abroad but can&apos;t get arrested in their home countries. London&apos;s Art Brut are another: though never more than niche indie players in Britain, they&apos;re considered significant enough in Germany for the University of Berlin to have presented a lecture about their lyrics. There&apos;s also Daniel Merriweather \u2013 three UK top 10 singles and a No 2 album, but barely a fraction of that success in his native Australia \u2013 and Kings of Leon, whose fellow Americans are only now awakening to their hairy charms, years after the band conquered Europe. While we&apos;re at it, let&apos;s not forget those who were legendarily big in Japan before they got anywhere at home: when Cheap Trick headlined Tokyo&apos;s 14,000-capacity Budokan in 1978, they hadn&apos;t even had a top 40 album back in America. Ironically, it was a live recording of that gig, released as Cheap Trick at Budokan, that finally broke them in the US. &quot;Everybody asks, &apos;Why France?&apos; \u2013 even in France,&quot; says Winston. &quot;My reckoning is that I&apos;m a mature artist and I think in France, it&apos;s a different animal from the UK market. There&apos;s much more respect for artists, and they put them on more of a pedestal, especially with older artists. My French record company said they hadn&apos;t seen anything like it in years.&quot; He&apos;s right about the pedestal. The French treat rock music with the same gravity afforded classical and jazz, resulting in a mindset that doesn&apos;t exist on this side of the channel. Thus, it&apos;s easy to see why Winston has caught on. A listen to his No 1 single, Like a Hobo (also heard by three million people a day on the TV magazine show Le Grand Journal), reveals a weathered je ne sais quoi reminiscent of Chris Rea. In Britain, that would get him filed in the MOR category; in France, it pushes the button marked &quot;young Serge Gainsbourg&quot;. Cue instant respect, and sales to match. So there&apos;s a lesson: some just have a greater affinity with foreign audiences than those at home. That would also explain Merriweather&apos;s ascendancy in the UK, where soulful white singers have always been welcomed. &quot;I&apos;m the last person to know why I&apos;ve been embraced here,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&apos;s probably a combination of things. I&apos;ve done so much touring with Mark [Ronson, who discovered him] \u2013 every festival in England in the last three years \u2013 and I&apos;ve been based in London half the time. The album&apos;s just been released in Australia, but I don&apos;t have any particular\u00a0expectations.&quot; Glasgow&apos;s Frightened Rabbit have also profited by taking their ramshackle indiepop where people wanted to hear it, which turned out to be America. Though virtually unknown here, they&apos;ve sold 30,000 albums on the other side of the Atlantic, and acquired American management, which has sent them on frequent tours of the US. It has paid off: their MySpace page is brimming with pleas from fans wanting them to come back to Pittsburgh, Chicago and Cleveland. Singer Scott Hutchison attributes it to their Scottishness: &quot;Americans have a romantic view of Scotland, and see it as a motherland. It&apos;s our grab factor over there, but it&apos;s not as big an attraction here,&quot; he says ruefully. So Americans love Frightened Rabbit&apos;s Caledonian coolness, and France regards Winston as almost French. But it&apos;s harder to deduce what Germans see in Art Brut, who seem too arch and English to translate. Leader Eddie Argos is also baffled: &quot;When I found out they were doing a lecture about my lyrics, I thought they were taking the piss. But it was true. It was called The Depressive Dandy. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m a depressive dandy \u2013 my lyrics are funny.&quot; He thinks it&apos;s &quot;the sad bits&quot; underlying the humour that the Germans have taken to. &quot;I think I might have accidentally written an album about popular culture [Art Brut vs Satan, released last spring] \u2013 in Germany, that&apos;s how they saw it. The more I said I&apos;m not an intellectual, the more people thought I was. [News magazine] Der Spiegel gave me a really good review \u2013\u00a0more than a\u00a0page.&quot; In theory, every hit record or sold-out tour anywhere is cause for celebration, but it must be depressing to be a big name everywhere but at home. Where&apos;s the fun in collecting platinum discs in Japan if nobody on your own patch has heard of you? The dream of inviting friends and family to that headlining stadium gig isn&apos;t the same if the stadium is on another continent while at home they&apos;re lucky to headline the local indie dump. And what does it say about a band&apos;s music if it fails to connect with the domestic audience? Are the hometown crowd idiots for not getting it, or is the music so challenging that only &quot;abroad&quot; can appreciate it? Hutchison admits it&apos;s disheartening to wow crowds in America only to return to obscurity every time they&apos;re back in Glasgow \u2013 a sentiment echoed by Merriweather, who says he&apos;s desperate to be successful in Australia. Interestingly, Russell Mael of Los Angeles duo Sparks \u2013 perhaps the first band to experience heroes-abroad-zeroes-at-home\u00a0syndrome, in the early 70s \u2013 never minded that their US career was always greatly overshadowed by their popularity in the UK. &quot;We were real Anglophiles, so the fact that we were successful in Britain was enough for us,&quot; he says. &quot;It was great to be accepted in the one place in the world where we wanted to be accepted. It was a dream fulfilled.&quot; The elements of Sparks that Americans just didn&apos;t get \u2013 the quirky tunes, Russell&apos;s unnerving falsetto, brother Ron&apos;s Hitler-style toothbrush moustache \u2013 made them perfect for Britain, where they were lauded for their cleverness rather than denounced as skinny weirdos. And for Brit fans, there was the added pleasure of feeling superior to the US public. There was a similar air of self-congratulatory smugness in the UK when Scissor Sisters became so big here. Their debut album was the UK&apos;s top-selling album in 2004, but didn&apos;t even reach the American top 100. Was some of their popularity generated by Brits wanting to prove that, unlike conservative Americans, they&apos;re not fazed by spangles and campness? Orla Lee of Polydor UK thinks not. &quot;I think the reason they haven&apos;t done as well in America is to do with radio formats. If it&apos;s not American Idol, country or urban, where do you put it? I don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong with Americans. [Scissor Sisters] are colourful, bright and fresh, and classic songwriters, too.&quot; Hutchison, too, believes his band just don&apos;t fit in here, though he blames the rock press rather than radio: &quot;If you don&apos;t make the pages of the NME here, then you&apos;re fucked.&quot; As for Japan and its mysterious relish for rock bands greeted with less enthusiasm back in the UK or the States, it apparently comes down to the nation&apos;s love of melody. Hitoshi Yoshioka, a marketing manager at Universal records in London, explains: &quot;Because of the language [barrier], the Japanese focus on melody instead. We&apos;re big on karaoke, so hit songs must have melody.&quot; But why do bands stay big in Japan, rather than being forgotten after their hit? &quot;Once a Japanese person buys a CD, they&apos;ll love a band and won&apos;t forget them and how they were entertained by them.&quot; Those will be comforting words for artists: if things don&apos;t look too promising at home, there&apos;s always Japan."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Japanese households are becoming increasingly defensive as the environment surrounding wages and employment turns severe,&quot; said Kyohei Morita, the chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Global recession", "Japan", "Economics", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-28T10:33:38Z", "title": "Japan unemployment hits record high", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/28/japan-unemployment-record-high", "article": "Unemployment in Japan rose to a record high and consumer prices dropped at an unprecedented pace last month, adding to fears that the country&apos;s economic recovery is already stalling under the grip of deflation. Just two weeks after Japan emerged from its worst recession in half a century, its internal affairs ministry said that the jobless rate rose to 5.7% in July from 5.4% a month earlier. Core consumer prices fell 2.2% as concern mounted that the world&apos;s second biggest economy is caught in a deflationary spiral. The figures will come as a blow to the prime minister, Taro Aso, whose Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to suffer a heavy defeat in Sunday&apos;s general election. Household spending fell 2% last month in a further sign that the boost provided by one-off cash handouts as part of Aso&apos;s record \u00a525tn (\u00a3163bn) stimulus programme was beginning to wear off. &quot;Japanese households are becoming increasingly defensive as the environment surrounding wages and employment turns severe,&quot; said Kyohei Morita, the chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. Unemployment, at its highest level since records began in 1953, surpassed the previous record of 5.5% in April 2003 and was expected to rise as high as 6% next year. Takeo Kawamura, the senior government spokesman, defended his party&apos;s record on handling the economic crisis. &quot;There is no denying the fact that the economy is improving overall,&quot; Kawamura said. Figures out last week showed that the economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the first expansion for more than a year. Analysts expect the LDP to be punished for failing to stem job losses as it braces itself for only its second period in opposition for more than 50 years. The number of people out of work rose by more than 200,000 in July, the ministry said, bringing the jobless total to 3.59 million \u2013 more than a million up on last year. &quot;The rise to a record high in the jobless rate was expected but the worsening job and income situation highlights worries about the Japanese economy heading into a double dip as the government stimulus runs out,&quot; Yuichi Kodama, an analyst at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance, told Reuters. &quot;The economy&apos;s recovery may slow down in July-September compared with April-June.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["All such top-level meetings between Afghan leaders and the country&apos;s international backers since 2001 have been held in foreign capitals such as London, Tokyo and Paris."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-28T12:59:28Z", "title": "UN plans Afghanistan summit in Kabul", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/28/afghanistan-kabul-summit-election-karzai", "article": "The United Nations is planning to host an international summit on the future of Afghanistan for the first time in Kabul \u2013 an attempt to bestow credibility on the new government that emerges from the country&apos;s bitterly contested presidential election.

A pitifully low turnout in the country&apos;s south and allegations of widespread electoral fraud are threatening to undermine the new administration&apos;s legitimacy. Kai Eide, the Norwegian head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, told the Guardian that the international community would want to &quot;give the new government some momentum&quot; and the conference, to be held once the administration is in place, would be a &quot;political manifestation of that support&quot;. He said that by holding it in Kabul the international community would highlight its desire to &quot;rebalance&quot; its relationship with Afghanistan. &quot;We need over the next few years to have a stronger Afghan role and Afghan ownership. Having it in Kabul would be a signal of that. The international community has a long term commitment but it must be an increasingly supportive role.&quot; Despite protests that the west wants to see Afghans take the lead, foreign powers will be pushing hard for rapid progress on reform of corrupt and ineffective ministries and peace talks with insurgents. Eide said the conference would be held on the condition that the next Afghan government put &quot;a good reform orientated programme in place&quot; and that it should have &quot;the governance that is capable of implementing such a programme&quot;.

Twigger appears in his books as a sardonic, terribly English, grandly-self-appointed-but-nonetheless-slightly-apologetic-about-it kind of guru figure, who travels, adventures, writes, and is a proponent of what he calls &quot;lifeshifting&quot;. He now extends himself further, lifeshiftingly, into fiction, with Dr Ragab&apos;s Universal Language - which is basically a Paulo Coelho book as written by a funny English bloke. The narrator is a wimpish slacker living in west London who has been commissioned to write the history of a German aluminium company. He is also obsessed with bunkers, air-raid shelters, abandoned tunnels and pill-boxes - something to do with &quot;their darkness, their permanence&quot;. He dutifully travels to Germany and, during the course of his research, discovers a manuscript - hidden, miraculously, in a bunker - written by a Dr Ragab, proposing a method for learning a universal language. He also discovers an account, by a Martin Hertwig, a relative of the founder of the aluminium company, of how he learnt Dr Ragab&apos;s universal language and used it to save himself from imprisonment in a bunker in Germany after the second world war. The book consists of the bunker-obsessed narrator&apos;s translation of Hertwig&apos;s manuscript, with the narrator himself enjoying various minor adventures and self-revelations before eventually overcoming his &quot;lack of push and thrust&quot;, leaving his own metaphorical west London bunker, and moving to Egypt. Hertwig&apos;s account of his tutelage under Dr Ragab in Cairo in the 1920s is believably odd and thoroughly entertaining. Ragab is the kind of spiritual teacher who encourages self-awareness through pointless activities such as jumping up and down while talking, and drawing mystical symbols in the sand. It is not clear whether he is a crank, a genius or a huckster. But whatever Ragab&apos;s true identity, his teaching, as the narrator explains, &quot;was about, or seemed to be about, maintaining concentration, or, rather, a certain intensity of involvement in the task - almost despite the absurdity of it all&quot;. One reads on, despite the absurdity of it all. Curious episode follows curious episode with, it seems, mere adjacency the governing principle. Hertwig and Ragab go on a journey to visit the lost pillar of Seth. Hertwig is trapped in a bunker by roaming brigands. There is a thinly veiled satiric attack on the Swedish author Sven Lindqvist, author of Benchpress (1988), merrily traduced as Sven Marquist, author of A Short History of Bodybuilding. Lots of other weird stuff happens - penis piercing, bunker building, post-Holocaust chaos. The real pleasure of reading Twigger derives from his knowing things other people don&apos;t, knowledge he has carefully cultivated. His non-fiction books combine Boy&apos;s Own adventures with sharp observation and esoteric ideas; now, as a novelist, he treats the form as essentially just another vehicle for transmitting this extraordinary knowledge. Dr Ragab&apos;s Universal Language is thus part allegorical quest, part philosophy and part pure hokum.

The best of the bunch is the portrayal of Hatoyama and three senior DPJ colleagues \u2013 in silhouette this time \u2013 as vacillating members of an a cappella group. &quot;Can you entrust Japan&apos;s future to the Wavering Four in Tokyo?&quot; asks the narrator.

The supplement, wrapped around copies of the right-wing paper, was accompanied by an ad for the band&apos;s latest CD, Sotto, Kyutto (Softly, Tightly). Penned in a cloying style reminiscent of an adult attempting to explain matters of state to an eight-year-old, the message asks if we aren&apos;t all being a little unfair on Taro Aso and his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) colleagues. &quot;When the economy is good, prime ministers are popular, but in bad times, the popularity fades,&quot; it said. &quot;Still, these are people whom we&apos;ve elected, so let&apos;s make some allowances and support them.&quot; Victor Entertainment, which paid for the ad, insisted that it wasn&apos;t meant to support any particular candidate, while the LDP described it as &quot;appropriate and neutral&quot;. The notoriously taciturn folk at Smap&apos;s agency, Johnny &amp; Associates, refused to comment. For Smap member Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, the ad marks the completion of his return to the establishment fold, months after his career was put on hold by his booze-fuelled caper in la Tokyo park. Given that this typically saccharine effort from 2005 became an unofficial anthem among Japanese opposed to the Iraq war, the band&apos;s apparent involvement with the LDP is a little puzzling. Then again, perhaps Smap \u2013 an acronym for sports, music, assemble, people \u2013 and the LDP aren&apos;t such strange bedfellows after all: both, unkind observers might suggest, have been part of Japanese public life for far too long."}, {"sentences": ["Clare Campbell&apos;s Tokyo Hostess is mainly concerned with the disappearance and killing of Lucie Blackman.", "The narrative is intercut with Campbell&apos;s research into the nightlife of Tokyo&apos;s Roppongi district, where Blackman worked, pouring drinks and laughing politely at the jokes of drunk businessmen, earning money to pay off her debts.", "For hostesses, Tokyo offers 24-hour partying and easy money paid in cash so that one can work illegally on a tourist visa.", "&quot;What were they really thinking, all those salarymen and office ladies, as they shuffled robotically around [Tokyo&apos;s] underground labyrinths?&quot; she asks, as if commuters in other countries have thought bubbles over their heads."], "tags": ["Society", "Crime fiction", "Books", "Culture", "World news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-29T23:06:57Z", "title": "Tokyo Hostess by Clare Campbell | Book review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/30/tokyo-hostess-clare-campbell-review", "article": "Clare Campbell&apos;s Tokyo Hostess is mainly concerned with the disappearance and killing of Lucie Blackman. The outlines of the story \u2013 Blackman&apos;s life, the discovery of her remains in a cave, her family&apos;s long campaign for justice \u2013 are well-known. Alongside this, Campbell tells the stories of Carita Ridgway, an Australian hostess who died at the hands of the same man, Joji Obara, in 1992, and Lindsay Ann Hawker, a British English teacher who was murdered in 2007 by Tatsuya Ichihashi. The narrative is intercut with Campbell&apos;s research into the nightlife of Tokyo&apos;s Roppongi district, where Blackman worked, pouring drinks and laughing politely at the jokes of drunk businessmen, earning money to pay off her debts. Campbell&apos;s research is thorough and the book teems with the voices of family members, friends and the characters who populate Roppongi. But why is Hawker&apos;s murder included in the narrative? She had no connection with Roppongi or the sex industry. &quot;I wanted to know just why so many girls chose to go to Japan, either to work as teachers, hostesses or frequently both,&quot; Campbell writes, casually lumping together a diverse group of people. But surely their reasons for going are very different. For hostesses, Tokyo offers 24-hour partying and easy money paid in cash so that one can work illegally on a tourist visa. It&apos;s a heady lifestyle, though not without its humiliations. Hostesses have to prove themselves popular to earn money; they have to be both deferential and competitive. Meanwhile, most of the thousands of foreigners in Japan are, perhaps too boringly for Campbell, teaching English. Roppongi is small and easy to avoid. Campbell draws attention, rightly, to the western media&apos;s fascination with these cases. She criticises the &quot;racial stereotype of perverted Oriental and pale-skinned victim&quot;, but is guilty of similar stereotyping. When an eager customer emails a hostess friend of Blackman&apos;s after Obara&apos;s arrest, it is suggested that he represents &quot;the eternal up-for-itness of the Japanese male&quot;. Western women are always &quot;girls&quot;, open-eyed and vulnerable. Of the tabloids&apos; attempts to interpret Hawker&apos;s death, she asks: &quot;Was it exquisitely Oriental or just plain barking mad?&quot; Good question. The connection between the deaths of Blackman and Hawker is probably this: they were targeted by horrifyingly dangerous men. Japan is a relatively safe country, so these women may have been less careful than they would have been in Britain. They stood out physically and this would have made them vulnerable, but as Richard Lloyd Parry wrote in the Independent (quoted by Campbell): &quot;The notion that Japanese men are &apos;obsessed&apos; with western women is a lazy cliche.&quot; It&apos;s a cliche that Campbell perpetuates. For her, it&apos;s all about sex \u2013 Japanese sex. She writes: &quot;I did not ... believe that I could ever fully comprehend Japanese culture or sexuality.&quot; Does any other culture suffer the insult of being continually reduced to a puzzle that can never be &quot;comprehended&quot;? &quot;What were they really thinking, all those salarymen and office ladies, as they shuffled robotically around [Tokyo&apos;s] underground labyrinths?&quot; she asks, as if commuters in other countries have thought bubbles over their heads. After a depressing afternoon reading about the wasted lives of these bright young women who lived in the city I lived in and loved for many years, I went for a walk near my home in Brighton. Soon, I was in Waterloo Street where, in 2003, music teacher Jane Longhurst was murdered by Graham Coutts, who had an obsession with extreme pornography and who drew nooses on photographs of women. He kept her body in a storage centre before dumping and setting fire to it. It&apos;s hard to imagine anything more appalling. But was it exquisitely British or just &quot;plain barking mad&quot;? Transfer the details of the crime to Japan and then how does it look? We should grow up about Japan, stop wondering whether or not we can comprehend it and just try to get to know it a bit better.

After 12 days of exhaustive official campaigning, candidates have made their final pitch to the Japanese people ahead of an election that polls suggest will be won by a landslide by the Democratic Party of Japan [DPJ]. In a last-ditch attempt to alter the course of a disastrous campaign, the prime minister, Taro Aso, told voters near Tokyo that the party headed by his rival, Yukio Hatoyama, represented a dangerous leap into the unknown. &quot;Can you trust these people?&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a problem if you feel uneasy about whether they can really run this country. I beg you to give power to the LDP, so we can complete the recovery.&quot; Despite doubts about Hatoyama&apos;s ability to fund ambitious spending plans for education and welfare, Japanese voters are fed up with the incumbent government&apos;s inability to tackle the big issues facing the country \u2013 an ailing economy and an ageing population. Hatoyama said he represented the forces of change after 54 years of LDP rule, broken only by 11 months in opposition in 1993. &quot;At last, it is the election, one that we will be able to tell the next generation changed Japanese history,&quot; he said in Sakai, western Japan. &quot;The election is more about emotions than policies,&quot; said Takashi Mikuriya, a political science professor at Tokyo University. &quot;Most voters are making the decision not about policies but about whether they are fed up with the ruling party.&quot; Opinion polls show that the DPJ, a mish-mash of progressives and conservatives united by their hatred of the LDP, could secure as many as 230 of the lower house&apos;s 480 seats. The LDP, meanwhile, could see its strength plummet to about 100 seats, according to the Asahi Shimbun. Hatoyama, who walked away from the LDP in 1993, has promised to end Japan&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to the foreign policy of the United States, but maintains that the alliance with Washington will &quot;continue to be the cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy&quot;.

His grandfather, Ichiro Hatoyama, was the Liberal Democratic party&apos;s first prime minister after its formation in 1955; today, Yukio Hatoyama is preparing to lead only the second non-LDP government for 54 years. Like many senior Japanese politicians, Hatoyama has politics in his blood. His father, Iichiro, was a foreign minister and his younger brother, Kunio, recently served as a minister in Taro Aso&apos;s LDP government, which faces defeat today. Today is not the first time Yukio Hatoyama has had a hand in ousting the LDP. Angered by its weak response to corruption scandals, he left the party in 1993 and helped form a coalition that kept the LDP in opposition, albeit for less than 11 months. The 62-year-old&apos;s appointment in May as leader of the Democratic Party of Japan could not have been better timed, coming as Japan&apos;s main opposition emerged as a viable alternative to the LDP for the first time in the country&apos;s postwar history. His election to the leadership was never seriously in doubt after Ichiro Ozawa, his mentor and fellow LDP rebel, stepped aside amid a funding scandal involving a senior aide. Hatoyama&apos;s task since then has been to convince voters that his party, an eclectic bunch comprising former LDP rebels, conservatives and social democrats, is capable of guiding the world&apos;s second biggest economy through its worst economic crisis since the war. Yet as a blue-blooded politician from a hugely wealthy family, Hatoyama can hardly claim to represent a fresh alternative to Japan&apos;s political modus operandi. He inherited his father&apos;s LDP seat in Hokkaido, northern Japan, in 1986 and has since been elected seven times. Hatoyama&apos;s personal ratings have not matched the high levels of support for his party. He can come across as eccentric and aloof \u2013 traits that have earned him the nickname &quot;the alien&quot; \u2013 and at times sounds more like the teacher he once was than a political leader. In his first, three-year stint as DPJ leader from 1999, he was criticised for being indecisive. While as an opposition leader he appears to have pulled off a landmark victory over one of the most formidable forces in modern political history, some have low expectations for Hatoyama as prime minister. &quot;He is a miserable candidate,&quot; Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University, told the Associated Press. &quot;He is wooden, he is stiff, he can&apos;t improvise. His image is that he is not a very decisive leader, somebody who&apos;s not so charismatic, not so strong-willed.&quot; Hatoyama studied engineering at Tokyo University \u2013 a breeding ground for generations of politicians and elite bureaucrats \u2013 before completing a PhD at Stanford.

Television exit polls suggested the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) would win 300 or more of the 480 seats in the lower house, a huge improvement on its current 115 seats. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party was forecast to win only about 100 seats, a devastating blow to the party that has ruled Japan for all but 11 months since 1955. &quot;These results are very severe,&quot; the prime minister, Taro Aso, told a news conference at party headquarters. &quot;There has been a deep dissatisfaction with our party.&quot; Aso said he would have to accept responsibility for the results, suggesting that he would resign as party president. Other LDP leaders also said they would step down, though official results were not to be released until early tomorrow morning. Victory for the DPJ will see its president, Yukio Hatoyama, installed as leader of the first government not led by the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) for 15 years and only the second for more than half a century. Early estimates showed turnout was high, but hopes that it could exceed 70% may have been dashed by strong winds and heavy rain brought by an approaching typhoon. The exit polls are in line with recent opinion polls showing the LDP&apos;s strength in the lower house slashed from 300 seats to as few as 100. The Democratic Party needs only to win a simple majority of 241 seats in the lower house to ensure that it can name the next prime minister. The 300-plus level would allow it and its two smaller allies the two-thirds majority they need in the lower house to pass bills. The election has proved disastrous for Aso, whose year in office has been bedevilled by gaffes and sleaze, as well as coinciding with Japan&apos;s deepest recession since the second world war. While Hatoyama represents a shot in the dark, he has captured the public imagination with promises of higher welfare spending, the introduction of a minimum wage and child allowance, and a more equal relationship with Japan&apos;s main ally, the US. &quot;The ruling party has betrayed the people over the past four years, driving the economy to the edge of a cliff, building up more than 6 trillion yen (\u00a339.4bn) in public debt, wasting money, ruining our social security net and widening the gap between the rich and poor,&quot; the DPJ said in a statement today. &quot;We will change Japan.

Hours after the polls closed, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) had surpassed the 241 seats it needed to win a majority in the 480-seat lower house and oust the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) from power. Major television networks projected that the DPJ, a broadly progressive party whose ranks include socialists as well as former LDP rebels, would secure more than 300 seats, almost triple the number it held going into the election. The incoming prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, will lead Japan&apos;s first non-LDP administration since 1993, and only the country&apos;s second since 1955. Speaking to jubilant party members in Tokyo, he said he remained committed to the mantra of change that had swept the DPJ into power. &quot;The people are angry with politics and the ruling coalition,&quot; he said. &quot;We keenly felt that people wanted a change in their lives, and so we fought this election for a change in government.&quot; Taro Aso, the outgoing prime minister, indicated he would resign as head of the LDP to take responsibility for a disastrous night that could see the party&apos;s strength reduced from 300 seats to just over 100. &quot;These results are very severe,&quot; he said. &quot;There is deep dissatisfaction with our party.&quot; In a potentially intriguing development, those emerging as possible candidates for the LDP presidency included Hatoyama&apos;s brother, Kunio, a former justice minister in the Aso administration. With an overwhelming public mandate secured, Hatoyama will quickly come under pressure to make good on his manifesto pledges. He has promised to eliminate wasteful public works, challenge elite bureaucrats&apos; policy stranglehold and invest heavily in social security in one of the world&apos;s most elderly societies. But he has come under fire for failing to cost proposals such as free high school education and a 26,000 yen (\u00a3170) a month child allowance. Sceptics have also questioned his ability to wrest power from the mandarins who have dictated Japan&apos;s postwar economic policy. There is potential, too, for friction with the Washington if Hatoyama pursues an election pledge to end Japan&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to American foreign policy, including plans to halt a refuelling mission in support of US-led forces in Afghanistan. In a New York Times opinion piece, he said the failure of the Iraq war and the global financial crisis proved that &quot;the era of US-led globalism is coming to an end.&quot; He added, however, that the US would &quot;remain the world&apos;s leading military and economic power for the next two to three decades&quot; and he ruled out a radical shift in bilateral ties. The US-Japan alliance, he said, would &quot;continue to be the cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy&quot;. Analysts said the election result heralded a fundamental shift in Japan&apos;s conservative-dominated political culture. &quot;This is about the end of the postwar political system in Japan,&quot; said Gerald Curtis, an expert on Japan at Columbia University in the US. &quot;It is the only time any party other than the LDP has won a majority in the lower house of the Diet. It marks the end of one long era, and the beginning of another one about which there is a lot of uncertainty.&quot; Much uncertainty centres on the DPJ&apos;s spending commitments as Japan, already saddled with a huge public debt, emerges from its deepest recession since the war. Richard Jerram, the chief economist at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo, described Hatoyama&apos;s 16.8tn yen investment programme, as a &quot;quasi-socialist approach&quot; that would harm Japan&apos;s public finances and blunt its competitiveness. &quot;The core of the DPJ&apos;s economic policy seems to be a fantasy Robin Hood scheme, aimed at appealing to as many voters as possible,&quot; he said. Japanese newspaper editorials agreed that his first task must be to steer Japan towards sustained economic recovery. &quot;We want to ask the next administration to swiftly deal with concerns about unemployment uncertainty and deflation, which are deepening simultaneously,&quot; the Nikkei business paper said. While Aso counted the cost of a year in office bedevilled by gaffes, sleaze and mounting economic woes, Hatoyama was reportedly discussing his cabinet. The administration is expected to include two minor parties, giving the DPJ majorities in both houses of parliament. Despite nagging concerns over the DPJ&apos;s ability to govern, its extraordinary rise to power appears to have stirred voters out of their disenchantment with politics.

Questions are already being asked about his government&apos;s ability to end the bureaucracy&apos;s stranglehold on economic policy and to focus on the interests of consumers rather than those of powerful corporations. &quot;It has taken a long time, but we have at last reached the starting line,&quot; Hatoyama told reporters at his home in Tokyo. &quot;This is by no means the destination. At long last, we are able to move politics \u2013 to create a new kind of politics that will fulfil the expectations of the people.&quot; His opponent, Taro Aso, resigned as president of the LDP, which now has just 119 MPs in the lower house compared with 300 before the election. Hatoyama has about two weeks to put together his administration. Elite bureaucrats and business leaders will use that time to prepare themselves to work with a different ruling party for only the second time since 1955. Japan&apos;s parliament will look radically different when it formally elects Hatoyama as prime minister at a special session in the middle of next month. The lower house will contain 158 first-time MPs, just over 90% of them from the DPJ, and a record 54 women, 40 of them from Hatoyama&apos;s party. The chamber&apos;s 480 MPs have an average age of 52, with the youngest aged 27. The LDP&apos;s depleted ranks will be missing several senior politicians, including the current finance minister, Kaoru Yosano. Over 46% of its remaining MPs are &quot;hereditary candidates&quot; who inherited their seats from their fathers or mothers, compared with just over 10% among DPJ MPs. The financial markets reacted positively to the prospect of a new government, with the Nikkei benchmark index rising to a near-11-month high before retreating slightly as a stronger yen pushed down shares among exporters. The DPJ&apos;s honeymoon period promises to be shortlived amid nagging concerns about its ability to fund spending pledges that are expected to reach 16.8tr yen over the next four years. The party has vowed to end wasteful spending and invest heavily in welfare, to introduce a child allowance and to raise the minimum wage while keeping the consumption tax unchanged at 5% for the next four years. But despite disquiet about Hatoyama&apos;s recent attack on &quot;unrestrained market fundamentalism&quot;, business leaders offered him a cautious welcome. Fujio Mitarai, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, said the DPJ had made a &quot;genuine transition of power&quot; possible for the first time in Japan&apos;s postwar history. Kaoru Yano, president of the electronics firm NEC, said the result was &quot;an expression of the people&apos;s call to break out of these tough economic and stagnant social conditions&quot;. The US president, Barack Obama, said he looked forward to working closely with Hatoyama, who has promised to end Japan&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to US foreign policy. In recent days, however, Hatoyama has toned down his rhetoric, pledging that the bilateral alliance would remain the &quot;cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy&quot;. &quot;The people of Japan have participated in an historic election in one of the world&apos;s leading democracies,&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement. &quot;President Obama looks forward to working closely with the new Japanese prime minister on a broad range of global, regional and bilateral issues.&quot; The new US ambassador to Tokyo, John Roos, said: &quot;The challenges we face are many, but through our partnership our two great democracies will meet them in a spirit of cooperation and friendship.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Pledges by the DPJ&apos;s incoming prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to eschew visits to the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo and pursue closer Asian co-operation are seen as tacit acknowledgement of Tokyo&apos;s past mistakes.", "&quot;The vast tracts of land set aside for US forces in Japan impede community development and have a major impact on the lives of our citizens,&quot; said Matsuzawa Shigefumi, governor of Kanagawa prefecture, abutting Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "China", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Obama administration", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-01T17:30:00Z", "title": "Is Japan's sun rising or setting? | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/01/japan-election", "article": "It&apos;s tempting to dismiss the weekend election landslide victory of Japan&apos;s opposition Democratic party (DPJ) as reflecting no more than a bad-tempered &quot;throw the bums out&quot; mood among recession-hit voters. European commentators transfixed by China&apos;s rise have jumped two-footed into this trap. They play down the result&apos;s wider significance for a country they view as a declining power while predicting that little will change in practice. A slightly smug response is evident in Beijing, too. There is quiet satisfaction there at the decimation, after half a century in power, of the Liberal Democratic party of the nationalist former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, a hate figure for many Chinese. Pledges by the DPJ&apos;s incoming prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to eschew visits to the Yasukuni war shrine in Tokyo and pursue closer Asian co-operation are seen as tacit acknowledgement of Tokyo&apos;s past mistakes. American reactions have been notably less complacent, reflecting real unease about where the DPJ&apos;s untested, vaguely anti-capitalist, anti-globalisation stance and its vow to forge a &quot;more equal&quot; relationship with the US may lead. The Obama administration said it was ready to work together &quot;to further cement this indispensable alliance&quot;. But it quickly stressed Washington had &quot;no intention&quot; of re-opening negotiations on American bases and troop re-deployments in Japan, as urged by DPJ leaders. Although Hatoyama backpedalled recently, saying the US-Japan alliance will &quot;continue to be the cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy&quot;, the presence of 47,000 American military personnel, occupying 134 bases covering over 100,000 hectares of prime real estate, is one of several weak points in the edifice. &quot;The vast tracts of land set aside for US forces in Japan impede community development and have a major impact on the lives of our citizens,&quot; said Matsuzawa Shigefumi, governor of Kanagawa prefecture, abutting Tokyo. Crime and environmental damage associated with the bases were of especial concern, he said. The 1960 Status of Forces agreement between the two countries should be reviewed or, failing that, specific Japanese laws should be applicable to US bases and personnel. Hatoyama says the new government will not renew the mandate for Japanese refuelling ships in the Indian Ocean, tasked with supporting US military activities in Afghanistan, when it expires in January. He also wants a US pledge not to bring nuclear-armed vessels or aircraft into Japanese ports and airports. At the same time, the prime minister-elect favours the establishment of an East Asian regional community, not dissimilar to early forms of the EU, with Japan and China (like France and Germany) at its heart. Indeed, some have compared Hatoyama to Germany&apos;s former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der&apos;s mould-breaking bid to loosen Washington&apos;s stifling postwar embrace. These unsettling ideas, plus his guiding political mantra of yuai (friendship and love), will add spice to his first meeting with Barack Obama around the G20 summit in Pittsburgh later this month. Contradicting the suggestions that the wrinkles will be ironed out given time, rightwing American commentators sense a real threat to US interests. &quot;Hatoyama dreams of an Asian union, a utopia free of rapacious American capitalism, a region bound together by fraternity and a common currency,&quot; wrote Tim Kelly in Forbes magazine. &quot;He describes his country as being &apos;buffeted by the winds of market fundamentalism&apos;.&quot; His dangerous vision was of Japan and China marching hand-in-hand as American economic and military power waned. Hatoyama, Kelly concluded, was living on &quot;fantasy island&quot;. Mary Kissel of the Wall Street Journal was scarcely less scathing. &quot;Hatoyama is scoring populist points by talking about distancing Japan from [the US] alliance,&quot; she said. And his domestic policies were just as damaging. &quot;He stands for agricultural protectionism, higher minimum wages, higher taxes in the name of environmental responsibility, and more [state] handouts \u2026 Hatoyama&apos;s Keynsian worship may spell another lost decade for the world&apos;s second-largest economy.&quot; Veteran Asia commentator Philip Bowring is less alarmist; he rules out any significant change in Japan&apos;s foreign policies, the main reason being China. In this regard, he suggested, Hatoyama and the DPJ were behind the curve and faced a sharp reality check. &quot;In some [Asian] countries rising fears of China&apos;s goals are now cancelling out criticism of the US-led invasion of Iraq and the &apos;war on terror&apos;. Worries about the impact of reduced US demand is offsetting resentment of Wall Street-style capitalism,&quot; Bowring said. In other words, Japan could become more dependent on Washington, not less. &quot;The [DPJ] assumes that Japan and China can share leadership of an East Asian community. But the prevailing view in China appears to be that &apos;there cannot be two suns in the sky&apos;. For Beijing, the Japanese sun is setting as the Chinese one rises.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Would a white woman with a &quot;normal&quot; name seeking to board a plane, be it in London or Rome, Nairobi or Tokyo, have been tossed aside by callous and possibly vindictive Canadian officials and subjected not just to detention but to the humiliation of a DNA test?"], "tags": ["Canada", "Race issues", "Stephen Harper", "Kenya", "World news", "US news", "Americas"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-02T13:30:00Z", "title": "Canada's identity fraud | Michael Stickings", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/sep/02/canada-suaad-hagi-mohamud-race", "article": "Here are the facts: on 21 May 2009, Suaad Hagi Mohamud, a Kenyan-born Canadian national, arrives at the airport in Nairobi for her return flight back to Toronto. At the airport, she is detained by Kenyan authorities as an alleged imposter. Apparently, she does not look like her passport photo, which is several years old. The authorities focus specifically on her lips. Mohamud later claims that she was expected to pay a bribe to secure her release and return home. The next day, according to the CBC: &quot;The high commission of Canada in Nairobi confiscates and voids her passport, despite Mohamud producing her Canadian driver&apos;s licence, fingerprints and other documents.&quot; She spends eight days in jail before being released on bail. &quot;Liliane Khadour, the Canadian high commission&apos;s first secretary, tells Kenyan government officials a thorough investigation has determined Mohamud is an impostor and recommends that she be prosecuted. Kenyan officials charge her with identity fraud. Mohamud would spend parts of the next two and a half months living in Nairobi slum hotels.&quot; On 22 July, the Canadian government &quot;agrees to ask Kenyan authorities to delay her trial until a DNA test can be conducted to confirm her identity&quot;. Still, two days later, foreign minister Lawrence Cannon says that &quot;there is no tangible proof&quot; that Mohamud is Canadian. The DNA test results are released on 10 August. They show that &quot;there&apos;s a 99.99% chance that she is the mother of her son in Toronto.&quot; On 13 August, almost three months after Mohamud&apos;s detention at the Nairobi airport, Canada&apos;s prime minister Stephen Harper, in his first public statement on the case, says that he wants &quot;to see her get on a flight back to Canada.&quot; The next day, the charges against Mohamud are dropped. The Canadian government announces that it will conduct an investigation. On 15 August, Mohamud arrives in Toronto. &quot;You can&apos;t imagine, I&apos;m really happy to come back, I&apos;m really, really happy to come home. I&apos;m glad my own nightmare is over.&quot; On 21 August, Mohamud announces that she is suing the Canadian government. &quot;I don&apos;t care about money. I only go to court so this never happen[s] to another Canadian citizen.&quot; But could this have happened to another Canadian citizen, or, rather, to any Canadian citizen? Or is what happened to Mohamud far more likely to happen to Canadians like her \u2013 a &quot;new&quot; Canadian \u2013 than to Canadians who are more, well, traditionally Canadian? Which is to say, was Mohamud&apos;s ordeal the result of her being non-white, non-Christian, non-European? There is an eye-opening contrast with the decision by Canada&apos;s government to grant asylum to a white South African who claims he was persecuted for his race. Like it or not, this ugly story raises the spectre of race, religion and ethnicity, and specifically of racial, religious and ethnic prejudice. And the uncomfortable question must be asked: Beneath the official veneer of Canada&apos;s impressive multicultural diversity, beneath the widespread toleration of difference, do Canadians \u2013 and does their government \u2013 actually treat some among them as somehow less than they are? Mohamud herself is accusing Canadian officials of &quot;callous and reckless treatment&quot;. &quot;I told them I&apos;m a Canadian so call my government,&quot; she said on 21 August. &quot;I thought my government would back me up. I was alone when my government let me down.&quot; Remember: The Canadian government wanted Kenya to prosecute her. The high commission in Nairobi was an active participant in her nightmare. (Liliane Khadour has since been recalled, though the government has not admitted that it was because of her role in this affair.) Mohamud&apos;s claim is that she suffered &quot;severe damages, including ... loss of reputation, physical and psychological injuries, mental distress, loss of income and special damages.&quot; Back in Toronto, during her prolonged stay in Kenya, her life crumbled. To be fair, Mohamud&apos;s saga did generate a good deal of interest here in Canada, not least with the media establishment in Toronto. A number of leading political figures across the country have come to her defence. The federal New Democratic party has proposed legislation to protect foreign nationals overseas. Parliament has convened a committee to examine Mohamud&apos;s case in particular and the issue of Canadians overseas in general. As Bob Rae, a leading Liberal MP, put it: &quot;How this government treats people speaks to the character of the government, and it&apos;s a very fundamental issue. How we present ourselves to the world, how we treat our citizens is an important issue.&quot; At the very least, Mohamud&apos;s story reveals that &quot;questionable protocols&quot; were in place. But that can&apos;t be all there is to it. First, there is the matter of the Harper government&apos;s treatment of Canadians abroad. As the Globe and Mail explains: &quot;The case has fuelled concerns over the Conservative government&apos;s protection of Canadians abroad, after controversies over the cases of Guant\u00e1namo detainee Omar Khadr and Sudanese-Canadian Abousfian Abdelrazik.&quot; The government&apos;s internal investigation of the Mohamud case won&apos;t nearly be enough. The opposition parties need to hold the government accountable and demand answers. Failure to protect Canadians abroad, not least those who find themselves in trouble with local authorities, is simply not acceptable. Second, there is the matter of a possible double standard with respect to the treatment of Canadians in general. A nice way to put is that the government&apos;s &quot;lumpy and idiosyncratic decision-making has created the perception, if not the reality, of playing favourites&quot;. A more honest way to put it is that the government, and perhaps Canadian society more generally, treats different Canadians differently, and not always fairly or justly. While I do not accuse Harper or his government of pursuing an explicitly prejudicial policy \u2013 akin, say, to the practice of searching the luggage of non-whites at Heathrow airport, or to the all-too-common police practice, most notably in the US, of disproportionately pulling over non-whites for traffic violations \u2013 and while there is no direct evidence, yet, to suggest that the treatment of Mohamud by Canadian officials was explicitly prejudicial, do we really think that a white woman with a &quot;normal&quot; name from a more desirable Toronto neighbourhood \u2013 that is, a more &quot;normal&quot; Canadian (in the eyes of most Canadians) \u2013 would have received the same treatment? Surely there are white women with passport photos that sort of don&apos;t resemble them. Would a white woman with a &quot;normal&quot; name seeking to board a plane, be it in London or Rome, Nairobi or Tokyo, have been tossed aside by callous and possibly vindictive Canadian officials and subjected not just to detention but to the humiliation of a DNA test? And would those officials have actively pushed for the prosecution of such a woman? Would they not rather have rushed to her defence, taken her side, and had her on the next plane home? Why did they not believe this woman in particular? Whey did they think she was an imposter? Why did they rush to judgement before even looking into the particulars of her case in any serious way? What exactly did they have against her? And it isn&apos;t just the officials at the high commission in Nairobi. Where has the Harper government been through all this? Where has Harper himself been? Why did it take him almost three months to utter a public statement on Mohamud? Even now, why does his government refuse to apologise? No, Canada may not be an &quot;apartheid&quot; state, as the Toronto Star&apos;s Christopher Hume suggested. But I think Hume is right to ask the key question: &quot;Is citizenship now defined by the colour of your skin?&quot; In Mohamud&apos;s case, it seems that her status was defined not just by her skin colour but by her name and her religion.  From Nairobi to Ottawa, the Canadian government&apos;s handling of the Mohamud case has been, from the start, appalling. We like to think that this sort of thing only happens elsewhere, often down in the US, where such segregation, such a double standard, is, we observe with noses held high, commonplace. It&apos;s time we woke up to the truth."}, {"sentences": ["The IOC&apos;s evaluation commission, which visited each of the bidding cities in turn earlier this year to rate the merits of Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid, laid out the pros and cons of each in a 93-page document yesterday.", "The Tokyo bid won praise for plans that would &quot;generally facilitate very efficient games operations and travel&quot; and its &quot;fully achievable budget&quot; but there were concerns about low levels of public support and that some of the venues listed as already built were yet to be constructed.", "Both Rio and Tokyo have attempted to tap into the IOC&apos;s desire to ensure the Olympics thrives in new markets and reaches younger generations.", "Tokyo claims that, by 2016, it will be able to reach the largest primetime audience in the world.", "Tokyo is expected to deploy the Japanese prime minister and the Chicago bid team is desperately hoping Obama will add some stardust to its final push in Copenhagen, although dignitaries will have less time to press IOC flesh than usual, with the vote taking place on the first full day of the congress.", "Chances of victory: 4/5 Tokyo The pitch &quot;Uniting our world&quot; as part of a &quot;100 year Olympic games legacy&quot;."], "tags": ["Sport", "Olympics & the media", "Media", "World news", "Rio 2016", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-02T18:59:17Z", "title": "2016 Olympics city hopefuls hit the home straight", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/02/2016-olympics-city-hopefuls", "article": "The race to host the 2016 Olympic games entered the home straight today, with no clear leader emerging from the four bidding cities after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) published important technical evaluation reports. The IOC&apos;s evaluation commission, which visited each of the bidding cities in turn earlier this year to rate the merits of Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid, laid out the pros and cons of each in a 93-page document yesterday. Chicago had been the early favourite because of the predicted &quot;Obama effect&quot; and the obvious commercial benefits of holding the games in the biggest market for sponsorship and TV rights, but Rio de Janeiro has come up on the rails after running a well regarded campaign in which President Lula has been a highly visible presence. Nor can Madrid, which enjoyed the highest level of national public support, be entirely discounted. IOC insiders said the race remained genuinely open. In light of the global recession that has taken hold since the bidding process began, there will be increased focus on the need for bidders to provide government guarantees. That could count against Chicago. In its report the IOC said only a capped guarantee of $750m (\u00a3460m) had been offered and it had knocked back an attempt by Chicago to amend the Host City Contract. But Chicago was praised for its plans for a &quot;compact&quot; games, with the majority of venues and hotels within five miles (8km) of the city centre and the commission said its lakefront Olympic Village would provide a &quot;special experience&quot; for athletes. The Tokyo bid won praise for plans that would &quot;generally facilitate very efficient games operations and travel&quot; and its &quot;fully achievable budget&quot; but there were concerns about low levels of public support and that some of the venues listed as already built were yet to be constructed. The Rio bid is backed by government guarantees and was praised for the high quality of its bid but the IOC commission questioned an accommodation plan that includes the use of six cruise ships and mentioned concerns around security. Brazil has already been awarded the 2014 World Cup, the effect of which on the voting intentions of IOC members is unclear. The 13-strong evaluation commission said it would accelerate the delivery of infrastructure and provide valuable experience but would also present a &quot;marketing and communications&quot; challenge. Much of Madrid&apos;s infrastructure already exists, with 23 out of 33 venues in place, and &quot;strong support and financial commitments&quot; have been received from local, regional and national government. Its high level of public support was also noted but the quality of documents and presentations relating to its bid were &quot;varied&quot; in quality and there were potential organisational challenges. The IOC president, Jacques Rogge, has said last year&apos;s Olympics in Beijing will be the last of the money-no-object spectaculars for the foreseeable future and that, in line with the bid that won the games for London, sustainability and legacy would become watchwords for would-be bidders. &quot;We are in the mode for lean games,&quot; he said earlier this year. Both Rio and Tokyo have attempted to tap into the IOC&apos;s desire to ensure the Olympics thrives in new markets and reaches younger generations. The Rio bid has majored on its ability to bring the games to South America for the first time and play a role in transforming the country and the continent. Tokyo claims that, by 2016, it will be able to reach the largest primetime audience in the world. &quot;We are particularly pleased that the IOC report recognises the power of a Rio games to deliver social transformation and our ability to &apos;leave an affordable and significant legacy&apos;,&quot; said Carlos Nuzman, president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee and Rio 2016, yesterday. London&apos;s victory in the race for the 2012 games is widely considered to have changed the terms of the debate for bidding cities, with &quot;compact&quot;, &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;sustainable&quot; becoming the buzzwords. The 106 members of the IOC will announce the winning city in Copenhagen on 2 October, taking into account the information provided by each in their &quot;bid book&quot;, the conclusions of the evaluation committee and the final presentations that can swing votes at the last minute. In Singapore in 2005 it was felt that it was Lord Coe&apos;s dynamic speech, an empowering film focusing on the legacy for youth and then prime minister Tony Blair&apos;s glad-handing of delegates that helped London overcome the favourite, Paris. Vladimir Putin also played a crucial role in swinging the vote for the 2014 Winter games Sochi&apos;s way in 2007. President Lula has already committed to flying in to Copenhagen, as has King Juan Carlos for Madrid. Tokyo is expected to deploy the Japanese prime minister and the Chicago bid team is desperately hoping Obama will add some stardust to its final push in Copenhagen, although dignitaries will have less time to press IOC flesh than usual, with the vote taking place on the first full day of the congress. Rio de Janeiro  The pitch &quot;Live Your Passion&quot; \u2013 a bid based around &quot;celebration&quot; and &quot;regeneration&quot;. Pros Would take games to South America for first time; backed by president as part of regeneration plan and financially sound; young population would attract new audiences.

My partner was reading a book one evening a couple of weeks ago and suddenly called me over to look at something. She pointed at a line in the middle of a poem and there it was, my name. I mean my name exactly, Billy Mills, not William, or Bill, or Will, or any of the other possible variants, but Billy, loud and clear. Mute incomprehension quickly gave way to a nice warm glow and a broad grin; fame at last, I thought. Of course, it wasn&apos;t me but, as the next line in the book coincidentally has it, &quot;the other wun&quot; (sic); the other one being Billy Mills, Olympic Gold medallist, member of the Oglala Sioux nation, Native American rights activist and, as it happens, author. In an instant, my initial disappointment was replaced and assuaged by fond memories of a 10-year-old me glued to the grainy television coverage of this strange man with my name running his way into the history books in the 10,000 metres final at the Tokyo Olympiad. Now there&apos;s reflected glory to bask in, if you like, especially for a boy whose surname had up to that moment been indelibly linked, for his peer group, to a certain sweet-as-sugar child actress. Bliss. The book in question was, by the way, The American Poems by Colin Simms. I&apos;ve long enjoyed Simms&apos;s naturalist poems and his ability to bring birds, otters and martens alive from the page, but this book was a recent purchase and a real eye-opener. The poems capture 30 years&apos; worth of visits to the United States and Canada and Simms&apos;s resulting reflections on the fraught relationships between the indigenous population (The People, as Simms calls them) and the European interlopers, and include history, myth, contemporary reservation life and a characteristic eye and ear for the natural world. At first glance, it seemed an odd choice of topic, but it turns out that Simms is, via one grandfather, part Native American himself; he&apos;s probably the only poet from the north of England that can make such a claim. Equally, The American Poems is probably the only book of verse ever published that acknowledges the assistance of, on the one hand, Basil Bunting and Hugh MacDiarmid and, on the other, Marlon Brando and Bob Mitchum. It&apos;s well worth a read if you get the chance. Sadly, though, the quality of Simms&apos;s writing will not guarantee me literary fame. However, my experience did set me thinking that some people probably just take it for granted that their names &quot;belong&quot; to the reading public as much as to themselves. The world must be full of Elizabeth Bennets, Leopold Blooms and Winston Smiths who are heartily sick of being reminded of their more famous fictional namesakes. Or maybe I&apos;m wrong; maybe people revel in the glamour of such an association. I wouldn&apos;t know.

Gathered in a first-floor conference room at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a huddle of senior Lehman Brothers executives realised that their firm was bust. A last-ditch effort to get Barclays to buy the 185-year-old Wall Street bank had failed. The British were not coming. Bankruptcy was the only card left to play. &quot;People were enormously upset,&quot; recalls Rodgin Cohen, a partner at the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who was advising Lehman on its bankruptcy on the afternoon of Sunday, 14 September last year. &quot;But this was a group of professionals. There was anger but there wasn&apos;t any screaming or running around. Everybody had been living this 24/7 so, really, there was an element of exhaustion.&quot; Lehman had tried everything to avoid this fate. Its chief executive, Dick Fuld, had peppered his counterpart at Bank of America, Ken Lewis, with phone messages urging him to use his stronger institution to mount a rescue. Fuld even persuaded George Walker, a non-executive director of Lehman who was a cousin of President Bush, to put in a call to the Oval Office with a last-ditch appeal for a bailout, over the head of treasury secretary Henry Paulson. The president refused to answer the phone. In the final hours of a weekend of desperate negotiations to save the bank, a bid from Barclays had been the last hope. Fuld was waiting for news at his antique-stuffed office, which took up almost a quarter of the executive suite on the 31st floor of Lehman Brothers&apos; midtown headquarters, overlooking the Hudson River. Down at the New York Fed, Cohen and Lehman&apos;s chief operating officer, Bart McDade, rang him to tell him that no deal was forthcoming because the British bank was unable to proceed without a US government backstop against liabilities. &quot;We talked to Dick and told him what had happened,&quot; said Cohen. &quot;He was still somewhat aghast that it had come to this after Bear Stearns had gotten government support. But there were no options left on the table. The government had made it quite clear that they would not bail out Lehman.&quot; In the early hours of Monday, 15 September, the 185-year-old Wall Street institution officially declared itself insolvent with a filing for chapter 11 protection against its creditors. It was a very public bankruptcy - all weekend, television crews had stationed themselves outside Lehman&apos;s office, snatching footage of downcast employees emerging with boxes full of personal belongings. The event brought out attention-seekers - one man stationed himself outside Lehman&apos;s building with a red flag, shouting: &quot;The capitalist order is in freefall collapse!&quot; It was well known that Lehman, an Alabama cotton trader turned banking behemoth, was the biggest bankruptcy in US history. But nobody anticipated quite what would follow - a week that has become known on Wall Street as the great panic of 2008. Mercifully, many Asian stockmarkets were closed the next morning for a holiday. But shares plunged in Taipei, Mumbai and Manila. And when the business day opened in Europe, the FTSE 100 index dived by 4%. In New York, financiers awoke to the news that not only had Lehman Brothers collapsed but that another struggling brokerage, Merrill Lynch, had been bought by Bank of America for $50bn (\u00a330bn) in a buyout negotiated in just 48 hours. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by more than 500 points, its worst fall since the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, with an all-time record of 8bn shares changing hands. &quot;There was a tremendous amount of nervousness,&quot; says Anthony Conroy, head trader BNY ConvergEx, a New York brokerage. &quot;People were worried about the ramifications not just for a day or a week but for the months and years ahead.&quot; Would the system collapse? As stocks slid, it became apparent that there was a system-wide crisis of confidence in banks across the globe. Conroy says: &quot;You realised you were living through something that was part of history. You didn&apos;t know how bad it was going to be. Would the system collapse? Was somebody else going to default?&quot; Around the world, dismal tidings came thick and fast. Attention briefly turned to Japan&apos;s banks as it emerged that leading Tokyo institutions were among Lehman&apos;s top creditors. China cut its interest rates, nervous about a plunge in economic activity. Russian authorities shut down Moscow&apos;s stock exchange, horrified by the speed of a plunge in the country&apos;s RTS index. In Britain, the struggling bank HBOS became the focus of attention as its shares halved in the space of an hour. Desperate to stave off a failure, the government suspended competition rules to broker a \u00a312.2bn merger with Lloyds TSB, in a lightning round of negotiations concluded in barely 48 hours. On Wall Street, a sense of alarm moved beyond speculative, market-driven, investments to seemingly safe sources of wealth. The contagion took a dangerous turn on Tuesday, 16 September when America&apos;s oldest money market fund, the Reserve Primary Fund, revealed that exposure to Lehman had caused it to &quot;break the buck&quot;. Money market funds are ultra-low risk - they only put money in conservative securities and, routinely offered by America&apos;s high-street banks, were widely considered to be as safe as bank accounts. They generally aim to keep a stable asset value of $1 a share. To &quot;break the buck&quot; meant that the fund&apos;s value had fallen below a dollar - an extremely unusual event that triggered a run on the industry. Old hands on Wall Street pinpoint this as the moment that they realised the global financial system was in danger. Nothing was safe. To avert mass withdrawals, President Bush was obliged to sign an emergency order providing government insurance to the $3.5 trillion tied up in money market funds. &quot;It was a very, very dangerous time,&quot; says Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland and a former chief economist at the US International Trade Commission. &quot;The concept that the &apos;market will police itself&apos; failed. My feeling is we got pretty damn close to it all coming apart.&quot; It became clear that the Bush administration&apos;s laissez-faire attitude in allowing a major financial institution to collapse into an disorderly bankruptcy had been catastrophic. Nobody in the financial world trusted anybody&apos;s claims of solvency. The flow of money around the economy was simply seizing up. A fundamental fissure opened up in capitalism. Morici says: &quot;Western nations could have come apart in the way they did in the Great Depression.&quot; Wall Street titans under attack One by one, the titans of Wall Street came under attack. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley saw its stock lose a quarter of its value. Chief executive John Mack urged his bankers to hold their nerve, firing off a memo attacking &quot;fear and rumours&quot; in the market. Even Goldman Sachs, the most revered name in investment banking, felt its foundations shake with a 14% drop in its stock, prompting angry denials from the bank of any difficulties. Late in the evening of Tuesday 16th, another huge US name was teetering on the brink of oblivion - and this time, the US government acted. AIG, an insurer with $1 trillion in assets, 116,000 employees and its name on Manchester United&apos;s shirts, had come disastrously unstuck on huge contracts written by a financial products subsidiary in London. The division specialised in insuring banks against the risk of default on bad loans. It was compared, by critics, to a giant, reckless hedge fund. Faced with the imminent prospect of AIG going bust, the Federal Reserve hurriedly stumped up $85bn in return for an 85% stake in the company. AIG&apos;s chief executive was summarily fired by the government in a rescue which the Fed&apos;s chairman, Ben Bernanke, later described to Congress as the event which most infuriated him of the entire financial crisis: &quot;If there is a single episode in this entire 18 months that has made me more angry, I can&apos;t think of one other than AIG.&quot; AIG&apos;s near death experience prompted another judder through the markets. The Dow tumbled by 440 points on Wednesday 17th and the FTSE 100 index lost 2.25% of its value. Short sellers, who make money by betting on a drop in stock prices, were accused of aggravating an evaporation of confidence in banks. Authorities around the world soon began to crack down, imposing a temporary ban on &quot;shorting&quot; any financial stocks. In the days that followed, another US bank met its maker. Washington Mutual, a Seattle-based chain with branches throughout the nation, failed in the biggest high-street banking collapse since the war. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley ripped up their business models as standalone Wall Street banks and opted for the shelter of government regulation, in return for a lower risk structure. As far away as Sydney, one of Australian&apos;s biggest banks, Macquarie, had to deny rumours of trouble as its stock went into freefall. And on both sides of the Atlantic, governments took the extraordinary step of bailing out and partially nationalising the banking industry. Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College, describes September 2008 as the most momentous financial turmoil since president Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared a mandatory four-day banking shutdown in March 1933 to halt a panic-driven run on deposits. In the wake of Lehman&apos;s failure, institutions accustomed to prosperity suddenly realised they were mortal: &quot;It was a message sent to Wall Street banks that they weren&apos;t too big to fail. The reaction was really very severe.&quot; Unleashing the forces of evil Barclays picked up parts of Lehman from the bankruptcy courts, salvaging about 10,000 of the bank&apos;s 25,000 jobs. But many still question the wisdom of the US government&apos;s decision to stand by and allow a vast investment bank to go bust, given the intertwined nature of Lehman&apos;s trading relationships around the globe. Larry McDonald, a former Lehman vice-president, says the Bush administration could easily have offered the guarantee needed to help Barclays buy Lehman outright: &quot;They put Lehman Brothers to sleep. They executed her. They put a pillow over her face.&quot; Researching a recently published book on Lehman&apos;s failure, &quot;a colossal failure of common sense&quot;, McDonald interviewed more than 45 Lehman executives. They insisted that they warned both Bush&apos;s treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and the then chairman of the New York Fed, Timothy Geithner, of the consequences of inaction: &quot;They were begging Geithner and begging Paulson. They were saying to Geithner &apos;you&apos;re going to unleash the forces of evil on the global markets - you don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re doing!&apos;&quot; That is not to say that Lehman can shirk blame for its predicament. With $18bn of core equity on its balance sheet, the bank had taken positions of an astonishing $780bn in mortgages, stocks, bonds, oil, gold, derivatives and other investments. It had leveraged its books by an astonishing factor of 44 and it had opted to take a particularly huge punt on America&apos;s teetering home loans market. Lehman&apos;s chief executive has gone to ground since September 2008. Fuld has been questioned by the US department of justice, which is investigating whether the bank misled investors about its parlous finances. He recently sold his apartment on New York&apos;s Park Avenue for $25m and he has offloaded a collection of artwork, including drawings by modernists Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, for $13.5m. At a rare public appearance before a Congressional committee, Fuld described the bank&apos;s collapse as &quot;a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life&quot; but to the disgust of lawmakers, he refused to acknowledge any errors, insisting that all his decisions in running the bank had been &quot;both prudent appropriate&quot; based on the information he had at the time. Many former employees see it differently. McDonald has accused Fuld of surrounding himself by &quot;yes&quot; men and of rotating senior executives regularly so they could never build a powerbase to threaten him. Fuld, he says, was one of a generation of &quot;peacetime generals&quot; on Wall Street who had become lulled into the belief, from two decades of prosperity, that making money was easy. &quot;It was a scrappy, over-achieving investment bank. Our goal was to catch the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,&quot; says McDonald. &quot;We&apos;d had these tranquil seas with very little surf for so long.&quot; In common with many other ex-Lehman bankers, he places blame for the firm&apos;s excesses squarely in the bank&apos;s 31st floor executive suite. &quot;Lehman was a case of 24,992 people making money and eight guys losing it.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["In late 1940 and 1941, as positions hardened and diplomacy failed, the argument was voiced in Tokyo that only by war could these obstacles be overcome.", "Attempts to rally Islam by calls of jihad, and ordering worshippers in the mosques to bow in prayer not towards Mecca, but towards the imperial palace in Tokyo, outraged the Muslims of Malaya and Indonesia.", "In a rare joint operation, he was transferred from a German to a Japanese submarine off the coast of Madagascar and flown to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-07T11:05:01Z", "title": "Japan's gamble to become a colonial power during the second world war", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/07/japan-imperialism-militarism", "article": "The far east has too often been seen as a distant and relatively minor theatre of the war in Europe. This perspective needs to be reversed. The great Asian war had a seismic momentum of its own. Fighting began\u00a0in 1931 and there was barely a hiatus when Japan surrendered to the allies in August 1945. Between 1941 and 1945 alone, war claimed around 24 million lives in Japanese-occupied Asia, perhaps 3 million Japanese, and 3.5 million more in India through war-related famine. Of\u00a0these victims, the European, American and Australasian casualties numbered perhaps 1% of the total. But such tallies do not convey the full scale of the tragedy. Roads to war  The roots of war lay in western imperial competition in Asia and the quest of newly modernising states such as China and Japan for wealth, power and equality. Japan&apos;s rapid industrialisation, like that of the west, required privileged access to raw materials overseas. To Japan, to be a modern power was to be a colonial power. By the 1914-1918 war, she controlled the assets of Korea and Taiwan, and demanded greater access to those of China. Resistance to Japanese imperialism was a defining moment of national awakening in China. Japan&apos;s insistence on its &quot;special interests&quot; in China flew in the face of the so-called &quot;open door&quot; policy that was backed by the United States, Britain and the League of Nations. Many Japanese soldiers and politicians now saw the international system as a form of racial exclusion, designed by the western powers to protect their own imperial interests, and to deny newcomers theirs. In 1918, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, a later prime minister, wrote that it condemned Japan &quot;to remain forever subordinate to the advanced nations&quot;. When after 1928, a stronger central government arose in China under Chiang Kai-shek, and was recognised by the west, Japan was increasingly isolated. As the great depression squeezed resources, many argued that the only way for Japan to progress was to go it alone. In 1931, Japanese armies annexed the mineral-rich Chinese province of Manchuria [Manchukuo], and created a puppet regime under Pu Yi, China&apos;s last emperor. The initiative came from commanders in the field who wanted to commit civilian politicians at home to a bolder imperial policy. In July 1937, a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese troops near Beijing was escalated by the Japanese into a war of conquest of the north-east and maritime provinces \u2192 \u2190 of China. When the capital Nanjing fell in December 1937, a huge number of civilians, probably more than 300,000, were massacred. This brutal campaign overshadows Sino-Japanese relations to this day. The Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek fled to the inland city of Chongqing. It was weakened and corrupt, but committed to modernising China and restoring its sovereignty. A\u00a0patriotic &quot;united front&quot; was patched up between Chiang and his main rivals, Mao Zedong&apos;s communists, who gathered strength in their northern redoubt of Yan&apos;an. It was a fragile truce, not a working alliance. &quot;The Japanese are a disease of the skin,&quot; Chiang said in 1941, &quot;the communists are a disease of the heart.&quot; But Chiang had gained time and allies. President Franklin D Roosevelt&apos;s family fortune came from the China trade; he believed that a democratic China was destined to lead modern Asia. But he was not prepared to go to war for it. Nor were the British. Instead they supplied Chongqing by air and road over the &quot;Hump&quot; from British Burma. By late 1941, a US soldier, the acerbic &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell, was in effective command of Chiang&apos;s troops. He considered Chiang a &quot;stubborn bugger&quot;, reluctant to commit Chinese armies to battle, but Stilwell under-estimated Chiang&apos;s wiliness in drawing the Japanese into a long, costly war they could not win. Japan now felt even more tightly encircled by the ABCD powers: America,\u00a0Britain, China and the Dutch. The Netherlands East Indies was the best available source of oil for the war effort in China: Borneo and South Sumatra produced more than eight million tonnes a year. But blocking Japan&apos;s path to it was the British &quot;fortress&quot; of Singapore. On 27 September 1940, Japan entered into a fateful tripartite pact with Germany and Italy. For Japan, Wilhelmine Germany had been a model for a modernising, martial monarchy. As Japanese politics lurched to the right, fascism too seemed a &quot;kindred spirit&quot;. Both Germany and Japan spoke of shattering and remoulding the international order. But Japanese leaders were motivated by a deeper conviction that Emperor Hirohito was to be the nucleus of a new regional cosmology: a &quot;greater east Asian co-prosperity sphere&quot;. After the fall of Paris, Japan occupied French Indochina to cut off a supply route to Chongqing and as a springboard to the south. But the European war presented new obstacles to Japan&apos;s destiny in Asia. It caused the United States to expand its navy and to look more sympathetically upon the British empire in Asia, to help Britain fight on in Europe. Crucially, the occupation of Indochina was met by crippling economic sanctions from the United States and the west, effectively cutting off Japan&apos;s imports of oil. In late 1940 and 1941, as positions hardened and diplomacy failed, the argument was voiced in Tokyo that only by war could these obstacles be overcome. As Japan&apos;s militant new prime minster Hideki Tojo told an imperial conference on 5 November 1941: &quot;I fear that we would become a third-class nation after two or three years if we just sat tight.&quot; Japan&apos;s 70 days On 8 December 1941, Yamashita Tomoyuki&apos;s 25th Army landed on the north-east coast of Malaya and began a driving charge down the peninsula to Singapore. The British had long expected this, but failed to launch their planned pre-emptive strike into neutral Thailand, so-called Operation Matador. What was not foreseen was the simultaneous strike by air and sea at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This achieved the short-term goal of removing the immediate threat of the US Pacific fleet. But, given the fury of America&apos;s reaction, it made Japan&apos;s rather vaguer\u00a0long-term goal \u2013 a negotiated and advantageous peace \u2013 much harder to attain. The British in Malaya viewed the Japanese with racist contempt. &quot;I\u00a0suppose you&apos;ll push the little men off,&quot; was the reported reaction of the governor of Singapore. But British, Australian and Indian troops were confronted by hardened veterans of the China war, advancing 20km a day by bicycle. Allied forces fell back into Singapore with a speed that did not allow them to regroup and counter-attack effectively. But &quot;fortress Singapore&quot; was a myth. There were no fixed land defences to\u00a0speak of, few modern warplanes, and the naval base had no capital ships.\u00a0When the Prince of Wales and Repulse were sent to the South China Sea, they were sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. Reinforcements poured into Singapore, only to witness in disgust the scorched earth destruction of the naval base they had been sent to defend. The brutal reality was that for Churchill and the chiefs of staff in London, the first call on war materials was the Mediterranean theatre. Churchill ordered the garrison to fight and die to the last man. But at the hour of the final assault on Singapore town, fearing a wholesale slaughter of civilians, local commanders were given leave to surrender on 15 February 1942. The campaign had lasted only 70 days. Lost armies  Without pause, the Japanese pressed on into the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos. Four days after the fall\u00a0of\u00a0Singapore, bombs fell for the first\u00a0time on Australian soil. The Australian cabinet demanded the recall of their troops. Many of them were among the 85,000 soldiers marched into captivity in Singapore. The entire colonial order in Asia was incarcerated. On the best estimates, there were 130,895 civilian internees of the Japanese, more than 11% of whom were to perish. Of the 132,134 prisoners of war, 35,756 died in captivity. But these figures do not include the Asian soldiers captured, the 45,000 Filipinos who fought with the Americans, or some 40,000 Indians in Singapore. Abandoned by their European officers, the Indians were presented with a huge moral dilemma. It seemed as if the British had &quot;handed them over like cattle&quot;, and many were now recruited into a new Indian national army to fight alongside Japan for India&apos;s liberation. British prestige in Asia was shattered by the abandonment of its people. The ugly evacuation of Europeans was, as one British nurse in Penang put it, &quot;a thing that I am sure will never be forgotten or forgiven&quot;. Convinced that the British empire was on the point of collapse, Japan attacked Burma from Thailand. The initial aim was limited: to prevent the reinforcement of Malaya from India. But it became all-out conquest. British reluctance to call on the Chinese to save the British empire meant that intervention by Chinese forces under Stilwell came too late. It\u00a0cost the Chinese more than 10,000 men. As the British retreated, one of the largest displacements of people in history occurred as around 600,000 Indian refugees fled west to Bengal; as many as 80,000 of them died on the wayside. It was the Indian army that made Britain a power of consequence in Asia. During the war, more than two million Indians were recruited to arms. But Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian National Congress did not see it as India&apos;s war. The &quot;Quit India&quot; protests of 1942 were a challenge on a scale not seen since the great rebellion of 1857. As the stragglers from Burma stumbled into the great imperial city of Calcutta, it seemed to herald the imminent apocalypse of the Raj. In Burma, the Japanese were welcomed by some as liberators. Around 18,000 young nationalists travelled in their train as a &quot;Burma independence army&quot;. In the villages, they kindled a promise of freedom and martial revival. In Indonesia, it was said that the Japanese fulfilled the prophecy of the 12th-century king, Joyoboyo: that the rule of the white man would end with the coming of the dwarfish yellow men, who would reign only as long as &quot;a maize seed took to flower&quot;. But for the 2.3 million overseas Chinese of Malaya and Singapore it was the bitterest defeat. Their campaigns for &quot;national salvation&quot; had raised around one third of Chongqing&apos;s war expenditure. Chinese volunteers fought in the last-ditch defence of Singapore, and joined guerrilla bands in the jungle. One Japanese commander described entering Malaya as if it was &quot;the crossroads of the central province of China&quot;. When Singapore fell, between 50,000 and 100,000 Chinese were slaughtered in a so-called &quot;purification by elimination&quot;. Rape was an instrument of war; the standard military-issue condom was branded &quot;Assault No 1&quot;, and young girls began to be coerced as &quot;comfort women&quot; for Japanese soldiers, perhaps 80,000 to 100,000 across occupied Asia. Global war Japan&apos;s war was a gigantic gamble: that\u00a0its forces could win enough audacious victories and hold on long enough to their gains to win a favourable peace. But no American air-carriers or submarines had been destroyed at Hawaii, and they now preyed on Japanese shipping. Dutch and British &quot;scorched earth&quot; further reduced the spoils of conquest. By 1944, oil production in Indonesia was below half its pre-war level. The military-industrial arithmetic was decisive. During the war, Japan produced 70,000 warplanes; the US 300,000 \u2013 and 10 times more munitions. This was now global total war. But in many ways Japan was as isolated as ever. Axis cooperation amounted to little. The key agreements had come late in the day, and set the boundaries of each other&apos;s operations rather than combining them. There was no concerted assault on India. Strategic objectives diverged further over Russia. Japan had joined the axis partly to reduce the risk of war with the Soviets. But this again became a possibility when the Nazi-Soviet pact was thrown aside. Although Hitler disliked the idea of even &quot;honorary Aryans&quot; fighting in Germany&apos;s war of destiny in the east, Japan&apos;s help was sought in January 1943. It declined. Its &quot;final war&quot; was to be fought in the Pacific, with indifference, ultimately, to Germany&apos;s fate. By May 1942, Japan&apos;s perimeter was at its widest extent. But at the same moment, it was contained and turned back in the Pacific at Coral Sea and Midway, where the Japanese lost four carriers and more than 300 warplanes. In the south, the Japanese suffered their first defeat by land, when their landings in New Guinea were repulsed by the Australians and Americans in a series of battles that saw some of the heaviest casualty rates of the war. These were not perhaps the irreversible &quot;turning points&quot;, but they allowed the allies to think in offensive terms. One effect of containment in Asia was to allow the United States to maintain a strategy that placed &quot;Europe first&quot;. In Cairo, between 22 and 26 November 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and Chiang came face to face for the first time. Roosevelt gave the generalissimo great power status, but privately he asked Stilwell: &quot;How long do you think Chiang can last?&quot; Chiang was not present at the conference two days later with Stalin in Tehran, at which the invasion of France took precedence over all else. The new South East Asia Command (SEAC) under Lord Louis Mountbatten did not mean, as Americans quipped, that they would &quot;Save England&apos;s Asian \u2190 Colonies&quot;. Mountbatten&apos;s cherished plans for amphibious landings in Malaya were not executed until after the surrender of Japan. Unable to take war to Japan themselves, the British employed others to wage it on their behalf. In Burma, ethnic minorities such as the Shan, Kachin and Karen were armed against the Japanese and Burmese. In Malaya, by August 1945, around 5,000 fighters of the Malayan Communist party were kitted out with guns and khaki by air drops to support the allied invasion that never came. The seeds of future confrontations were sown. The new Asia  As the first fury of conquest subsided, the Japanese attempted to build a new Asia. A formidable propaganda machine promoted Nippon language, culture and modernity, and attempted to recruit Asian leaders to its cause. This often backfired. Attempts to rally Islam by calls of jihad, and ordering worshippers in the mosques to bow in prayer not towards Mecca, but towards the imperial palace in Tokyo, outraged the Muslims of Malaya and Indonesia. Japanese pan-Asianism was less important in what it achieved for Japan than in providing a platform for Asian politicians \u2013 men such as Sukarno in Indonesia and Aung San in Burma \u2013 to realise their own national visions, and to raise their own armies. On 4 July 1943, prime minister Tojo appeared at a rally in Singapore. At his side was Subhas Chandra Bose,\u00a0a\u00a0radical Congress leader who had\u00a0escaped arrest by the British in India in 1941 and fled to Berlin. In a rare joint operation, he was transferred from a German to a Japanese submarine off the coast of Madagascar and flown to Tokyo. Bose&apos;s charisma as national leader rallied the Indians in south-east Asia behind the Indian national army. He proclaimed a provisional government of &quot;free India&quot;, and toured the region, raising funds. Young Indian women threw their jewellery at his feet and enlisted to fight alongside the men. Their call was &quot;Chalo Delhi!&quot; (&quot;On to Delhi!&quot;), the cry of the mutineers of 1857. Rumours of this soon reached India; it was the beginning of the end of the Indian army as an instrument of British power in Asia. But as war conditions deteriorated, Japanese idealism died, and most Asians only saw imperialism in another form. Japan plundered its colonies for war materials and coerced labour for the Bangkok-Rangoon railway and other projects; more than 70,000 men from Malaya alone. The supply of food broke down across all fronts. In Bengal alone in 1943, more than 3.5 million people died from starvation and disease. The loss of the rice bowl of Burma was compounded by the failures of the British Raj. Final throws  Japanese commanders saw Britain as the weakest of the enemies that encircled them. In March 1944, supported by 40,000 troops of the Indian national army, and hoping to precipitate a revolt within India, the Japanese launched their forces in Burma at the frontier. In China, the massive Ichi-go offensive attempted to destroy the airfields from which US bombers attacked Japanese shipping and cities. These were last, desperate throws of the dice. In Burma, half a million men were locked in some of the bitterest fighting of the war. The British positions in Kohima and Imphal held for five months. Then William Slim&apos;s 14th Army \u2013 Britons, Indians, Gurkhas, Africans \u2013 began to strike forward into Arakan. As reports of Japanese atrocities circulated among the troops, Slim reported, &quot;quarter was neither asked, nor given&quot;. The young Japanese soldiers they faced believed the survival of their homeland was at stake. In the words of the soldier-poet Alun Lewis, they fought &quot;Sleeplessly watching, knifing and falling back&quot;. British and Indian troops were now better led, better provisioned, and backed by US warplanes and the resources of the Indian subcontinent. But the turning of &quot;defeat into victory&quot; was largely the work of Indian soldiers, traders and officials, who would not accept a return to the status quo. The Raj was a mighty weapon of war, but once loosed, the recoil shook the British empire to its foundations. In the Pacific, General MacArthur&apos;s combined operations punched ahead towards Palau and Saipan, which put B-29 bombers in range of Japan&apos;s major cities. These turning points were achieved at a shocking human cost, and greater costs now had to be weighed: not least that of assaulting Japan&apos;s home islands. Britain was desperate to redeem the disasters of 1942 by regaining Malaya by right of arms. In China, Mao&apos;s armies grew while Chiang&apos;s faced heavy attrition. There was much blood and treasure still to be expended, and the shape of the post-war regional order was still in the balance. It was at this point that Asia&apos;s peoples began to grasp a future beyond empire. Young fighters prepared to strike out in the name of the nation. One of the abiding legacies of war was the political legitimacy it gave to men in uniform and to violent, revolutionary change. When, a year later, Japan collapsed more suddenly than anyone could have imagined, across south-east Asia and in China itself, this merely unleashed a new phase of the long and terrible Asian war.

Hatoyama, who will take office next week, said Japan would seek to reduce CO2 emissions by 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, but said the target would be contingent on a deal involving all major emitters in Copenhagen in December. &quot;We can&apos;t stop climate change just by setting our own emissions target,&quot; he said at a forum in Tokyo. &quot;Our nation will call on major countries around the world to set aggressive goals.&quot; Hatoyama will discuss the initiative, which is far more ambitious than the equivalent 8% cut unveiled by the outgoing government in June, at a UN meeting on climate change in New York this month. Connie Hedegaard, Denmark&apos;s minister for climate and energy, described the plan as a bold step forward. &quot;For a long time, everybody has been waiting for everybody else to move in the negotiations. Japan has taken a bold step forward and set an ambitious target. I hope this will inspire other countries to follow suit.&quot; The commitment places Japan firmly among countries committed to aggressive CO2 emissions cuts, despite mounting opposition from business and industry groups, which claim the measures will put jobs at risk. &quot;We have concerns about its feasibility in view of the impact on economic activities and employment, as well as the enormousness of the public burden,&quot; said Satoshi Aoki, the chairman of the Japan automobile manufacturers&apos; association. Harufumi Mochizuki, the outgoing vice minister of trade and industry, said Hatoyama had chosen a &quot;very tough road ahead for the Japanese people and economy&quot;. Hatoyama said his plan would create jobs in sectors such as renewables and manufacturing amid an expected rise in demand for solar energy, home renovations and energy-efficient cars and consumer electronics. &quot;There are cautious people who worry that it will hurt the economy and livelihoods, but I think it will change things for the better,&quot; he said. To help achieve the reduction, Japan will create a domestic emissions trading market and introduce a &quot;feed-in&quot; tariff \u2013 financial rewards for industries that expand their use of renewable energy sources. The Copenhagen talks will be dominated by attempts to persuade China, India and other big emerging economies to sign up to emissions targets. Kim Carstensen, the head of the WWF&apos;s global climate initiative, said: &quot;The decision by an important player such as Japan to do more and get serious about low carbon future can help break the deadlock between developed and developing countries. &quot;The climate negotiations are at a critical point and we need urgent progress to get a fair, ambitious and binding deal in Copenhagen.&quot; The target brings Japan, the world&apos;s fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, alongside the EU, which is committed to a 20% cut by 2020 from 1990 levels and 30% if other nations agree to match the target. But it is still at the lower end of the 25-40% cuts recommended by the UN climate change panel. Hatoyama will have to reconcile his bold initiative with election pledges to eliminate road tolls and petrol surcharges. As host of the Kyoto summit in 1997, Japan is keen to reposition itself at the forefront of the battle against climate change. Its emissions rose 2.3% in the year to March 2008, putting its 16% above its 2012 Kyoto target. Yvo de Boer, the head of the UN climate change secretariat, said: &quot;With such a target, Japan will take on the leadership role that industrialised countries have agreed to take in climate change abatement.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The most expensive is Tokyo (\u00a357.43), followed by Osaka (\u00a351.24) and Paris (\u00a348.51)."], "tags": ["Restaurants", "London", "UK news", "Life and style", "Food & drink"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-08T10:49:47Z", "title": "Recession is biting into Londoners' eating habits", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/08/london-dining-out-zagat-guide", "article": "The economy may still be in trouble and debt levels are at a record high, but Londoners are still enjoying eating out \u2013 they are simply cutting back and spending less. A new restaurant guide published today reveals that the average cost of dining in the capital has declined for the first time since 1997. According to Zagat, the famed &quot;burgundy bible&quot; and restaurant guide, an average London meal is now \u00a340.39, but that still ranks the city as the fifth most expensive in the world for dining out. The most expensive is Tokyo (\u00a357.43), followed by Osaka (\u00a351.24) and Paris (\u00a348.51). From 1997 to 2009, Zagat reported that the cost of dining out in London increased every year. The annualised inflation rate for the period was 3.6%. But this year&apos;s survey reports a first \u2013 the average cost of a meal fell by by a marginal 0.4% from \u00a340.55 to this year&apos;s \u00a340.39. The 2010 Zagat London Restaurants survey includes ratings and reviews of 1,166 eateries in the City and Greater London, based on the input of 5,562 local restaurant-goers. The number of meals eaten out dropped from 2.5 a week in the last survey to 2.2 this year. When asked what effect the economy has had on their dining habits, surveyors confirmed that they have tightened their belts. They are eating out less (41%), eating in less expensive places (36%), being more price sensitive (34%) and cutting back on alcohol, appetisers and desserts (13%). The travails of the economy may also explain why hard-up Londoners are tipping less \u2013 11.6%, down from 12.2% last year. And 72% of Londoners cite service as their main gripe about local dining. All other irritants, including high prices, poor food, noise, crowding and difficult parking received only 28% of surveyor complaints. Tim Zagat, co-founder of the guide, said: &quot;London&apos;s dining habits have clearly changed. Quite simply, they are being more careful with their money. Although eating out less, our surveyors still take out or eat out 43% of their weekly lunches and dinners \u2013 an indication that dining in London is a part of the culture, a part of everyday life \u2013 even in these difficult times.&quot; Having received a pasting in other recent restaurant guides, Gordon Ramsay&apos;s flagship establishment at 68 Royal Hospital Road takes Top Food honours in this survey, while his restaurants also scored second and third positions for popularity. The noodle bar Wagamama is again the most popular restaurant, while Le Manoir aux Quat&apos;Saisons wins the top plaudit for service. And there is more good news for diners, in further signs that restaurants have survived the recession. The British restaurant industry is now &quot;so vibrant&quot; that The Good Food Guide has expanded its list of top eateries, it announced today. There are now so many high-calibre restaurants in the UK that the guide&apos;s 2010 edition lists 50, rather than the 40 of previous years. While Heston Blumenthal and Gordon Ramsay still top the list, as announced last month, The Good Food Guide 2010 also includes a number of new young chefs and a string of restaurants scoring high marks. Editor Elizabeth Carter said there had been a recent culinary revolution, giving Britain a new gastronomic lead over France. And she said despite the economic downturn, high-end restaurants appeared to be riding out the recession, with more UK chefs making the grade. &quot;There are so many great British restaurants hitting their stride at the moment that we just had to expand to a top 50. Despite the credit crunch, the British restaurant scene has never been so vibrant,&quot; she said. Zagat \u2013 Top food 1. Gordon Ramsay/68 Royal Hospital Road 2. Chez Bruce 3. Pied a Terre 4.

Resistance groups in German-occupied countries across the continent burned with impatience. In many cases they wanted to take liberation through into revolution and settle accounts with those who had collaborated or profited. In some cases, especially in Poland, hope was overshadowed by foreboding at what a Soviet occupation would mean. Stalin&apos;s hatred of the country since their victory on the Vistula in the Soviet-Polish war of 1921 meant that he intended to dominate the country totally and even absorb the eastern part into the Soviet Union. In 1940, at the time of the Soviet occupation of eastern Poland during the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the NKVD secret police had tried to eliminate all potential opponents, including teachers, landowners, officers, lawyers and academics. The Polish government in exile raised the fate of the thousands of missing Polish officers, nearly 22,000 of whom had been executed on Stalin and Beria&apos;s orders, 4,400 of them in the forest of Katyn. Stalin broke off diplomatic relations. Both Churchill and Roosevelt felt forced to take Stalin&apos;s side purely to maintain the alliance with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany. On the eastern front, the Red Army had advanced from the Ukraine into Romanian and Polish territory. It now began to prepare the most ambitious offensive of all against the Germans&apos; Army Group Centre in Belorussia. In Italy, the Anglo-American forces were blocked at Monte Cassino and in the Anzio bridgehead, but this convinced the Americans that they were right to concentrate on the preparations to invade northern France. Although Winston Churchill now fully supported the Normandy invasion, he tried in vain to oppose the American plan to mount a second invasion in the south of France, because that would mean taking forces from the Italian campaign. Churchill was set on the militarily impractical idea of continuing the advance up Italy and then striking north-eastwards through the Ljubljana gap to seize Vienna and pre-empt a Stalinist occupation of central Europe. The Americans, not yet suspicious of Stalin, viewed this idea as British politicking and wanted to have nothing to do with it. They intended to finish the war against Nazi Germany as quickly as possible with a drive across northern Europe so that all their efforts could be switched to finishing the war against Japan. In May 1944, the western allies began to plan the postwar world with the governments in exile in London. The first stage of the liberation of western Europe was to be fought in the skies, because the allies needed to establish air supremacy. The strategic bombing campaign against German cities, aircraft factories and refineries in fact served a dual military purpose, whatever the moral debate later. It had greatly helped the Soviet Union by forcing the Germans to withdraw the bulk of their fighter squadrons from the eastern front to defend the Reich. This gave the Soviets air superiority and prevented the Germans from carrying out air reconnaissance, thus enabling the Red Army to mount huge surprise attacks. But the bombing campaign also forced the German fighters into the air, where they could be taken on by the new long-range Mustangs escorting the Flying Fortress squadrons. By the early summer of 1944, the Luftwaffe was reduced to a skeleton. The allies also needed to isolate the invasion region to hinder German supplies and reinforcements sent to the Normandy front. A plan known as &quot;Transportation&quot; involved bombing bridges, railway lines and marshalling yards. Churchill was horrified by the scale of French civilian losses, which he wanted limited to 10,000, but he was overruled by Roosevelt, who insisted that Eisenhower, the supreme commander, be given a free hand to reduce allied casualties later. In fact close to 15,000 were killed, and another 20,000 French civilians died during the campaign. Nearly 70,000 French were killed by allied bombing and shelling during the whole war, more than the total number of British non-combatants killed by the Luftwaffe and the flying bombs. The allies&apos; reliance on massive bombing and shelling, in the hope of reducing their own losses to avoid angry questions at home, revealed perhaps the worst paradox of democracy at war. It is too easy to look back on the Normandy landings of Operation Overlord and assume that success was inevitable because of the allies&apos; overwhelming strength. In fact, the break in the weather that allowed the invasion to go ahead was critical. The German navy never put to sea on the night of 5 June, and despite the legend of &quot;bloody Omaha&quot;, allied casualties were far lower than the 10,000 expected. With around 3,000 servicemen dead, the figure was no more than the number of French civilians killed that day. War of attrition But once German panzer divisions arrived, the British and American armies found themselves bogged down in a terrible war of attrition. The savagery of the fighting meant that the German casualty rates alone were double the average on the eastern front. General Montgomery was forced to make a virtue out of a very sore necessity. With his British and Canadian forces facing the bulk of the SS panzer divisions, all he could hope to do was to tie them down until the Americans were able to break through in late July, launching Operation Cobra. This drive southwards, parallel to the Atlantic coast, enabled General Patton&apos;s Third Army to break out into Brittany and then swing east towards the Seine. Normandy was devastated by the fighting, but its martyrdom saved the rest of France from serious damage. Amid scenes of the wildest jubilation, General Leclerc&apos;s Second Armoured Division advanced into the centre of Paris on 25 August following a rising by the French resistance. De Gaulle had feared disorder not far short of civil war if communist groups tried to seize power. At the same time, Stalin did not want the Americans provoked by insurrectionary disorders in France behind their frontlines, in case they blamed the Soviet Union and cut off lend-lease supplies in retaliation. Jacques Duclos, the Comintern veteran, accordingly reined in the French Communist party. Stalin also felt that in exchange for his discouragement of revolution in France, the western allies should allow him a free hand in Poland. De Gaulle&apos;s main fear was that any disturbance would give the Americans the opportunity to impose Amgot \u2013 the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories \u2013 on France. Roosevelt distrusted him and American commanders suspected that the French were more interested in their own politics than in carrying on the war against Nazi Germany. They were also sickened by the readiness of many French to denounce neighbours and rivals as collaborators and by the head-shaving of Frenchwomen accused of collaboration horizontale with German occupiers. The French, for their part, did not appreciate the naive arrogance displayed by many American soldiers and their evident belief that almost any woman could be bought. Mutual suspicions and resentments from this time were to sully Franco-American relations for far longer than anyone could have imagined at the time. On the eastern front, meanwhile, the Red Army had launched Operation Bagration in Belorussia with 1.2 million men on 22 June. Hitler was taken completely by surprise. Tricked by a Soviet deception plan, he had switched forces to the south. Ten days later, Soviet forces entered Minsk, then, on 13 July, they took the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. That same day, Marshal Konev launched an attack from the Ukraine towards the southern Polish city of Lvov. And on 21 July, the Soviet Union announced the formation of a Polish committee of national liberation. The Polish government-in-exile in London denounced this as the first step towards imposing a puppet administration under Soviet control. On 1 August, with Marshal Rokossovsky&apos;s forces on the Vistula opposite Warsaw, the Polish &quot;Home Army&quot; rose in revolt against the German troops defending the Polish capital. They hoped to seize the city as a base for the government-in-exile and thus pre-empt the imposition of a Soviet dictatorship. The Polish resistance was encouraged to rise against the Germans by broadcasts from Moscow, but it soon became clear that Stalin wanted the Home Army to be destroyed. Already in the areas of Poland occupied by the Red Army, the NKVD and Smersh were arresting non-communists as &quot;saboteurs&quot; or &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;. Rokossovsky&apos;s armies waited east of the Vistula, while the Germans brought in SS units to crush the Polish rising. Stalin, despite the appeals of Churchill and Roosevelt, also refused to allow airfields behind the Soviet front to be used by allied aircraft from Italy trying to drop supplies to the insurgents. Although without hope, the remnants of the Polish Home Army fought on with bitter bravery from the sewers and ruins of Warsaw. They finally surrendered on 2 October. Stalin had let the Germans do his dirty work for him. Euphoria in the west In September, following the liberation of Paris, a mood of heady euphoria infected almost everyone in the west, with the idea that the war would be over by Christmas. The Red Army was close to East Prussia and sweeping into the Balkans. The Romanians had surrendered. The Finns had sought an armistice with the Soviet Union. The British were dashing across Belgium towards Holland, Patton&apos;s Third Army had already reached the Moselle, and in the centre other American forces had crossed the border from Luxembourg on to German soil. On 17 September, Montgomery, with uncharacteristic rashness, ordered paratroop drops on the bridges over the Maas, the Waal and the lower Rhine at Arnhem. The British XXX Corps would charge up the road to relieve them, but constant delays meant that they never got through. Also, British commanders discounted intelligence reports that two SS panzer divisions had recently moved to the area. Operation Market Garden, as it was called, collapsed after 10 days. All the exaggerated optimism earlier in the month evaporated. It was to be a hard winter for the allied troops along the German frontier and in Italy. The Americans were to suffer particularly badly in the fighting for the H\u00fcrtgen forest and combat exhaustion casualties mounted alarmingly. After the Canadians and British had cleared the northern side of the estuary leading to Antwerp, the allies prepared to start using the port. Hitler decided to launch a major counterattack from the Ardennes forests with the aim of recapturing the city. In a typically reckless gamble, he saw this as his best chance of knocking the western allies out of the war. On 16 December, two panzer armies suddenly struck through the snow-covered pine forests, taking the weak American infantry divisions by surprise. Panic and chaos ensued. Allied aircraft were unable to take off in the freezing fog. As the Germans surrounded the key town of Bastogne, General Patton started to move his Third Army north with impressive speed. The battle changed dramatically in the Americans&apos; favour when the German formations began to run out of fuel and the skies cleared to allow allied fighter-bombers to attack at will. It was also a hard winter for the German population, which up to then had lived off the food supplies seized from occupied countries. Berliners, with their black humour, joked at Christmas: &quot;Be practical. Give a coffin.&quot; But they knew that the military situation was desperate, with all males between 16 and 60 called up for service in the Volkssturm militia. They also knew that retribution from the Red Army would be terrible after the Wehrmacht&apos;s &quot;war of annihilation&quot; against the Soviet Union. The Japanese also had little hope. In late October, they had tried to ambush the US Third and Fifth Fleets off the Philippines, but were decisively outfought in the battle of Leyte, which involved no less than 282 warships. The Americans succeeded in sinking the last four Japanese aircraft carriers, and effectively ended the power of the Imperial Japanese navy. Meanwhile, American bombers had begun to attack Japanese cities. Their Asian empire was crumbling. The Americans were fighting hard to evict the remaining Japanese troops from the Philippines while the British 14th Army advanced down into Burma. On 12 January 1945, the great Soviet winter offensive began against East Prussia and along the line of the Vistula. Warsaw was taken and Soviet tank armies charged forward in a headlong advance all the way to the river Oder, just 60 miles from Berlin. To the south, Marshal Konev&apos;s armies seized Silesia and advanced to the river Neisse. Nazi gauleiters refused to allow German civilians to flee, in many cases until it was too late. Some 8.5 million refugees from East Prussia, West Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia sought safety in the Reich, travelling on &quot;treks&quot; in farm carts and on foot through heavy snow. Others were evacuated in cattle trucks or on ships organised by the German navy from Baltic ports. More than 7,000 drowned when the liner Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine. During this massive migration, some half a million civilians are said to have died, and the fate of those women and girls caught by the Red Army was appalling, especially those trapped in East Prussia. Even greater suffering was endured by concentration camp inmates, forced in inadequate clothing and without food on to death marches back towards Germany. Any who collapsed from the cold, exhaustion or starvation were shot on the spot by their SS guards. The Soviet advances had been so rapid that in most cases the SS had not been\u00a0able to destroy much of the evidence of their crimes. On 27 January 1945, reconnaissance troops from Konev&apos;s armies came across Auschwitz, where a few hundred of the sickest prisoners\u00a0had been left behind. They stared in disbelief at the skeletal figures, barely alive. Fall of Budapest While Marshal Zhukov regrouped his forces on the Oder during February and Marshal Rokossovsky started to clear Pomerania, the Hungarian capital of Budapest finally fell to Soviet forces after a bloody siege. In the rear areas behind Red Army lines, NKVD rifle regiments and Smersh detachments hunted down not only German sympathisers, but anyone who might oppose Soviet rule. Although the Yalta conference early in February had ended in optimism, Churchill was soon horrified to hear of the repression carried out against non-communists. At Yalta it had been agreed that representatives of the Polish government-in-exile should have talks with the Soviet-backed Lublin administration, but they were arrested and imprisoned by the NKVD despite their safe-conduct passes. Protests to Stalin produced angrily dismissive responses. Roosevelt, already very ill at Yalta, was interested only in forming the United Nations organisation to guarantee a postwar peace. He had barely a month to live. Churchill was increasingly preoccupied by the Soviet domination of central Europe. In October 1944, in an attempt to preserve Greece, he had made the so-called &quot;percentage agreement&quot;, tacitly conceding to Stalin most of the Balkans, but excluding Greece. He had flown to Greece just before Christmas as British troops fought off communist ELAS guerrillas trying to seize control. Churchill had underestimated how much the Greek royal family was disliked, and a bitter civil war followed, but his tenacity at least saved Greece from becoming a Soviet satellite. At Yalta, the Soviet Union also agreed to join the war against Japan as soon as Germany was defeated. The United States and Britain, shaken by the suicidal defence of Pacific islands, feared that storming Japan would cost up to half a million allied casualties. At that stage, nobody knew whether the new atomic bomb would work. In the meantime, General Curtis LeMay stepped up his bombing attacks. On the night of 9 March, he sent his Superfortress squadrons on a fire-bombing raid against Tokyo. The mainly wooden houses blazed into an inferno. It is estimated that 97,000 people died, 125,000 were injured and 1 million left homeless. On 6 April, US forces landed on Okinawa to seize it as a springboard for the invasion of Japan itself. In Europe, the war was coming to a close. The western allies were across the Rhine and advancing towards the river Elbe when, on 16 April, the Red Army unleashed &quot;the Berlin Operation&quot;. From Stettin on the Baltic to the Czech border, 23 Soviet armies with 2.5 million men opened a massive artillery barrage. Yet despite their overwhelming strength, Zhukov&apos;s 1st Belorussian Front took six days before its artillery was within range of Berlin. Stalin had insisted on encircling the city first to make sure that the Americans would not get there beforehand from their bridgehead across the Elbe. But Eisenhower had decided to hold back his forces, to Churchill&apos;s exasperation. As Soviet forces closed in on the centre of Berlin, Hitler committed suicide with his new wife, Eva Braun, on 30 April. The leadership of the Nazi state was transferred to Grand Admiral D\u00f6nitz in Flensburg, but his was a phantom government. The final surrender was signed in Berlin at midnight on 8 May. Overwhelming problems Although the Americans wanted to wind down their forces in Europe and switch them to the far east, the problems of a devastated Germany remained overwhelming. The first priority was to care for the survivors of concentration camps, whose conditions sickened allied troops. There were up to 20 million displaced persons, including more than a quarter of a million Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, who needed transport home or accommodation. In the far east, the Japanese defence of Okinawa continued until 21 June with fanatical intensity, while kamikaze pilots attacked the US navy offshore. The Americans had suffered 50,000 casualties. Plans for an invasion of Japan were put on hold after the first atomic bomb was tested successfully in New Mexico on 16 July. Two days later the allied leaders met at Potsdam. President Truman conveyed the news of the bomb to Stalin, who already knew\u00a0of its existence through his\u00a0spies. The Japanese rejected calls to surrender, so on 6 August, the first atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Three days later another was dropped on Nagasaki. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan and began to invade Manchuria. On 14 August, the Japanese agreed to surrender unconditionally and the final ceremony took place in Tokyo Bay on 2 September aboard the US battleship Missouri. It was in Europe, however, where the tensions between the Soviet Union and the western allies would grow into the cold war, despite all of Roosevelt&apos;s hopes. An &quot;iron curtain&quot; had indeed come down, with all democratic parties behind it ruthlessly crushed by Stalinist power.

However, 1945 was different, so different that it has been called Year Zero. The capacity for destruction had been so much greater than in the earlier war that much of Europe and Asia lay in ruins. And this time civilians had been the target as much as the military. The figures are hard to grasp: as many as 60 million dead, 25 million of them Soviet. A new word, genocide, entered the language to deal with the murder of 6 million of Europe&apos;s Jews by the Nazis. During the war, millions more had fled their homes or been forcibly moved to work in Germany or Japan or, in the case of the Soviet Union, because Stalin feared that they might be traitors. Now, in 1945, another new word appeared, the DP, or &quot;displaced person&quot;. There were millions of them, some voluntary refugees moving westward in the face of the advancing Red Army, others deported as undesirable minorities. The newly independent Czech state expelled nearly 3 million ethnic Germans in the years after 1945, and Poland a further 1.3 million. Everywhere there were lost or orphaned children, 300,000 alone in Yugoslavia. Thousands of unwanted babies added to the misery. It is impossible to know how many women in Europe were raped by the Red Army soldiers, who saw them as part of the spoils of war, but in Germany alone some 2 million women had abortions every year between 1945 and 1948. The allies did what they could to feed and house the refugees and to reunite families that had been forcibly torn apart, but the scale of the task and the obstacles were enormous. The majority of ports in Europe and many in Asia had been destroyed or badly damaged; bridges had been blown up; railway locomotives and rolling stock had vanished. Great cities such as Warsaw, Kiev, Tokyo and Berlin were piles of rubble and ash. In Germany, it has been estimated, 70% of housing had gone and, in the Soviet Union, 1,700 towns and 70,000 villages. Factories and workshops were in ruins, fields, forests and vineyards ripped to pieces. Millions of acres in north China were flooded after the Japanese destroyed the dykes. Many Europeans were surviving on less than 1,000 calories per day; in the Netherlands they were eating tulip bulbs. Apart from the United States and allies such as Canada and Australia, who were largely unscathed\u00a0by the war&apos;s destruction, the European powers such as Britain and France had precious little to spare. Britain had largely bankrupted itself fighting the war and France had been stripped bare by the Germans. They were struggling to look after their own peoples and deal with reincorporating their military into civilian society. The four horsemen of the apocalypse \u2013 pestilence, war, famine and death \u2013 so familiar during the middle ages, appeared again in the modern world. New &apos;superpowers&apos; Politically, the impact of the war was also great. The once great powers of Japan and Germany looked as though they would never rise again. In retrospect, of course, it is easy to see that their peoples, highly educated and skilled, possessed the capacity to rebuild their shattered societies. (And it may have been easier to build strong economies from scratch than the partially damaged ones of the victors.) Two powers, so great that the new term &quot;superpower&quot; had to be coined for them, dominated the world in 1945. The United States was both a military power and an economic one; the Soviet Union had only brute force and the intangible attraction of Marxist ideology to keep its own people down and manage its newly acquired empire in the heart of Europe. The great European empires, which had controlled so much of the world, from Africa to Asia, were on their last legs and soon to disappear in the face of their own weakness and rising nationalist movements. We should not view the war as being responsible for all of this, however; the rise of the US and the Soviet Union and the weakening of the European empires had been happening long before 1939. The war acted as an accelerator. It also accelerated change in other ways: in science and technology, for example. The world got atomic weapons but it also got atomic power. Under the stimulus of war, governments poured resources into developing new medicines and technologies. Without the war, it would have taken us much longer, if\u00a0ever, to enjoy the benefits of penicillin, microwaves, computers \u2013 the list goes on. In many countries, social change also speeded up. The shared suffering and sacrifice of the war years strengthened the belief in most democracies that governments had an obligation to provide basic care for all citizens. When it was elected in the summer of 1945, for example, the Labour government in Britain moved rapidly to establish the welfare state. The rights of women also took a huge step forward as their contribution to the war effort, and their share in the suffering, were recognised. In France and Italy, women finally got the vote. If class divisions in Europe and Asia did not disappear, the moral authority and prestige of the ruling classes had been severely undermined by their failure to prevent the war or the crimes that they had condoned before and during it. Established political orders \u2013 fascist, conservative, even democratic \u2013 came under challenge as peoples looked for new ideas and leaders. In Germany and Japan, democracy slowly took root. In China, people turned increasingly from the corrupt and incompetent nationalists to the communists. While many Europeans, wearied by years of war and privation, gave up on politics altogether and faced the future with glum pessimism, others hoped that, at last, the time had come to build a new and better society. In western Europe, voters turned to social democratic parties such as the Labour party in Britain. In the east, the new communist regimes that were imposed by the triumphant Soviet Union were at first welcomed by many as the agents of change. The end of the war inevitably also brought a settling of scores. In many parts people took measures into their own hands. Collaborators were beaten, lynched or shot. Women who had fraternised with German soldiers had their heads shaved or worse. Governments sometimes followed suit, setting up special courts for those who had worked with the enemy and purging such bodies as the civil service and the police. The Soviets also tried to exact reparations from Germany and Japan; whole factories were dismantled down to the window frames and were carted off to the Soviet Union, where they frequently rotted away. Much of the revenge was to gain advantage in the postwar world. In China and eastern Europe the communists used the accusation of collaboration with the Japanese or the Nazis to eliminate their political and class enemies. German de-Nazification The allies instituted an ambitious programme of de-Nazification in Germany, later quietly abandoned as it became clear that German society would be unworkable if all former Nazis were forbidden to work. In\u00a0Japan, the head of the occupation, General Douglas MacArthur, broke up the zaibatsu, the big conglomerates that were blamed for supporting the Japanese militarists, and introduced a range of reforms, from a new school curriculum to a democratic constitution, that were designed to turn Japan into a peaceable democratic nation. In both Germany and Japan, the victors set up special tribunals to try those responsible for crimes against peace, war crimes, and the catalogue of horrors that came increasingly to be known as &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. In Tokyo, leading Japanese generals and politicians, and at Nuremberg, senior Nazis (those that had not committed suicide or escaped), stood in the dock before allied judges. Not a few people then and since wondered if the trials were merely victors&apos; justice, their moral authority undercut by the presence, in Nuremberg, of judges and prosecutors from Stalin&apos;s murderous regime, and by the fact that in Tokyo, the emperor, in whose name the crimes had been committed, was shielded from blame. The trials, inconclusive though they were, formed part of a larger attempt to root out the militaristic and chauvinistic attitudes that had helped to produce the war, and to build a new world order that would prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again. Well before the war had ended, the allies had started planning for the peace. Among the western powers, the United States, by 1945 very much the dominant partner in the alliance, took the lead. In his Four Freedoms speech of January 1941, President Roosevelt talked of a new and more just world, with freedom of speech and expression and of religion, and freedom from want and fear. In the Atlantic charter later that year, he and Churchill sketched out a world order based on such liberal principles as collective security, national self-determination, and free trade among nations. A host of other allies, some of them represented by governments in exile, signed on. The Soviet Union gave a qualified assent, although its leader Stalin had no intention of following what were to him alien principles. Roosevelt intended that the American vision should take solid institutional form. The key organisation was the United Nations, designed to be stronger than the League of Nations, which it was replacing, and the economic ones known collectively as the Bretton Woods system, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Trade\u00a0and Tariffs.\u00a0This time, Roosevelt was determined, the United States should join. Stalin again gave grudging\u00a0support. Common humanity While much of what Roosevelt hoped for did not come about, it was surely a\u00a0step forward for international relations that such institutions were created and largely accepted and, equally important, that they were underpinned by notions of a common humanity possessing the same universal rights. The idea that there were universal standards to be upheld was present, no matter how imperfectly, in the war crimes trials, and was later reinforced by the establishment of the United Nations itself in 1945, the International Court of Justice in 1946 and Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. It had already become clear at the top-level conferences of Teheran (1943), Yalta (February 1945) and Potsdam\u00a0(July-August 1945) that there was a gulf in what constituted universal\u00a0values and goals between the United States and its fellow democracies and the Soviet Union. Stalin was interested above all in security for his regime and for the Soviet Union, and that to him meant taking territory, from Poland and other neighbours, and establishing a ring of buffer states around Soviet borders. In the longer run, where the western powers saw a democratic and liberal world, he dreamed of a communist\u00a0one. The grand alliance held together uneasily for the first months of the peace, but the strains were evident in their shared occupation of Germany, where increasingly the Soviet zone of occupation was moving in a communist direction and the western zones, under Britain, France and the United States, in a more capitalist and democratic one. By 1947, two very different German societies were emerging. In addition, the western powers watched with growing consternation and alarm the elimination of non-communist political forces in eastern Europe and the establishment of Peoples&apos; Republics under the thumb of the Soviet Union. Soviet pressure on its neighbours, from Norway in the north to Turkey and Iran in the south, along with Soviet spy rings and Soviet-inspired sabotage in western countries, further deepened western concerns. For their part, Soviet leaders looked on western talk of such democratic procedures as free elections in eastern Europe as Trojan horses designed to undermine their control of their buffer states, and regarded the Marshall plan, which funnelled American aid into Europe, as a cover for extending the grip of capitalism. Furthermore, their own Marxist-Leninist analysis of history told them that sooner or later the capitalist powers would turn on the Soviet Union. Within two years of second world war&apos;s end, the cold war was an established fact. Both sides built military alliances and prepared for the new shooting war that many feared was bound to come. In 1949, the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb, giving it parity, at least in that area, with the United States. That the cold war did not in the end turn into a hot one was thanks to that fact. The terrifying new power of atomic weapons was to lead to a standoff suitably known as Mad \u2013 Mutually Assured Destruction. The cold war overshadowed another momentous international change that came as a result of the second world war. Before 1939 much of the non-European world had been divided up among the great empires: the ones based in western Europe but also those of Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan and Italy lost their empires as a result of defeat. Britain, France, and the Netherlands all saw their imperial possessions disappear in the years immediately after the war. (The Soviet Union was not to lose its until the end of the cold war.) Empires crumble The former imperial powers no longer had the financial and military capacity to hang on to their vast territories. Nor did their peoples want to pay the price of empire, whether in money or blood. Furthermore, where the empires had once dealt with divided or acquiescent peoples, they now increasingly faced assertive and, in some cases, well-armed nationalist movements. The defeat of European forces all over Asia also contributed to destroying the myth of European power. The British pulled out of India in 1947, leaving behind two new countries\u00a0of India and Pakistan. Burma,\u00a0Sri Lanka and Malaysia followed\u00a0the road of independence not long after. The Dutch fought a losing war but finally conceded independence\u00a0to Indonesia, the former Dutch East Indies, in 1949. France tried to regain its colonies in Indochina but was forced out in 1954 after a humiliating defeat at the hands\u00a0of Vietnamese forces. The Europeans&apos; African empires crumbled in the 1950s and early 1960s. The United Nations grew from 51 nations in 1945 to 189 by the end of the century. Because of the cold war, there was no comprehensive peace settlement after the second world war as there had been in 1919. Instead there were a number of separate agreements or ad hoc decisions. In Europe most of the borders that had been established at the end of the first world war were\u00a0restored. The Soviet Union seized back some bits of territory such as Bessarabia, which it had lost to Romania in 1919. The one major exception was Poland, as the joke had it &quot;a country on wheels&quot;, which moved some 200 miles to the west, losing some 69,000 sq metres to the Soviet Union and gaining slightly less from Germany in the west. In the east, Japan of course lost the conquests it had made since 1931, but was also obliged to disgorge Korea and Formosa (now Taiwan) and the Pacific islands that it had gained decades earlier. Eventually the United States and Japan concluded a formal peace in 1951. Because of an outstanding dispute over some islands, the Soviet Union and its successor Russia have not yet signed a peace treaty ending the war with Japan. Remembering the war We have long since absorbed and dealt with the physical consequences of the second world war, but it still remains a very powerful set of memories. How societies remember and commemorate the past often says something about how they see themselves \u2013 and can be highly contentious. Particularly in divided societies, it is tempting to cling to comforting myths to help bring unity and to paper over deep and painful divisions. In the years immediately after 1945, many societies chose to forget the war or remember it only in certain ways. Austria portrayed itself as the first victim of Nazism, conveniently ignoring the active support that so many Austrians had given the Nazi regime. In Italy, the fascist past was neglected in favour of the earlier periods of Italian history. For a long time, schools did not teach any history after the first world war. Italians were portrayed in films or books as essentially good-hearted and generally opposed to Mussolini, whose regime was an aberration in an otherwise liberal state. In France, the Vichy period, after France&apos;s defeat by Germany, when there was widespread French collaboration, some of it enthusiastically antisemitic and pro-Nazi, was similarly ignored. From de Gaulle onwards, French leaders played up the resistance in such a way as to claim its moral authority but also to imply that it was more broadly based and widespread than it actually was. West Germany was not able to escape its past so easily; under pressure from the allies and from within, it dealt much more thoroughly with its Nazi past. In West German schools, children learned about the horrors committed by the regime. East Germany, by contrast, took no responsibility, instead blaming the Nazis on capitalism. Indeed, many East Germans grew up believing that their country had fought with the Soviet Union against Hitler&apos;s regime. In the east, Japan has been accused of ignoring its aggression in the 1930s and its own war crimes in China and elsewhere, but in recent years it has moved to teach more about this dark period in its history. How should the past be remembered?\u00a0When should we forget? These are not\u00a0easy questions. Acknowledging such difficult parts of the past is not always easy and has led to history becoming a political football in a number of countries. In Japan, the conservatives minimise Japanese responsibility for the war and downplay atrocities on nationalist grounds. Japan, they argue, should not apologise for the past when all powers were guilty of aggression. It has not necessarily been easier among the nations on the winning side. When French and foreign historians first began examining the Vichy period in France critically, they were attacked from both the right and the left for stirring up memories that were best left undisturbed. When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was, for a time, a willingness among Russians to acknowledge that many crimes were committed in Stalin&apos;s regime in the course of the war, whether the mass murder of Polish army officers at Katyn or the forcible deportation of innocent Soviet citizens to Siberia. Today, the conservatives argue that such criticism of the great patriotic war only gives comfort to Russia&apos;s foes. Britain and Canada played a major role in the mass bombing campaign of German cities and towns; suggestions that the destruction of Dresden or other targets that may have had little military significance might be war crimes causes impassioned debate in both countries. That the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have been morally wrong or unnecessary causes equal controversy in the United States. Today, particularly in the countries that were on the winning side, there is a reluctance to disturb our generally positive memories of the war by facing such issues. The second world war, especially in the light of what came after, seems to be the last morally unambiguous war. The Nazis and their allies were bad and they did evil things. The allies were good and right to fight them. That is true, but the picture is not quite as black and white as we might like to think. After all, one ally was the Soviet Union, in its own way as guilty of crimes against humanity as Nazi Germany, fascist Italy or Japan. Britain and France may have been fighting for liberty, but they were not prepared to extend it to their empires. And Dresden, or the firebombing of Hamburg, Tokyo and Berlin, the forcible repatriation of Soviet prisoners of war, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, should remind us that bad things can be done in the name of good causes. Let us remember the war, but let us not remember it simplistically but in all its complexity.

About 3,000 visitors a day will be able to take a tour of the \u00a378m, eight-storey building and inspect the 17m insects and 3m plant specimens on show. The most exciting prospect, though, is that 200 working scientists will be &quot;on display&quot; too. The Darwin Centre is an inspired and much needed attempt to bring the public closer to science and, in particular, to those who explore the boundaries of our scientific knowledge. I hope to be among those queueing for an early ticket. But while I applaud the museum&apos;s efforts to raise awareness of the work of scientists, particularly those studying the ever rising number of endangered insects, the opening of the centre also serves as a reminder that nowhere on the planet can you yet queue up to enter a major institutional museum solely dedicated to the environment. Considering that our understanding of the biosphere and, crucially, our increasingly troubled existence within it is now regularly billed as humanity&apos;s most pressing concern, it seems somewhat perverse that the foundation stone for a museum of the environment, for want of a better name, has yet to be laid in any of the world&apos;s great cities. London, for example, is among the most visited cities in the world, and boasts some of the greatest museums of all \u2013 Tate Modern, the British Museum, the Imperial War Museum, the Natural History Museum, the National Gallery and the V&amp;A, to name a few. But if you want to stretch your understanding of our own species&apos; problematic relationship with the natural environment, you currently cannot do so under one roof. Instead, you need to perform a somewhat disjointed and inconvenient dance across London. You could start at the Natural History Museum and marvel at how the natural world has evolved over the millennia before you cross over to the Science Museum next door to take a tour of its &quot;Fuelling the Future&quot; gallery. You might then head to the Museum of London for some timely reminders that there were times in the not too distant past when the capital&apos;s environment was in a truly shocking state. London did, until recently, also host a Museum of Mankind in Piccadilly, which offered all manner of anthropological insights, but this collection has now been subsumed back into the British Museum. But surely there is now a compelling and pressing need to bring all these important strands together \u2013 in addition to many others, such as, say, the history of environmentalism, and the rise (and fall?) of the western lifestyle \u2013 and offer them at a single-site educational visitor attraction. There is ample room in our cultural landscape for such an institution. In fact, there&apos;s a strong argument to say we urgently need just such a focal point to remind us of the task ahead. Many institutions around the world are documenting certain storylines \u2013 a year-long exhibition entitled Climate Change: The Threat to Life and a New Energy Future has just come to an end at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, for example \u2013 but not one has this important task as its mission statement. We need somewhere that documents the impact that industrial-scale food production is having on the environment; we need somewhere that records the implications of an exponentially rising global population; we need somewhere that records the lives and achievements of the great environmental visionaries, campaigners and pioneers, ranging from John Muir and Henry Thoreau right up to Rachel Carson and Wangari Maathai; we need somewhere that charts our slow awakening to the implications of climate change; and we need somewhere that never lets us forget some of the world&apos;s worst environmental disasters and follies, such as Bhopal, Exxon Valdez, Chernobyl, and the ongoing destruction of our rainforests. Perhaps a bricks-and-mortar museum is not the required route. Maybe we need an extensive online museum dedicated to this subject, built and maintained by a coalition of institutions and benefactors across the world, so that people, wherever they are located, can benefit from its resources and scholarship. After all, encouraging people to fly to, say, London, New York or Tokyo to visit such a museum wouldn&apos;t exactly chime with its core message. Or maybe a global franchise should be launched, so that like-minded institutions are constructed across the world in the way that we now have an international network of Guggenheims. We live in an age where our interaction with the world around us is both fraught and volatile. We need all the tools we can muster to teach and inspire us.

His lemon-flavoured oil is good enough to drink on its own. 76 Compton Street, London EC1, 020 7251 4721, www.planet mem.com And Manni One of the priciest olive oils in the world, the minimum order of a litre of Manni costs \u00a3190. Film director Armando Manni harvests olives from seven plantations at different altitudes on a Tuscan mountain and speed-couriers the oil in small, UV-resistant bottles. The flavours are extraordinary. Chef Thomas Keller, of The French Laundry and Per Se, has called it &quot;the best olive oil in the market&quot;.

Best place to eat: TacosEl Pastorcito, Mexico City People drive the length and breadth of Mexico City, causing traffic jams, to get to this neighbourhood taqueria, which spills out onto the street from dusk till dawn. The main draw is their superlative tacos al pastor \u2013 a speciality of the capital \u2013 made with pork carved from a shawarma-style spit and ultra-fresh salsa served in dramatically massive stone bowls. 4503 Lorenzo Boturini Street, 24 de Abril, Mexico City, Mexico, 0051 55 5764 1185, www.elpastorcitodeboturini.com 22. Best place to eat: Peking DuckQuanjude, Beijing Beijing&apos;s most famous purveyor of Peking duck is nothing if not well-endorsed: more than 115 million ducks have been dished up in the restaurant&apos;s 145-year history, and China&apos;s first Premier, Zhou Enlai, personally chose the location for the seven-storey Hepingmen branch. Quantity hasn&apos;t affected quality: the duck, with its crispy red skin and melt-in-the-mouth flesh, is sublime \u2013 400 versions of the classic dish are available: opt for the classic kaoya.

Photograph: Neville Elder/Corbis    &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, the Gramercy Tavern is one of the best places to eat in New York, and the best place to eat pig.

Best place to eat: Vegetarian IndianSagar Ratna, Delhi &quot;Sagar Ratna, in Delhi, serves South Indian vegetarian food \u2013 pukka food that nourishes the body and soul and is always in harmony with the seasons.

Best place to eat: SushiDaiwa sushi, Tokyo If you want the world&apos;s best sushi, don&apos;t even think of looking anywhere but Japan. Empty your bank account and eat at one of Tokyo&apos;s swankiest sushi temples, such as the three-Michelin-star Jiro in Ginza. Alternatively, go right to the heart of the action, to the city&apos;s overwhelming Tsukiji fish market (the largest on the planet), and eat unsurpassable sushi for a fraction of the price at Daiwa Sushi. It&apos;s a fast-moving hole-in-the-wall establishment without tables and it&apos;s only open for breakfast, but none of this matters once the expertly prepared rolls come your way. Try the melt-in-the-mouth tai, a type of sea bream that is impossible to get outside Japan. Building 6, Chuo-ichiba, 5-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, 0081 3 3547 6807 26.

We always eat bulalo (beef stew), banana heart salad, adobo (marinaded meat), baked oysters, pancit noodles, lechon de leche (suckling pig) and, to drink, green mango juice \u2013 my daughter is addicted to it! The staff are so friendly and welcoming.

Best place to eat: Algerian foodRestaurant Gnaoua, Algiers &quot;To get a really good North African meal in Algeria you have to get yourself invited to someone&apos;s house, and as there are so few tourists, people would love to have you to their home for a meal. The few restaurants around tend to serve bad French food. That said, there is a handful of really good grilled-fish restaurants down in the port in Algiers. My favourite is a small, traditional place called Restaurant Gnaoua. The owner, Hamidou, understands Algerian cuisine. It&apos;s not an easy cuisine to get, but he just does.&quot; Cite Sahraoui, les Deux Bassins, Ben Aknoun, Algiers, Algeria 29. Best place to eat: Classic French cuisine, Close des Gourmets, Paris &quot;I eat at Clos Des Gourmets two or three times a week when I&apos;m in Paris. They only use seasonal ingredients and always add a touch of wackiness to very classic dishes. They love creating new things. I suppose it&apos;s new classic French cuisine. I&apos;ll have roast kidneys or grilled rabbit with fresh herbs in a white wine sauce, asparagus with truffle in early summer, and a lavender cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to finish. It&apos;s always madly busy but the dishes are always perfectly cooked. And it&apos;s amazingly cheap: \u00a480 for three courses with wine.

Best place to eat: PizzaFrank Pepe Pizzeria, New Haven, Conneticut You could generate enough heat to fuel a brick oven with the argument over which country bakes the world&apos;s best pizza: Italy, where the concept originated, or America, where it was globalised. Neapolitan purists will make pilgrimages to hotspots such as La Sorrentina, outside Naples, whose chef has won the prestigious Naples Pizza Championship, but we contend that the upstart Yanks do it better. The best American pizza can be found, not in New York as is commonly assumed, but in New Haven, Connecticut, where the Pepe family has been spinning dough since 1925. Their white clam pie has no equals. 157 Wooster Street, New Haven, Connecticut, 001 203 865 5762, www.pepespizzeria.com Pizzeria La Sorrentina, Via Domenico Pirozzi 37, Fratta Maggiore, Italy, 0039 338 3248615 32. Best place to eat: Thai curryKrua Apsorn, Bangkok &quot;When I&apos;m in Bangkok, I go to Apsorn&apos;s Kitchen, also known as Krua Apsorn, a small restaurant just up from the National Library.

It has fantastic wine cellars with local wines that people would never have heard of.&quot; 97 rue Battant, Besan\u00e7on, France, 0033 3 81 81 48 18 34. Best place to eat: Ice creamCorrado Costanzo, Noto, Sicily The legend about Romans making the earliest ice creams from the snows of Mount Etna may be apocryphal, but Sicily is still the best place for frozen treats in gelato-crazed Italy, and Italian ice cream, as everybody knows, is the finest in the world. (Gelato is made with considerably less butterfat than the heavier American variants, for starters.) Corrado Costanzo&apos;s pastry shop can be found in the crumbling baroque town of Noto, in the south-eastern corner of the island. We defy you to find an ice better than his transcendent mandarin-orange granita. Via Silvio Spaventa 7, Noto, Sicily, 0039 931 835 243 35. Best place to eat: KebabsBade Miya, Mumbai An entire Mumbai street gets overrun, nightly, by pilgrims to an unassuming grilled-food vendor on a pavement behind the Taj Hotel. People hunch over rickety outdoor tables, or the hoods of their cars, to gorge on cheap, basic but spectacular kebabs, roti rolls and drumsticks hot from the grill. The chicken tangdi kebab is especially delicious. Tulloch Road, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai, India 36. Best place to eat: RavioliBabbo, New York &quot;I love the oxtail ravioli with black truffles and pigeon liver sauce at Babbo in New York, my favourite restaurant.

Best place to eat: PrawnsCasa Bigote, Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain &quot;The logo of this restaurant is actually a prawn, and they get their seafood from little dayboats. They serve the local Sanlucar prawn, which is mild and sweet, a bit like a tiger prawn but pinker. They do mantis shrimps too \u2013 prehistoric-looking things which taste like white crab meat. They steam them, and really needn&apos;t do anything else.&quot; Restaurante Casa Bigote, Bajo de Guia, 10, Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, C\u00e1diz, Andaluc\u00eda, 0034 956 36 26 96/956 36 32 42 38. Best place to eat: CurrywurstKonnopke&apos;s Imbiss, Berlin The German obsession with currywurst \u2013 800m portions of chopped sausage with sweet curry sauce are consumed each year \u2013 reaches its zenith in Berlin, where countless diners and roadside stalls vie for the currywurst crown. It&apos;s hard to improve on Konnopke&apos;s, which has been serving superlative sausage since 1930 under raised train tracks in Prenzlauerberg. Consume with fries and a cold bottle of Berliner Pilsner for maximum impact. Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee 44a, Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin, 0049 30 442 7765, www.konnopke-imbiss.de 39. Best place to eat: HamCasas, Aracena, Spain &quot;Aracena, 40 minutes north of Seville, feels like a frontier town, because north of it is an area the size of Wales of nonstop forest. Here groups of men disappear for months at a time harvesting the cork bark and tending the oak so the iberico pig may gorge on acorns. Black foot ham from nearby Jabugo is some of the finest in the country, and there is nothing better than sitting down in any of the bars and restaurants in Aracena to a plate of this rich delicacy, sliced and served with unpretentious understanding. Last time we were there we had a memorable revueltos (scrambled eggs) with setas (local wild mushrooms) and jam\u00f3n at Casas.&quot; Calle Colmenetas 41, Aracena, Huelva, Spain, 0034 959/128044 40. Best place to eat: Chocolate cakePierre Herme, Paris &quot;When Pierre Herm\u00e9 first let me try his heart-shaped Chuao cake, made with blackcurrants and a chuao couverture from Pralus, I totally forgot where I was. It was a firework of aromas, temperatures and textures. The freshness of the fruit flirted with the roundness of the chocolate. Herm\u00e9 is a genius \u2013 one of my chocolate gods. The cake is seasonal and available on demand, and now made with Valrhona, but it is still my favourite in the world.&quot; 72, rue Bonaparte, Paris, 0033 01 43 54 47 77, www.pierreherme.com 41.

It was super-tender and crunchy on the outside. The flavours were incredibly intense \u2013 the juice had been flavoured with rosemary, garlic and olive oil. The best time to eat octopus here is May or late September.&quot; Gialos, Symi 85600, Islands, Greece, 0030 22460 72033 43. Best place to eat: BouillabaisseRestaurant de Bacon, Antibes, France &quot;The most powerful experience I ever had with a bouillabaisse (Proven\u00e7al fish stew) was at this restaurant by the sea in Antibes. The place itself is nothing fancy but it&apos;s very famous for this dish, and people travel a long way for it. They kill you with the price \u2013 it costs an arm and a leg \u2013 but it&apos;s worth it. They use fish from the region that&apos;s been caught that same morning, and bouillabaisse is their speciality: they do it better than anyone else on this planet.

Best place to eat: PastaTrattoria Caprini, Verona, Italy &quot;This little restaurant in Verona makes the most beautiful pasta in the traditional way, rolling it into wafer thin sheets before cutting it into the various shapes. The pasta is rich and eggy with a slightly tough texture that ensures that it doesn&apos;t turn sloppy when cooked. We went recently and loved the pasta so much we bought some back for the chefs at the restaurant. It was so delicious that they ate it with just some olive oil \u2013 the pasta spoke for itself.&quot; 9 Via Paolo Zanotti, Torbe di Negrar di Volpolicella, Verona, Italy, 0039 0457500511, www.trattoriacaprini.it 46. Best place to eat: CevicheSankuay, Lima, Peru The ceviche craze has gone global in recent years (it now graces the menu at London&apos;s Nobu), but to really experience Peru&apos;s national dish of raw fish cured in lime juice and hot pepper, you have to venture into the backstreets of Lima. The title of best cebecheria is hotly contested in the Peruvian capital. Javier Wong&apos;s Sankuay undoubtedly has the greatest sense of theatre. There&apos;s no sign outside, and the building in the anonymous Balconcillo district turns out to be the chef&apos;s own home. There are only 10 tables, and no menu. Wong&apos;s cebiche, made with lenguado (a type of sole) and accompanied by octopus discs rather than the usual choclo (white maize) and camote (sweet potato), is out of this world.

Best place to eat: Dim sumLuk Yu Tea House, Hong Kong &quot;Hong Kong is the best place for dim sum, and Luk Yu Tea House is a Hong Kong institution. It feels very authentic, and the dim sum they do is of an extremely high quality (it&apos;s incredible how they&apos;ve managed to keep both the quality and the authenticity). The menu hasn&apos;t really changed since it opened in 1933. You get things here you won&apos;t get anywhere else. They buy the best Chinese ham and grill it in small slices as an appetiser \u2013 amazing with a glass of red wine. And they still do incredible egg tarts.&quot; 24-26 Stanley Street, Central, Hong Kong, 00852 2523 5464 50. Best place to eat: RamenRamen Jiro, Tokyo &quot;People in Japan always say ramen (Japanese noodle soup) can&apos;t be this and can&apos;t be that. Ramen Jiro is very non-traditional, in your face, take it or leave it. You either love it or hate it, but people who like it are good people. It&apos;s got pork, it&apos;s got cabbage, it&apos;s got garlic, and the sauce is sweet. It&apos;s gnarly.

The \u00a3120,000 bat house has been built at the London Wetland Centre by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust founded by Scott. The only child of Scott of the Antarctic, Scott was born on 14 September, 1909, and was dubbed &quot;conservation&apos;s patron saint&quot; by Sir David Attenborough. The complex of ponds and shallow lakes at the centre in Barnes, west London \u2013 created 10 years ago from a derelict waterworks \u2013 is home to hundreds of native and migrating birds as well as thousands more plant and animal species, including rare moths and butterflies, dragonflies, frogs and water voles. At dusk, bats, increasingly endangered in the south-east, hunt through the mist of insects hovering over the water. Of the 17 native British species of bat, eight have been spotted at Barnes. Along with brass bands, acid house music, bicycles, processions, and tin badges, Deller loves bats. He sees them in trouble, their flight paths disrupted by lighting, their roosts in trees and old buildings vanishing under concrete. He persuaded the Wetland Centre to add a bat house to its wildlife habitats, and organised an international design competition that attracted hundreds of entries from schoolchildren, architects, and members of the public. The sleek, white and modern design is by two architecture students, Jorgen Tandberg from Oslo and Yo Murata from Tokyo, who met at the Architectural Association college in London. It incorporates homes for several species of bats, designed on the advice of the Bat Conservation Trust. The box, which has an invisible black roof to make the interior warmer, is built of Hemcrete, an environmentally friendly mixture of hemp fibre and lime that holds layers of computer-cut fretwork panels, which are not just decorative but incorporate the small, dry, dark spaces bats love. &quot;It&apos;s great,&quot; Deller said. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind living there myself.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The town, a six-hour train ride from Tokyo, is dotted with restaurants serving whale and dolphin sashimi and cetacean iconography appears on everything from the pavements and bridge balustrades to road tunnels and a wind turbine."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Environment", "World news", "Oceans", "Fishing", "Marine life", "Animal welfare", "Whales", "Asia Pacific", "Dolphins", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-14T15:39:22Z", "title": "Dolphin slaughter turns sea red as Japan hunting season returns", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/14/dolphin-slaughter-hunting-japan-taiji", "article": "The tarpaulin covers have been meticulously erected, but they can&apos;t completely mask the brutality of the slaughter unfolding below. Even from the clifftop, it is possible to hear the hunters&apos; voices and the thrashing of tail fins as their prey make a final, fruitless bid for freedom. Occasionally a hunter emerges into the gaps between the covers, grimacing as he plunges his knife into the water. Minutes earlier the sea around him was emerald green. Now it is turning a deep crimson, the morning air tainted with the stench of freshly drawn mammal blood. The gruesome spectacle of dolphins being slaughtered for profit has returned to Taiji, just as international condemnation of the Japanese town&apos;s annual cull reaches a crescendo. At least 100 bottlenose dolphins and 50 pilot whales have been taken in the first hunt of the season, which began on 1 September. Over the next six months the town&apos;s fishermen will catch about 2,300 of Japan&apos;s annual quota of 20,000 dolphins. The meat from a single animal fetches up to 50,000 yen (\u00a3330), but aquariums are prepared to pay up to \u00a390,000 for certain types. In a typical hunt the fishermen pursue pods of dolphins across open seas, banging metal poles together beneath the water to confuse their hypersensitive sonar. The exhausted animals are driven into a large cove sealed off by nets to stop them escaping and dragged backwards into secluded inlets the following morning to be butchered with knives and spears. They are then loaded on to boats and taken to the quayside to be cut up in a warehouse, the fishermen&apos;s work hidden from the outside by heavy shutters. Taiji officials said all the pilot whales caught on this expedition had been killed and their meat put on the market, but added that half of the bottlenose catch would be sold to aquariums and the remainder &quot;set free&quot;, in an apparent attempt to mollify international opinion. It is impossible to verify those claims. The bottlenose dolphins were still penned in close to the shoreline more than 24 hours after they had been captured. Guardian photographs taken covertly during the cull show what appears to be a young bottlenose floating, motionless and belly up, just beyond the slaughter zone. What is clear is that a siege mentality has taken hold in Taiji, an isolated town of 3,500 on the Pacific coast of Wakayama prefecture. Tensions have been rising and the culls conducted in near-secrecy since 2003, when two members of the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd released several dolphins that were being kept in an enclosure ready to be slaughtered. During our visit we were followed at almost every turn, ordered not to take photographs and questioned by the police, who seem to view every foreign visitor as a potential hunt saboteur. None of the residents who agreed to talk would reveal their names, and requests for comments from the town office were ignored. Criticism of the dolphin hunts intensified this summer with the release of the award-winning US documentary The Cove, whose makers used remote-controlled helicopters and hidden underwater cameras to record the hunters at work. The film, with its graphic footage of the dolphin slaughter, sparked outrage after its release in the US and Australia. Last month councillors in the Australian coastal town of Broome suspended its 28-year sister-city relationship with Taiji after receiving thousands of emails protesting at the culls. Taiji is regarded as the spiritual home of Japan&apos;s whaling industry. The first hunts took place in the early 1600s, according to the town&apos;s whaling museum, but the industry went into decline after the introduction of a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. The town, a six-hour train ride from Tokyo, is dotted with restaurants serving whale and dolphin sashimi and cetacean iconography appears on everything from the pavements and bridge balustrades to road tunnels and a wind turbine. Yet in other respects it does not have the feel of a town that takes pride in its traditions. Last week&apos;s pilot whale cull was conducted in inlets shielded on three sides by steep cliffs and dense undergrowth to deter campaigners and journalists. Barriers have been hastily erected along coastal paths that run through publicly owned land. Local fishermen point out that the dolphins and other small cetaceans are not covered by the whaling moratorium. What critics regard as the senseless slaughter of intelligent creatures they see as a legitimate exercise in pest control, blaming dolphins for decimating fish stocks. &quot;People say dolphins are cute and smart, but some regions have a tradition of eating dolphin meat,&quot; said Toshinori Uoya, a fisheries official. &quot;Dolphin-killing may be bad for our international image, but we can&apos;t just issue an order for it to stop.&quot; The hero of the film is Ric O&apos;Barry, a 69-year-old activist who has waged a one-man campaign against Taiji&apos;s dolphin culls for more than a decade. &quot;We have to keep Taiji in the news,&quot; said O&apos;Barry, who trained dolphins for the 1960s TV series Flipper before devoting himself to their conservation. &quot;There is an international tsunami of attention. &quot;I&apos;ve been working with dolphins for most of my life. I watched them give birth. I&apos;ve nursed them back to health. When I see what happens in this cove in Taiji, I want to do something about it.&quot; To many Taiji residents, O&apos;Barry&apos;s comments typify the hypocrisy they say lies at the heart of mounting fury at their centuries-old tradition of killing whales and dolphins. &quot;I think we are the victims of a form of racism,&quot; said one, as we watched the pilot whales being herded out of sight to be killed. &quot;Westerners slaughter cattle and other animals in the most inhumane ways imaginable, but no one says a word. Why is it that only Japan gets this kind of treatment?&quot; The Cove will be released in the UK on 23 October."}, {"sentences": ["In April, the success (\u00a313.6m) of Fast &amp; Furious proves that you can get away with presenting a sequel as a franchise reboot, even when the previous entry (Tokyo Drift) was released as recently as three years ago."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Harry Potter", "3D", "The Dark Knight"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-15T14:00:00Z", "title": "Harry Potter and the lukewarm summer at the UK box office", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/sep/15/box-office-summer-2009", "article": "Summer 2008 UK box office was always going to be hard to beat.

Here are the lessons we learned this summer. Funny sells As industry analysts surveyed the box of goodies at the start of the summer, rich in franchise entries and expensive CGI spectacles, nobody, but nobody, predicted that the fourth-biggest hit of the season (see chart, below) would turn out to be the stag-weekend comedy starring Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms andZach Galifianakis. And yet The Hangover has beaten the latest entries in the Night At The Museum, X-Men, Terminator and Dan Brown/Robert Langdon franchises as well as the reboot of Star Trek. It did so by appealing to women as much as men, and by eventually reaching older audiences after being initially embraced by younger cinemagoers. The Hangover&apos;s \u00a322m gross compares with \u00a313m for Wedding Crashers, and around \u00a38m for both Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. 3D = cash bonanza When My Bloody Valentine 3D opened in January, it occupied all 86 of the UK screens capable of projecting in the innovative digital format. Each successive release (Bolt, Monsters V Aliens, Coraline) saw more and more of the plex chains&apos; inventory scrambling to convert, and by the time Ice Age 3: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs rolled into cinemas, it was able to occupy 237 3D screens (and 488 2D ones). The rewards have been evident: more than half of the film&apos;s \u00a334.6m gross comes from 3D, where ticket prices are at a premium.  That&apos;s more than \u00a310m ahead of the recent efforts from animation power-houses Pixar (WALL-E: \u00a323m) and DreamWorks (Monsters V Aliens: \u00a321m). Ice Age 3 has been the year&apos;s biggest hit in international (non-US) territories, with $640m by the end of summer, as against $611m internationally for top UK title Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, and just $429m internationally for Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen, which was far and away the biggest box-office performer in the US. Family rules Last summer, top two titles Mamma Mia! and The Dark Knight appealed primarily to adults, although of course respective ratings of PG and 12A made the pictures available to children. This time around, it&apos;s family films that rule the roost, with the latest Harry Potter and Ice Age movies contributing \u00a385m between them. Even a second-tier kid flick such as G-Force scored impressively, with \u00a313m in takings so far. The Half-Blood Prince&apos;s \u00a350m gross is more than any of the last three entries in the franchise, and the best since 2002&apos;s Chamber Of Secrets. Brands have value Paramount had seemingly run its Star Trek film franchise into the ground when the tenth entry, 2002&apos;s Nemesis, continued the downward trajectory for grosses established by the likes of 1998&apos;s Insurrection. The property had attracted negative stigma among crucial female and under-25-year-old demographics as the preserve of socially maladjusted middle-aged males. So the JJ Abrams-nurtured repositioning of Star Trek as a sexy, mainstream fun-ride is one of the more accomplished studio resuscitations of recent years. The reboot&apos;s \u00a321m UK gross compares highly favourably with Insurrection&apos;s \u00a37.7m and Nemesis&apos;s \u00a34.8m. In April, the success (\u00a313.6m) of Fast &amp; Furious proves that you can get away with presenting a sequel as a franchise reboot, even when the previous entry (Tokyo Drift) was released as recently as three years ago. The Final Destination 3D (\u00a39.8m in two weeks) has just made the same point. The UK is not America Although Britain is the international territory that&apos;s closest to the North American model, our audiences shouldn&apos;t be taken for granted. GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra was hardly the biggest US hit, with grosses of $141m, but the UK has significantly underperformed that benchmark. By industry rule of thumb, a \u00a314m UK gross was indicated; in fact, it&apos;s taken \u00a36.3m. Paramount always faced an uphill struggle with the title: the toy simply isn&apos;t as well-known here, and nor is lead actor Channing Tatum. Top movies, summer 2009 1.

Asia&apos;s biggest airline said it would suspend 29 domestic routes and 21 routes by March 2011 in a rescue plan submitted this week to the transport ministry. JAL is expected to withdraw from several international airports, including those in Mexico and China, and to suspend routes from Tokyo and Osaka to nine overseas destinations, including Rome, S\u00e3o Paolo in Brazil and Dalian in China, reports said. The 6,800 redundancies \u2013 14% of JAL&apos;s workforce \u2013 will be implemented through to March 2012 as the company strives to cut operating costs by 30% over the next three years. &quot;The personnel reduction cannot wait,&quot; JAL&apos;s president, Haruka Nishimatsu, told reporters. &quot;The world is changing, and we have to adjust our size. It&apos;s easy to expand, but it&apos;s extremely difficult to downsize.&quot; The firm is seeking a tie-up by mid-October with either Delta Airlines or American Airlines after suffering its biggest-ever quarterly loss of \u00a599bn (\u00a3665m) in the three months to June. JAL has forecast losses of \u00a563bn through to the end of March 2010. The Japanese airline, which is facing tough competition on domestic routes from All Nippon Airways, is also in talks with Air France-KLM and Korean Air over additional investments worth several hundred million dollars. JAL is under mounting pressure to carry out radical restructuring measures after securing \u00a5100bn in government funds, and hopes to cut costs by \u00a553bn this year and another \u00a5100bn next year. A capital tie-up with Delta or American could herald a dramatic reshaping of the global aviation industry, as it would give either one access to JAL&apos;s Chinese and other Asian routes through code-sharing agreements. Delta, the world&apos;s biggest airline, is keen to add to its trans-Pacific and Asian routes. The Nikkei business newspaper reported that Delta had offered to invest up to \u00a550bn, giving it an 11.2% stake in JAL. Japanese law permits foreign firms to own up to a third of a Japanese airline. But a Delta victory in the bidding war would be a serious setback to American&apos;s attempts to establish a hub in Asia because it would mean losing code-sharing agreements as part of its Oneworld alliance agreement with JAL. JAL&apos;s exit from the Oneworld alliance would also deal a blow other group members, including British Airways, analysts said. JAL executives are thought to favour a tie-up with American, while the Japanese government is said to prefer the more financially robust Delta or Air France-KLM. Nishimatsu would only say his firm was likely to opt for one of the US bidders &quot;if an open skies agreement looks likely&quot;. A flexible arrangement would give the successful bidder access to Haneda, the world&apos;s third-busiest airport by passenger numbers. Haneda and Narita, Tokyo&apos;s international hub, are both expanding. &quot;If you just look at what the companies can offer, then Delta would make more sense as an ally because they have more services between Japan and North America,&quot; Osuke Itazaki, an analyst at Credit Suisse, told Reuters. News of the talks comes amid more bad news for the global airline industry. Rising oil prices, faltering demand and intense competition will see it post a loss $27.8bn (\u00a316.9bn) for 2008 and 2009, the International Air Transport Association said yesterday."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;The DPJ has got to come up with an agreed list of priorities quickly, because its manifesto is just a long laundry list,&quot; said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.", "The president of the Tokyo stock exchange, Atsushi Saito, warned the incoming government against &quot;excessive and irrational regulation&quot; that could &quot;kill the market&quot;.", "&quot;We hope the new government can be very flexible and very rational.&quot; Hatoyama will also attempt to reassure Washington that his campaign pledge to end Tokyo&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to US foreign policy will not significantly alter the status of US troops based in Japan."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Yukio Hatoyama", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T08:39:43Z", "title": "Yukio Hatoyama named as Japanese prime minister", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/yukio-hatoyama-japan-prime-minister", "article": "Japan today completed the most radical political shift in its postwar history when MPs approved Yukio Hatoyama as only the country&apos;s second prime minister from outside the Liberal Democratic party [LDP] for more than half a century. Hatoyama, wearing his now-familiar lucky striped tie, bowed after securing 327 votes in the 480-seat lower house of parliament. Moments later he named a cabinet that must quickly deal with Japan&apos;s worst recession since the war, record unemployment and disquiet in Washington over the future of the bilateral alliance. &quot;I have mixed feelings of excitement about changing history and the very heavy responsibility of making history,&quot; Hatoyama told reporters before the parliamentary vote. &quot;The battle begins now.&quot; His centre-left Democratic Party of Japan [DPJ] swept to power after trouncing the LDP in last month&apos;s general election, securing 308 seats while reducing its main opponent to 119 seats. Today marks only the second time since 1955 that a Japanese administration has not been led by the LDP, whose cabinet resigned en masse this morning. Its outgoing leader, Taro Aso, said: &quot;I did my best for the sake of Japan, in a very short one-year period.&quot; Analysts said Hatoyama would be given little time to implement his ambitious spending programme, and make good on promises to end waste and take on the elite bureaucrats who have dictated economic policy since the end of the war. Questions are already being raised about the party&apos;s pledges to pour money into social security as Japan battles a ballooning public debt that is heading towards 200% of gross domestic product. Its manifesto commitments include a higher minimum wage, the abolition of motorway tolls and petrol surcharges, the introduction of child benefit and a promise not to raise sales tax for at least four years. &quot;The DPJ has got to come up with an agreed list of priorities quickly, because its manifesto is just a long laundry list,&quot; said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. &quot;And it had better not just be how they will govern differently, but actual policies. They can expect something of a honeymoon for a year, but not longer than that.&quot; Doubts also surround the abilities of Hatoyama&apos;s inexperienced ministers. Katsuya Okada, a former DPJ leader, is to become foreign minister, while Hirohisa Fujii was named finance minister. Okada has never held a cabinet post, although Fujii served as finance minister in a coalition government that kept the LDP out of power for 11 months in 1993-94. Despite his overwhelming victory, Hatoyama has offered two cabinet posts to minor opposition parties to secure majorities in both houses of parliament, an arrangement that should end the deadlock that has stalled legislation over the past two years. The most contentious outside appointment is that of Shizuka Kamei, who left the LDP in 2006 in protest at Junichiro Koizumi&apos;s plans to privatise the post office, the world&apos;s biggest bank by deposits with $1.8tn in customer savings. Kamei, a former police agency official and outspoken critic of recent market reforms, indicated that as financial services minister he would review post office privatisation and confront &quot;unbridled&quot; US capitalism. &quot;I will fundamentally repair the situation into which the people and the country have fallen because of Koizumi&apos;s politics, and revise postal privatisation as a top priority,&quot; he said. Hatoyama&apos;s recent calls for &quot;a balance between government regulation and the market&quot; have set off alarm bells in the financial sector. The president of the Tokyo stock exchange, Atsushi Saito, warned the incoming government against &quot;excessive and irrational regulation&quot; that could &quot;kill the market&quot;. &quot;They have studied in depth already but the real business could be a bit different,&quot; Saito told Bloomberg television yesterday. &quot;We hope the new government can be very flexible and very rational.&quot; Hatoyama will also attempt to reassure Washington that his campaign pledge to end Tokyo&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to US foreign policy will not significantly alter the status of US troops based in Japan. Although some in his party have called for an overhaul of the security relationship, most analysts expect little will change once he is in office. In recent weeks Hatoyama, who is to meet Barack Obama at the UN general assembly next week, has said the alliance will remain the &quot;cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["While millions confront the spectre of unemployment, the recession has failed to materialise at KidZania, a scaled-down replica town in the Tokyo suburbs that invites children to act out their fantasies, whether it is flying a passenger jet and acting on stage, or the less glamorous tasks of issuing driving licences and delivering parcels.", "It proved so popular that a second Mexican park was developed, in Monterrey, followed by KidZania in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T17:49:10Z", "title": "Jobs for the boys - and girls - at KidZania replica town in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/kidzania-tokyo-replica-town-children", "article": "It may be the only place in the world where child labour is acceptable: where parents look on with pride as their offspring slave over hot stoves or pursue criminals through the streets.

He travelled little, preferring his native France, better still his native Paris, and best of all the patch around Belleville-M\u00e9nilmontant where he could photograph the local people of the &quot;popular classes&quot;, with whom he felt such a gentle affinity. Although best known for his lyrical, black-and-white images of everyday life in Provence and Paris, his most frequently reproduced picture is Nu Proven\u00e7al, a nude of his wife, Marie-Anne Lansiaux, bending over a sink in a rustic bathroom. Ronis was born in Paris, the son of a\u00a0Jewish refugee from Odessa who had a photographic studio near the Place de la Nation. His first love was music. He learned the violin and studied composition, but his studies were interrupted in 1932 when his father fell ill and he took over the studio. He later claimed to find a resemblance between music and photography in &quot;the taste I have for composition, particularly counterpoint. Many of my photographs are taken from above, either looking down or up, three planes in one image, like three different melodies in a fugue which work together to give the piece structure and harmony.&quot; Despite his desire for structure, Ronis specialised in pictures that were not posed. Perhaps his early experiences photographing weddings, christenings and communions caused him to resist the stiff, prevailing fashions, and he believed that spontaneity offered greater insights than the scrutiny of\u00a0a\u00a0subject frozen in time. The striking liveliness of his pictures, often taken on the streets of poor quarters of Paris, form many of our most familiar images of the city. &quot;Most of my photographs were taken on the spur of the moment, very quickly, just as they occurred,&quot; he once said. &quot;All attention focuses on the specific instant, almost too good to be true, which can only vanish in the following one.&quot; He began working as a freelance photojournalist in 1936, exploring the life of the poor and destitute, with images of workers, picket lines and trade union meetings, until the outbreak of the second world war. He\u00a0had also served as a meteorologist with the French air force and briefly with the artillery before the fall of\u00a0France. Under the Nazi occupation, his refusal to wear the yellow badge and France&apos;s partition forced his flight south of\u00a0Vichy, where he eked out the war by lying low. Appropriately, despite the horrors of war, he concluded that &quot;humanity doesn&apos;t change, it&apos;s only the decor that changes&quot;. He fell in love with Nice, Toulon, Aubagne, places he was to revisit when, in 1972, he moved to Provence as a teacher of photography at the School of Fine Arts in Avignon, Aix-en-Provence and Saint Charles, Marseille. By the end of the war he had also fallen in love with and married Marie-Anne, an artist, with whom he had a\u00a0son. His first priority was always his family, which is why he refrained from accepting lengthy assignments abroad, even when, in the 1950s and 60s, his work was being shown widely in Life and Vogue. These images were a radical departure from his politicised work on strikes and occupations of the 1930s, and came partly through his meeting with David &quot;Chim&quot; Seymour and Robert Capa, the war photographers who founded the Magnum agency. In 1947 Ronis won the Prix Kodak and joined the Rapho agency, with Robert Doisneau and Brassa\u00ef, where he remained. This was despite a long break when he ceased photographic production, having no major exhibition between 1967 and 1979. One reason for his withdrawal was his disillusionment with publishers. He had enormous success with his book on Belleville-M\u00e9nilmontant, which appeared in 1954, but another that &quot;was made for me&quot;, with the author and editor R\u00e9gine Desforges, had cast him in the mould of a great photographer of beautiful women, which was not really his speciality. The women he most typically photographed were those of the poor quarters, where, as he said: &quot;The streets were a theatre where you could see the real difficulties those mothers and housewives had, simply in shopping at the market.&quot; Those difficulties are evident in the women clutching their purses, counting their coins and their goods, contrasted with the abstracted look of a child for whom financial want is not yet a concern. There are also the famous shots of women grieving over a railway worker being stretchered out after a\u00a0fatal accident; those celebrating by night at a country fair; a trade union leader haranguing her fellow strikers at the Citro\u00ebn-Javel plant; the starched maid watering the window-boxes on the balcony of Claridges hotel; the harpist playing to the terminally ill in a Malmaison hospice; the mother leaning over her child&apos;s playpen on a\u00a0patch of waste ground in the smoky city outskirts. His most tender female portraits remain the curiously Degas-like Le Nu Proven\u00e7al (1949), and one of\u00a0his wife suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s disease, shortly before her death, lost in a park of autumn trees. In 1980 Ronis was the Honoured Photographer at the annual Arles Rencontres, where the influential critic Christian Caujolle hailed him as &quot;France&apos;s forgotten photographer&quot;. In\u00a01981 he won the Prix Nadar; in 1986 he was made a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. His work was again shown widely in Europe, the US, Russia and at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris and\u00a0the Witkin and Zabriskie galleries in\u00a0New York. He also mended fences with pub-lishers after his earlier disappointments. In 1980 Sur le Fil du Hasard appeared; Mon Paris in 1985; in 1986 a portfolio of Douze Photos; in 1991 Toutes Belles, along with reissues (after his earlier complaints of &quot;massacred images&quot;, with improved reproduction) of three of the earlier books. A major touring retrospective was commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 1995. In 2007 he was honoured in New York at the Lucie awards, which celebrate lifetime achievement. When we met in Paris in 1992, he was already preparing for the Oxford overview, apparently feeling in some senses that his life was over. The death of his son, Vincent, in a hang-gliding accident in 1988 spelled the end of\u00a0the family that had always held such enormous importance for him. A\u00a0gentle, frail man in failing health, in an apartment cluttered with furniture and\u00a0paintings by his late wife, he asked me if there was a photograph I had found that summarised &quot;his&quot; Paris. I\u00a0mentioned that of a vitrier, mounting the steep cobbled hillside with the panes of glass on his back, as an image that had fixed the city in a light and a\u00a0period that would never return. Within 24 hours I was to be proved wrong. As\u00a0I\u00a0descended the Butte de Montmartre to my flat, I saw the shade of Ronis&apos;s photograph in a vitrier labouring towards me in his blue overalls, calling out his wares. What better testimony for a photographer than that reality had come to resemble his art? Ronis is survived by his grandson. \u2022 Willy Ronis, photographer, born 14 August 1910; died 12 September 2009"}, {"sentences": ["Fernando Trueba&apos;s The Dancer and the Thief, Daniel Sanchez-Arevalo&apos;s Gordos and Isabel Coixet&apos;s Map of the Sounds of Tokyo are the three films which have been put forward for the final stage of consideration to be the country&apos;s entrant.", "Coixet&apos;s Map of the Sounds of Tokyo focuses on the relationship between a wine seller played by Sergi Lopez, and the hitwoman hired to kill him."], "tags": ["Film", "Pedro Almod\u00f3var", "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz", "Oscars", "Culture", "Spain", "Europe", "Oscars 2010", "Broken Embraces (Los Abrazos Rotos)"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-17T14:08:11Z", "title": "Broken Embraces fails to make Spain's Oscar shortlist", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/17/broken-embraces-spain-oscar-almodovar", "article": "Pedro Almodovar&apos;s critically acclaimed Broken Embraces, starring last year&apos;s best supporting actress winner Penelope Cruz, has been controversially omitted from Spain&apos;s shortlist for next year&apos;s Academy Award for best foreign language film, Variety reports. Fernando Trueba&apos;s The Dancer and the Thief, Daniel Sanchez-Arevalo&apos;s Gordos and Isabel Coixet&apos;s Map of the Sounds of Tokyo are the three films which have been put forward for the final stage of consideration to be the country&apos;s entrant. The winner will be announced on 29 September. Spain has won the prize four times, and currently lies in third place on the leaderboard of countries that have achieved a victory, behind Italy and France, but ahead of Japan, Germany and Sweden. Almodovar took the award in 1999 for All About My Mother and picked up a nomination in 1988 for Women on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown. His films High Heels, The Flower of My Secret and Volver were also picked as Spain&apos;s entries in 1991, 1995 and 2006 respectively, but did not make the final list of nominees. The auteur nevertheless maintains something of an on-off relationship with his country&apos;s Oscars committee. In 2002 his film Talk to Her won the Academy Award for best screenplay despite being snubbed as Spain&apos;s foreign language entry. Oscar watchers suggest Broken Embraces might still pick up nominations in the best actress, best original screenplay or cinematography categories, though the film, in which Cruz stars as a secretary and part-time call girl determined to become a big screen success, might be too spiky in its subject matter and delivery to win over the Academy. The Dancer and the Thief, a tale of high-romance between three Chilean outsiders, two ex-cons and a wannabe ballet dancer, would appear to be the frontrunner for Spain&apos;s nomination, director Fernando Trueba having taken the Oscar in 1993 for Belle Epoque. Gordos, described as a daring take on society&apos;s obsession with appearances as seen through the eyes of a group of fat people, is the second film from Sanchez-Arevalo, one of the foremost members of Spain&apos;s newest generation of movie directors. Coixet&apos;s Map of the Sounds of Tokyo focuses on the relationship between a wine seller played by Sergi Lopez, and the hitwoman hired to kill him.

Despite growing evidence that storms in China are getting fiercer, droughts longer and typhoons more deadly, Xiao Ziniu, the director general of the Beijing Climate Centre, said it was too early to determine the level of risk posed by global warming. &quot;There is no agreed conclusion about how much change is dangerous,&quot; Xiao said. &quot;Whether the climate turns warmer or cooler, there are both positive and negative effects. We are not focusing on what will happen with a one degree or two degree increase, we are looking at what level will be a danger to the environment. In Chinese history, there have been many periods warmer than today.&quot; The IPCC warns a 2C rise substantially increases the risks of floods, drought and storms. Whether a 2C rise turns global warming into global burning has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in advance of the Copenhagen summit. The G8 and EU want the world to set 2C as a ceiling by 2050, but China is sceptical. A senior government adviser said yesterday that the target of two degrees was unrealistic and would not give developing nations room to grow. Xiao said China had started its own climate modelling programme for the next 100 years aimed at predicting the point when global warming will result in environmental collapse. His centre will also release yearly climate predictions for China. Even with weather satellites and sophisticated simulation software, Xiao is not overly optimistic about accuracy the initial results. &quot;Climate prediction has only come into operation in recent years. The accuracy of the prediction is very low because the climate is affected by many mechanisms we do not fully understand.&quot; China&apos;s growing influence in climate studies was recognised this year when the World Meteorological Organisation selected Beijing as a co-host of the Asian Climate Centre. Alongside Tokyo, it will be responsible for monitoring and predicting changes in weather patterns and their impact on natural disasters, water resources and soil quality. Even at current levels of warming, the centre has collected a strong body of evidence that climate change is wreaking havoc in China. A report provided by the centre to the Guardian shows rainfall coming in shorter, fiercer bursts, interspersed by protracted periods of drought, particularly in the north. Water supplies have been badly affected. The Yellow river watershed has suffered a continuous drought since 1965 and it is getting worse, it said. Almost half the serious droughts of the past 60 years have occurred since 1990. &quot;Due to climate change, drought disasters come more frequently and across a wider area,&quot; the report noted. Since 1950, Beijing has had an average of 36 rainy days a year, but not once in the past decade has that figure been reached. In 2007, the northernmost province of Heilongjiang reported a summer drought, which is almost unheard of in what is usually a flood season. Glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate. A ferocious storm on 10 May this year broke records in Gaoqing, Shandong, with nearly 19.7cm of water dumped from the skies in one day. On the edge of the Gobi desert in Xilin Haote, Inner Mongolia, 5.6 cm of rain fell on 27 June 2008 \u2013 the most since a monitoring station was established in the area fifty years earlier. Summer is coming earlier and hotter across swaths of the North. Of the many records broken this year, the most dramatic was in Shijiazhuang Hebei where the temperature soared to 30C on 17 March, more than six degrees higher than the previous high for that day. Near the border with Siberia, the counties of Yilan and Yichun have experienced the hottest May in history and searing heat of more than 40C is now commonplace in many areas of the north. &quot;I think it is the responsibility of scientists to have a sense of crisis.

But this week the Japanese capital&apos;s police launched a crackdown on the scourge of groping. In the first reported case, Tsutomu Yamane, 30, was arrested with minutes of allegedly groping a 15-year-old girl on Monday morning. Undercover police officers have been dispatched to notorious train lines across Tokyo in a new offensive against chikan, a catch-all term that covers groping, sexual rubbing and surreptitious mobile phone photography. The introduction almost a decade ago of women-only carriages during the morning and evening rush hours failed to put an end to Japan&apos;s chikan plague, despite warnings that convicted gropers face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 500,000 yen (\u00a33,300). Police in Tokyo make between 1,500 and 1,800 arrests a year, and have recorded more than 700 cases in the first six months of this year. More than 50% of victims are women in their 20s, and about a third are teenage girls. According to one survey, nearly two-thirds of young women say they have been touched inappropriately in train or underground carriages. Kimiko Kitagawa, a 31-year-old business consultant, joined the long list of chikan victims as she stepped off a subway train near her office in central Tokyo earlier this year. &quot;I felt a hand grab my backside, but when I turned around there were several men rushing to get past,&quot; she said. &quot;I had no way of knowing who had touched me.&quot; Confusion and embarrassment mean the number of groping incidents is suspected of being much higher than official reports suggest. &quot;Many victims are reluctant to come forward, as they feel too embarrassed,&quot; a police spokesman told the Yomiuri newspaper. &quot;We are going to concentrate on the most serious cases.&quot; The crackdown came in response to a recent jump in cases involving groups of men who use online chat rooms to arrange where and when to target women. At least 100 websites list prime groping locations, offering hints on how to fondle undetected and, if that does not work, evade arrest. One site advises would-be gropers to select carriages with doors that open near platform escalators or staircases \u2013 perfect escape routes. Several men arrested in recent months have admitted being encouraged by the websites and emboldened by the prospect of working as part of a group. A typical tactic is to position two men in front and behind a victim, while as many as six other men block the view of other passengers. The police are targeting nine railway lines in Tokyo where groping has become endemic, especially the Saikyo line, which takes commuters between Ikebukuro and Akabane in the capital&apos;s suburbs. Attempts to prosecute gropers, however, have been frustrated by cases in which women, often with the help of male accomplices, make have made false accusations in the hope of securing huge out-of-court settlements. Men who are apprehended are usually found guilty. The 2007 film, I Just Didn&apos;t Do It, was based on the true story of a young man accused of groping who cleared his name after a five-year battle. In another high-profile case, the supreme court last year acquitted a 63-year-old professor of molesting a teenage girl in 2006. He had earlier been sentenced to 22 months in prison."}, {"sentences": [" Michelle Obama will be called on to provide the stardust for Chicago&apos;s Olympic bid when it goes head-to-head with Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid next month for the right to stage the 2016 Games."], "tags": ["Michelle Obama", "Sport", "Rio 2016", "International Olympic Committee", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-17T21:57:19Z", "title": "Barack Obama sends his wife to boost Chicago's 2016 Olympics bid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/17/michelle-obama-chicago-2016-olympics", "article": " Michelle Obama will be called on to provide the stardust for Chicago&apos;s Olympic bid when it goes head-to-head with Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid next month for the right to stage the 2016 Games. The International Olympic Committee&apos;s president, Jacques Rogge, yesterday revealed that President Obama had explained his potentially damaging absence from the vote by saying he was sending &quot;the best part of his couple&quot; to represent Chicago. With the other bids being supported in person by heads of state, Chicago officials were keen for the president to fly to the 2 October IOC meeting in Copenhagen at the beginning of and help sway members. Now they will rely on his wife&apos;s box-office appeal. Rogge said that, in a phone call last week, Obama had explained the ongoing political row around his healthcare reforms would keep him from attending. &quot;President Obama expressed his support for Chicago in a very clear way,&quot; Rogge said. &quot;You know how charismatic he is when he wants to express his love for his city. He was very clear to say he was totally behind the bid. &quot;But he explained that the political situation in Washington did not allow him to participate in Copenhagen. He said with a sense of humour that he would send the best part of his couple and the First Lady would probably be the best stand-in he could have imagined for himself.&quot; Rogge said that big hitters did not necessarily win votes, but it is generally accepted that Tony Blair&apos;s presence in Singapore in 2005 helped sway a close vote London&apos;s way, while Vladimir Putin helped tip the scales in Sochi&apos;s favour ahead of the vote for the 2014 Winter Olympics. &quot;We are very honoured and happy to host heads of states, dignitaries and heads of government. [But] I don&apos;t consider this is the most vital aspect in a bid,&quot; Rogge said. &quot;This is something that is an honour for the IOC and is also reassurance that public authorities are behind the bid and will be supportive. However, this is absolutely not a requirement of the IOC. We have never asked a head of state to come, [but] if they elect to do so we consider them as being part of the bid. If they come, we&apos;re glad. But we don&apos;t want them to come at all sakes.&quot; Rogge said that the personalities behind the bids were a big factor, praising Lord Coe&apos;s Singapore speech as a key element of London&apos;s victory in the race to host the 2012 Games. &quot;All being equal in terms of technicalities, it&apos;s the confidence you have in the people making the bid and who will be the organisers in staging the Games,&quot; he said. Chicago began the race as a clear favourite but Rio, bidding to become the first South American city to host the games and trading on a message of regeneration and youth appeal, is perceived to have drawn level in recent months. Other bidders are judged to be not far behind. The US bidder has natural advantages in terms of the revenue it would attract in sponsorship and TV rights but has also been hit by a drop in public support and wrangling over the level of local government financial guarantees. Rogge said that was all settled, adding that recent disputes between the US Olympic Association and the IOC over the launch of a new TV network would &quot;have no negative effect whatsoever&quot;. But he did say that public support was &quot;an important factor&quot;. Rogge predicted the vote, to be taken on October 2 after a final round of presentations to the 106 IOC members, would be one of the closest ever. &quot;I had a feeling in Singapore that the race was very close. I thought it would be decided by around half a dozen votes, in the end it was not six votes, it was four votes,&quot; he said. &quot;I think I can make a bet today and say it will be a couple of votes. I think it&apos;s going to be very close. Four or five votes is only the change of mind of two persons or three persons.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Locals might not want the guide in Tokyo but tourists clearly do."], "tags": ["The Michelin Guide", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Twitter", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-18T11:15:00Z", "title": "Michelin guides itself to Twitter", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/sep/18/michelin-guide-twitter", "article": "Witnessing the dear old Michelin Guide trying to wrestle with the realities of the wired world \u2013 the democratisation of opinion, the challenges to top-down expertise, the head-spinning speed of it all \u2013 is not unlike watching a much loved but desperately square uncle trying to dance at a hip wedding. Please! Just stop. The latest? Michelin inspectors in New York and San Francisco are, apparently, going to be using Twitter to record their restaurant experiences. (For those who want to have a look items are being posted at MichelinGuideNY and MichelinGuideSF.)  There are lots of problems here. The first is that, at the same time, Michelin is also running an advertising campaign bigging up the anonymity of their inspectors, apparently to differentiate themselves from the common herd who provide the reviews for guides like Zagats. And yet, here is Michelin&apos;s top man, Jean-Luc Naret, on why they are going a-tweeting:  &quot;One of the things we realised when we started to question people in New York was ... they didn&apos;t realise that this was about a team of professionals. We&apos;re trying, really, to make sure that people understand they are on the road, they are out there and maybe they could spot them.&quot;  Hang on. On the one hand, hurrah for anonymity, but on the other &apos;follow our tweets and come and find us&apos;. Really? Is that what you want? Well no, perhaps not, because it turns out that rather than behaving like normal people \u2013 and Michelin inspectors are not like normal people \u2013 who would simply get out the mobile and tweet from the table, they have to send theirs to an editor elsewhere and they post them, a lag which completely destroys the point of as-it-happens real-time updates. And, whaddyaknow, probably makes it almost impossible to play hunt the inspector because by the time the tweet is up they have gone. Which is apparently the intention.  According to Ryan Lynch, the man behind the idea for Michelin, &apos;&quot;With technology being what it is, and the advancements in being able to locate people, we open ourselves up for a potential chance of that anonymity being broken, and at the end of the day that can&apos;t happen.&quot; For godsake, MAKE UP YOUR MINDS. There are other problems too. If Michelin is about anything it&apos;s the multiple visit; the assessment based on rigorous and endless road testing of menus. So does it really serve their cause to post things like &quot;mmm ... slurped up some nutty soba today - http://www.sobatotto.com/ - great value at lunch ... this might be a keeper!&quot; as they did in New York two days ago, if, eight meals down the line, it turns out that it&apos;s not a keeper after all actually now you mention it?  Or to announce: &quot;Lunch at Jaiya, renovations still under way but lookin&apos; good. Yummy spring roll, seafood red curry, creamy iced coffee ... all for under $20.&quot; When, who knows, the place might later put its prices up? In short does a Michelin tweet carry any of the authority of the Michelin guide, or does it in fact just undermine it? In truth though, going by what&apos;s already been offered, the worst crime committed by a tweeting Michelin will be bald, in-yer-face, corporate product pimping, along the lines of: &quot;Did you know that the Michelin Guide features lists, such as &quot;Restaurants by Neighborhood&quot;?&apos; Or &quot;A bit bored with the tried and true? The 2010 New York City Michelin Guide has 145 NEW restaurant additions \u2026 bon appetit foodies!&quot; or &quot;Restaurant comfort levels are designated by the couvert symbol (fork &amp; spoon); one couvert means quite comfortable and five means luxurious.&quot; Appalling, kill-me-now tweets like that make you curse the day Tim Berners-Lee invented the web. Perhaps it will get better. Maybe hunt the Michelin man will become a sport. It&apos;s just possible those tweets could be a new source of inside knowledge on the best breakthrough eateries. There&apos;s no doubt that Jean-Luc Naret has understood the challenges posed to the organisation he heads. The decision to dump the cryptic entries based on pictograms and terse one liners in favour of expansive and enthusiastic entries was right. His recognition that he needed to push the brand aggressively, by launching guides across America and into Asia, seems to be working. Locals might not want the guide in Tokyo but tourists clearly do.  This move, though, feels clumsy and unfocused. Or perhaps it&apos;s simply this: a medium like Twitter, based on the individual and the instantaneous simply does not benefit from being used as some tacky, slow-moving corporate marketing tool.

Falling wages, slashed bonuses and fear of redundancy have shrunk household budgets, and for a growing number of workers that means cutting down lunchtime trips to the local sushi or ramen joint. Instead, almost 10% of men now take bento boxed lunches to work in an attempt to save money, according to a survey by a Japanese bank. And in a sign of the shifting power relationships in Japanese households, many of the men now seem happy to wake up early and cross the kitchen threshold to create their own bento ensemble, typically grilled fish, rice, pickles and an omelette, all lovingly arranged in a compartmentalised box. Despite his popular image as a formidable corporate warrior during office hours, the average salaryman is far more docile when it comes to household finances. About 40% of salarymen hand over their monthly pay to their wives, who dish out pocket money for essentials such as lunch, manga comics, canned coffee, cigarettes and after-hours bonding sessions over beer and sak\u00e9. But, according to the survey, average monthly allowances have fallen over the past year to about 45,000 yen (\u00a3300), well down on the 76,000 yen at the height of Japan&apos;s economic bubble almost 30 years ago. The bento craze has spawned a new range of sleek black or metallic lunchboxes with matching chopsticks, clearly designed with the younger salaryman in mind. Bento box sales in Tokyo have doubled over the past year as male office workers join aficionados among their female colleagues. An array of books, including the bestselling Danshi Gohan (Food for Men), guide hapless amateur cooks through the minefield of assembling nutritious and aesthetically pleasing boxed lunches. Others get recipe advice from What Did You Eat Yesterday?, a manga about the dietary habits of two cohabiting men, or hone their cooking skills at weekly evening classes. Masafumi Ono, a business software developer, eschews restaurant lunches in favour of a bento he makes himself. &quot;I used to eat out all the time, but since I got married and had a child I have had to be more frugal,&quot; he said as he settled down to lunch in the Tokyo sunshine. Ono, 33, uses leftovers from the previous night&apos;s dinner and reckons he is saving between 20,000 yen and 30,000 yen a month. His bento comprises a rolled omelette, mini-hamburger, fish sausage, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, pickled radish and rice with seaweed on top. Chuji Takeda, who works for a medical supplier, has been less ambitious. &quot;My son is studying overseas, spending my money, so I have to count the pennies by making this sorry excuse for a bento,&quot; the 49-year-old said as he looked down on his meagre offering of rice ball, hard-boiled egg and pickles. The intricately arranged bento of today is a far cry from the original version from the Kamakura period (1185-1333), which was often nothing more than a clump of dried or boiled rice eaten on the hoof. The bento took on a more refined look around the 19th century, when rice balls were packed into woven bamboo boxes and consumed during breaks in Noh and Kabuki performances in theatres.

When people are watching the actual stages, they can get really close. Really, really close at times ... Is it safe? Safety has improved massively. Back in the 1980s, drivers went to places like Portugal and it was just mental. There were spectators leaving it until the very last minute before jumping out of the way. There&apos;s a lot more control now - a helicopter flies over the stage before we go through and if the crowd situation is too dangerous then the stage is stopped.

His four films to date are beautifully crafted variations on established Hollywood genres and Away We Go is the first to be set in the 21st century, the others taking place variously during prohibition, the Eisenhower era and the first Gulf war. Though Mendes has not taken a credit as writer on any of them, there are common themes and a shared tone in American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Revolutionary Road and, now, Away We Go (an original screenplay by the fashionable young novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida). The common themes are the breakdown of family life and people turning against the society in which they&apos;re reared; the common tone is a guarded despair tinged with dark\u00a0humour. Away We Go belongs to that branch of the road movie in which characters examine their pasts to confront present dilemmas, like the doctor driving across Sweden in Bergman&apos;s Wild Strawberries and the ageing couple visiting their scattered children in Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story, or that series of American pictures coming out of Julien Duvivier&apos;s 1937 Un carnet du bal, most recently, Jim Jarmusch&apos;s Broken Flowers, in which the main characters trace old friends and relations. Here, a cheerful, somewhat disorganised couple in their early 30s, Verona (Maya Rudolph) and bespectacled college dropout Burt (John Krasinski), head off in a battered Volvo from their run-down immobile home in the woods of Colorado to see his parents. Impending parenthood has persuaded them to reconsider their behaviour and their curious jobs affect their attitudes: she&apos;s an artist specialising in depicting the interior of the human body; he advises on insurance futures. He proposes marriage regularly and she always refuses. &quot;Are we fuck-ups?&quot; she asks. Her parents are 12 years dead and in search of family stability Verona and Burt have moved to Colorado to be near Burt&apos;s mother and father. But suddenly, these two leftover hippy types announce they&apos;re renting out their house to spend two years in Antwerp. So Verona and Burt embark on a journey to find the perfect place to raise the daughter they&apos;re expecting, a disillusioning odyssey that takes them to Arizona, the Midwest, Canada, Florida and South Carolina. We think at first that they&apos;re a rather odd pair in the way they dress and behave. But by the end we see they&apos;re as endearing and kindly as the scatty young couple played by Philip Davis and Ruth Sheen at the centre of Mike Leigh&apos;s High Hopes. In Phoenix, they meet Verona&apos;s old work colleague (Allison Janney), a loud-mouth misfit with a thuggish husband given to apocalyptic thoughts and greyhound racing. In nearby Tucson, with background mountains familiar from a hundred westerns, they have lunch with Verona&apos;s successful, power-dressed sister (Carmen Ejogo), who has her own compact single life. The worst encounter comes in Wisconsin when visiting Burt&apos;s crazy feminist cousin, an academic married to a doctrinaire tree-hugger, a couple who believe that putting a child into a stroller is a crime. After this explosive reunion, they visit an old college friend in Montreal, who has five adopted children with her well-off husband but is suicidally depressed. Finally, they&apos;re called to Miami by Burt&apos;s brother whose wife has left him to bring up their daughter on his own. During this fraught, affecting visit, Verona has an epiphany about her own childhood which clarifies their lives. Everywhere, they&apos;ve learnt lessons about how not to raise children: apparently, the answer to their problems is that they don&apos;t have to depend on the support of friends or the kindness of strangers. This is a slick, occasionally smug, at times overplayed and frequently very funny film, and the production designer, Jess Gonchor, and the cinematographer, Ellen Kuras, have combined to give a distinctive regional look to each episode. The film works through striking scenes and splendid moments, rather than as a continuous whole. It begins, for instance, with an extraordinary pre-credit sequence in which while engaged in cunnilingus Burt can taste that Verona is pregnant. This sounds like something out of a film from Judd Apatow or the Farrelly brothers (and indeed Burt&apos;s father is played by that fine character actor Jeff Daniels, who made an uncharacteristic appearance in Dumb and Dumber), but it is, in fact, oddly touching as well as funny. There&apos;s also a memorably comic scene where an officious female check-in clerk at an airport refuses to accept the pregnant Verona and the couple are forced to continue by railroad. An interesting aspect of the movie is the fact, never explicitly stated, that Verona is of mixed parentage: either her mother or father was black. This is alluded to in different contexts on three crucial occasions and becomes apparent when she meets her sister. It gives the movie both an intriguing subtext and an ironic topicality when, at the end, Verona and Burt find the place of their dreams in an idyllic corner of South Carolina.

The Commission&apos;s Decision outlines specific cases of these conditional rebates and naked restrictions, as well as how Intel sought to conceal its practices and how computer manufacturers and Intel itself recognised the growing threat represented by the products of Intel&apos;s main competitor, AMD.  Intel has responded in a statement that says:  We are convinced that the Commission&apos;s conclusions regarding our business practices are wrong, both factually and legally. We have appealed the Commission&apos;s decision Intel is committed to ethical business behavior and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing business practices. We are convinced that we&apos;ve adhered to those standards and acted legally at all times in this matter. The Commission relied heavily on speculation found in emails from lower level employees that did not participate in the negotiation of the relevant agreements if they favored the Commission&apos;s case. At the same time, they ignored or minimized hard evidence of what actually happened, including highly authoritative documents, written declarations and testimony given under oath by senior individuals who negotiated the transactions at issue. (Quoted from VentureBeat)  The EU has been unusually quick to publish evidence to back up its case. Bloomberg quotes Dennis Oswell, a competition lawyer with Oswell &amp; Vahida in Brussels, saying: &quot;The commission is playing the public-relations game.&quot; However, it may be because it was criticised by its own ombudsman for failing to record &apos;potentially exculpatory&apos; evidence from a Dell witness. AMD has been shopping its complaints round the globe, and has launched its own cases against Intel in the US and Tokyo. America&apos;s FTC has also investigated Intel twice this century, without taking any significant action. (There was an FTC ruling against Intel concerning the supply of technical information.) The bulk of the complaints in the EU case seem to concern the period from Autumn 2002 to the end of 2005. In 2003, AMD launched the Opteron and Athlon 64 processors, code-named Hammer, offering Windows users 64-bit processing at a time when the Itanium was still Intel&apos;s main 64-bit solution. However, the Opteron/Athlon combination failed to hammer Intel, which had a huge success with the heavily promoted, Wi-Fi-oriented Centrino brand, launched in February 2003. Intel then followed AMD&apos;s lead in extending the 32-bit x86 line for 64-bit operations."}, {"sentences": ["Murray is still &quot;hopeful&quot; of playing the Masters Series in Shanghai and its warm\u2011up event in Tokyo, according to a spokesperson for his agents, Entertainment 19, and is positive about maintaining pressure on Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal above him in the world rankings.", "After Tokyo in a fortnight&apos;s time, and then Shanghai, his itinerary includes Valencia and Paris, which come almost immediately before the tour climax in London with the ATP World Tour finals."], "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-21T18:46:34Z", "title": "No serious damage but wrist worries plague Andy Murray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/21/andy-murray-wrist-injury", "article": "Andy Murray could pull out of two Asian tournaments next month after being ordered to rest by his doctor yesterday despite an MRI scan suggesting no long-term damage to his left wrist.

The scan was a relief to the world No3, who has been increasingly concerned that the ailment that has lasted more than four weeks could affect him for the remainder of his season.

It feels like tendinitis. It&apos;s sore and can get better or worse depending on the day and on adrenaline. It can come and go and has obviously not healed.&quot; Murray&apos;s anxieties are magnified by memories of the wrist injury he had in 2007, which lasted five months and was career-threatening. This one seems different, but it may make him edgy. &quot;That one was a bit of a freak,&quot; he said. &quot;It happened on one shot and it was agony and I couldn&apos;t even hold a racket. With this one the pain is bearable, but I have to make a decision. There is such a short turnaround at the end of the year and preparations for Australia have to be good because conditions can be tough. &quot;I have to decide when to fit in a long break, and a break long enough to get my wrist better.

Apologies for such delays; the day job often intervenes. Please continue to post your questions and comments below, we&apos;ll wade in as often as we can. Up for discussion today, among other things: who should host the 2016 Olympics? A week on Friday, delegations from Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid will travel to Copenhagen, where the final result will be announced. Will the &apos;Obama effect&apos; propel Chicago to victory and the US to a third Games in 32 years or will the 106 members of the IOC look elsewhere?

We&apos;ll be monitoring this throughout the day. \u2022 Following on from last night&apos;s Carling Cup action: a potential violent conduct charge for Javier Mascherano after he appeared to swing an elbow against Leeds United last night; and more on the racism allegations involving Blackpool&apos;s Jason Euell at Stoke City. \u2022 The ICC Champions Trophy continues, with Pakistan v West Indies. There will also be an Andrew Strauss press conference with England now in South Africa to prepare for the tournament (their first game is against Sri Lanka - who swept the hosts aside yesterday - on Friday). \u2022 We&apos;ll also have updates as our county cricket blog returns. \u2022 The Renault Crashgate saga rumbles on. \u2022 And among other things on the blog today: Robert Kitson writes on the remedy for the curse of excessive kicking in rugby union; Paul Wilson on the hypocrisy of the FA in not charging Craig Bellamy in the wake of the Manchester derby; From the Vault recalls Man City 5-1 Man Utd in 1989; and Will Buckley delivers The Forgotten Story of Swindon Town winning the League Cup as a third division team in 1969.

I spoke to his representative this morning and he has just decided it&apos;s not working out and he wants to move on. Perhaps things are not happening as quickly as he thought they might, but this is a five-year project, not a five-week project. We can&apos;t just become a Premier League club overnight.

Turning Japanese is sorry for having treated you for so long as little more than young, dumb starlets who squeal soppy, high-pitched sentiments over painfully crass Casio demo track ditties, designed solely to suck money from the pockets of teens too young to know any better. Little did we know that you pretty, pretty folks (and you really are all so very, very pretty) are at the frontline of a flourishing cultural exchange with your Korean K-pop counterparts.  Not that it&apos;s always been this way. Korean-Japanese relations have remained frayed since the second world war, as Japan has never officially apologised for its colonisation of the Korean peninsula between 1909 and 1945. As a form of cultural revitalisation after its liberation, Korea banned all cultural imports from Japan, and for decades the two countries&apos; pop markets developed largely in isolation from one another, which created the roaring black market pop trade of illegal CD-Rs. (This is not, however, the only instance of people committing crimes for J-pop). But in October 2004 the Korean government lifted the ban on Japanese cultural imports, and in the five years since, pop exchanges have flourished. When Japanese pop group Arashi turn up in Seoul for a press conference these days, 2,000 screaming fans are waiting for them at the airport. They can easily sell out week-long stints in arena-sized venues in Seoul, despite not speaking a word of Korean. Even though Japanese labels don&apos;t tend to promote their bands as strongly in Korea, artists such as Gackt, Hyde, Namie Amuro, Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki have developed considerable Korean followings simply from internet buzz. And the favour has been returned; Korean pop princess BoA took the Japanese pop charts by storm and is always popping up in Tokyo \u2013 her most recent appearance being at the MTV awards. The singer has enjoyed a success in Japan she failed to emulate when she had a pop at America. Meanwhile, Korean boyband shapeshifters TVXQ are effectively two bands \u2026 going by the moniker TVXQ in Korea and Tohoshinki in Japan, for whom they record special versions of their songs in Japanese. Of course, back and forth through all of this, it&apos;s important to remember that by and large the music in question is absolutely dreadful. But if it&apos;s improving cultural relations and making the world a more peaceful, understanding place \u2026 who am I to begrudge that?"}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo Games Show (TGS) has kicked off with Sony boss Kaz Hirai delivering a keynote very heavy on networked communities \u2013 think LittleBigPlanet \u2013 and motion control."], "tags": ["Games", "Sony", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-24T06:57:13Z", "title": "Tokyo Games Show - Sony show off motion controller", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/sep/24/games-sony", "article": "The Tokyo Games Show (TGS) has kicked off with Sony boss Kaz Hirai delivering a keynote very heavy on networked communities \u2013 think LittleBigPlanet \u2013 and motion control.

The Wii is the best-selling games console in the world,with more than 50m machines sold since 2006. But while the company announced on Thursday that the price of the machine would fall by \u00a55,000 (\u00a333) in Japan and drop from $249 (\u00a3152) to $199 in America \u2013 the UK will see no similar reductions. Instead, consumers will be offered the chance to buy their machine with an extra game at the same \u00a3199 price as before. In fact, the console is now \u00a320 more expensive in Britain than it was when it first launched to widespread acclaim three years ago, following a controversial price hike earlier this year. That increase, which raised the price of the machine from \u00a3179, angered many British customers who already felt they were paying more than those in other countries. At the time Nintendo said it brought in the change to cope with fluctuating currency exchange rates. It is the first time that Nintendo has dropped the price of the Wii, which proved a surprise hit thanks to its innovative motion-sensitive controller and family-friendly games. The move comes on the eve of the Tokyo Games Show \u2013 the biggest industry event of the year \u2013 and is seen as a response to similar cuts by Nintendo&apos;s major rivals, Sony and Microsoft. The two companies, which make the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 respectively, both reduced the price of their games consoles in an attempt to stimulate sales in the run-up to Christmas and challenge the Wii&apos;s dominance. &quot;The Wii is still the top-selling platform, but there is no doubt the console needs a shot in the arm, particularly with the competition finally getting more aggressive,&quot; Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets, told the San Francisco Chronicle. Nintendo UK says that it has cut prices for the Wii, just as has been done in the US \u2013 but that it&apos;s up to retailers whether you&apos;ll actually see that difference when you come to hand your cash over. A spokesman said: &quot;We ARE lowering the cost price of Wii to retailers in the UK.

And all nations must do their part to make this work.    Now, we harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons. We know there are plenty of cynics, and that there will be setbacks to prove their point. But there will also be days like today that push us forward -- days that tell a different story.

Welcome to our live coverage of the  ongoing humiliation of England&apos;s one-day team  the Champions Trophy.  I&apos;ve been away on holiday for the last two weeks, in which time England&apos;s one day team seems to have made an impressive transition from merely mediocre to truly and utterly despicable.  &quot;The truth of it is with England that you&apos;re never sure which side is going to turn up&quot; Charles Colville assures us in a vain but futile effort to convince England fans that they shouldn&apos;t give up on their side&apos;s chances already.  The one thing in England&apos;s favour, or so Atherton and Hussain try to convince us, is that conditions at the Wanderers are looking &quot;quite English&quot;. The pitch is green, and should allow some seam movement. England have won the toss and decided to bowl first. Given that that means they&apos;ll be batting under lights in the dew later on, we&apos;ll most likely know the result of this game inside the first fifteen overs of the first innings. Sangakkara insists he would have batted first anyway.  Steve Rackett has captured the prevailing tone in the very first email of the day: &quot;It&apos;s just a question of how much England are going to be stuffed by in today&apos;s match isn&apos;t it? Earlier in the year they barely scraped past Ireland and got a T20 beating by Holland, so they aren&apos;t even the best team in Europe? They could always do what our tennis team did and get related to Euro Division Two, and get some games against the likes of Italy and Denmark.&quot;  &quot;The pitch&quot; Bob Willis tells us, &quot;is a fast bowling paradise. And,&quot; he adds, &quot;the conditions are perfect for bowling in.&quot;  &quot;It looks like God has decided he&apos;s an Englishman today&quot; suggests Colville.  The ability of England fans to muster blind hope against even the most miserable circumstance remains remarkable.  &quot;Hope you had a good holiday&quot; begins Max Tant.

Anyway, Max continues: &quot;I&apos;m really looking forward to today&apos;s game, not for the cricket, which would register as only mildly interesting even if these two teams were equally matched, but for the excuses England will come out with for their dire display and the look of barely restrained contempt from Andy Flower in his interviews. There are other sub-plots to keep it interesting in the meantime too: 1) Bopara&apos;s increasing ineptitude 2) Shah&apos;s collection of bizarre dismissals and 3) England&apos;s continuing justification for picking this clearly sub-standard side.&quot;  Anyway. At least one of those sub-plots seems to have reached a sorry conclusion before the match has even started, because Ravi Bopara has been left out. In his absence England look like this: AJ Strauss, JL Denly, OA Shah, PD Collingwood, EJG Morgan, MJ Prior, LJ Wright, SCJ Broad, GP Swann, G Onions, JM Anderson.  While Sri Lanka look like this: TM Dilshan, ST Jayasuriya, KC Sangakkara, DPMD Jayawardene, SHT Kandamby, TT Samaraweera, AD Mathews, KMDN Kulasekara, M Muralitharan, SL Malinga, BAW Mendis.  &quot;I&apos;m big on blind faith generally&quot; pipes up Sara Torvalds, &quot;(until proven utterly wrong, often in the first three overs or so), but even my faith is tested by this one-day side. I mean, are they all even fit to play? How is Stuart Broad&apos;s neck? Or was that &apos;strain&apos; just an euphemism for &apos;I have absolutely no faith in my team mates and I&apos;d rather not play quite that many losing games on the trot&apos;?&quot;  I owe a hearty &quot;so long&quot; and a gold-plated carriage clock to Larry Booth, the godfather of cricket at GU, and the man responsible for getting me a job here many moons ago. Yes, blame him. Booth, you&apos;re a peerless all round cricket writer and you&apos;ll be missed. Especially so because I&apos;ll surely have to do more solo through-the-night OBO shifts now you&apos;re gone.  1st over: Sri Lanka 1-0 (Dilshan 1, Jayasuriya 0) Anderson opens with two fizzing deliveries outside Dilshan&apos;s off-stump. His third is all-but-unplayable, pitching on off and ripping away past the outside edge. &quot;I don&apos;t know why Sky are getting excited about the conditions,&quot; gripes Andy Bradshaw, &quot;Sri Lanka have better seamers than us as well.&quot; England have an optimistic three slips in place, but they&apos;ve little to do as Dilshan leaves four deliveries alone, swishes at the fifth and then eases a single past gully from the sixth ball.  WICKET! Jayasuriya 0 c Prior b Onions (2nd over: Sri Lanka 7-1)  Onions opens at the other end. Dilshan swings and misses at the first delivery, then steals a single from the third. &quot;I think it&apos;s really public spirited of Straussy to have a bowl first&quot; says Ian Smithson, employing the merest hint of sarcasm, &quot;he must have been thinking of the fans who parted with their hard-earned to get in the gates. If we&apos;d have batted first we&apos;d be all out in 30 overs and they&apos;d Dilscoop them off in 10. This way we&apos;re guaranteed Sri Lanka&apos;s 50 plus at least 10 balls for our reply.&quot; Onions opens to Jayasuriya with five wides down the leg side. Oh. He&apos;s out. Caught behind. What a strange dismissal, a timid little stroke from Jayasuriya producing a simple catch off the outside edge. England hardly realised they&apos;d taken a wicket.  WICKET! Dilshan 2 c Morgan b Anderson (3rd over: Sri Lanka 7-2)  What a team England are! The greatest one-day side on earth! This must be the best XI they&apos;ve ever fielded. World beaters, the bunch of them. Dilshan smacks a catch straight to Eoin Morgan at point. Jayawardene flails helplessly at a brute of an opening delivery from Anderson.  4th over: Sri Lanka 13-2 (Sangakkara 1, Jayasuriya 5) &quot;Booth gone?&quot; scoffs Wayne Mark Stubbs (great handle, that), &quot;Don&apos;t worry. OBO commentators have more comebacks than Elvis on a bungee. Just wait until they need someone to do they need someone to do the Sunday morning shift covering a draw-bound test in a dead series.&quot; Sangakkara turns a single away through mid-wicket to move off zero, and as Onions&apos; line drifts down leg Jayawardene flicks four away fine.  WICKET! Jayawardene 7 lbw Anderson (5th over: Sri Lanka 17-3)  Jayawardene skips down the pitch to Anderson, and ends up looking a bit of a chump as the ball swings well away from him past off stump. His next shot is altogether more impressive though, as he cracks a straight drive back past the stumps for two runs down the ground. He&apos;s left groping at the next delivery, but, unflustered by that failure, he eases two runs out through cover from the next ball. That&apos;s a beautiful piece of batting in absurdly difficult conditions, and no sooner have I typed that than Jayawardene is out, trapped LBW by Anderson. That ball was fuller, and swung towards off and back into the pads as Jayawardene played across the line.  WICKET! Sangakkara 1 c Strauss b Onions (6th over: Sri Lanka 24-4)  Well I&apos;ll be damned. Sangakkara swings wildly at a wider ball and slices a catch straight to Strauss at slip. &quot;Goodness me, England. Well done, you,&quot; gasps Sarah Bacon, &quot;I wonder, though, whether the stress on the &apos;Englishness&apos; of the conditions isn&apos;t gilding the lily somewhat. Perhaps it&apos;s just that a sizeable percentage of the side are feeling very comfortable back home in, I mean, playing in Africa.&quot; Kandamby and Samaraweera scamper a pair of singles, and the over ends with a four through mid-wicket.  7th over: Sri Lanka 25-4 (Samaraweera 1, Kandamby 5)  Anderson slips a in-swinger in towards Samaraweera, and the ball skitters off the inside edge and past the stumps. &quot; Did you see Graeme Swann&apos;s joke competition on Twitter yesterday?&quot; asks Ed Genochio. No. No I didn&apos;t. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s helped restore the team&apos;s mojo. (The winning joke, incidentally: Why should you avoid Russian underpants?... Chernobyl fallout.)&quot; Mercy. I&apos;m being out-written by Graeme Swann.  8th over: Sri Lanka 31-4 (Samaraweera 5, Kandamby 7)  Samaraweera flicks three runs out to deep mid-wicket with an excess of panache. &quot;Very funny Bull&quot; grumbles David Hopkins, &quot;Now can you run us through what has ACTUALLY happened in the first six overs. 42 without loss is it?&quot; Honestly I&apos;m stupefied by this myself.  9th over: Sri Lanka 34-4 (Samaraweera 7, Kandamby 8)  Anderson&apos;s figures so far are 4-1-6-2, while Onions&apos; are 4-0-25-2. Time to bring Stuart Broad into the attack perhaps? &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; shouts Cory Hazlehurst, &quot;It sounds from your report that wild slashes from Sri Lankans are going straight to fielders, maybe England are going to use up their entire luck quota in this match. Before we know it they&apos;ll have run out someone by hitting the stumps from a direct hit. Then I&apos;ll know you&apos;re just making this all up, and Sri Lanka are actually 345-0 from eleven overs.&quot; Broad is doing some very vigorous warm-ups now, so I imagine he&apos;ll be on soon enough, especially as this over was Anderson&apos;s least threatening yet.  10th over: Sri Lanka 43-4 (Samaraweera 15, Kandamby 8)  Here is Stuart Broad, and there goes Stuart Broad, as Samaraweera thumps four down through long-off in emphatic fashion. Ouch, the next shot is even better, Samaraweera leans back and cuts four more viciously past point. A glorious pair of shots, those. &quot;So maybe the ECB scheduling those seven interminable ODIs against Australia wasn&apos;t so daft after all,&quot; muses Robin Hazlehurst as Samaraweera opts to block the next two deliveries, &quot;The sense of release now that it is all over has put a spring in England&apos;s step and they can get back to enjoying their cricket - which they apparently are today. Brilliant psychological planning.&quot;  11th over: Sri Lanka 43-4 (Samaraweera 15, Kandamby 8)  &quot;Re: the winning joke in over 7: Chernobyl, as any fule know, is in Ukraine not Russia&quot; seethes Peter Withey, &quot;Shame on Swann for allowing this geographical blunder.&quot; Now he&apos;s got his funk going, it&apos;d be a shame to cut him off, so here&apos;s the rest of his email: &quot;What&apos;s with cricketers using Twitter anyway? Surely it&apos;s for people with some ability to entertain using the English (or indeed any other) language? Swann is fabulously entertaining but only whilst holding bat or ball. What&apos;s he got to say that&apos;s so bloody interesting? Nothing, same as pretty much all sportspeople. Witness that great contradiction in terms Sports &quot;Personality&quot; of the Year for further evidence of why we admire them for their physical and athletic prowess, not their witty banter. Sportspeople and Twitter: about as entertaining a combination as Stephen Fry and pole vaulting. All right the latter is entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons.&quot;  12th over: Sri Lanka 46-4 (Samaraweera 17, Kandamby 9) &quot;In the old days if I googled my name, I was on the first page of results due to my emails from the 2005 ashes&quot; mourns Jim Carpenter, perhaps revealing just a little more about the sorry state of his social life than he had intended, &quot;Now I&apos;m not even in the first ten pages, it&apos;s all facebook-this and myspace-that.&quot; Good grief, it gets worse. &quot;There&apos;s also a troubling German school question about who my murderer is, but we&apos;ll gloss over that. I&apos;d boasted of my over-by-over fame, but other than Naylor the ubiquitous we glorious few from 2005 seem to have gone the way of the dodo. Any other survivors out there?&quot; No. No you&apos;re one of the final few 2005 originals still going Jim. The rest of them are all propping up bars around the world, nursing watered-down booze complaining about how they couldda been contenders. &quot;I used to be in the OBO game&quot; they mutter, &quot;tough racket.&quot; Then they go home and google their own names, and count the number of pages they have to go through before they find a mention of themselves. What was I talking about again?  13th over: Sri Lanka 48-4 (Samaraweera 17, Kandamby 10) Two runs from this over, one of them a leg bye.  14th over: Sri Lanka 52-4 (Samaraweera 17, Kandamby 11) &quot;Graeme Swann not entertaining?&quot; gasps a dumbfounded Erik Petersen, &quot;Pah. For work, I was once at a primary school in Nottingham where Swanny was making an appearance for one of those desperate &quot;Please kids, put down the football and play the occasional game of cricket&quot; days. He was going around the room chatting to the kiddies, asking them if they played cricket, and one said he sometimes went to watch his dad play at a local club. Graeme knew the local club, and then spent the next five minutes rhapsodising on what a great pub it had next door. He highly recommended it. To a classroom of nine-year-olds. Comedy gold.&quot; The score tick-tocks on past fifty, pushed onwards by a pair of wides from Broad.  15th over: Sri Lanka 60-4 (Samaraweera 19, Kandamby 16) &quot;Dear dear,&quot; rebuts Ed Genochio, &quot;tell me exactly how pole-vaulting is better than reading Swann&apos;s latest tweet: &apos;After the joke bonanza yesterday i dreamt i was doing stand up at the apollo, went down an absolute treat...but then i was playing chess against the ginger one from girls aloud all dressed up in a gimp suit. please help me...&apos; Peter Withey may have something better to do with his time. I don&apos;t.&quot; Onions is back, and begins by whanging down a pair of short balls, the second of which whacks Samaraweera on the hand and leaves him reeling away in pain. Unfortunately though a single follows and Onions then follows up with a short, wide delivery which Kandamby cracks past cover for four.  16th over: Sri Lanka 62-4 (Samaraweera 20, Kandamby 16) These two have put on 43 together now. And already all that optimism is evaporating away like so much spilt milk in the sun. &quot;So, how can England mess this one up?&quot; asks Charles Downes as Broad gives up another wide, &quot;I foresee a middle order collapse and England bemoaning the state of the wicket / weather / light. Pessimistic me? No just an England fan.&quot;  17th over: Sri Lanka 63-4 (Samaraweera 20, Kandamby 16) &quot;Jim Carpenter is luckier than he thinks. I had at least three emails published on OBO during the 2005 Ashes&quot; recalls Ben Mimmack wistfully, &quot;but when I looked at the benighted book, they&apos;d all been excised. I felt like Trotsky after the revolution.&quot; One day soon you&apos;ll wake up with an ice pick in the back of your head.  18th over: Sri Lanka 63-4 (Samaraweera 21, Kandamby 16) &quot;Surely the question is not whether sports people are funny on Twitter, but whether anyone is funny on Twitter?&quot; asks Gary Naylor, &quot;These obsessives who punch their keyboards compulsively day after day, with the sole intention of being read by people who don&apos;t want to read their dull words, really get my goat. Er\u2026&quot; I think that email deserves to stand alone in a paragraph all of its own. But then Samaraweera snicks the ball off his inside edge flush into his box, then doubles over in pain. And a man being hit in the groin by a ball, as any fule kno, merits an obligatory mention in any cricket commentary worth its salt.  19th over: Sri Lanka 74-4 (Samaraweera 29, Kandamby 17) Samaraweera gracefully turns four runs through mid-wicket, then punches four more down the ground through long-on. Onions replies with a brainless bouncer that sails down the leg side for a wide. &quot;Jim Carpenter&apos;s reminded me of a date I went on with somebody I met through Soulmates,&quot; says Chris Gripton, &quot;Keen to impress the young lady with my Guardian reading credentials I boasted about the fact that I&apos;d been published on The Guardian website, not quite confessing to the fact it was in fact restricted to two OBO contributions from 2004 and &apos;05&quot; - Chris has included the links to these memorable occasions, but I&apos;m really not sure they&apos;re necessary, unless you people are really, really bored - &quot;I was somewhat caught out when the lady in question revealed that she too had had some work published in The Guardian on the subject of the the effects on adoptive parents of reuniting adopted children with their natural parents which kind of showed me up for the work-shy cricket obsessed saddo I probably am. Surprisingly we&apos;re still together.&quot; Pity relationship is it?  WICKET! Samaraweera 30 c Collingwood b Broad (20th over: Sri Lanka 81-5)  Bob Willis unleashes a tirade of condemnation on England&apos;s witless bowling after Broad flings down another bouncer and watches the ball sail away for four over Prior&apos;s head. Sod&apos;s law means that Willis&apos; words are more than enough to prompt another wicket to fall. Samaraweera is caught at backward point off the outside edge. &quot;The best thing about Swann&apos;s chess tweet was Jimmy Anderson&apos;s next tweet&quot; Andy Bradshaw tells us, &quot;I&apos;ve just seen Swann in the lobby playing chess and absentmindedly ruffling Colly&apos;s hair.&quot;  21st over: Sri Lanka 89-5 (Kandamby 24, Mathews 4) The Least Reassuring Phrases in the History of Cricket, part XVII of an ongoing series: &apos;Luke Wright is coming into the attack&apos;. Mathews duly clumps the third ball back past Wright&apos;s ankles and away for four down the ground. A humiliatingly wide wide sails past off stump, and the over ends with a flick to third man for two more.  22nd over: Sri Lanka 95-5 (Kandamby 25, Mathews 10) &quot;I was curious to learn more about this mythical lord of the OBO, Gary Naylor&quot; writes Tom Cochrane, &quot;So I googled him. The top hit, his most notable quote, you ask? Surely a pithy, informed and witty comment on some England batting collapse? No, it&apos;s this: &apos;Figure the average weight of your cows, and you can estimate how much hay you will need per cow.&apos; Is there no subject on which the man cannot enlighten us?&quot; And that&apos;s the shot of the day, Mathews standing tall and whipping four through deep backward square with a delightful hook shot. Broad follows up with a wide. &quot;This bowling performance should be X-rated&quot; says Willis. That&apos;s the 16th wide of the innings.  23rd over: Sri Lanka 100-5 (Kandamby 27, Mathews 13) Collingwood hits the stumps with a throw from backward point, but the batsman is safe and the ball ricochets away for two overthrows, raising the Sri Lankan hundred.  24th over: Sri Lanka 102-5 (Kandamby 28, Mathews 13) And here&apos;s Paul Collingwood. England need one more wicket to get an opening at Sr Lanka&apos;s very long tail, which features Muttiah Muralitharan no less at a heady no9 in the order. Collingwood though is intent only on containment, and gives up a mere two runs, one of them a wide, in his maiden over.  25th over: Sri Lanka 108-5 (Kandamby 33, Mathews 15) Kandamby hits a drive so plumb-straight that it crashes into the non-striker&apos;s stumps, and so powerful that it then runs away to the boundary for four regardless. &quot;Sorry to be a pedant,&quot; says Phil Powell with the air of a man who is in no way sorry to be a pedant, &quot;but the header for this OBO is nothing short of atrocious. Can things really have slipped so far so quickly since Booth&apos;s departure?&quot; You&apos;ve no idea...  26th over: Sri Lanka 116-5 (Kandamby 37, Mathews 17) &quot;Can I put in an entry for the Least Reassuring Phrases in the History of Cricket series?&quot; asks Alan White: &quot;The field is spread and there are plenty of singles on offer as Shah takes guard&quot;. The 18th wide of the innings fades past the off stump. Mathews and Kandamby sneak and scamper some singles, accruing seven from the over.  27th over: Sri Lanka 123-5 (Kandamby 42, Mathews 18) And here&apos;s Graeme Swann, on at the golf course end. His first ball spins, but not enough to trouble Mathews, who flicks it away for a single. Kandamby guides his nect delivery away for four to third man, and Swann then serves up a seemingly-obligatory wide. &quot;As I write, England have reduced Sri Lanka to 100-odd for 5,&quot; points out Nic Stone, helpfully, &quot;The thing about being an England fan is that if this were England batting, you&apos;d expect them to fold for maybe 150-160. Put Sri Lanka in the same position and a true England fan just knows they will still reach 250, even though conditions favour the bowlers, and England will still be bowled out for 160 in reply. I&apos;ve just explained this to my newborn son and he turned his back on me. He already has the haggard look of an England cricket follower about him and he&apos;s only 15 days old.&quot;  28th over: Sri Lanka 125-5 (Kandamby 43, Mathews 19) Paul Collingwood bowlsBatsmen leave the ball aloneI stifle my yawn So I picked up a bad haiku habit in Japan. Sorry about that. I&apos;m working on it.  29th over: Sri Lanka 131-5 (Kandamby 47, Mathews 21) &quot;My first OBO comment lightheartedly asked the readers for advice on clearing an about:blank virus from my then girlfriends dad&apos;s computer&quot; remembers Tom v d Gucht fondly, &quot;I was horrified when it was printed as it left me in a catch22 position of either publicly shaming the dad as a porn user or trying to save his reputation by falling on my sword and taking the blame.&quot;  30th over: Sri Lanka 133-5 (Kandamby 47, Mathews 21) I don&apos;t know what Sky are doing, but they seem to have cut away from the live cricket to show us Bob Willis in a studio presenting a feature called &apos;Inside Edge&apos;. I suppose you have to do something to fill these middle overs. On that topic, Mike Atherton wrote a superb, and entirely original, piece this week about how to fix the one-day game, I just hope that for once the people who run the game are listening to the man.  31st over: Sri Lanka 139-5 (Kandamby 49, Mathews 27) Gracious, what a shot that is. Mathews drops to one knee and carves a sweep away past backward square for four. I&apos;d be amazed if England mustered a single shot with half as much panache about it in the entirety of their innings.  Terrible poem Really nothing else to say A load of old bull Thanks for that, Michael Sones.  32nd over: Sri Lanka 141-5 (Kandamby 50, Mathews 27) Kandamby raises his fifty with a dainty glance to leg. &quot;Least Reassuring Phrases?&quot; ponders Mark Lloyd, &quot;I vividly remember the sense of despair and pointlessness which came over me whilst listening to the commentary on an Ashes test being played in Australia a few years back, with England already 2 or 3-nil down and the Waugh twins piling on the runs, when I heard the immortal lines: &apos;This one finds the gap, Tufnell&apos;s after it.&apos;&quot;  33rd over: Sri Lanka 148-5 (Kandamby 51, Mathews 34) Luke Wright accidentally palms four runs over the rope diving to to try and cut off a glance to third man from Mathews.  34th over: Sri Lanka 149-5 (Kandamby 51, Mathews 34) Collingwood spits a delivery past a defensive prod from Mathews, and the ball pings Prior on his fingertip. He staggers away from the wicket, grunting in pain. He&apos;s bowling well now Collingwood, keeping the ball up around off stump and letting it wobble around the outside edge.  35th over: Sri Lanka 157-5 (Kandamby 51, Mathews 43) Onions is back into the attack now England have a new ball to work with. &quot;Nice to see some aspiring youngsters in the crowd&quot; writes Sunil, before adding &quot;So that&apos;s what England&apos;s future players look like.&quot; Mathews chips four runs up and over mid-wicket, an audacious shot oddly rewarded with a burst of Depeche Mode over the PA system.  36th over: Sri Lanka 160-5 (Kandamby 52, Mathews 45) &quot;Oh, how to fix the one-day game, not how to fix a one-day game. Miss-read that&quot; says Damien Sefton of my link to the Times. Right, yes, I was trying to praise the man, not slander him. I should probably make that clear.  37th over: Sri Lanka 161-5 (Kandamby 52, Mathews 45) Onions appeals for a catch behind off Kandamby&apos;s inside edge, but Billy Bowden shakes his head, unconvinced. Onions pushes his next delivery out wider and tempts Mathews into a wild heave. Fortunately for him, he fails to make any contact. He pats a yorker out to leg to end the over.  WICKET! Kandamby 53 run out Wright (38th over: Sri Lanka 163-6)  Well that was foolish. Kandamby is run out after a curiously idiotic piece of running, he was trying to take a quick single to cover and the run was definitely on but for some reason Mathews just didn&apos;t want to run for it. He rather hung his partner out to dry there.  39th over: Sri Lanka 166-6 (Mathews 48, Kulasekera 0)  Mathews drives neatly through extra cover for two runs. Peter Davies has surpassed himself here:  Andy Bull&apos;s haiku,For the Champions TrophyA champion strophe Don&apos;t be ashamed if you have to google &apos;strophe&apos;, readers, you&apos;ll be in good company. &quot;England have got Luke Wright on for some reason&quot; comments a baffled Sanjay Manjrekar.  40th over: Sri Lanka 170-6 (Mathews 51, Kulasekera 1)  &quot;You describe Michael Atherton&apos;s article on how to fix the 50-over game as &apos;superb&apos;&quot; grumbles Ben Howell, &quot;I can only see two proposals: allow captains to put fielders where they want for the first 40 overs, and allow bowlers as many overs as they like. Really? So Murali and Mendis bowling 25 overs each to a defensive field is the blueprint for a revival in 50-over cricket? Can&apos;t see it myself \u2013 but then it&apos;s Friday, I&apos;m tired, ale is calling and I may have missed something crucial. If so, I&apos;ll happily shut up.&quot; Amen to your last sentence Ben. Maybe superb was over-doing it, but broadening Atherton&apos;s point out from those two specifics his point is that all the attempts to improve one-day cricket have made it more formulaic by limiting the decision-making of the players. To make the game more spontaneous and varied the Laws should be taken in the opposite direction: scrap all fielding and bowling restrictions, junk the powerplays. Just allow fifty overs a side and leave the rest to the players... it is, at any rate, an original argument. WICKET! Or is it? The Sri Lankans are protesting that they&apos;ve been obstructed by the field here. Mathews has been run out, but only after he had collided with Onions as he turned back for a second run. The umpires confer, and Mathews walks. But no! He&apos;s been called back onto the field. Mathews innings continues. Strauss has called the batsman back, mindful of the fallout from what happened against New Zealand last year perhaps, when Collingwood upheld the dismissal of Grant Elliot. Onions was not in the wrong there, so Strauss may have been a little over-generous. Good sportsmanship? Or naive captaincy?  WICKET! Mathews c Prior b Wright (41st over: Sri Lanka 180-7)  Mathews wallops four over Strauss&apos; head at slip with a terrific flourish. That&apos;s all she wrote though, as Mathews snicks the next ball behind towards Prior, who takes a good low catch. Here&apos;s Muttiah Muralitharan then, slapping the first ball of the over out towards the rope at mid-wicket for two runs.  42nd over: Sri Lanka 191-7 (Kulasekara 7, Muralitharan 14)  Sri Lanka take their powerplay. And there&apos;s the reason why: Murali swats his second ball for six back over Stuart Broad&apos;s head. That&apos;s a ridiculous shot. In fact it almost defies my vocabulary. Sky are showing the replays of that run out, Strauss definitely recalled the batsman, to the obvious disgust and disbelief of his players, visible in the picture over his shoulder. When Mathews was out again moments later he had the good grace to say thanks to England for recalling him. Murali smears four more to fine leg with another cross-batted swipe.  43rd over: Sri Lanka 196-7 (Kulasekara 7, Muralitharan 17)  Dropped! Murali lofts another ludicrous shot out to leg, and Strauss tracks back looking over his shoulder at deep backward square. He takes the catch, and the ball then tumbles out of his grasp and falls to earth. &quot;You say po-tay-to I say po-tah-to&quot; says Grant Cartledge of that piece by Atherton, &quot;You say &apos;original argument&apos;, I say &apos;Bairstow on the boundary&apos;.&quot; Yes, Mike Brearley really did put his wicketkeeper field at long stop. In fairness Atheron does say that he would keep restrictions in for the last ten overs, making that situation a little less likely to occur.  WICKET! Muralitharan 18 b Broad (44th over: Sri Lanka 198-8) Broad clean bowls Murali with a straight delivery that hits the top of off as Murali allows himself another wild slash. WICKET! Malinga 0 b Broad (Sri Lanka 197-9) He then repeats the delivery and removes Lasith Malinga for a golden duck, putting him on a hat trick. Mendis just manages to play away the hat-trick delivery, throwing his bat out before him like a man trying to deter a raging bull by tossing a towel over its horns and hoping for the best.  45th over: Sri Lanka 200-9 (Kulasekara 9, Mendis 0) &quot;Good sportsmanship from Strauss&quot; says Steve Anthony, &quot;the respect he&apos;ll get for recalling the batsman far outweighs the criticism he&apos;d get for not doing so. Mature and far-sighted captaincy, not naive at all.&quot; I agree, though it&apos;s a lot easier to take that view when the reprieved batsmen gets out two balls later. Sri Lanka creep up to 200 as the final pair swap singles.  46th over: Sri Lanka 208-9 (Kulasekara 16, Mendis 3) Mercy. Broad drops short and wide, and Kulasekara leans back and cracks away an almighty cut shot, played with both feet off the ground, the ball flying up and over the boundary rope at backward point for six. England, by the way, are five overs behind the over rate.  47th over: Sri Lanka 211-9 (Kulasekara 17, Mendis 5) Anderson comes off, and Luke Wright comes on. No, no I don&apos;t know either. He clangs Mendis on the glove with a heavy bouncer. Three irritating singles ensue. Paul Collingwood almost takes a superb diving catch at point from the final ball, but he&apos;s not sure himself whether it carried. He stands there, arm aloft, an uncertain look on his face. The umpires confer and then send it up for TV replays, which prove predictably inconclusive. The third umpire settles on &apos;not out&apos; because he can&apos;t really tell either way.  WICKET! Mendis 5 c Strauss b Anderson (48th over: Sri Lanka 212) (Kulasekara 17) Anderson gives up a wide with a bouncer. And then, at last, England take the final wicket, as Mendis edges a catch through to Strauss, who topples over low to his left to take it. That&apos;s quite a comeback from Sri Lanka, given that they were 17-4.  So England need 213 for an unlikely win, which, against Murali and Mendis under lights, will be far from as easy as it looks. I&apos;ll be back in 30 minutes or so to tell you how it all unfolds, see you then.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: England 2-0 (Strauss 1, Denly 0) need 213 Here we go then. You don&apos;t need to have Rasputin-like powers to predict that England are going to be content to crawl along at 3.5 runs an over for most of their innings, slipping slowly behind the run rate, most likely they&apos;ll continue like that until the pressure gets to be too great and they collapse in a heap ending up 36 runs shy of the target. Malinga opens the attack. Strauss nudges his second delivery away for a single towards mid-wicket. Denly gropes around, playing across his pad. A no ball gives him a free hit and... Denly can&apos;t even get his bat on the ball, which was slow and straight.  2nd over: England 2-0 (Strauss 1, Denly 0) need 213 It&apos;s a curious truth that free hits hardly ever seem to go to the boundary. Anyway, here&apos;s Nuwan Kulasekara, currently the world&apos;s no1 ranked ODI bowler. The first four balls land on off stump and jag past Strauss&apos;s ponderous defensive strokes. The fifth prompts an appeal for caught behind, and for a moment Sky second-guess the umpire and make England&apos;s score 2-1. Bowden is not so quick to judge, and after a long pause he shakes his head and Strauss is reprieved.  3rd over: England 5-0 (Strauss 3, Denly 1) need 213 Denly hustles a single. Strauss then squirts a fortuitous edge away past gully to long leg and England take two runs. Malinga&apos;s next delivery cuts him in two, cutting back off the pitch between bat and pad, leaving Strauss sucking his teeth.  WICKET! Denly 5 LBW Kulasekara (4th over: England 9-1) need 213 Denly plays a fine Chinese cut away for four to fine leg. If only he&apos;d meant it. And he&apos;s out next ball, drawing wild whoops of jubilation from the Lankan fielders. Owais Shah is in then, and so, it seems, is the rot.  5th over: England 15-1 (Strauss 8, Shah 1) need 213 &quot;Well what did Denly do wrong here?&quot; intones Bob Willis as Sky show the replay of the wicket, &quot;well not much, apart from missing the ball with his bat.&quot; Quite. Strauss pulls a short ball away for one to leg. &quot;This is the England one-day side I remember&quot; says Sara Torvalds, &quot;after a recognizable first three overs: the run rate is approaching the negative and I safely predict game will be lost in the first fifteen overs. Obviously, the first overs of Sri Lanka&apos;s innings was a momentary aberration.&quot; Shah blocks out a yorker away to leg, and Strauss then cracks a deliciously crisp cut to backward point, where Dilshan makes a good stop. Strauss drops his bat on yet another yorker at the end of the over, the ball running away for four to fine leg.  6th over: England 19-1 (Strauss 8, Shah 1) need 213 Shah hustles two leg byes - punctuated by a single from Strauss - and Kulasekara then gives up a wide.  7th over: England 19-1 (Strauss 8, Shah 1) need 213 Mathews is into the attack now, plying his wobbly medium-fast. Rather unbelievably, Shah leaves each of Mathews&apos; six innocuous deliveries well alone, playing a series of exaggeratedly emphatic leaves.  WICKET! Strauss 9 c Kandamby b Kulasekara (8th over: England 19-2) need 213 Wow. What a catch that is by Kandamby at mid-wicket. Strauss fairly clobbered a fierce pull shot out to leg, but Kandamby leapt and plucked it from the air as it whistled overhead. Collingwood is in and hopping about, trying to scratch out his first run. He pats the first ball out to leg and for some inexplicable reason at the non-striker&apos;s end Owais Shah gets his feet into a tangle and falls over face-first onto the wicket. At least he wasn&apos;t on strike at the time I suppose, the hapless ninny.  9th over: England 22-2 (Shah 1, Collingwood 0) need 213 Mathews beats Collingwood&apos;s outside edge with an away-swinger. &quot;Not only is there no TMS on BBC radio,&quot; gripes Gary Naylor, &quot;but I&apos;ve just listened to about 45 minutes of the usual inanities on FiveLive without a single update on the match - as if it wasn&apos;t happening. The BBC really, really hate cricket don&apos;t they?&quot; Depends entirely on whether they&apos;ve got the rights to broadcast it or not, unfortunately. And I&apos;m sure they had to devote a good 25 minutes to some big piece of news like, ohh I don&apos;t know, Marlon Harewood moving to Newcastle or somesuch bunkum.  10th over: England 36-2 (Shah 1, Collingwood 15) need 213 Well I never, what a shot. Collingwood shows some chutzpah by stepping down the pitch and lofting Kulasekara&apos;s latest delivery up and over mid-wicket for six. He glances the next ball fine to leg for four and all of a sudden, for the first time in a long time, England look like they have a decent one-day batsman in their ranks again. He steps out again and cocks his leg as he carts four more away through backward square. That&apos;s 14 from three deliveries.  11th over: England 46-2 (Shah 2, Collingwood 23) need 213 Shah wisely takes a single from the first ball, realising that, almost uniquely in their recent history, England have an in-form batsman at one end. Collingwood duly leans on a cover drive, and the ball hurtles across the turf through cover for four. He stands tall and clips the fifth delivery wide of mid-on for four more. T6he man&apos;s on fire! He&apos;s hit 22 from his last eight balls. He sprints a single from the sixth delivery to ensure he holds onto the strike. I honestly can&apos;t recall the last time I saw an English batsman play with such assurance in a one-day game.  12th over: England 47-2 (Shah 2, Collingwood 23) need 213 The first key bowling change: Sangakkara brings Ajantha Mendis into the attack. England have never faced him before outside of a net. Frankly, anyone who has watched them much at all over the last few years won&apos;t be fancying their chances much against the mystery spinner. Collingwood gropes at him a drunken salaryman on a packed Tokyo commuter train, before taking a single to leg allowing Shah a chance to prod forward, bat in front of pad.  13th over: England 47-2 (Shah 2, Collingwood 23) need 213 &quot;Come on Andy&quot; exhorts Gary Naylor while Collingwood plays out a maiden, &quot;you know that the BBC could acquire rights if they were prepared to pay for them. That&apos;s a commercial decision and they have chosen not to do so, as well as choosing to cover England&apos;s forthcoming tour to South Africa on the cheap. Whilst it suits the BBC to appear impecunious, it is a vast organisation with cashflow security like no other enterprise on the planet - despite that, it never quite has enough money, time, bandwidth whatever for doing cricket properly. You&apos;ll be sure to press the red button to see an interview with a Force India wheel-changer won&apos;t you, as one BBC talking head hands over to another at the other end of the Singapore pits?&quot; More importantly Gary, when are they going to give you your own talk radio show?  14th over: England 52-2 (Shah 7, Collingwood 25) need 213 Shah takes a huge backlift and then clumps four up and over mid-off off Mendis&apos; first ball. Otherwise he is playing the spinner with his bat well out in front of his pad, a series of good-looking solid defensive strokes.  15th over: England 55-2 (Shah 9, Collingwood 26) need 213 Mathews is still plugging away, pegging back England&apos;s run rate after that aggressive flurry from Collingwood a few moments back. England muster three singles from his latest over.  16th over: England 56-2 (Shah 10, Collingwood 26) need 213 Shah slaps a chip back over mid-on off Mendis&apos; first ball. Seems his plan is to try and take a boundary from him early in the over and then settle into a string of forward defensive strokes for the remainder. His single here puts Collingwood on strike though, and he seems altogether less certain of his technique against the spinner.  17th over: England 63-2 (Shah 12, Collingwood 31) need 213 Mathews continues, his spell stretching into a sixth straight over. Maybe he is just beginning to flag: Collingwood snicks four fortuitous runs to fine leg off the inside edge, and then, as Mathews&apos; line creeps too wide, he adds a sharp single. Shah squeezes another to short fine leg.  18th over: England 71-2 (Shah 12, Collingwood 38) need 213 Malinga is back into the attack - I wonder why Sangakkara is keeping Murali waiting so long? Shah stares back down the track with that freakish wide-eyed intensity, manically chewing gum as he waits for the first ball. That runs away for a leg bye, and Collingwood then comes on strike. He is almost diddled out of his wicket by a slower ball that ricochets off the leading edge towards, but just short, of mid-off. Cripes. That&apos;s another six from Collingwood, who picks up a short ball from Malinga and deposits it over square leg with a terrific crack.  19th over: England 73-2 (Shah 12, Collingwood 39) need 213 &quot;I&apos;m disappointed that no-one has come up with the obvious solution for learning to bat against Mendis&quot; says Paul Headon, &quot;when you&apos;ve never faced him before. When Fernando Alonso turned up at a grand prix track he&apos;d never driven on before, he announced that it wouldn&apos;t be a problem, because he&apos;d studied it on the xbox. Where is that initiative, that nous, from England&apos;s batsmen? I want to see Andy Flower up there in front of the press, announcing that &apos;we&apos;re going to score bucketfuls of runs off him, because Colly&apos;s been plugging away on Brian Lara Cricket, and can score 20 an over against him, no problem&apos;.&quot;  WICKET! Collingwood 46 b Malinga (20th over: England 82-3) need 213 I don&apos;t know what Collingwood has had for breakfast today, but being dropped from the England team seems to have done him the power of good: that&apos;s his third six of the innings. Again it&apos;s lofted up and over backward square leg, and again it doesn&apos;t just clear the rope but sails well over it and deep into the crowd. And then, sadly, he&apos;s out. He&apos;s played on to his own stumps. How disappointing. That was the most assertive innings he has played in a long while, and he&apos;s furious that it is over, kicking at the pitch in frustration. Morgan is welcomed to the wicket with a yorker from Malinga, which he digs out easily enough.  21st over: England 82-3 (Shah 13, Morgan 0) need 213 Sangakkara roars out an appeal for a catch behind off the outside edge, but umpire Dar merely raises a disapproving eyebrow and looks in the other direction. The question is whether now England have lost a wicket, they&apos;re going to collapse into a heap despite having built a near-match-winning platform. &quot;The BBC may have chosen not to bid for any televised cricket rights, but you&apos;ve got to respect their track record on deciding what sport to spend our licence fee on,&quot; says Michael Foreman, &quot;It&apos;s not like they&apos;d spunk \u00a31 million of our money on Audley Harrison&apos;s first 10 professional fights or anything.&quot; Do you want to add the &apos;eh? Oh&apos; yourself Michael, or shall I do it for you?  22nd over: England 87-3 (Shah 16, Morgan 2) need 213 Still no sign of Muralitharan, though you&apos;d think he&apos;d be just the man to prise open the middle-order now there&apos;s a new batsman in. Shah and Morgan swap singles. &quot;&apos;Cripes. That&apos;s another six from Collingwood, who picks up a short ball from Malinga and deposits it over square leg with a terrific crack&apos;&quot; quotes Sam Jordison back at me, before asking &quot;Did you go on holiday to the 1950s?&quot; Truth be told my mind is starting to drift away. It&apos;s the jet lag you see. Far as my body is concerned it is 3.30am in the morning. Either that or it&apos;s just the bog standard brain-rot that affects all sports journalists if they stay in the business too long. Anyway, Sam adds as a sign-off: &quot;PS That&apos;s not a criticism, I&apos;m enjoying the commentary and the retro-flourishes make it all the more jolly. Let&apos;s hope our chaps biff some more of those sixes!&quot;  23rd over: England 93-3 (Shah 17, Morgan 6) need 213 And here is Muralitharan at last. That familiar cheeky grin spread across his face as he plots and schemes over his next wicket. I hope that when Murali retires next year he gets his due from the Western press. In comparison to the praise they lavish on Warne, he deserves more plaudits than he gets. He has, after all, every bit as strong a claim to being the greatest spin bowler to play the game. Anyway, Morgan and Shah take singles to and fro, and there&apos;s a wide as well, so it&apos;s six from Murali&apos;s first over.  24th over: England 101-3 (Shah 17, Morgan 14) need 213 And at the other end comes Ajantha Mendis. Morgan premeditates a paddle-sweep, and succeeds in edging the ball up and over Sangakkara&apos;s head and away for four. He clumps a drive away to deep cover, where Laith Malinga makes a terrible hash of fielding the ball and gifts the batsman another boundary.  25th over: England 106-3 (Shah 18, Morgan 18) need 213 Morgan snicks four runs off his outside edge and away through third man as he drives towards cover. He&apos;s now drawn level with Shah, despite facing only 16 balls as opposed to the Shah&apos;s 44. &quot;Paul Headon (19th over) may be on to something,&quot; says Phil Sawyer, &quot;but I fear that Shah has been taking lessons from Piquet Jr rather than Alonso. How else to explain his consistent efforts to run himself out and get the safety car that is England&apos;s middle order in. Someone should explain to him that slowing things down to a crawl for a few laps may lead to a surprise win in F1, but slowing England&apos;s run rate down in an ODI has exactly the opposite effect - an insipid loss that absolutely no-one is surprised by.&quot; Mmmhmm. Shah&apos;s strike rate is a turgid 40 at the moment.  26th over: England 108-3 (Shah 18, Morgan 20) need 213 Morgan sets himself for another paddle sweep, and this time he gets the ball away around the corner for a single. Without wishing to curse the man, he&apos;s playing well, making the most of the luck he has had.  27th over: England 116-3 (Shah 20, Morgan 26) need 213 Another streaky shot from Morgan, who strides out to try and force Murali through the off and instead snicks four runs fine past Sangakkara&apos;s grasping gloves.  28th over: England 118-3 (Shah 21, Morgan 27) need 213 The innings meanders on, as Mendis ties up the English batsmen. They&apos;re complicit in it of course, content as they are to ease their way along in singles.  29th over: England 121-3 (Shah 22, Morgan 28) need 213 Three more singles for England. &quot;Totally agree with the sentiments expressed about the Beeb&apos;s dislike of cricket,&quot; opines Martin Duckworth, &quot;I suspect it&apos;s because those in charge at Auntie grew up in the days when BBC&apos;s cricket coverage occupied the entire schedule rain or shine and were consequently bored to tears. Personally, I long for the days of Benaud and Jim Laker, with dear old Peter West saying stuff like, &apos;Well as there doesn&apos;t seem to be much likelihood of play at The Oval for some time, what we&apos;re going to do is take you back to 1976 when these two sides played a great match here. We join the action with the West Indies on five without loss with Bob Willis bowling to Gordon Greenidge.&apos; Ah, bliss.&quot; Quite.  30th over: England 130-3 (Shah 29, Morgan 31) need 213 Kulasekara is back into the attack now, as Sangakkara goes searching for that elusive wicket. Shah sloppily pulls a single out to mid-wicket. He&apos;s scoring so slowly that I almost expect to see his score start rolling back towards zero. Well maybe he heard that out in the middle - he&apos;s flicked the fourth six of the innings up and over leg from the very next ball. He made that look very easy indeed, just cocking his wrists as he pulled the ball, angling its trajectory up and over the infield.  31st over: England 136-3 (Shah 31, Morgan 34) need 213 Y&quot;ou&apos;re absolutely spot on about Murali,&quot; writes Phil Sawyer most agreeably, &quot;His achievements should be celebrated. The secret of his success is not the congenital defect in his arm - if anything, the constant questioning of his action would have destroyed someone less able to cope with the constant pressure and accusations - rather it is in his extremely flexible wrist and marvellous control of the ball. Criticising him for this would be like saying that it&apos;s unfair that Usain Bolt has very fast legs.&quot; Murali&apos;s not having the best match tionight though, he&apos;s on again now, giving up a string of singles - four in a row in fact -and then a wide as well.  32nd over: England 138-3 (Shah 31, Morgan 34) need 213 Kulasekara switches around the wicket, and has Morgan limply prodding at a slower ball. Morgan steers a run away to fine leg, and Shah then threads another through cover.  33rd over: England 146-3 (Shah 37, Morgan 35) need 213 Guru Singh needs your help. He&apos;s cycling from Oxford to Cambridge to raise money for the British Heart Foundation. He&apos;s sent me five emails in this innings alone asking for a plug so I figure it&apos;s probably time to give him one. If you&apos;d like to sponsor him click here. Shah whacks four more through extra cover and, dare I say it, it&apos;s all beginning to look a little easy. Surely England can&apos;t lose this now.  34th over: England 151-3 (Shah 39, Morgan 37) need 213 &quot;It&apos;s happening again&quot; wails John Richards, &quot;I&apos;m getting lulled into believing England can do this. It doesn&apos;t matter how often the inevitable happens, I still fall for it. Oddly, my lullability increases with each beer. Should I stop drinking... or keep going? It&apos;s a dilemma.&quot; That&apos;s no kind of dilemma from where I&apos;m sitting, but then I&apos;m a very thirsty man. The 150 comes up with a wide from Kulasekara. Morgan then squirts a run out to mid-on.  WICKET! Shah 44 c Sangakkara b Muralitharan (35th over: England 158-4) need 213 Presumably it&apos;s too little coming along too late but that&apos;s a lovely piece of bowling by Murali, baffling Shah with a doosra that pitches on leg and then turns to beats the bat. Sangakkara gathers the catch and scoops off the bails for good measure.  36th over: England 159-4 (Morgan 40, Prior 0) need 213 And immediately Sangakkara brings Mendis back into the attack. He&apos;s not given up on his hopes of a dramatic English collapse yet. And a googly draws a huge LBW appeal from Mendis as Prior fails to pick it and is rapped on the pad. He survives, just. Sally Ledger sent me this one just a few moments ago: &quot;Whoever it is commentating on Sky (apologies for my ignorance) has just said that England have got to do something pretty stupid to lose this now. Have they not watched England in one day cricket before? And shame on you too...&apos;Surely England can&apos;t lose this now?&apos; I mean really. I know you&apos;ve been on holiday but things haven&apos;t changed that much in two weeks.&quot;  37th over: England 163-4 (Morgan 41, Prior 2) need 213 Prior gets off zero with a sweep to short fine leg where Samaraweera fumbles the ball, much to Murali&apos;s irritation.  38th over: England 166-4 (Morgan 42, Prior 4) need 213 With England needing 50 runs from 78 balls, Sanga throws the ball to Malinga, giving him his third spell of the innings. Was Shah stumped, caught, or bowled? Well truth be told I sprinted to the toilet as soon as I saw the umpire&apos;s finger go up and was still there when they were showing the replays so I&apos;ve no idea. Everyone else seems to think he was caught though, so I&apos;ve indulged in a little retrospective editing. Yet more Stalinist journalism here on the OBO.  39th over: England 169-4 (Morgan 43, Prior 5) need 213 Prior pushes a single down to long-on, and the game rather dawdles onwards to its conclusion.  40th over: England 170-4 (Morgan 43, Prior 6) need 213 Prior cuts away a run from the first ball, and Morgan then spends the rest of the over trying, but failing, to get Malinga off the square. Possibly irked by his temporary ineptitude, Malinga whistles a visious bouncer past Morgan&apos;s nose and indulges in a long follow-through, standing staring and snorting at the batsman.  41st over: England 180-4 (Morgan 44, Prior 14) need 213 Prior clips two runs out to mid-wicket off Murali, and then, after a pair of singles, he drops to one knee and slaps a slog sweep past deep backward square for four. Murali&apos;s ten overs have cost a rather flabbergasting - given that this is England after all - sixty runs, ten of them from that last over.  42nd over: England 186-4 (Morgan 51, Prior 15) need 213 Morgan raises his second fifty for England by thrashing a high-risk straight drive through mid-off and away to the rope for four. The shot almost cost him his wicket, but the ball burst through the fielder&apos;s hands and raced on to the boundary. It&apos;s been a fine innings, albeit a very lucky one too.  43rd over: England 194-4 (Morgan 53, Prior 20) need 213 Prior belts four down the ground, and then tries to leather four more through extra cover but bags only a single as he picks out the sweeper. More grumbles about the Beeb come from Keiran Taylor: &quot;I thought I&apos;d put the radio on to listen to the cricket and the BBCs dedicated sports channel are broadcasting some deeply boring men talking about their sunday league team - Jarrow. Bloody Jarrow FC. The England Cricket team are playing live and the BBC thinks the nation will be more interested in Jarrow Football Club. Not even people who live in Jarrow give a flying one about them. Maybe I can go onto sports extra and hear live commentry of Huddesfield U-12s 5-a-side football team.&quot;  44th over: England 205-4 (Morgan 61, Prior 21) need 213 Malinga flings down another wide, and then peppers Morgan with short balls. He&apos;s looked very uncomfortable against Malinga all night long, taking three runs from the 16 balls he&apos;s received from him. And then, of course, just as I type that, Morgan clatters four runs through backward point as Malinga allows him a little too much width. The response is an eye-wateringly quick bouncer that speeds past Morgan&apos;s head. He&apos;s not put out by this though, and he carves the sixth ball of the over for four past cover. That&apos;s almost his finest hot of the innings.  45th over: England 213-4 (Morgan 61, Prior 27) need 213 &quot;Blimey,&quot; gawps Sally Ledger, &quot;I&apos;m actually starting to believe. Eight from six overs... do you think we can scrape over the line now?&quot; Prior forces two through extra cover, cracks four more through the same area and then takes a single to allow Morgan to squirt the winning run out to cover off his edge. Well who&apos;d have thought it. England have won by six wickets.  The English team are all grinning like loons which seems fair enough given few people thought they had even the remotest chance of winning this - least of all myself. &quot;Speaking of Strictly&quot; says my old mucker Andrew Fraser, and I wasn&apos;t actually speaking of Strictly at all, but what they hey, &quot;Zoe Lucker&apos;s on which makes me think have we got the wags (and Gary Kirsten) to thank for this? Or is it just the theory that you put 11 chimps (in whites) on a cricket pitch and eventually they&apos;ll win a 50 over match?&quot;  Atherton and Nasser are grinning like schoolboys - they both called it correctly at the start of play. I&apos;d love to stay and talk a little longer, but I&apos;m not going to, &apos;cause it&apos;s late and I&apos;m tired and confused. I&apos;ll be back here on Tuesday for England&apos;s next match, see you then. Thanks for all the company and emails, and cheerio."}, {"sentences": ["The near silence of the Tokyo crowd \u2013 Tyson&apos;s trainer Aaron Snowell said &quot;you could hear a rat piss on cotton&quot; \u2013 only added to the eerie, almost Lynchian feeling."], "tags": ["Football", "Rugby World Cup 2003", "Sport", "Rugby union", "Mike Tyson", "Shane Warne", "Cricket", "Jonny Wilkinson", "Kenny Dalglish", "Rugby World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T12:33:41Z", "title": "The Joy of Six: JFK moments | Rob Smyth", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/25/joy-of-six-jfk-moments", "article": "1. Buster Douglas beats Mike Tyson, 11/02/1990 With the possible exception of Ian Beale&apos;s lovemaking, nothing has moved the earth in modern times quite like the events of the second weekend of February 1990. Nelson Mandela was freed after 27 years in prison; Tottenham won at Chelsea, something they have not done since; and James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas beat up the baddest man on the planet, Mike Tyson, real bad. It was a victory that can never be fully explained. The tyrannical brutality of Tyson had brought him 37 straight victories and a public reaction that mixed awe and revulsion. All but one betting parlour would not even give odds on Douglas, an habitual underachiever who was blessed with all the tools but had little idea how to use them. But the death of his mother 23 days before the bout enabled him to enter a zone of absolute serenity in which he jabbed Tyson into submission. The near silence of the Tokyo crowd \u2013 Tyson&apos;s trainer Aaron Snowell said &quot;you could hear a rat piss on cotton&quot; \u2013 only added to the eerie, almost Lynchian feeling. You never forget where you are when you hear that the champ has gone down. It&apos;s the same when Brazil go out of a football World Cup or New Zealand a rugby World Cup. Yet when most of England woke to the news on the Sunday morning, the news that Douglas had been felled in the eighth before knocking out Tyson in the 10th engendered a sense that he had somehow held on and hit Tyson with a freakish right-hander. Far from it: in fact it was Tyson who almost got lucky with an isolated uppercut in that eighth round. Otherwise this was a clinical demolition from start to finish, and the image of Tyson on his knees, patting wretchedly at fresh air as he tries to find his gumshield, is one of the most iconic in sport. &quot;If there was a Richter scale for sporting earthquakes,&quot; Hugh McIlvanney wrote in the Observer, &quot;what happened would have to be considered two or three points clear of any other shock in twentieth-century boxing.&quot; And, because of an even greater societal earthquake, it was hardly mentioned on the front page of the next day&apos;s Guardian. 2. Jonny Wilkinson&apos;s drop goal wins the rugby World Cup, 22/11/2003 There is an argument that JFK moments should intrinsically involve off-field action, because when a contest is taking place we are always aware that something might happen and should therefore be immune to surprise. And while that isn&apos;t entirely illogical, it ignores the fact that some things, even if they are vaguely on the cards, are so momentous that you will never forget them: the first touch of a new lover, the first restraining order, or England winning a World Cup. What were you doing when they did just that in 2003? While the majority took advantage of the Saturday-morning kick-off to embark on a stunning bender, those of us who had failed to plan ahead and book the day off work had to watch it at home without recourse to pints of Fast-Acting Nerve Calmer. The end of the match brought a single text message that read simply: &quot;Bloody hell, we did it.&quot; It was all so gossamery as to be the textual equivalent of an awkward handshake \u2013 no eye contact please, we&apos;re British \u2013 after curing cancer, or a pitiful post-coital &quot;Thank you&quot;. As such, it felt like a perfectly English response to a peculiarly English triumph. 3. Adelaide, 05/12/2006 Where were you while Warne was getting high? The most numbing, traumatic and downright magical sporting defeat many of us have ever experienced did not have a specific JFK moment \u2013 although Shane Warne bowling Kevin Pietersen around his legs was the point at which a strikingly low-key day&apos;s play snapped brusquely into the horror genre \u2013 but for most in this country it was experienced as such: people had gone to bed safe in the knowledge that a draw was nailed-on, and then woke to have the horrific news relayed by teletext, house-mate, partner, radio, David Gower, Blackberry, black dog, whatever. In writing the Guardian&apos;s over-by-over report, I felt as alone in the world as the bloke in 28 Days Later: first because nobody was emailing in (not even Gary Naylor), and then because, after our then night editor left, it was just me and the coffee machine experiencing what was, for all the partisan disappointment, one of the truly great nights of sport \u2013 the sort of night that makes you want to engage someone, anyone; to come within a whisker of eulogising Shane Warne to the coffee machine, perhaps a consequence of watching too much Wonderfalls; to greet a bleary-eyed cleaner, with whom you had previously shared nothing more than a few ineptly handled workplace formalities, like a long-lost brother and immediately demand whether he likes cricket because OMGHAVEYOUSEENWHAT&apos;SHAPPENED?!?!?! He shook his head. For different reasons, the rest of us would be doing the same for days after. 4. Kenny Dalglish resigns as Liverpool manager, 22/02/1991 In hindsight it made perfect sense. You just had to look at the slack-jawed bewilderment on Dalglish&apos;s face during the astonishing 4-4 draw with Everton 36 hours earlier to realise that he was mentally shot, but at the time not a soul saw it coming. These days, most big sports stories are pre-empted by a newspaper exclusive or gossip on an internet forum; Dalglish&apos;s sudden, tearful resignation was entirely unexpected and, as the headline in this paper put it, truly beyond everybody&apos;s Ken. Had Sky Sports News been going then their breaking news ticker, and the tickers of their hyperactive, hyperbolic presenters, would have exploded. Instead it was left to teletext to confirm what had been urgently relayed upon our return from a particular half-term treat: a Friday-morning trip into town to see Sittingbourne&apos;s various landmarks \u2013 the library, Woolworths, John Menzies \u2013 while whistling one of the less unpalatable tunes from Now 18 (we like to think it was Fascinating Rhythm by Bass-O-Matic, but it was probably The Joker by The Steve Miller Band). The previous season Liverpool had won their 18th league title, also their third in five seasons under Dalglish, and they had started their title defence with a scorching run of 12 wins and a draw from the first 13. Yet George Graham&apos;s hungrier young Arsenal side began to gobble up the gap, and Liverpool started to look their age. Dalglish began to make some seriously eccentric decisions: he played four full-backs away at Arsenal, bought Jimmy Carter and David Speedie; more importantly, nobody had realised the extent to which Hillsborough had drained him. Despite all that, Liverpool were still top of the table when Dalglish quit. Few envisaged the seismic impact his decision would have on the landscape of English football: 18 months later Liverpool would finish outside the top five for the first time since the mid-Sixties; 18 years later Dalglish would still be the last Liverpool manager to win a league title. 5. The death of Ben Hollioake, 22/03/2002 One of the best and worst things about listening to sport on the radio is when you turn on mid-match and, before the score is given, try to discern what is happening to your team from the tone of the commentators and their particular choice of words. We all become amateur linguists, and the moment is fascinatingly pregnant with possibilities. A personal memory is of waking up and turning on TalkSport around 40 minutes into England&apos;s tour of South Africa in 1999-2000 to hear Mark Nicholas praise the solidity of Chris Adams&apos;s forward defensive. Adams had been scheduled to bat at No6 on his debut, so there must have been a last-minute reshuffle in the order. Right? That anxious desire to find out the score quickly evaporated during an apparently mundane Test between New Zealand and England two winters later. After turning to Test Match Special a few minutes late for the second day&apos;s play following the family tree episode of Black Books (whatever happened to must-see Friday-night TV?), it was instantly apparent from the solemn tone of Jonathan Agnew&apos;s voice that something serious had happened. A text message confirmed the horrific news that Ben Hollioake, the cherub of English cricket, had died in a car crash in Perth. Instantly, nobody cared what the score was; nor would they for the rest of the game. Hollioake&apos;s death is not a moment you necessarily want to remember, but it is one that few will forget. 6. Robert Key&apos;s maiden Test hundred, 22/07/2004 A JFK moment should theoretically be universal, yet we all have very precise and personal memories of sporting moments that, for whatever reason, mean a lot to us when the rest of the world gives barely a solitary one between them. Robert Key&apos;s maiden Test hundred in 2004 \u2013 hopefully predicted on the over-by-over earlier that morning \u2013 comes into that category. Other events just stick for no particular reason and against all logic. We&apos;re sure, for example, that someone out there remembers precisely what they were doing the moment Nicky Shorey signed a new contract at Reading on August 1 2006. This is, of course, spectacularly sad \u2013 Nicky Shorey probably doesn&apos;t remember what he was doing the moment Nicky Shorey signed a new contract at Reading on August 1 2006 \u2013 but we won&apos;t be throwing stones from our particular glass house."}, {"sentences": ["Or, if your tastes are more classic, visit Jasper Morrison&apos;s semi-secret little shop just down the road; you&apos;ll find perfect but anonymous designs hand-picked by Britain&apos;s celebrated minimalist, who happens to live in both Paris and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Festivals", "London holidays", "Culture", "London design festival"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T15:00:30Z", "title": "There's no such thing as British design", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/25/london-design-festival", "article": "It&apos;s the London Design festival this week, and the capital is celebrating its creativity. But if you&apos;ve been reading the International Herald Tribune or watching the BBC recently, you might wonder if there was much reason for merriment. Last month, design critic and former head of the Design Museum, Alice Rawsthorn, suggested that \u2013 at least in some respects \u2013 British design isn&apos;t what it used to be. Then what happens? Philippe Starck pops on our TV screens in a reality show called Design for Life, with a brief to &quot;save British design&quot;. There&apos;s just one problem: if there&apos;s one thing that the London Design festival repeatedly demonstrates, it&apos;s that there is no such thing as British design. At this week&apos;s official opening, mayor Boris Johnson regaled his guests with such glories as &quot;the, um, phone box \u2013 and, of course, um, Harry Beck&apos;s tube map&quot;. These cliches sustain the myth of British design genius. But design, like architecture, is fast becoming post-national. How do you classify a product designed by a German educated and based in London for a French brand manufactured in Italy? One of the showpieces of this year&apos;s festival is Jaime Hay\u00f3n&apos;s giant chess set in Trafalgar Square. It&apos;s lovely not just because of the workmanship of the man-size pieces, but because it is the festival&apos;s first public-spirited gesture in the six years it has been running. The colourful Hay\u00f3n himself is a Spaniard living in London, while his chessmen were born in the Veneto region of Italy. Not far away in Covent Garden, at the Aram Gallery, is a show of brilliant flatpack bamboo furniture by Amsterdam-based Israeli-Austrian Jair Straschnow, each piece full of craft ingenuity and innate social intelligence. Out west, in the South Kensington neighbourhood that blossoms once a year as the Brompton Design District, you can see an exhibition of work by Dutch designer Dick van Hoff in a former garage. This &quot;industrial tailor&quot; has created evocative hand-blown glass vessels fitted with what look like saw handles. Across the road, the Victoria and Albert Museum is tackling the timely theme of the return of narrative to design, in a show. The stars of Telling Tales are the likes of Dutch designers Tord Boontje and Jurgen Bey, of whom the former heads the Design Products department of our cherished Royal College of Art, and the other teaches there. Over in the east, meanwhile, drop in on a collective of young RCA graduates called Okay Studio. These wonderfully talenteddesigners live in London and hail from Holland, Spain, Israel and Norway, among other places. Or, if your tastes are more classic, visit Jasper Morrison&apos;s semi-secret little shop just down the road; you&apos;ll find perfect but anonymous designs hand-picked by Britain&apos;s celebrated minimalist, who happens to live in both Paris and Tokyo. My point is that British design is increasingly like Premier League football: it&apos;s not about British players. London is a nexus of international talent, training and investment watched by a global audience. By the same token, neither is the iPod a British design simply because Jonathan Ive, leading a team of thousands at Apple in California, is a Briton. When Rawsthorn complains about the design of new post boxes, phone boxes and buses, she&apos;s not really complaining about the decline of British design. Really what she&apos;s bemoaning is the decline of British services \u2013 the Royal Mail, public transport, banking. Politicians in the UK love paying lip service to design almost as much as they do measuring its net worth \u2013 \u00a311.6bn, according to Boris \u2013 but they are not patrons of it. National design declined when national manufacturing began to die. Ask any design-world insider for their highlight this week, and there&apos;s a chance they&apos;ll say it was the Established &amp; Sons&apos; party, hosted by this most glamorous of British furniture brands, known as much for its celebrity-studded parties as for exclusive designs such as Zaha Hadid&apos;s \u00a3180,000 table. What most of the guests won&apos;t have known is that although the company set out with the slogan &quot;Made in Great Britain&quot;, it proved an impossible ambition. Now it manufactures in Italy and India, just like everyone else. It is unfortunate that we make so little here, but what the London Design festival draws attention to each year is what a design hothouse the city is. Designers flock here from all over Europe to study and work here; the city is an international hub of ideas and dissemination. That&apos;s something to be proud of."}, {"sentences": ["Chamber music involved her in partnerships with the cellist Gaspar Cassad\u00f3, and the Emerson, Guarneri and Tokyo quartets."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Spain", "US news", "World news", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-26T18:04:37Z", "title": "Alicia de Larrocha obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/26/alicia-de-larrocha-obituary", "article": "Alicia de Larrocha, who has died aged 86, was the leading Spanish pianist of her time, and widely considered the pre-eminent interpreter of two Spanish composers of the early 20th century: Isaac Alb\u00e9niz and Enrique Granados. She was also a distinguished exponent of mainstream works from Bach, Mozart and Beethoven to Schumann and Rachmaninov. Born in Barcelona, she had a natural advantage in native repertoire, since both her mother and her aunt had been pupils of Granados, although neither of her two sisters nor her brother took much interest in the piano. In mellow middle age, Larrocha recalled that at two she had been a determined infant, and banged her head on the floor until it bled, just to be allowed to play. Her aunt began teaching her, having discovered that her niece could reproduce the melody and most of the harmony of one of Grieg&apos;s Lyric Pieces after hearing it played by one of her pupils. At three, Larrocha began lessons, on her own insistence, with the legendary Frank Marshall, an Englishman who settled in Spain and had himself been a pupil of Granados; he was director of his own academy in Barcelona, where Larrocha succeeded him after his death in 1959. Yet Larrocha was not the child prodigy of which legends are made, and she was certainly never exploited as such. Right up to her 20s, her parents never pushed her, and she enjoyed a secure, quiet upbringing. Marshall remained her only teacher, though she came into contact with distinguished musicians from an early age, meeting Artur Rubinstein when she was five. That was the age at which she played some minuets by Bach and Mozart at the International Exhibition in Barcelona. She advanced to learning Scarlatti and Schumann, but did not touch Spanish music until her teens. When she was 12 she played Mozart&apos;s Coronation Concerto, No 26 in D major K537, with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra conducted by Enrique Fernandez Arbus, orchestrator of Alb\u00e9niz&apos;s Iberia. During the Spanish civil war, Marshall left Spain, and Larrocha played simply for herself, with coaching from her aunt, and also composed some music, which she modestly dismissed afterwards as trifles. Apart from occasional invitations to play in Paris and Switzerland, she had no definite career until after the second world war, when from 1947 onwards she began touring Europe extensively. She first visited the US in 1955, when she played Mozart&apos;s Concerto No 23 in A major K488 and Falla&apos;s Nights in the Gardens of Spain with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and she was launched in earnest there by five concerts with the New York Philharmonic in 1965. Meanwhile, in 1958, Larrocha had married a fellow pianist, Juan Torra, with whom she had played as a duo when they were both students of Marshall. He subsequently taught at the Academia Marshall, becoming co-director with her, and advised her on programmes. They had a son, Juan, and daughter, Alicia, with whom Larrocha regretted not spending more of her time \u2013 she left for a concert tour of South America when her son was one month old \u2013 yet it was her husband who spurred her on. Larrocha did not regard herself as a specialist, yet her reputation rests very largely on her playing of Alb\u00e9niz and Grandados. In itself this is remarkable, because she had small hands (she was also short in stature, only 4ft 9in), and Alb\u00e9niz&apos;s music in particular calls for a large stretch with its enormous chords and intricate textures. She was lucky to have a long fifth finger, however, and a wide stretch between thumb and index finger, so that she could reach a tenth, whereas some, though not many, pianists can hardly manage more than an octave. All her life she also practised hand-stretching exercises, and was assiduous at practising altogether, because she loved it. She recorded the major works of both composers, including Iberia and the Suite Espa\u00f1ola by Alb\u00e9niz, and Goyescas by Granados, several times. The playing is above all controlled, formal (checking the opposite tendency in both composers&apos; styles, grounded as they were in folk music and improvisation), yet it is also warm, with a radiant, jewel-like tone quality. It avoids overstatement and impulsiveness and is in immaculate taste. Larrocha had a wide repertoire, but two composers with whom she was particularly associated were Mozart and Schumann. She had recorded several of Mozart&apos;s concertos with various orchestras and conductors before embarking on a series with the English Chamber Orchestra and Colin Davis in the early 1990s that was never completed. Earlier, in the 1970s, she recorded two of Rachmaninov&apos;s concertos \u2013 the first and the third, one of the most gruelling of all virtuoso warhorses \u2013 with the London Symphony Orchestra and Andr\u00e9 Previn, which is not so surprising for someone who managed the near-unplayable extravagances of Alb\u00e9niz with such aplomb. The Philips Great Pianists of the 20th Century series included two double-CDs of Larrocha, one of Spanish, the other of 18th-century repertoire, and in May 2003, to mark her 80th birthday, Decca reissued a wide range of her recordings in a set of seven CDs. Although Larrocha had studied the history of the keyboard literature from Bach and Handel to Prokofiev, that did not prevent her going further. She was a devotee of the subtle, understated music of her fellow Catalan, Federico Mompou, as well as other Iberian contemporaries. Chamber music involved her in partnerships with the cellist Gaspar Cassad\u00f3, and the Emerson, Guarneri and Tokyo quartets. She also partnered two of Spain&apos;s greatest sopranos, Victoria de los Angeles and Montserrat Caball\u00e9. Larrocha continued touring well into her 70s, and retired in 2003, after 75 years of public performance. She visited the US regularly, sometimes more than once a year; toured Australia and New Zealand in 1995; and Japan and South America in 1999. Her visits to Britain were unfortunately not as frequent as her reputation warranted, ending in 2000 with appearances with the BBC Philharmonic in Manchester and at the Wigmore Hall in London. Her many honours included the Prince of Asturias prize in 1994, and she was the first Spanish artist to be awarded the Unesco Prize, in 1995. Her husband died in 1982, and she is survived by her children. \u2022 Alicia de Larrocha y de la Calle, pianist, born 23 May 1923; died 25 September 2009"}, {"sentences": ["Milan is followed by Tokyo at $776 and London&apos;s most expensive shopping locale, New Bond Street, at $768 a square foot."], "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Global recession", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-26T23:08:10Z", "title": "Big spenders: how slump has hit world's top shopping streets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/27/worlds-top-shopping-streets", "article": "With Fame showing at the cinema and shoulder pads in the shops, the 1980s are back with a vengeance. Unfortunately for property firms, the revival is proving more painful than bad fashion after rents on the world&apos;s most exclusive shopping streets registered their biggest slump since 1985. From Fifth Avenue in New York to Causeway Bay in Hong Kong, landlords saw rental values plunge as consumer spending contracted against the backdrop of the economic downturn. Although Fifth Avenue, home to glamorous stores such as Saks and Bergdorf Goodman, remains the world&apos;s most expensive street for retailers to take a store, rents dropped 8.1% to $1,700 (\u00a31,067) per square foot a year in the year to June. Grafton Street in Dublin was the biggest faller in the top 10, dropping from fifth to eighth place after prime rents tumbled 22.5% as the country&apos;s credit-fuelled spending boom ended spectacularly. The ranking of top retail destinations compiled by property adviser Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which crunches data on 274 locations across 60 countries, is seen to provide a global barometer of the strength of the retail sector. This year the research revealed the biggest global fall in retail rents since the adviser&apos;s Main Streets Across the World report was first published in 1986. &quot;The past 12 months have been one of the most difficult periods ever for the retail sector, with consumer spending and retail sales down in many markets,&quot; said John Strachan, global head of retail at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. &quot;The impact has been much more significant as the full impact of the downturn has been realised.&quot; Causeway Bay, the world&apos;s second- most expensive shopping street, saw rents drop 15% to $1,525 per square foot a year. Rents on Paris&apos;s most famous shopping boulevard, the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, where Louis Vuitton has its largest store, stood firm at $1,009. It is estimated that more than 280,000 finance workers, many of whom stoked retail sales with their bumper annual bonuses, have lost their jobs since the credit crunch began. The depressed outlook has seen retailers rein in expansion, a decision that has put further pressure on rental values. The biggest shock was in the Asia-Pacific region, where rents fell 15% compared with 12% and 5.8% in North America and Europe. Cushman &amp; Wakefield said rents were unlikely to return to growth until the wider global economy and employment trends showed firmer signs of recovery. The biggest fall was in Mumbai, with rents on the Colaba Causeway down a staggering 64%. Life was sweeter for Milan&apos;s landlords as rents on the Via Montenapoleone bucked the trend with a 1.5% rise, making it the fourth most expensive street in the world. Milan is followed by Tokyo at $776 and London&apos;s most expensive shopping locale, New Bond Street, at $768 a square foot. However, the boom in tourism caused by the weak pound has provided a fillip for New Bond Street, where rents went up nearly 7%. &quot;The West End continues to perform well with limited availability in major thoroughfares such as Oxford Street, while demand, especially from overseas retailers remains buoyant,&quot; said Peter Mace, head of central London retail at Cushman &amp; Wakefield."}, {"sentences": ["On Thursday, the Tokyo Game Show, billed as the world&apos;s largest computer entertainment fest, kicked off, offering a glimpse into the future of entertainment."], "tags": ["Games", "Nintendo", "Wii", "Technology", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-27T10:29:39Z", "title": "Videogames now outperform Hollywood movies", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/sep/27/videogames-hollywood", "article": "Last year will go down in history as the point at which the UK videogames industry pulled decisively away from cinema, recorded music and DVD sales to become the country&apos;s most valuable purchased entertainment market, with combined software and hardware sales topping the \u00a34bn mark for the first time: more than DVD and music sales combined, and more than four times cinema box office takings. Industry insiders agree that the last few years have been something of a golden age for the videogame, with titles setting new records almost every other month for both sales and critical acclaim. On Thursday, the Tokyo Game Show, billed as the world&apos;s largest computer entertainment fest, kicked off, offering a glimpse into the future of entertainment. Meanwhile, the biggest gaming release of this month, Halo 3: Orbital Drop Shock Troopers, sold 2m copies worldwide on its day of release. Yet if videogames now self-evidently demand to be taken seriously as an industry, they still have a long way to go before they are also taken seriously as a medium. When critics look for an insult to throw at a film such as Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, one of the first phrases on many lips is &quot;it&apos;s like a videogame&quot;. Videogames may be economically formidable, but they remain a byword for crass, shallow thrills. A game, it&apos;s understood, can look spectacular, but it will have little to offer its audience in the way of values, insights or craftsmanship. It&apos;s a curious and increasingly untenable situation, given that, to the increasingly large percentage of the population who play them, games are rapidly establishing themselves as the single most exciting and vigorous creative industry around: a sector able to boast not only booming revenues and growing audiences, but a melting pot of talents and new ideas that is increasingly attracting some of the biggest-hitting figures in film, television and the other arts. Perhaps the biggest global headlines of all were made in 2008 by a British-produced game, Grand Theft Auto IV, which on 29 April took the title of the most successful entertainment release in history. Within 24 hours, GTA IV had grossed $310m (\u00a3157m) \u2013 comfortably more than history&apos;s most successful book (Harry Potter &amp; The Deathly Hallows, at $220m in 24 hours) and its most successful film (Spider-Man 3 at $117m). Despite this jaw-dropping success, however, few commentators paused to consider the kind of production that had made such a game possible. With a budget of around $100m, the game credited a production team of more than 550 people, plus almost double that number again of voice actors and performers used for motion-capturing virtual citizens. The result was anything but disposable: a product retailing at \u00a350 intended to occupy players for up to 100 hours of open-ended exploration through a highly detailed virtual world. The scripted incidentals, some reviewers noted, wouldn&apos;t have been out of place in a primetime television slot, and they were almost right; if the in-game scenes didn&apos;t quite fit the TV mould, it&apos;s because they were fresher, funnier and braver. Grand Theft Auto IV may have marked a watershed in the public profile of games, but its level of sophistication and production values \u2013 albeit not quite its budget \u2013 has increasingly become the rule rather than the exception. The videogame industry is an area in which consumers are voting with their wallets and their eyeballs: audiences, according to recent surveys such as the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, are increasingly switching off their televisions and abandoning passive media for the kind of interactive experience that games are able to offer. Games consoles, too, are becoming not only a favourite device for play, but fully fledged media hubs that are used by the whole family, thanks to their ability to stream television services, play music and DVDs, offer social networking services and even record sound, video and motion. We&apos;ve come a long way since the old days of teenage boys hunched over flickering screens in their bedrooms; and it&apos;s time that public perceptions caught up. It&apos;s not just money that is flowing into the games industry: it&apos;s talent and a sense of possibility, a combination that is rapidly tipping on its head the old media pecking orders. Take the hit game Ghostbusters, a product whose relationship with the two 1980s Ghostbusters films is rather more complex than the tacky spin-off fare that was standard for games even a decade ago. For a start, the game itself is based around an original script part-written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, the writers and stars of the original films, and features the vocal talents of the entire original cast, not to mention motion-captured computer recreations of their 1980s appearances. The banter and visuals, in fact, are of a standard that comfortably exceed many beloved movies of the 1980s, much like the game&apos;s budget of more than $15m. What&apos;s perhaps most difficult to grasp from outside the games industry is the sheer complexity of the world-building process that modern titles require. Turning a major game from concept into reality demands thousands of hours of work by artists, animators, musicians, actors, writers and directors, as well as computer programmers and technicians. In a virtual world, everything must be created from scratch, from the tiniest sound effect or musical note to the light glinting off a virtual office building. There is no reality beyond the fiction the game itself generates, and this must be maintained at all costs. Yet the actual process of creating a virtual world is only the beginning for a game \u2013 and it&apos;s here, in the fact of their interactivity, that they begin to move beyond much of what takes place in other media. There is, in the games industry at the moment, a sense that boundaries are being broken every year. Take the increasingly important phenomenon of massively multiplayer online gaming, embodied above all in the phenomenally successful World of Warcraft. Such games involve not only the construction of online virtual worlds used by thousands of people simultaneously but, more crucially, the maintenance and development of these worlds: something that can approach the complexity of running a city, or even a small country. WoW now boasts more than 11 million paying players, and revenues in excess of $1bn per year. The science and the art of running a world like Warcraft in such a way as to keep players happily playing, and paying, is boggling in its complexity. Running a modern online game can involve employing professional economists and community architects dedicated to maintaining the balance and integrity of the game world and the billions of virtual goods earned, traded and sold within it every week. What&apos;s perhaps most staggering, though, is just how much growth the videogames industry has yet to come. Like the early days of cinema or television, gaming is a young medium, and one that is still growing. It will be another half-century before gaming is truly as &quot;native&quot; to almost everyone alive as cinema, television and recorded music are today. It has existed in a commercial form for less than four decades and is only just beginning to come into its own, expanding conceptually as well as commercially to answer both the increasing sophistication of its consumers (the average British gamer is now aged in their 30s) and the increasingly formidable aspirations of the people drawn to work within it. These are not only gamers or computer programmers: television producers, writers, actors, directors, musicians, even performance artists are flocking towards the medium. In 2008, for instance, Steven Spielberg was credited as lead designer on a game, Boom Blox, for the Nintendo Wii. This wasn&apos;t just a title he had been paid to dignify with his name; it was a game he had devised himself from first principles, and that was aimed at creating an interactive version of the kind of cinematic space he made his own \u2013 somewhere where parents and children come together to share a creative experience. Gaming increasingly has its own auteurs: creative directors and designers whose latest titles create much the same waves as Spielberg&apos;s or George Lucas&apos;s films did in the 1970s and 1980s. The name of Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of some of the best-selling games of all time, serves on its own as a promise of excellence. So, too, do names such as Will Wright \u2013 the creator of the Sims, the best-selling games series in history \u2013 or Cliff Bleszinski, who merited the unusual distinction of a profile in the New Yorker thanks to his role as lead designer on the &quot;sensually overwhelming&quot; title Gears of War. It&apos;s perhaps unsurprising that, in a recent MTV survey of teens in America, &quot;videogames designer&quot; came out as the top professional aspiration, ahead of the more traditional astronaut and movie star. Although the analogy may sound fanciful, there is an element of the Elizabethan stage about the games industry today: a coincidence of public taste with critical excellence in a young, booming medium where much is being done for the first time and is being reinvented on an annual basis. Not everything is excellent. But it&apos;s a peculiarity of the games industry and its high-cost products \u2013 retailing at an average of \u00a335 each \u2013 that top-notch production values are not so much a bonus as an absolute requisite. Among the coming generation, it&apos;s a quality that already speaks for itself. Tom Chatfield is arts and books editor at Prospect magazine.

BBC1 also paid tribute to Swayze, who died earlier this month, repeating the surfing thriller Point Break and garnering an average of 1.7 million viewers and a 17% share between 10.20pm and 12.20am. ITV1 had a good night all round, starting with All Star Family Fortunes at 6.45pm, which drew 5.4 million and a 27% share. After that, at 7.30pm, The X Factor won the best ratings of the night, averaging 10.9 million and a 43% share over its 90-minute run. The reality show peaked with 11.8 million and 46% in the 15 minutes from 8pm. BBC1&apos;s Countryfile had an audience of 4.9 million and 22% at 7pm, with Antiques Roadshow drawing 5.2 million and 20% an hour later. Earlier in the day, BBC1&apos;s coverage of the Singapore Grand Prix scored highly with viewers. An average of 4.3 million viewers, a 42% share of the audience, tuned in to watch the night race between 12.10pm and 3.15pm, with a peak of 5.4 million and 47% in the quarter hour from 2.45pm as Lewis Hamilton came in first. BBC2 honoured another recently departed star, the TV chef Keith Floyd, with a couple of early evening programmes. A Farewell to Floyd, first shown on Saturday night, was watched by 1.1 million and a 5% share between 6.45pm and 7.30pm, while a repeat of a 1994 episode of A Feast of Floyd drew the same numbers immediately afterwards. On BBC2, the Stephen Fry documentary Last Chance to See, had 2.1 million viewers and 8% at 8pm, while Channel 4&apos;s Come Dine with Me, was watched by 1.3 million and 5%, with another 323,000 an hour later on Channel 4+1. Channel 4&apos;s 7pm offering, a repeat of the Richard Dawkins documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin, drew 700,000 and 3%, with another 70,000 on Channel 4+1. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The White House ended months of speculation todayby confirming that Barack Obama would travel to Denmark this week to try to secure the 2016 Olympic games for Chicago. Obama will become the first serving US president to lobby the International Olympic Committee in person on Friday as he attempts to tip the balance in favour of his old home town in a close race against Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid. The president initially planned to let his wife, Michelle, represent the US at the meeting after warning that his battle to push through his domestic healthcare reforms was likely to keep him from attending. But after Tokyo confirmed over the weekend that Japan&apos;s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, would be attending, the Chicago bid was the only one without a head of state attached \u2013 a factor that may have influenced Obama&apos;s thinking. There was speculation that Obama was keeping his options open for fear of being associated with the losing side if Chicago, the long-time favourite, did not prevail. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has been strongly linked with Rio&apos;s bid as it seeks to become the first South American country to host the games, and King Juan Carlos of Spain, who will arrive aboard a specially decorated private plane, will lobby the 106 IOC members and take part in their city&apos;s presentations. Each city will also call on other big names to add a sprinkling of stardust to their final 45-minute presentation, with American talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and athletes Ed Moses and Jackie Joyner-Kersee forming part of the Chicago delegation.

Uncertainty over financial guarantees, which the US does not provide at national level in contrast to every other bidder, was only resolved when Chicago alderman agreed to underwrite the bid. But their decision has not proved universally popular, with a recent poll by the Chicago Tribune showing that almost as many people in the city opposed the bid as supported it. Although IOC president Jacques Rogge has repeatedly attempted to downplay the importance of big political hitters attending the final presentation, it is widely accepted that Tony Blair&apos;s long term backing and his presence in Singapore in 2005 the night before the vote helped win the 2012 Games for London. And Vladimir Putin&apos;s personal support was seen as a big factor in landing the 2014 Winter Games for Sochi in 2007."}, {"sentences": ["The White House confirmed that the president, who had said he was unlikely to attend, due to his domestic political battle over healthcare reform, would lead a star-studded delegation in a bid to back Chicago against Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid.", "Tokyo said on Sunday that the newly elected Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, would travel on its behalf."], "tags": ["Barack Obama", "Rio 2016", "Sport", "International Olympic Committee", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-28T20:02:12Z", "title": "President Obama goes all out to push Chicago's Olympic bid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/28/chicago-olympics-2016-barack-obama", "article": "Chicago&apos;s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games received a boost yesterday when its most famous former resident, the American president, Barack Obama, ended months of speculation by announcing that he would fly to Copenhagen before Friday&apos;s vote, in order to lobby on the city&apos;s behalf. The White House confirmed that the president, who had said he was unlikely to attend, due to his domestic political battle over healthcare reform, would lead a star-studded delegation in a bid to back Chicago against Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid. Although Chicago was immediately installed as the favourite when the shortlist was narrowed to four in June last year, it has come under pressure from Rio as the Brazilian city&apos;s bid team, vocally backed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has made a compelling case for bringing the Games to South America for the first time. Obama&apos;s appearance in Copenhagen with his wife, Michelle, with both expected to deliver an address about their former home town and the transformative power of sport, could help wrest back the initiative. The arrival of Obama, with the attendant risk that his presence could backfire and damage Chicago&apos;s chances, will add an extra layer of intrigue to what is shaping up to be the tightest vote ever. Much will depend on the emotional punch of the final days of a two-year campaign. The news immediately energised the Chicago team as they conducted final rehearsals. With no IOC executive board meeting before the vote, there will be less time for last-minute horse trading in hotel lobbies. But the make up of each bid team, and their contribution to the final round of 45-minute presentations, is still expected to prove pivotal. IOC members believe it will come down to just a couple of votes. Whereas Beijing was the overwhelming favourite to win the 2008 Games, IOC sources say the way this race has evolved is similar to four years ago, when London pipped Paris to be awarded host status for 2012. A victory for Chicago, which will attempt to sell a vision of a compact Games on the shores of Lake Michigan that will leave a lasting sporting legacy, would return the Olympics to the most lucrative market in terms of sponsorship and television rights. But the city&apos;s campaign has been far from smooth. Until relatively recently the requisite financial guarantees were not in place and polls show public support to be at the lowest level of any bidding city. A dispute between the IOC and the US Olympic Committee over revenues from TV rights, together with the latter&apos;s plan to launch its own Olympic TV network, also threatened to harm Chicago&apos;s chances \u2013 though the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, recently said the row would have no bearing on the decision. While Rogge says the presence of high-ranking politicians is not a defining factor, several IOC members have said the absence of Obama would have been noted. The other bidders have high-level support, with King Juan Carlos of Spain supporting Madrid in a specially decorated private plane. Tokyo said on Sunday that the newly elected Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, would travel on its behalf. The IOC executive board has considered limiting government involvement to the sports ministers of bidding nations, but it rejected the idea because in some cases the head of state was also sports minister. Rogge said the presence of high-profile figures should not prove decisive but did little to discourage the prestige their presence adds to the bid process. &quot;We are very honoured and happy to host heads of states, dignitaries and heads of government,&quot; he said, earlier this month. &quot;[But] I don&apos;t consider this is the most vital aspect in a bid. This is something that is an honour for the IOC and is also reassurance that public authorities are behind the bid and will be supportive. &quot;However, this is absolutely not a requirement of the IOC. We have never asked a head of state to come but, if they elect to do so, we consider them as being part of the bid. If they come, we&apos;re glad. But we don&apos;t want them to come at all sakes.&quot; And Rogge did admit that the personalities behind the bids were a big factor, praising Lord Coe&apos;s Singapore speech as a key element of London&apos;s victory in the race to host the 2012 Games. &quot;All being equal in terms of technicalities, it&apos;s the confidence you have in the people making the bid,&quot; he said. It is widely accepted that Tony Blair&apos;s charm offensive on the eve of the 2005 vote in Singapore, when he flew halfway around the world to press home London&apos;s message before returning to Gleneagles to host the G7 summit, was also a decisive factor. In 2007, Vladimir Putin played a key role in securing victory for Sochi in the race to host the 2014 Winter Games."}, {"sentences": ["Earlier in his career he worked as a journalist for 12 years, in London, New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Future Publishing", "US press and publishing", "Newspapers & magazines", "Magazines", "Media business", "Media", "Business", "Film industry"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-29T10:21:51Z", "title": "Publishing group Future names former Yahoo! executive as its US president", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/29/future-publishing-us-president-john-marcom", "article": "Publishing group Future today appointed a former Time Warner and Yahoo! executive to be its US president.

She had a great sense of humour and people always laughed with her. Laura was born at home, in a Worcestershire village rectory, to the poet-priest David Lockwood and his wife Wilhelmina, a Dutch doctor. After school in Worcester, Laura read Italian and French at Aberdeen University and then spent a year teaching English in Tokyo. She later returned to teach in Japan, learning the language and filling her house with Japanese prints and scrolls. After studying for an MSc in development studies at Swansea University, she stayed on in the city and worked for Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity, and developed the west Wales cycle tracks. She was good at charming people \u2013 from farmers reluctant to have the network cross their land to teenagers needing motivation on work camps. Working for Sustrans made her passionate about cycling, but she recognised the difficulties that it posed to disabled people. She started to correct this imbalance by raising money for modified bikes. The project started with a handful of bikes stored at a business park hotel. But strong local support led to the creation of the charity Bikeability Wales, and this became a full-time job. Bikeability now comprises a fleet of weird and wonderful bikes and was recently awarded money from the lottery. Laura&apos;s contribution was recognised in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by awards for outstanding service in the voluntary sector. Laura was incredibly untidy. Her bedroom was heaped with discarded clothes, but then she would emerge wearing unusual and slightly zany outfits. She did attempt to keep to a no-flying policy, but the pleasure of seeing her friends across the world and visiting new places won out. Laura&apos;s connection with Wales started in childhood when we were taken to remote churches in mid-Wales tracking down the wanderings of Francis Kilvert, on whose diaries our father was an expert. While teaching in Japan she was also a Christian missionary, but there became interested in Buddhism and absorbed this into her spiritual beliefs, which were combined in turn with environmentalism. In 2007 she met Keith, an IT engineer. They married the next year, and within five minutes of the ceremony starting, we were all laughing as we heard the strains of Mendelssohn&apos;s wedding march give way to Daisy Daisy. Keith started off their married life by cycling Laura to the reception. Laura is survived by Keith, by Wilhelmina, myself and our brother Peter. Our sister Helena was killed in a car accident in 1971; our father died in 2005."}, {"sentences": ["Murakami, who has his own multinational corporation, fills the last room of the show, which is dominated by a huge mural of a magical princess marching through Akihabara, the centre of Manga production in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Art", "Andy Warhol", "Jeff Koons", "Damien Hirst", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-29T20:30:00Z", "title": "Pop Life's schlock horrors | Adrian Searle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/29/pop-life-tate-pop-art", "article": "Andy Warhol, painted in red and black, glowers from the wall as you step into Tate Modern&apos;s Pop Life exhibition. He looks baleful and sinister. Jeff Koons&apos;s stainless steel Rabbit stands beside him on a plinth, like a psychopathic sidekick: benign, innocent, dumb-looking \u2013 but really filled with bad intent. I&apos;m surprised no one&apos;s made a horror movie with the Rabbit, though the creature was turned into an inflatable (just like the one that first inspired Koons&apos;s creation) for Macy&apos;s 2007 Thanksgiving Day parade. A film of that parade features in this\u00a0show, which is subtitled Art in a Material World. It reminds us that art has slithered back to where it found its\u00a0inspiration, on the street. But wait:\u00a0we must complete our trio of art world monsters. Here&apos;s Hiropon, a sculpted, blue-haired cutie dancing on a plinth, her minuscule bra twanging across her impossibly huge breasts. I thought she was doing aerobics until I realised her tiny hands were grasping her erect nipples, and that she&apos;s skipping with a rope curdled from her\u00a0own breast milk. This is by Takashi Murakami, who is huge in Japan and almost everywhere else, although I do my best to avoid his work, in case it grows on me. Murakami, who has his own multinational corporation, fills the last room of the show, which is dominated by a huge mural of a magical princess marching through Akihabara, the centre of Manga production in Tokyo. Murakami has also worked with Hollywood director McG (who made Terminator Salvation) on a video here. It stars Kirsten Dunst as the princess, singing a version of the Vapors 1980 hit, Turning Japanese. &quot;The more we study, the more difficulty we have answering the question, &apos;What is art?&apos;&quot;, Murakami writes in an accompanying pamphlet. The entire show leaves this question dangling. This overcrowded, manic exhibition is full of things to snigger and ogle at, to boggle the mind and to make one wish for saner days, old-style values and a bit of decorum. They&apos;re long past, and a lot of the art here is 20 or 30 years old, too. Warhol presides over Pop Life; in fact, there&apos;s far too much Warholabilia in an exhibition already stuffed to the gills. We know him too well now, even if he is key to understanding what happened to pop in the 1980s and 90s \u2013 long after it had had its historical moment in the late 1950s. The careers of Warhol, Koons and Murakami have all spun out beyond the art world, entering the media mainstream to become figures of popular entertainment in their own right. Lots of artists manage to turn themselves into larger-than-life characters, but it isn&apos;t always part and parcel of their art; nor do they always confuse themselves with their personas. Warhol kept another life, hidden from view, in which the good Catholic boy ministered to the poor and needy. For\u00a0all I know, Koons moonlights for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. This rise of the artist as media celebrity, as art-tart and living artwork, is one of the subplots here. Being a smart operator, a whizz at public relations and having an eye for the main chance are all very well. They might help you become a successful artist, but will they help you make good art? This is the sort of question that makes savvy types snort with derision: there is only success, they say; the rest is subjective. Pop Life also nods to 1980s commodity fetishism, but it&apos;s a\u00a0sideshow to the big, loud and self-trumpeting art. Artistic depth (or what passes for it), and even a level of opacity, might be a good thing for an artist&apos;s work, to stop it being reduced to just a token chip on the gaming table of a career. German artist Martin Kippenberger carved out\u00a0quite a niche as a living monster, hanging out in his lair in Berlin&apos;s Paris Bar, but he also found time to paint, sculpt and parody himself. However much he staged his life, there was more to his art than boisterous despair and cynicism, and the construction of a public alter ego. European artists don&apos;t play the game the way Americans do. This show doesn&apos;t do complexity well. It does shock \u2013 and schlock \u2013 better. A whole room is devoted to Koons&apos;s Made in Heaven project, beginning in 1989, in which Koons extolled his love for Italian porn star La Cicciolina. Centre-stage is a life-sized tableau of Jeff having sex with the Hungarian-born artiste on a rock. A makeover has given the pair a grubby-but-coiffed, clammy look. Various silk-screened photographs on canvas show us Jeff&apos;s digitally remastered dick, and the stylists have been hard at work on his pecs, hair and private parts. Even Ilona&apos;s asshole has been puckered for the camera; it gives us a knowing wink, demanding our complicity. More troubling is the dark red room\u00a0recreating a 1983 show by Richard Prince, empty but for a single photograph in a tacky gilt frame. It shows a pubescent Brooke Shields, naked and shower-wet, posing knowingly for the aptly named Garry Gross for a Playboy publication called Sugar&apos;n&apos;Spice. Prince called the installation Spiritual America, after a 1923 photograph by Alfred Stieglitz that focused on the nether regions of a gelded horse. Prince&apos;s piece remains a work of troubling ambivalence. Shields, who was groomed as a child star even before she was one, coerces us with her gaze \u2013 but she&apos;s been coerced into the situation, too. Prince dramatises our engagement. If he is telling us something about images and representations, he doesn&apos;t say what. The visceral red of the room makes us feel we are in a dark cave, a place perhaps we shouldn&apos;t be. Those quaint young YBAs Nor am I sure if I should be looking at Andrea Fraser&apos;s 1983 Untitled video. Fraser asked her gallery to find a man who would be willing to pay $20,000 to be filmed having sex with her. She recorded the encounter in a hotel room. The video is intended as a kind of metaphor: the artist as service provider, a seller of pleasures, the punter wanting to get up close and personal, and to achieve a kind of relationship with art that people only dream of. The idea is more interesting than the film itself. After all this, the young YBAs looks quaint. Gavin Turk&apos;s famous Blue Plaque (the artist&apos;s graduation piece from the Royal College of Art, which just tells us that Gavin Turk, sculptor, worked here), and his later self-portrait mannequin as Sid Vicious, can only have local appeal. The same is true of the memorabilia from Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas&apos;s short-lived shop in Bethnal Green, London. It makes me feel nostalgic seeing it all again. Then of course there&apos;s Hirst, and a selection of works from his auction last year at Sotheby&apos;s. What dreck all this gold and diamond stuff is, especially the calf with golden hooves, in its golden tank atop a marble plinth. Hirst&apos;s sale, and Emin and Lucas&apos;s shop, are seen to follow on from the late Keith Haring&apos;s New York Pop Shop, where one could buy posters, T-shirts and any number of objects decorated with Haring&apos;s jaunty, cartoon figures. It is impossible not to like Haring, though he was never much of an artist. They&apos;ve reinstalled the shop in the show, and it has a bouncy, jiving glamour, tinged with the shadow of Aids, which the artist&apos;s work did much to educate the public about. The original title of Pop Life was Sold Out, but one of the artists (I heard it was Hirst) insisted it was changed. Hirst&apos;s work makes me feel dead inside, but not so dead as the horse Maurizio Cattelan has installed in an otherwise empty room. The stuffed nag is impaled through the flank with a stick, bearing a placard that says: &quot;INRI.&quot; Pontius Pilate had a similar sign hung over Jesus on the cross. It means Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. Did the horse die for us \u2013 or for the sins of Pop Life?"}, {"sentences": ["With all the excitement about gaming over the past week - Tokyo Games Show, Halo ODST, Nintendo Wii price cuts - we thought we&apos;d chat to the people behind some of the biggest titles in the industry: so Charles and I speak to those who work on the Guitar Hero franchise and forthcoming Fifa 10."], "tags": ["Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Internet", "Computing", "Google", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-30T05:00:00Z", "title": "Breakfast briefing: Could the internet harbour artificial life?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/sep/30/breakfast-briefing", "article": "\u2022 Can computers become self-aware?

This year&apos;s event has warranted only a handful of cursory mentions in the Western games press. &quot;Man, Japan is over. We&apos;re done. Our game industry is finished,&quot; veteran Capcom game designer Keiji Inafune is quoted as saying on the show floor. A bleak prognosis, but sadly not an unreasonably alarmist one - Hideo Kojima made similar points at the start of the year. Indeed, Japanese game development has been in gradual decline for a decade. Sure, in the eighties and nineties, videogame culture was absolutely dominated by the big arcade releases - an arena monopolised by Japan. What players wanted from their consoles were pixel-perfect adaptations of coin-ops like Double Dragon, Street Fighter II, Daytona USA and Tekken.  But in the mid-nineties, new audiences were drawn to the more expensive and intensely marketed PlayStation. At first they lapped up flashy arcade fare like Ridge Racer and Virtual Fighter, but then older gamers started to look for deep long-term challenges instead of quick &apos;hardcore&apos; thrills; the influence of the arcade waned, and the whole structure of the industry evolved to embrace this change in appetite. Western developers began to create large, hugely ambitious adventure titles - the likes of Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto 3 - which drew their influences from Western culture, rather than manga and martial arts. Rockstar North mashed up mature sex and violence in a way that the big Japanese publishers would not even contemplate, kickstarting a massive new trend for adult interactive experiences far removed from the codified ramblings of Devil May Cry and Onimusha with their comic book mythologies and hyper stylised action.  At the same time, the first-person shooter became a major console genre, the likes of Halo, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor bringing the PC gaming experience of choice to a ravenous new fanbase. But, Japanese developers had no background in PC development - the market was almost irrelevant in the country - so the whole FPS culture was alien to them. The same goes for the MMORPG phenomenon. Now, PES has relinquished its crown to FIFA, Resident Evil is in crisis after a weakened fifth instalment, Western developers have stolen, modified and globalised the whole rhythm action genre... Currently, the big Japanese publishers seem content to raid their back catalogues to exploit past glories - Capcom with SFIV, Mega Man and Bionic Commando, Namco with Tekken and Splatterhouse, Konami with Silent Hill, Castlevania and Vandal Hearts... The country&apos;s major companies have always been insular, always been keenest to appease the domestic market, but the problem is, no-one else is as interested anymore.  So, is Japan really finished as a major force in game development? Well, of course not. For a start, you cannot possibly overlook the enormous impact of the Wii - the machine has revolutionalised the whole concept of the console/human interface, while the Fit brand is one of the biggest in the world right now. You also cannot overlook the fact that Sony is still a massive player in the manufacture of games hardware. And on the games side we&apos;re looking forward to Gran Turismo 5, Metal Gear Solid: Rising, Final Fantasy XIII, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Last Guardian, Metroid: Other M, a new Professor Layton game from Level-5, whatever Grasshopper Manufacture is currently working on... the list goes on. But more importantly - and on a more profound level - Japan still makes a singular contribution to the videogame culture and community. Japanese developers draw from a unique aesthetic, an approach to iconography, character design and structure that is unfathomable to studios in the west. The concept of kawaii is the obvious manifestation of this - Loco Roco, Pokemon, Puyo Puyo, Harvest Moon, Cooking Mama - none of them could have originated anywhere else. But it goes much deeper than that - into uses of digital space (Echochrome), movement (SFIV), metamorphosis (Resident Evil), psychological horror (Fatal Frame, Silent Hill), time and seasonality (Animal Crossing), etc, etc. Japanese developers are also more likely to toy with the arcane possibilities of the hardware - for example, introducing light sensors (Boktai), getting you to swap controller ports as a tactical gameplay element (Metal Gear Solid) - this isn&apos;t all just going to disappear. Look at Nintendo again - after the relative failure of Game Cube everyone had pretty much written off the company, then there was a moment of tangential genius - the Wii - and it&apos;s back to the top of the class for Miyamoto and co. Right now, Japanese development teams are embracing Natal; it is likely they will think of stuff that, say, Activision and Ubisoft wouldn&apos;t come up with in a hundred years of dedicated R&amp;D. Some of it won&apos;t travel, but some of it will be astonishing, epoch-shattering even. This is, though, clearly a period of transition. It seems Japanese publishers are having difficulty adjusting to the mega-budget Hollywood-style development system required to create chart-topping titles for the current gen consoles. Studios wishing to make a global impact are going to have to take a broader cultural outlook - embracing Western tropes and influences. One way to smooth this process is creative co-operation; it&apos;s something Capcom has tried with Bionic Commando and Dead Rising 2, both of which were co-operative projects involving in-house Japanese producers and Western studios. It didn&apos;t work out with the former (indeed the Bionic Commando developer, GRIN, has now folded), but the Dead Rising sequel looks promising.  The game isn&apos;t over; Japan has plenty of lives left."}, {"sentences": ["We have tried throughout to have fair play.&quot; Most observers have Chicago and Rio as the narrow favourites in a tight race , but Odriozola said Madrid and Tokyo were in fact leading the way."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Cadbury", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-30T16:09:55Z", "title": "2012 Olympics organisers expect to beat sponsorship targets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/30/london-2012-olympic-sponsorship", "article": "London 2012 organisers have said they would hit the top end of their sponsorship target of between \u00a3600m and \u00a3700m, insisting that the global economic slump had not dampened the corporate appetite for involvement in the Olympics. Unveiling UPS as its 22nd sponsor, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog) chief executive, Paul Deighton, said it was on track to meet or exceed the \u00a3700m barrier. He said the new deal took the total raised so far to \u00a3550m and that the remainder would be achieved by tying up a string of further tier-two and tier-three deals, worth at least \u00a320m and \u00a310m respectively. Organisers were able to lock in the majority of major sponsors before the worst effects of the global slump became clear. There were fears 18 months ago that the last batch of deals would be more difficult to wrap up, but Deighton said negotiations had not been adversely affected.&quot;There is nothing quite like the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games. It has got a set of values attached to it which business would really, really like to be associated with,&quot; he said. &quot;In the modern world, that kind of value-based association is much more powerful than a traditional advert.&quot; Based on negotiations already in train Deighton said he was &quot;comfortable&quot; in predicting that Locog would meet or exceed its target. &quot;From the perspective of the overall economic environment I think people are planning for recovery, rather than managing through the worst of it,&quot; he said. &quot;The momentum of our sponsorship programme and the excitement of the Olympics is a strong pull, despite the economic background.&quot; Locog must raise \u00a32bn from private sources in order to stage the Games \u2013 a third comes from its own sponsors, a third from International Olympic Committee partners and a third from ticket sales. Deighton, who on Tuesday night spoke alongside the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, at an event designed to convince wealthy patrons to back the Team 2012 athlete programme that was launched the same day with a \u00a310m investment from Visa, said any extra money raised from domestic sponsorship would be reinvested elsewhere. UPS will act as the official logistics and express delivery partner and was named as the fifth &quot;tier two&quot; partner. The deal, mainly to be delivered in kind, is worth upwards of \u00a320m. Dan Brutton, the president of UPS International, said it would also look to sponsor Team GB athletes and would adopt specific squads to follow. Aside from having to deal with the travails of IT partner Nortel, which was replaced as a tier-one sponsor with Cisco when it entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year, Locog has managed to avoid the worst effects of the slump. Deighton&apos;s assessment will also be encouraging to the four cities bidding to host the 2016 Games, to be decided in Copenhagen this Friday. He also revealed there was no way that Cadbury, subject of a takeover bid by US food giant Kraft, would be able to renege on its sponsorship if the deal went through. &quot;There&apos;s no basis upon which the deal with Cadbury&apos;s can be changed based on their change of control,&quot; he said. The Locog chief executive, who will next week deliver an update on London&apos;s progress to the IOC at its congress in Copenhagen, also confirmed for the first time that it was looking for a car sponsor. Historically, the category has been filled by the IOC&apos;s partner programme, but after the Sochi 2014 Winter Games appointed Volkswagen as a tier one domestic partner it will fall to London to also find an automobile partner. &quot;We&apos;d expect the car category to be a domestic category, so that is one of the things we are looking at,&quot; said Deighton, adding that environmental factors would be a consideration. Deighton will also meet with sporting federations in Copenhagen in a bid to resolve an ongoing row over where badminton and rhythmic gymnastics should be sited. Locog is keen to save \u00a340m by not building a temporary arena on the Greenwich Peninsula. A plan to build a venue in Barking that would deliver greater legacy benefits is under consideration. &quot;The balance in trading these things off is very fine now so final resolution is quite hard. That reflects the fact we&apos;ve squeezed every bit of economic advantage out of moving the venues,&quot; he claimed. The race to stage those Games, viewed as one of the tightest ever, threatened to turn nasty tonight after Rio&apos;s delegation reported Madrid&apos;s bid team to the International Olympic Committee&apos;s Ethics Commission. As heads of state, dignitaries and sporting celebrities flowed into the Danish capital to lobby IOC members, a war of words erupted between the two camps after the Spanish Olympic Committee&apos;s vice-president, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Odriozola, told the national Efe news agency that &quot;Rio is the worst bid&quot;. IOC rules expressly forbid bidding cities commenting on their rivals and a spokesman for Rio 2016 said: &quot;This gentleman is clearly out of step with the report of the IOC&apos;s own Evaluation Commission. His comments are totally unacceptable and Rio 2016 has now lodged a formal complaint to the Ethics Commission.&quot; The head of Madrid&apos;s bid later apologised to Rio for the remark. &quot;Whatever happened, we want to apologise to Rio,&quot; Mercedes Coghen said. &quot;We believe that all four bids are very good bids. We have tried throughout to have fair play.&quot; Most observers have Chicago and Rio as the narrow favourites in a tight race , but Odriozola said Madrid and Tokyo were in fact leading the way. With many IOC members still claiming to be undecided, last minute lobbying and the final presentations ahead of the vote on Friday are expected to be more important than ever. Michelle Obama arrived yesterday to lobby on Chicago&apos;s behalf and will be joined by her husband, the US president Barack, on Friday. Spain&apos;s King Juan Carlos and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also touched down today while Japan&apos;s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, was expected to arrive tomorrow."}, {"sentences": ["Andy Murray has been told by his doctor to pull out of next week&apos;s Japan Open in Tokyo and has sought to alleviate the increasing sense of concern about his left wrist injury by claiming that it is &quot;more a precaution than anything else&quot;."], "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-30T19:40:22Z", "title": "Andy Murray pulls out of Japan Open", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/30/andy-murray-wrist-injury", "article": "Andy Murray has been told by his doctor to pull out of next week&apos;s Japan Open in Tokyo and has sought to alleviate the increasing sense of concern about his left wrist injury by claiming that it is &quot;more a precaution than anything else&quot;.

Murray allowed optimism to influence his decisions about whether or not to compete for a month after he first suffered the injury, before deciding to rest the wrist. His withdrawal from only one tournament suggests he is hoping to compete the following week in the Shanghai Masters, a mandatory event, though that too must be in doubt. Only when he starts hitting the ball on a regular basis will he know whether keeping his options open for China is no more than a further bout of wishful thinking. Murray&apos;s agent said, &quot;on the basis of medical advice he has decided to give his left wrist further time to recover,&quot; but that &quot;his injury is improving on a daily basis and he is very close to full-time training.

As well as the Renault Crashgate affair, Button was referring to the history of drivers taking each other off the track in the sometimes desperate battle to take the title. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t mean so much to me if I deliberately collided with another driver,&quot; said Button. &quot;I&apos;d feel I&apos;d cheated myself. I&apos;m not the only driver who thinks that. If Rubens [Barrichello, Button&apos;s team-mate] was a different character, a team mate I hated, maybe I&apos;d think differently. But I&apos;m not in that situation. I&apos;d feel that I&apos;d cheated the people watching. &quot;I want to win fair and square because otherwise you&apos;d think &apos;I&apos;ve got this title and I cheated&apos;. What&apos;s the point in that? It&apos;s like doing a running race and taking a short cut and getting a really good time. You just don&apos;t do it.&quot; Button described the televised collision between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost as they fought for the 1989 title in Suzuka as one of his formative experiences. It was a clumsy but ultimately successful attempt by Prost to block a move by his McLaren team to snatch the lead in the closing stages of the Japanese grand prix. Senna was to exact his revenge in a more spectacular and dangerous manner in Japan 12 months later when he drove into the back of Prost, who had switched to Ferrari for the 1990 season. It was a controversial move that gave Senna the championship. Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill to win the title in 1994 but a similar move by Schumacher failed in 1997 when Jacques Villeneuve&apos;s Williams emerged largely unscathed. &quot;When I was a kid, Ayrton and Alain crashed at the chicane when they were team-mates and that stands out very well. I loved that because they were very different characters with very different styles of driving. I actually preferred Alain&apos;s style of driving but it made great television.&quot; Button leads Barrichello by 15 points with Sebastian Vettel, 10 points behind Barrichello, the outsider for Red Bull. If Button finishes Sunday&apos;s race 20 points clear, he will be world champion, regardless of what happens in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But the Englishman says arithmetic does not come into his thinking at this stage. &quot;I haven&apos;t come into this race thinking I am going to seal the title here; there are so many possibilities this weekend,&quot; said Button. &quot;There are three people who can still challenge for the title, and I am one of them. The most important thing to do is work on Friday and Saturday to get the car ready for qualifying and the race. I shouldn&apos;t be thinking about anything else. I&apos;ve just had a few days in Tokyo following last Sunday&apos;s race in Singapore and I haven&apos;t been thinking endlessly what might happen. &quot;When I&apos;m away from the circuit, I spend time with my friends and they know better than to talk about the championship. On the one hand, five points doesn&apos;t sound much. But to beat your team-mate by that amount when he&apos;s at his prime, as he is at the moment, is very difficult. It&apos;s a big margin.&quot; Barrichello said his options were clear. &quot;My aim is winning, winning, winning. It&apos;s pretty simple,&quot; said Barrichello. &quot;I&apos;ve been flat out for a long time. I&apos;ve got to win without worrying where Jenson is. Then, when the race is done, see how many more points I have.&quot; Button and Barrichello joined the majority of drivers in rejoicing over the Japanese race&apos;s return to Suzuka after two years at Mount Fuji. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to the weekend because it&apos;s a great circuit. I&apos;ve missed it a lot,&quot; said Button. &quot;It&apos;s possibly my favourite circuit and I love the atmosphere here. I&apos;ve pretty much had good results at Suzuka. I&apos;d love to get a win here; that&apos;s obviously going to be our aim. But, saying that, I think the Red Bulls are going to be the team to beat. &quot;The changes that we made to the car for Singapore help us not just on slow-speed tracks but on high-speed circuits like this one. This track has a bit of everything, fast corners, slow corners, rising and falling. You can get into a good rhythm and really enjoy driving a grand prix car round here. The weather forecast is interesting with rain forecast for Friday and Saturday. But Sunday should be dry. That will suit me. I can&apos;t wait to see what this race brings.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The race between Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid is seen as one of the closest ever and the guest list for the presentations to the 106 IOC members is the glitziest to date."], "tags": ["Rio 2016", "Sport", "Denmark", "Michelle Obama", "Barack Obama", "US news", "Spain", "Brazil", "Japan", "World news", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-01T21:33:47Z", "title": "2016 Olympics: Celebrities fly in to make Chicago's case", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/01/2016-olympics-chicago-copenhagen", "article": "     World leaders including Barack Obama, royalty, global celebrities and sporting legends will tomorrow converge on a nondescript conference centre in Copenhagen for the vote that will decide the destination of the 2016 Olympic games.

Amid the stunts, the heavy security, the last-minute press conferences and the frantic wooing of the 104 voting members of the 106 International Olympic Committee officials who will decide their fate, the one name on everyone&apos;s lips was that of the man not due to arrive in Copenhagen until this morning. After travelling overnight, Barack Obama will today step straight from Air Force One into the cavernous Bella Centre conference hall to deliver Chicago&apos;s pitch and attempt to bring the Olympics back to the US for the first time since the underwhelming and chaotic Atlanta Games of 1996. As he does so, he will reconfirm the rebirth of the Olympics over the past three decades as an economic and cultural force. Despite the scrutiny, the threat of it all going wrong, the fact that no city bar Barcelona has created a lasting legacy and the impact of a global recession, the battle to stage the Games is more intense than ever. With the IOC&apos;s evaluation commission failing to declare a clear leader, and up to half of all the IOC members still believed to be undecided going into the final hours according to some, much will depend on the final push. Obama&apos;s late, perfectly timed decision to attend the vote has robbed Rio&apos;s attempt to make Olympic history by bringing the Games to South America for the first time of crucial momentum. But there may yet be a twist in the tale. Other bidders yesterday tried, in vain, to deflect attention from the arrival of the US president. Shintaro Ishihara, the president of the Tokyo 2016 bid committee, urged IOC members to judge the bids on their technical merits and not on their presentation skills. &quot;If you judge the technical aspects of our bid dispassionately, evaluation can be carried out in the proper way,&quot; he said. But Tokyo&apos;s message of safe streets and clean drinking water could not compete with the stardust of Chicago&apos;s delegation or the emotional pull of Rio&apos;s message. At his own press conference yesterday, Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attempted to turn Obama&apos;s presidential campaign slogan on its head and present Rio as a vote for change. &quot;We want to say yes we can. It sounds very pretty coming from an American mouth but in Brazil we are accustomed to saying &apos;No we can&apos;t&apos; because we have considered ourselves second-rate citizens,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we are looking out towards the world and saying &apos;Yes we can&apos; and &apos;We will win&apos;.&quot; But meanwhile, across town at a Marriot hotel swarming with security, Michelle Obama was conducting a second day of intensive wooing in a series of one-on-one sessions with influential IOC members. Downstairs, Oprah Winfrey was spotted working the lobby. The US president&apos;s entrance has been perfectly stage managed, from the final confirmation that he would attend the vote earlier this week to the arrival of his wife and Winfrey two days earlier to prepare the ground. And for all IOC president Jaques Rogge&apos;s hopes that the presence of heads of state would not prove decisive, the big names were clearly making an impressio. &quot;She is one impressive lady,&quot; said Kevan Gosper, a senior IOC member from Australia after meeting Mrs Obama. &quot;She has got great charm, great presence. She&apos;s very friendly, very informal, a very good listener. She&apos;s a great advocate for the Games.&quot; For the armies of lobbyists and PR professionals employed by the bidding nations this week represented a last intense round of rehearsals, meetings and press calls on a long 18-month road since the field narrowed to four. As the Madrid team touched down in a liveried plane on Wednesday, the Chicago delegation staged a glitzy red carpet welcome dinner and Pele held court on the merits of Rio&apos;s bid. Each is seeking the elusive final momentum that will carry them over the line. It will all come down to the choices of 106 IOC members \u2013 an uneven mixture of administrators, diplomats, minor royalty and former sportsmen and women influenced by a wide range of factors including geography, sentiment, personal loyalties, internal politics and the future of the Olympic movement, in addition to the technical merits of the four bids. Ever since the White House confirmed earlier this week that the US president would be stopping by today [FRI] to lobby on behalf of his former home town, the Tokyo, Madrid and Rio campaigns have been focused on how to neutralise the expected effect of his arrival. His wife, who arrived two days ahead of him with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, gave a flavour of what is expected to be a personal appeal when she spoke of her pride in her former home and the power of the Olympics to inspire future generations in front of hundreds of cheering supporters at an event on Wednesday night. &quot;They can never dream of being that close to such power and opportunity. So that&apos;s what excites me most about bringing the Games to Chicago, the impact it can have on the lives of our young people, and our entire community,&quot; she said. Michelle Obama, likened it to her husband&apos;s successful run to the White House saying the it was &quot;just like Iowa&quot;. It was, she said, &quot;an opportunity for the United States to connect with the world in a really important way at a very critical time and to show each and every person our sincerity and passion.&quot; Early concerns about a lack of public support and rows between the US Olympic Commission and the IOC over TV rights have faded as Obama&apos;s decision to attend has given the favourites fresh legs. A last-minute spat between the Madrid and Rio camps, after a senior official broke IOC rules on criticising rivals by saying the Brazilian bid was the &quot;worst&quot; in the race, caused no more than a minor ripple despite sparking a complaint to the IOC&apos;s Ethics Commission. But the bad blood could become a factor if one drops out of the race. It had previously been assumed that Madrid&apos;s backers would automatically turn to Rio, or vice-versa. Since the bidding process for the Olympic Games was overhauled in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, individual IOC members are no longer allowed to visit bidding cities themselves and instead reliant on the information supplied in the hefty &quot;bid books&quot; and the verdict of an IOC evaluation team, the importance of developing a compelling campaign &quot;narrative&quot; has come to the fore. Buzzwords such as legacy and sustainability have become de rigeur in the wake of London&apos;s success in 2005, with the IOC placing a premium on ensuring the Games reaches new generations and expands into new markets. &quot;For some countries, it is just one more sports event that they are going to organise,&quot; Silva said. &quot;But for us, it is a unique and extraordinary thing.&quot; There is a strong feeling among some in the Olympic movement that it needs to expand into new markets and practise what it preaches when it comes to &quot;universality&quot;. &quot;Although there is no geographical rotation, I think there is a feeling that the Games might go west,&quot; British IOC member Craig Reedie said. &quot;In which case, you have a choice of two Western Hemisphere cities. The emotional argument is with Rio with regards to the games having never been in South America before.&quot; Pele, one of the small army of former sporting stars drafted in by each bidding nations, declared: &quot;If I have to die for my country I will die for my country, it&apos;s important to help when your country needs you. I&apos;m not here just for Brazil but for the whole of South America. Sport has changed the life of a lot of people and children.&quot; Yet enough question marks remain over security, accommodation and transport that some IOC members will consider it too much of a leap of faith, despite the depth of experience on the Rio team and the fulsome financial guarantees provided by government at all levels. The tactical voting that tends to dominate the early rounds, where some members vote out of sympathy rather than for their genuine first choice, will also play a part. The winner needs a simple majority of all votes in a round to win, with the lowest scoring city eliminated. Ninety-seven IOC members are eligible to vote in the first round, with those from bidding cities disallowed unless they are eliminated. Rogge has said he expects there to be only a couple of votes in it. Nor can Madrid, which enjoyed the highest level of national public support and is politically well connected within the IOC, be entirely discounted. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said yesterday he was &quot;more optimistic than ever&quot; having spoken to more than 50 IOC members. For all the increasingly sophisticated and expensive planning, lobbying and positioning over a three year period, this Friday&apos;s vote could be swung by old fashioned rhetoric - President Obama&apos;s power and charm versus the emotional pull and increasing clout of President Lula, the stardust of Winfrey versus the cache of IOC &quot;athlete of the century&quot; Pele. There is no official rotation policy, but the fact that the Games has never been held in South America could count in Rio&apos;s favour, while Tokyo could suffer due to the proximity to last year&apos;s Beijing Games and the prospect of a third European Olympics in row could hurt Madrid&apos;s chances. Reedie said: &quot;This is a very, very close race between four outstanding bids, and because the bids are so good and because it is so close the last few hours are going to be even more exciting than usual.&quot; Rio&apos;s convincing message of using the Games to turbo-charge the development of a continent and bring the Games to new audiences remains compelling, but Obama&apos;s late intervention has changed the game. Much will depend on whether his much vaunted rhetorical powers can seal the deal. The lessons of London There many be growing questions over the legacy that London has promised from the 2012 Games, but one lasting influence is undeniable. London&apos;s victory in Singapore in 2005 in many ways rewrote the rules of successful Olympic bidding. It was the first race under new IOC rules designed to draw a line under the Salt Lake City scandal, which led to 10 IOC members being expelled. However hard it will ultimately prove to deliver, Seb Coe&apos;s promise to deliver a legacy for the world&apos;s youth, regenerate one of the poorest parts of east London and deliver a Games devoid of white elephants went down well with IOC members aware that the movement needed to reach out to new audiences. A perfectly pitched film establishing London&apos;s multicultural credentials also left a warm glow. The role played by then prime minister Tony Blair in Singapore has also been noted by the bidders for 2016. His decision to travel to Singapore and spend two days lobbying IOC members one-one in his hotel suite was widely seen as a vital factor. Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett met with Blair last week to solicit his advice on negotiating the IOC voting process. Since the Salt Lake City scandal led to IOC members being banned from visting prospective host cities, their marketing and lobbying campaigns have become increasingly sophisticated. The bidding race has become an exercise in remaining just the right side of the rules while trying to gain every possible incremental advantage over your opponents. Sentiment counts for a lot. Although Tokyo has a solid bid that ticks all the boxes and is perhaps the most financially solid of all four contenders, its lack of a compelling backstory and perceived lack of support at home could count against it. Buzzwords such as legacy and sustainability have become de rigeur and, with the IOC placing a premium on ensuring the Games reaches a new generation and expands into new markets, the youth-appeal that worked so decisively in London&apos;s favour is also seen as a key factor. In light of the recession, Rogge has said the IOC &quot;is in the mode for lean Games&quot;, putting the emphasis on reusable venues and lofty legacy goals."}, {"sentences": ["Plus here&apos;s the lowdown on the strengths and weaknesses of each bid: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo.", "Tokyo had a robot, nice uniforms and the air of the already defeated, Madrid had nice red, the prime minister and bullish optimism while Rio had Pele and President Lula, who - as president of the country on track to be the fifth largest economy on earth and a vocal advocate of Rio&apos;s cause throughout two years of presentations, IOC visits, press calls and PR - must be feeling a bit put out that Obama has swooped in to steal his thunder.", "9.04am Tokyo are next up by the way.", "9.32am Meanwhile Tokyo&apos;s presentation is kicking off.", "He mentions &quot;the heartfelt wish of the people of Japan to host the Games in Tokyo&quot;.", "9.43am The Tokyo video has got lots of pictures of healthy Japanese people and Japanese athletes.", "There&apos;s a bloke hurling the hammer and going &quot;aaaaaarrrrgh!&quot; Tokyo is probably a safe bet, a kind of Toyota Olympics with it&apos;s emphasis on being &quot;compact&quot; and green and economical, like a slightly dull brand new Prius.", "9.48am The Tokyo promo film has some great moody sax in it.", "9.52am Ichiro Kuno, president of the Tokyo bid is up, and he&apos;s sucking up to Jacques Rogge straight away.", "the next Tokyo bloke really can&apos;t speak English that well.", "10.06am I rather like the Tokyo lot.", "10.07am They&apos;re doing another film, this one about how easy it is to get around Tokyo and how clean everything is.", "I want to go to Tokyo.", "Stephen spencer says:   like most residents of Tokyo I&apos;m praying that the city doesn&apos;t win.", "10.24am On the Tokyo Mayor chappie John Senior writes: &quot;It&apos;s a shame Governor Ishihara didn&apos;t do the presentation.", "Today he declared that 2016 could be the last ever Olympics before mankind destroys the planet (unless, he presumably meant, Tokyo wins).&quot;  10.26am Next up on the stage is Rio.", "Chicago and Rio de Janeiro are viewed as favourites to win the contest ahead of Madrid and Tokyo.&quot;It wasn&apos;t actually that emotional.", "None of that weird Tokyo shouting about karaoke.", "12.08pm Just in case you&apos;re into that kind of thing, here&apos;s a bit about Tokyo&apos;s eco stadium.", "&quot;After that presentation by Madrid I am afraid it must go to Rio or Tokyo,&quot; writes Richard Young.", "All round the world, in Rio, Madrid and Chicago, and maybe even in Tokyo even though it&apos;s late and I can&apos;t find any photos of it, people are gathering to witness what is about to happen.", "The full list of cities and numbers is:Chicago - 4Rio - 7Tokyo - 8Madrid - 9Just in case you&apos;re there and want to know who you&apos;re voting for.", "And Tokyo&apos;s out!", "Less Europe, more world I say.&quot;  5.41pm Now a video from the Tokyo team.", "Tokyo, meanwhile, get a round of applause for their &quot;excellent bid&quot;."], "tags": ["Rio 2016", "Sport", "US news", "Spain", "Brazil", "Japan", "World news", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T06:28:29Z", "title": "Olympic Games 2016 host city decision day - as it happened!", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/02/olympic-games-2016-host-city-decision-live", "article": " It&apos;s an exciting day in Copenhagen as the celebrities supporting the four candidate cities touch down for the final push. The IOC delegates cast their votes later today, with a decision expected around 5.30pm.  Barney Ronay will be commenting live on all the days events plus we&apos;ll have updates from Owen Gibson in Copenhagen as well. There&apos;s still time to cast your vote for which city should win in our poll. Read all about the background to the bids in Owen&apos;s report from Copenhagen, as he delves into the politics behind each candidate&apos;s entry and in particular Barack Obama&apos;s backing for Chicago.  Plus here&apos;s the lowdown on the strengths and weaknesses of each bid: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo.  7.45am Hello and welcome. Even as I type Chicago&apos;s presentation has just kicked off. This is history in the making. This is huge. this is also a video of a man singing some bluesy music that sounds a bit like the them tune from The Wire over shots of happy smiling non-broke or unemployed Americans. Go Chi!  7.50am Owen Gibson is in Copenhagen with his finger literally on the beating pulse of world sport. He sends this update from the epicentre:   things got underway last night with a day of frantic press conferences as all the rival bidders tried desperately to combat the fact their final push had been comprehensively overshadowed by the leader of the free world turning up today to bat for his former home city. Tokyo had a robot, nice uniforms and the air of the already defeated, Madrid had nice red, the prime minister and bullish optimism while Rio had Pele and President Lula, who - as president of the country on track to be the fifth largest economy on earth and a vocal advocate of Rio&apos;s cause throughout two years of presentations, IOC visits, press calls and PR - must be feeling a bit put out that Obama has swooped in to steal his thunder.   7.58am So Chicago currently burbling on about how it hopes to be considered as good as Hackney at presenting a major global event. A man is now talking at a lectern while we see a video of inspiring pictures of stuff happening in Chicago. &quot;If you award us the games, we will be your best partners. The people of Chicago are passionate honest and hard-working.&quot;Really? All of them?  8.01am Oh no! It&apos;s children saying weepy heartfelt things about Chicago. &quot;The heart of America!&quot; Oh no, they&apos;re singing. Stirring music is playing. &quot;Chicago brings people together!&quot; Children are doing brave things in classrooms.  8.08am There&apos;s a kind of chatshow style Q&amp;A going on now involving a US decathlete and a nice smiley woman. They;re called Brian and Linda. A man called Doug Arnott comes on. He&apos;s billed as &quot;the architect of our Games plan&quot;. Now he&apos;s doing a speech in weirdly accented French. Oh good. He&apos;s stopped and become American again. &quot;Our goal was to build venues that support both elite sport and youth sport.&quot; Good idea. Someone get on the blower to London 2012.  8.15am Doug Arnott: &quot;Concrete and steel do not build sport. People build sport.&quot; Which is probably right. Unless you&apos;re playing concreteball. More from Owen Gibson in the hub:  At last night&apos;s gala opening, featuring - of course - equestrianism reinterpreted through the medium of dance and a specially composed song called &quot;Plant a Tree&quot;, it was clear that it was the Oprah and Michelle show that was captivating the normally reserved IOC members - all protocol abandoned as camera phones were proffered and a mini scrum developed in the normally refined environs of the Copenhagen Opera House. The London 2012 contingent, including Seb Coe, were spotted reminiscing about Singapore four years ago and feeling a lot more relaxed now than they did then. However, there were reports that Winfrey might have lost a few votes by making IOC members&apos; wives wait for the lift at the Marriott Hotel where all the IOC members are staying and furious lobbying has been taking place over the last few days.    8.16am &quot;And now, here&apos;s someone familair to me and you - Bob Ctvrtlik!&quot;  8.17am Bob Ctvrtlik is talking about development and corporate partnerships. Eric E Schmidt from Goggle pops up with a message of support. He looks like a really well-groomed super-nerd and is probably worth at least $3646454bn. Quick shot of Obama looking interested.  8.20am &quot;Sports has given me so much! Like confidence!&quot; More happy teenagers with huge shiny white teeth. And this just in from Seb Coe on the wires: &quot;Any one of these four cities could deliver a great Olympics - this is probably the highest quality contest there has been. It is very close competition and it could all be decided by the final presentations.&quot;There you have it. It&apos;s all up for grabs.  8.25am Wow! It&apos;s Michelle Obama. &quot;I was born and raised on Chicago&apos;s south-side,&quot; she starts off. She looks great, as ever, in a kind of shiny yellow suit and with truly enormous TV hair. Never mind him, she is absolutely great. She&apos;s talking about cheering on Carl Lewis when she was a kid. Me too, Michelle, me too.  8.28am This is easy for the First Lady, she&apos;s talking about the Chicago she knows. &quot;I&apos;m not asking just as the First Lady of the United States, and not just as a Chicagean, and not just as a mother... I&apos;m asking as a daughter. You see, my dad would have been so proud&quot;. Michelle&apos;s dad had multiple sclerosis. &quot;He taught me to throw a mean right hook&quot;. Not a dry eye in the house. &quot;My dad was my hero!&quot; Blimey. What a show-stopper.  8.30am Michelle is absolutely ripping it up. She seems genuinely moved by all this, much more so than all the Dougs and Berts and Daves. She&apos;s introducing &quot;my husband, the President of the United States&quot;. He&apos;s up.  8.31am President Obama is now speaking. &quot;America is ready and eager to assume that sacred trust. We&apos;re a nation that has always opened its arms to the world. Including my father...&quot; More fathers.  8.32am &quot;On those Chicago streets I worked alongside folks of every colour and nationality... each is part of our city, one city, a place where I found a home&quot; I want to live in Chicago. With Michelle Obama. &quot;The World Cup we hosted in the 90s - we know how to put on big events.&quot; Really glad he didn&apos;t use the word &quot;soccer&quot; there.  8.35am Obama&apos;s breezing through this, lots of stuff about the American dream and we can make it if we try and moments in history and fates of nations. It&apos;s like a really stirring music hall song. He is doing a political speech now. This bit&apos;s kind of about him and &quot;why I ran for president&quot; rather than which city the pole vault should happen in.  8.36am The concept of the Olympic Movement was originally supposed to be supra-political, something that related sport to the greater good. Politicians have been trying to hijak it ever since. Here&apos;s another one borrowing its imagery and its phrases.  8.38am Obama wants to &quot;welcome the world &quot;into my neighborhood&quot;  8.39am He ends a little weakly with &quot;the city of Chicago and America will make the world proud&quot; and just sort of walks off. Questions from the IOC members now.  8.40am Sergei Bubka is asking a question! Go Sergei! It&apos;s about the Olympic village and the cycling annexe. Will it be as high spec as the main village? Get in there Sergei, stick your bendy pole in.  8.44am Chicago is currently reassuring Sergei Bubka. Some insight from Owen in Copenhagen:   there is a bit of history between the US and the IOC - Atlanta was a bit of a disaster and there have been a series of disputes over how TV revenues are shared. hence lots of references to what Chicago can do for the Olympic movement. There has been a lot of talk about how chicago will adopt a humble approach - reconnecting America with the world and supporting the Olympic movement and the presentation seems to be following that approach. But the odd reference to to sponsorship revenues betrays one of the key reasons why chicago is favourite - in uncertain economic times, it offers a windfall in sponsorship and TV income.    8.47am Doug Arnott, Chicago bid vice president reassures Bubka that it&apos;s easy to get around the Olympic village site. He keeps calling him &quot;Mr Boobka&quot;.  8.46am &quot;The next question is from Prince Albert&quot;. Let&apos;s hope it&apos;s a piercing one then. But ultimately pleasurable.  8.48am Actually it&apos;s about &quot;the legacy&quot; of a Chicago Games. Bob Ctvrtlik says Chicago will &quot;put the fun back into the Games&quot; by doing stuff in parks. Is fun really a legacy? How long does fun last? Anyway, Boris has already sold the London games on the issue of having fun and making it more like a garden party.  8.50am Having fun. Transl: &quot;not spending as much as China but still somehow pulling it off on the cheap.&quot;  8.53am A question from one Professor Lundqvist about doping. Chicago says it will try to stop doping happen and co operate with everyone blah blah. Imagine them saying anything else.  8.55am Barack answers a question about the travel infrastructure supporting all the visitors. &quot;America is at its best when it&apos;s open to the world.... Chicago, we&apos;ve got everybody, this could be a meeting in Chicago, we look like the world!... We are linked to the world.&quot; He gets some applause, but there&apos;s no doubt he&apos;s better with an autocue. That was a bit like a first draught of an advert for McDonalds or a new and extra friendly brand of chewing gum.  8.58am For some reason Obama has just been presented with a framed picture. And now the Chicago team are all off to scattered applause. They&apos;ve done their worst and Obama did his bit very nicely. for what it&apos;s worth I suspect that he&apos;s going to swing it. How can you say no to all that star power. He&apos;s a very good presenter too. Would be a terrible snub now if Chicago dont get it.  8.59am And after the Lord Mayor&apos;s show, here&apos;s a quiz about football in the Olympics.  9.02am American TV are harping on about the applause Obama got for his bits, pointing out that applauding an Olympic bid presentation is quite unusual. But then, so is a US president turing up and talking about America opening its doors to the world. To be honest the applause sounded a bit forced and embarrassed. What are you supposed to do when he&apos;s talking like that?  9.04am Tokyo are next up by the way. Tough act to follow, but they are a decent safe bet.  9.14am Apparently the IOC lot have all swarmed around the Obamas to shoot the breeze and bathe in their star heat. There&apos;s a bit of a a suggestion going around that Chicago have a been appealing directly to the African and Caribbean block. Obama flagged up his Kenyan father in his speech. It&apos;s a bit like a global election campaign for him, he&apos;s talked in exactly the same way.  9.20am Oprah Winfrey is also &quot;working the floor&quot;. Can that be right? We&apos;re about to have a press conference with all the Chi lot, including the Obamas. They&apos;re sitting next to each other. Sweet. And more The Wire-style music to introduce them.  9.23am Actually, the Obamas aren&apos;t in it. they&apos;ve shuffled off somewhere else. Probably for the best with all those hard-nosed sports hacks in the room.  9.26am The first question is about the Pres and his &quot;message to the world&quot;. He&apos;s kind of taken over all this and he&apos;s not even here now. I wonder if it&apos;s at all annoying for the bid team to work like maniacs on this, the moment of their careers, and then have to talk about Johnny-come-lately glory-hunter Obama the whole time.  9.28am The Mayor of Chicago is talking about &quot;a bedder life not juss for our chilrun but for all chilrun&quot;  9.30am You can tell Chicago feel they nailed it - and it was a good presentation. Americans are excellent at this kind of thing. It was showbiz and Oprah and TV and played the big emotional chords. But is that kind of thing really going to work with the IOC?  9.32am Meanwhile Tokyo&apos;s presentation is kicking off. They&apos;re fighting back with their new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama.  9.35am And they&apos;re kicking off with Hatoyama on the opening leg. He seems fairly youthful and slick, a bit like a Japanese David Cameron. He&apos;s only been in the job for two weeks. He mentions &quot;the heartfelt wish of the people of Japan to host the Games in Tokyo&quot;. He&apos;s talking about the body and soul and his personal philosophy.  9.38am But... the last Games were in Asia. Are we really going to have a Japanese Olympics after a Chinese Olympics, with just London in between? I bet we don&apos;t. Sorry Yukio, much as I like your promises on greenhouse emissions, which for some reason he&apos;s going on about now. The elections are over. You won. Now say something that appeals to Sergei Bubka.  9.41am He&apos;s pitching it as a green urban bid. There&apos;s a lot of stuff about nature and man in harmony. He&apos;s also given a government guarantee for all the funding. Bit unfair really as he&apos;s talking in a foreign language, but this is no swinging Obama presentation.  9.43am The Tokyo video has got lots of pictures of healthy Japanese people and Japanese athletes. There&apos;s a bloke hurling the hammer and going &quot;aaaaaarrrrgh!&quot; Tokyo is probably a safe bet, a kind of Toyota Olympics with it&apos;s emphasis on being &quot;compact&quot; and green and economical, like a slightly dull brand new Prius.  9.48am The Tokyo promo film has some great moody sax in it. Da da dee, dum dum. It&apos;s an inspiring tale of ordinary people doing sport, even though they&apos;re also waitresses and schoolkids. A nine year old does judo and she looks a bit tasty too. Neat and stylish young people smile. A florist runs over a bridge. A cook does the pommel horse. I hope he&apos;s washed his hands.  9.52am Ichiro Kuno, president of the Tokyo bid is up, and he&apos;s sucking up to Jacques Rogge straight away. &quot;You have encouraged us!&quot; Then he says &quot;Japanese people are not good at showing our emotions&quot; and you kind of want to give him a cuddle. He&apos;s emphasising that the money is all sorted, which was one of their problems. The government now seems to be fully backing the bid.  9.55am Now he&apos;s showing off by speaking French with a strong Japanese accent. It&apos;s weird but not bad. Very likable, Mr Kuno. &quot;Japan&apos;s strong point - teamwahhk!&quot; he says with a flourish. And here comes the rest of his team, the women in very nice matching blazers with varsity style badges on them.  9.58am The first tokyo woman seems to excited she&apos;s almost completely out of control. &quot;We have access to THE PACIFIC OCEAN!&quot; &quot;If you have never tried karaoke then WE... WILL... TAKE YOU!!!&quot; No kidding. I want to go, too. Let&apos;s go and do karaoke. She reminded me slightly of Su pollard as a yellow coat in an early episode of Hi De Hi.  10.01am Oh dear. the next Tokyo bloke really can&apos;t speak English that well. It&apos;s not really fair this, but his accent is massively distracting. &quot;The important thing is to CHALLENGE... YOUR... OWN... LIMITS!!!&quot; He ends with a weird bit of visualisation about &quot;a cheering crowd&quot; and then yells like a nutcase &quot;INTOKYO2016!!!!&quot;.  10.03am They do have two paralympic representatives on stage, the bloke with the bad accent, who is blind, and a woman in a wheelchair. I don&apos;t think Chicago had such a strong presence.  10.06am I rather like the Tokyo lot. they&apos;ve got a synchronised swimmer up now, a former gold medalist apparently. She seems nice. And she can probably stand upside down in a swimming pool waggling her legs about too. &quot;It is... our... TOKYO!!&quot; she ends. They all seem to have had the same media training, based around yelling a lot at the end.  10.07am They&apos;re doing another film, this one about how easy it is to get around Tokyo and how clean everything is. They&apos;ve got electric taxis, bullet trains and tasty raw fish. I want to go to Tokyo. They&apos;ve even mocked up a happy, clean, non-drunk or fat crowd going into the Olympic stadium looking sleek and calm.  10.09am &quot;President Logge, delegates...&quot;  10.10am A dissenting voice. Or at least, a voice. Stephen spencer says:   like most residents of Tokyo I&apos;m praying that the city doesn&apos;t win. The bid is the brainchild of the notorious egomaniac Shintaro Ishihara, governor of this fair concrete megalopolis**... Let&apos;s go Rio, Madrid or Chicago! We want to watch it at home on the telly and have our tax dosh spent on something useful.  **note: very interesting but potentially libelous bits edited out.  10.11am Some manga-style comic images. Like it. And a child doing lots of backflips in a kind of urban slum. Shun-Ichiro Okano is back and he&apos;s giving his final summing up.  10.15am They&apos;re doing a final sucking up to &quot;the Olympic movement&quot; and thanking everyone. And now they&apos;re off and its questions from the IOC members.  10.17am Prof Lundquist is back asking about doping again. It&apos;s the same question he asked Chicago. Will you help in the fight against drugs? The answer, amazingly, is yes we will.  10.19am Prince Albert is back with more piercing insights. He&apos;s asking about the Olympic village again. Kono tells him it&apos;s all in hand. He says &quot;the most important thing for us is a legacy that lives in the heart&quot;. Like a fried cheese sandwich.  10.23am Kono promises &quot;no smell from the fish market&quot;. Not sure what he&apos;s on about, but it sounds like good news. Is that a metaphor for something? The Olympic diploma is handed over again, a big piece of paper in a picture frame, and they&apos;re off.  10.24am On the Tokyo Mayor chappie John Senior writes: &quot;It&apos;s a shame Governor Ishihara didn&apos;t do the presentation. He may be a gaffe-prone ultranationalist (think a green Silvio Berlusconi), but he&apos;d certainly have grabbed people&apos;s attention. Today he declared that 2016 could be the last ever Olympics before mankind destroys the planet (unless, he presumably meant, Tokyo wins).&quot;  10.26am Next up on the stage is Rio. Looking at your comments there seems to be some support for a first South American Games. I have to admit I&apos;d love Rio to get it. What a brilliant place it is. That really would be an Olympic Games.  10.30am A bit of a kerfuffle in Copenhagen. This on the wires:  Police say they have detained 43 people in the Danish capital for public disturbance, some trying to hang a banner on a building along the route that President Barack Obama took to attend an IOC meeting  Apparently it&apos;s Greenpeace people trying to hang some painted sheets up. Leave them alone for heaven&apos;s sake. What is the point?  10.34am But yes, a Rio Olympics. Wouldn&apos;t that be something? Maybe they&apos;d finally do the Maracana up. The last time I went there Vasco da Gama were playing Flamengo and there were about 3,000 people in the far distance waving flags in the middle of a horrible crumbling concrete bowl and shouting &quot;&apos;Meennngo!&quot;. It is absolutely huge. But you could fill in the moat and make it a running track. This was about 15 years ago by the way, so apologies if it&apos;s been fixed up since.  10.38am American TV is still going on about the fact that people gave the Obamas a good reception. They seem genuinely stunned by it. Maybe America just isn&apos;t used to being liked on the world stage after all those Bush years. But they&apos;re also very smug about their &quot;star power&quot;. &quot;Chicago knew it had to bring its A-game,&quot; the bloke on ABC says. Get out of it.            10.41am: Mr and Mrs Obama take to the stage in Copenhagen to push Chicago&apos;s case.  10.45am The view seems to be that Chicago are now favourites after their presentation, but solely on the back of the Obama stardust. It was a bit gloomy and downbeat apart from them (or her). Maybe Rio can blow them out of the water with a bit more fun and pizazz and enthusiasm. The odd jewelled bikini.  10.56am Well, this is getting exciting now. It feels as though the next presentation could be decisive with Chicago and Rio facing off as the narrow favourites. Don&apos;t blow it Brazil. And for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t let Pele have the mic. On the wires:&quot;Barack Obama launched an emotional appeal today to the International Olympic Committee to choose his home city Chicago to host the 2016 Games. Chicago and Rio de Janeiro are viewed as favourites to win the contest ahead of Madrid and Tokyo.&quot;It wasn&apos;t actually that emotional. But he did a job.  11.00am Five minutes to go until the Rio bid get on the stage. Let&apos;s play bid bingo. My suggestions: &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot;; &quot;strong security&quot;, &quot;in the shadow of the Sugarloaf&quot;, &quot;one big beach party&quot;, &quot;samba-style&quot;, er... &quot;girl from Ipanema&quot;. Something about the rainforest and the environment.  11.04am Incidentally &quot;tasty&quot;, here in London, means &quot;good at fighting&quot; among the Guy Ritchie-style mock-geezer community. So wash your minds out with caustic soda  11.05am Owen Gibson is of course as we speak crawling through the pulsing arteries at the very heart of world sport. Here&apos;s his latest bulletin from inside the beast.  11.12am Carlos Arthur Nuzman is kicking things off for Rio, addressing Rogge and his friends in a lilting Brazilian-accented French. Before him we had a brief address from Joao Havelange, also in French. Very austere so far.  11.15am Nuzman is talking about confidence and the new economy and the youth of the world. &quot;Brazil is uniquely placed,&quot; he says in a cute Brazilian accent. Well, it&apos;s in south America for a start. Some shots of the Sugarloaf, beaches, young people, lots of glad-handing Brazilian politicians who, as ever, look like total comedians and good-time boys.  11.17am This just in from Owen, bid-side: &quot;view in the press centre seems to broadly accord with US TV - chicago presentation pretty flat before michelle stood up to speak, but she might have done the job for them. much depends on how rio can respond - it&apos;s a long day and the Obamas emotional impact may have dulled by the time they come to vote.&quot;  11.20am The best film yet with some lovely jazzy music and great pics of Rio and Cariocas doing watersports and dancing. It&apos;s all gone carnival down there. Trumpets, bongos, twiddly guitars, and a nice croony voice over the top with fireworks and carnival shots.  11.21am So far so good for Rio. It&apos;s all a lot more lively and colourful than the Chicago one, which, even when Meesh and Barack were on was quite sombre and quietly hectoring. They&apos;re concentrating on the economic side right now and promising &quot;safe and secure Games, the climax of decades of investment&quot;. This is what they need to work on.  11.25am Henrique Merlielles is up, the governor of the Brazilian central bank. It&apos;s slightly humiliating that Brazil has to do this, but there you go. The place was a basket case with rampant inflation just 15 years ago. He&apos;s talking up the current situation and the $420bn they&apos;re pouring into Rio&apos;s development.  11.26am Mac Millings notes: &quot;I like the photo. It makes it look like Chicago are planning to hold the Olympics in an enormous, Truman Show-style space age bubble. I suppose that would be to protect the Spirit of the Games from Chicagoan corruption. Although I may have that the wrong way round.&quot;  11.28am The bank governor is boasting about Brazil&apos;s recent oil find now. He walks off and gets a lovely backslap from Eduardo Paes, mayor of Rio. It made a loud &quot;flop&quot; noise. And there it is, first shot of Christ the Redeemer as Paes talks fluently about the World Cup coming and economies of scale.  11.30am Brazil is going really big on legacy and economy, presumably knowing they&apos;ve already got fun and glitz and the underdog vote in the bag. Let&apos;s hope they don&apos;t forget their strengths as well. But also that they don&apos;t let Pele say anything.  11.34am Wow! The Rio Games site looks absolutely amazing. The village and the stadia are right on the seafront. I want to live there and play beach football with Jairzinho every day. Then we can go for a caipirinha in a beach front cafe and maybe go to a jazz club and have a really great time. Every day. Maybe I&apos;ll start to wear gold jewelry and a white linen suit. Even the BMX park looks brilliant and verdant. Brazil does tropical gardens really well.  11.36am They have got to give it to Rio. It&apos;s a major re-development opportunity for them. The whole place is being made over and done up, and let&apos;s face it, it could do with it. &quot;Rio 2016 will help chance the face of Rio,&quot; they say. And you really believe them.  11.37am Disclaimer: other Olympic bid cities are also available. I am really biased.  11.39am Isabel Swan, a Brazilian athlete, is up now. She&apos;s great too. Brilliant. She&apos;s got Pele on his feet waving at the crowd too, which is fine, just don&apos;t let him speak. This Swan is speaking very well here, presenting it all very clearly, at least as good as an Obama.  11.40am Swan, who is great, introduces &quot;our great leader&quot;, the bearded President Lula. He gives her a lingering bear hug. Steady.  11.44am Lula seems to be wearing a Blue Peter badge. And he&apos;s already mentioned &quot;the golden sands of Copacabana Beach&quot;. &quot;We are a people who give meaning to the term &quot;melting pot&quot;. It is at the core of our identity&quot;. Take that Barack! &quot;Among the top ten economies in the world, Brazil is the only one who has never hosted a Games.&quot; Case closed, surely. &quot;This is not a Games for Brazil, this is a Games for South America&quot;.  11.47am Lula is nailing it. He&apos;s pushing all the buttons about the inclusivity of the Olympic movement and sending a message to the world. The logic is overwhelming. And he&apos;s stressing that they&apos;ve got the finance all in place. &quot;Dear friends, Brazil is experiencing an excellent moment...&quot; He is doing very well.  11.50am &quot;Rio is ready... give us this chance and you will not regret it. Be sure, the Games we will deliver in Rio will be unforgettable. They will be full of the passion, the energy and thew creativity of the Brazilian people&quot; Exit to what sounds like much louder applause than either of the Obamas got. Really well done, that. Lula did the job. Now, if they can just keep Pele quiet...  11.52am Another film. Very multicultural this one. There&apos;s a bloke in a bedouin style head dress talking in Portuguese. and a Nigerian-looking bloke. And then a really nice shot of those golden sands with the Olympic rings on them. Very pretty indeed.  11.55am Rio just needs a a big finish here and it&apos;s done. They can only blow it from here. The bid president is talking about &quot;universal celebrations of sport&quot; and how &quot;the last two years have been the greatest of my life&quot;. All the bids have had this bit where they seem to be just talking to the IOC lot directly. It&apos;s a bit odd.  11.58am &quot;When you push the button today you have the chance to inspire a continent. Vote Rio and we open a gateway to 180 million passionate young people in south America.&quot; That&apos;s the way to do it. None of that weird Tokyo shouting about karaoke. Very good summing up.  11.59am Question time again. Will Prince Albert come chinking up again?  12.00pm Crickey it&apos;s Prof Lundqvist again with his doping stuff. He&apos;s there to ask everyone about access to athletes. And Prince Albert is dramatically increasing his pleasure by asking about legacy again.  12.02pm Nuzman of Brazil is providing the reassurances on doping. Grant Cartledge wants to know: &quot;...did Pele say anything? And if he did, was it about...?&quot; Well, you know. Those ads. No, no Pele yet. And it looks like they&apos;ve got away with it. He won&apos;t be able to get in now. Just questions. ,  12.05pm The only iffy thing about the Rio bid seems to be all this stuff about cruise ships docking in the port to provide accommodation, as they do for carnival. It just sounds a bit irregular somehow. Paes is desperately trying to make it sound completely normal that people are going to have to stay on ships and not in hotels. Quick. Gloss over it and get on to something else.  12.08pm Just in case you&apos;re into that kind of thing, here&apos;s a bit about Tokyo&apos;s eco stadium.  12.10pm Lula&apos;s answering a question about the delivery of the whole thing. He&apos;s defending Brazil&apos;s right to call itself a developed nation these days and to carry out this kind of global project. &quot;It is a wish of the Brazilian people&quot; he says. He looks quite impassioned about it too.  12.15pm Rio gets its framed diploma. Nuzman and a 17-year-old athlete pick it up. She&apos;s been in tears pretty much all morning so Nuzman gives her a hug. And that&apos;s it for Rio - and for me too. Thanks for reading and thanks for your emails. Simon Burnton will be picking up the rest of the action when he&apos;s come back from getting a medicinal Diet Coke.  12.30pm Hello world! Madrid are up next, but not until 1.45pm UK time. Until then, or just before then, it&apos;s not that I&apos;m not excited and stuff but I&apos;m going to be mainly doing other things. I still love you really.       1.00pm To get to know a place, it&apos;s always good to find out what kind of music the people there are into. So here&apos;s current Spanish No1 smash single Esclavo De Sus Besos by David Bisbal! And here&apos;s the title track from Fito y Fitipaldis&apos; current chart-topping album Antes de que cuente Diez! And before you get all don&apos;t-they-have-rubbish-taste on me, here&apos;s our own No1, embedded in a use-friendly widget. OK, ours is cooler.       1.10pm And, while I&apos;m on the subject, here&apos;s the US No1 by the Black Eyed Peas. Everyone else here at Guardian HQ seems to be working diligently. Me, I&apos;ve got a big pair of headphones on and I&apos;m having a little private dance party. With fairly cheesy music.  1.45pm I have to admit to being a bit bemused by the odds on this race. For one thing, Rio isn&apos;t the favourite. For another, Madrid isn&apos;t the outsider. With London hosting in 2012, surely another western European city has absolutely no chance at all? Surely the Spaniards are the Eric Moussambanis of this particular race? ie, they&apos;ve got no chance at all and, though they might give us all a bit of fun along the way, are just wasting everybody&apos;s time? Surely?  1.46pm The delegates have been told to take their seats. Madrid-based action coming up.  1.49pm The Madrid delegation have filed into the room. This isn&apos;t the most interesting minute to be writing a minute-by-minute update on, to be honest. But I can reveal that their bid&apos;s token football star is ... Raul! Not bad, but Rio had Pele.  1.52pm The only emails I&apos;ve had in the last 10 minutes both came from the BBC&apos;s press office and we telling me about a sequel to Winnie the Pooh, read by Bernard Cribbins. If you work for a press office anywhere, let me know what you&apos;d like me to tell the world about and I&apos;ll do my best.  1.55pm Early Madrid catchphrases: &quot;We can spread the magic!&quot; and &quot;Individuals not infrastructure!&quot;  1.58pm Oooh, a video! People of different nationalities are arguing about who is the most Madrid-like. &quot;The Italians are the most Madrilenians \u2013 we love art as much as they do.&quot; &quot;No, the most Madrilenians are us the Chinese, that strength, that hope, binds us together.&quot; They&apos;re all extremely, er, Madrilenians, though, because they all speak perfect Spanish.  2.00pm A former Olympic hockey champion is introducing Madrid&apos;s &quot;legacy plan&quot;. &quot;We believe in our games with a human touch,&quot; she says. &quot;Looking at them the funny thing is that [prime minister] Zapatero is socialist and Esperanza Aguirre and Gallardon who are the mayor and president of Madrid are conservative,&quot; writes Ian Pinhey. &quot;So Aguirre and Gallardon hate Zapatero but also hate each other! There have been accusations of Aguirre spying on Gallardon recently.&quot;  2.02pm Oooh, a video! They&apos;ve got a venue called The Magic Box. What&apos;s not to like about that?  2.07pm Beatriz Quir\u00f3s Mancebo, a Madrilenian living in London, has got on the line. &quot;Today it should be our day! We deserve it,&quot; she writes. &quot;I know Chicago &amp; Rio are the favourites, but I don&apos;t think none of them have all the Population support &amp; enthusiasm that we have!&quot; \u2013 it&apos;s true, Madrid had 86% popular support for its bid, the best rating of all the bidding cities \u2013 &quot;We need the chance to show to the World how wonderful city Madrid is ... and for sure organisation is going to be great (just remind you the successs in Barcelona 1992). Come on Madrid! YES, WE CAN!&quot; Madrid also appears to have just promised hotel rooms in 2016 at &quot;guaranteed 2009 prices&quot;.  2.09pm If Madrid really wanted to impress me, they&apos;d have hired a Spanish-English translator who&apos;s a little bit more inspiring than this one. I&apos;m sure she&apos;d brilliant at translating and everything, but she is not getting across Esperanza Aguirre&apos;s inspirational oratory skills.      Disappointed Paris 2012 Olympic bid supporters file away after finding out that London had won the Games instead. Photograph: Srdjan Suki/EPA    2.11pm Gary Naylor has emailed! &quot;Rather like the Eurovision Song Contest, the winners of The Games tend to look one-dimensionally elated, but the losers look rather more interesting. Can we have a Guardian gallery of the losers as they discover their fate? I love the looks of anger, jealousy, bitterness, blame, befuddlement, disappointment, resignation etc etc etc as their fate is made known. The Parisian delegation and assembled masses in 2005 were superbly expressive.&quot; Er, no. But you might like this.  2.18pm Oooh, a video! This time, they are bringing a buff A4 envelope by hand from Madrid to Copenhagen, via lots of other places. And here it is, in the hall itself! It&apos;s a letter from Madrid to all of you, out there. And not a very long one either. They&apos;ve offered us their work, and also their friendship. &quot;Together we can dream and we can suffer,&quot; they say. Well you can suffer by yourself, if you don&apos;t mind. We can dream together though, if you like.  2.22pm Alejandro Blanco, president of the Spanish Olympic Association, is on the mic. &quot;We will reduce travel times!&quot; he pledges. &quot;What do we want? We want success!&quot; Hell, yeah!  2.23pm &quot;We believe that Madrid offers an inspirational organisation, a festival for all the Olympic family,&quot; Blanco continues, &quot;allowing them to realise their potential, to be happy and enjoy the games \u2013 the games with a human touch!&quot;  2.28pm Raul&apos;s talking. &quot;Hola everyone!&quot; Next to him is a young girl, the future of Spanish athletics apparently, who is very clearly extremely scared. &quot;I believe, we believe,&quot; he concludes. As does the Paralympian who speaks next. And the young girl, who speaks excellently well in English and is rewarded with a kiss from Raul.  2.30pm Oooh, a video! And Madrid introduce flamenco music to their presentation for the first time. A little overdue if you ask me. It accompanies images of Spanish sporting achievement and celebration. Quite a good video, actually.  2.34pm 89-year-old Juan Antonio Samaranch, former IOC president, basically asks the IOC to give Spain the Olympics as a personal favour to him, because he&apos;s going to die soon. And Ed Brown emails to remind us about the photograph members of the Spanish basketball team made before going to Beijing. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to nay-say the city of Madrid \u2013 it&apos;s nice \u2013 but frankly in my opinion the Spanish don&apos;t deserve to host an Olympics any time soon.&quot; Ah, but you forgot this.  2.35pm It&apos;s only the ruddy king! He promises that &quot;a vote for Madrid ... will lead to more friendship&quot; and says that &quot;the world will be a better place to live following Madrid 2016&quot;. Crikey, these are big promises.  2.38pm Ooooh, a video! A bit arty this one. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s about. People are saying verbs in the past tense. &quot;I stayed&quot;, &quot;I jumped&quot;, &quot;I suffered&quot;, that kind of stuff. Fernando Torres pops up. &quot;I showed off,&quot; he says. Rafael Nadal&apos;s there too! &quot;I saw,&quot; he tells us. OK then. And that&apos;s the end of Madrid&apos;s presentation. 5/10 for in-hall applause, I&apos;d say.  2.40pm Questions from the floor begin, as seems traditional, with some chap from Sweden asking about anti-doping. &quot;Madridlians are best known for the &apos;chuleria&apos; (pretentious behaviour),&quot; writes Xixa. &quot;I think Rio will offer a much better show and give the oportunity to south America, Spain had Barcelona. It&apos;s mad they should get it.&quot;  2.41pm Prince Albert has asked some questions. He very much likes asking questions. And Gintare has dropped us a line to disagree with Xixa. &quot;Two years ago I spent five months in Madrid on an Erasmus programme, and it is definitely the friendliest place I have ever spent time in,&quot; she says. &quot;The Madrile\u00f1os love their city, and love the fact that people come to see it. I was treated like a princess all the time. If there is one thing that Madrid deserves to host the Olympics for it is definitely that &apos;human touch&apos; they have been talking about.&quot; So there you are. No chuleria at all.  2.43pm Oh dear. &quot;After that presentation by Madrid I am afraid it must go to Rio or Tokyo,&quot; writes Richard Young. &quot;I have long believed Rio would win as that is the way the IOC thinks. Rio certianly have pushed their buttons. I stayed with the Madrid bid team in Beijing and found them then to be as inhospitable as they appear on stage now. It is all fakery!&quot; Crikey.  2.45pm &quot;The Olympic decision must rival the Champions League draw for manufactured &apos;tension&apos;,&quot; writes Kieran. Who would like me to mention that &quot;Mad&quot; Frankie Fraser is going to be speaking at the Devonshire Hotel in Liverpool on 16 October. The Madrid team are explaining that they have &quot;used the hand of our logo to create a legacy for each finger&quot;. They mean that there would be five strands to their legacy \u2013 cultural, environmental, economic, that kind of thing \u2013 not that, for example, the logo&apos;s little finger would get a legacy all of its own.  2.48pm Sergei Bubka has asked a question about sailing. Sergei Bubka is the greatest pole vaulter in the history of humanity. You don&apos;t really expect him to be bothering with sailing.  2.50pm That is the end of the Madrid presentation. The team receive their special commemorative IOC diploma. They look like a nice bunch really. Maybe they&apos;ll get the 2020 games, eh, because they&apos;ve got a bogglingly small chance of getting this one.  2.53pm &quot;This is not the end of proceedings, by far,&quot; warns Jacques Rogge to delegates traipsing out of the room. We&apos;re about to start voting. But not before someone presents a report into something or other.  2.58pm &quot;The four cities and their projects perfectly embody the Olympic spirit,&quot; the report says. Well that&apos;s a relief.  3.01pm &quot;We leave it to you, dear colleagues, to reflect upon each project,&quot; says the chair of the 2016 evaluation commission. What she means is, it&apos;s time to vote.  3.04pm First, they open the floor to questions. Inevitably, that bloke from Sweden pipes up to witter on about doping. He considers the evaluation commisson&apos;s report to have been &quot;too vague&quot; on this issue. Which is why he&apos;s had to ask all these questions. Rogge asks him to &quot;draft a little note&quot;.  3.05pm Another question, from the Prince of Orange. Where&apos;s Orange? Do they really have a monarchy? Why do we only get the prince? Is the King of Orange otherwise engaged? All these questions rush to my mind in such a giddy whoosh that I take absolutely no notice of his own. Sorry.  3.10pm &quot;Spanish TV seems to think they got it in the bag,&quot; reports Alasdair Barratt. &quot;In fact if it weren&apos;t for your coverage, I&apos;d think they were the only candidate city.&quot; They&apos;re going to have a very bad afternoon, then, that&apos;s my prediction. They&apos;re now having a coffee break and will be returning \u2013 as will I \u2013 at 3.50pm UK time, 40 minutes from now.  3.12pm Before the coffee break, Rogge recommends that &quot;you might use it to celebrate the birthday of Mr Frankie Fredericks&quot;. Interesting idea, but let&apos;s go with it. So here he is, coming second in something, by a considerable margin. Happy 42nd birthday, Frankie! See you in a little more than half an hour.      Spaniards gather in central Madrid to proudly cheer their city to Olympic glory. Or inevitable first-round elimination. Whatever. Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images    3.50pm So here we go then. All round the world, in Rio, Madrid and Chicago, and maybe even in Tokyo even though it&apos;s late and I can&apos;t find any photos of it, people are gathering to witness what is about to happen.     Brazilians get ready for a(nother) beach party in Rio. Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/AP    And what is about to happen is this: a vote. If no city gets a clear majority of the valid votes, the city that gets the least will be rejected and they&apos;ll vote again, and again, until one city does get a majority of all the valid votes cast (abstentions, spoiled ballot papers etc don&apos;t count).     Crowds flock to Daley Square in Chicago to cheer their city home. Basketball legend Scottie Pippen is there, apparently. Photograph: M. Spencer Green/AP    But, though Jacques Rogge told everyone to be back in the hall at 3.50, there&apos;s still no action and the screens are saying that they&apos;ll resume at 4.10pm instead. I&apos;ll let you know, obviously. In the meantime, here are some pictures of parties in progress...  4.05pm Andrew Siegler is actually in Rio right now! &quot;There&apos;s a giant party on the beach in Copacabana,&quot; he reports. &quot;Half of the city doesn&apos;t have to work today, so I&apos;ve heard some predictions of 500,000 people there (probably overly optimistic). Sounds almost as exciting as a Guardian live blog.&quot; Almost.  4.11pm Action! Frankie Fredericks, on his birthday, is a scrutineer!  4.12pm When I say action, of course, I use the word in its loosest possible sense. The first action is to conduct a draw to assign numbers to each of the candidate cities, which can thereafter be used in the voting process. You dig? The first number, weirdly, is eight.  4.16pm The voting rules are being read. Slowly. If there&apos;s a tie at any point, there&apos;ll be a revote between the two tied cities. Tracy Mohr is in Chicago. &quot;The locals seem to be just about wetting themselves in anticipation,&quot; she says. &quot;If Rio wins it, there will be a lot of disappointed people.&quot;  4.20pm Everybody has a voting box. The full list of cities and numbers is:Chicago - 4Rio - 7Tokyo - 8Madrid - 9Just in case you&apos;re there and want to know who you&apos;re voting for. What was wrong with just having 1, 2, 3 and 4 I&apos;m not sure.  4.21pm They&apos;re voting! Our man at the scene, Owen Gibson, has this report: &quot;IOC members back in their seats and tension mounting here. Consensus still that it will be extremely close with just a couple of votes in it. Madrid, tipped by some as a potential dark horse, would appear to be out of the running following a fairly pedestrian presentation. Rio now seems to be the most fancied bid among my colleagues.&quot;  4.23pm Vote closed! That was quick.  4.24pm People are passing around pieces of paper. One of them has run across the stage to show a piece of paper to Jacques Rogge.  4.25pm Chicago are out!  4.26pm So we&apos;re on to a second round, no city having got a clear majority in the first round, but the pre-vote favourites, Chicago, are the first to go. This is a turn-up for the books. They&apos;ve voting again already!  4.27pm The second round of voting has closed! Let&apos;s shuffle some papers!  4.28pm  One abstention this time, so 95 valid ballots. And Tokyo&apos;s out!  4.29pm So it&apos;s Rio or Madrid! The final round of voting is about to start. Crikey, the nervous tension here at Guardian Towers is incredible.  4.31pm Voting has closed! Seconds to go here...  4.31 and a half pm Some people in suits are shaking their heads a bit. Frankie Fredericks is one of them. They&apos;re writing things down. They&apos;ve passed the paper to the gopher boy...  4.32pm: &quot;You have elected a city,&quot; says Jacques Rogge. &quot;The election is over and will be announced later on.&quot; That&apos;s a bit of a disappointment.  4.34pm So they&apos;re not going to tell us who&apos;s won for an hour! An hour!  4.37pm More from Owen Gibson, our man on the spot: &quot;Major shock here and a slap in the face for Obama. Madrid very much back in it - lacklustre presentation but lots of political clout within the IOC.&quot;       4.40pm Tracy Mohr reports from the dejected streets of Chicago: &quot;No riots \u2013 just a lot of sad pandas. And here I was ready to rent my house at an exorbitant price.&quot; And here&apos;s a musical widget that I had all prepared for a Chicago win but I&apos;ll never get another chance to use. See how many times you can play this between now and 5.30pm without becoming suicidal. I&apos;ll be back in half an hour.    Who should host the 2016 Olympic Games?(trends)   4.45pm Hang on, why don&apos;t we have a vote ourselves? I&apos;m getting a lot of pro-Rio sentiment through your emails, but let&apos;s see what happens in the next half-hour, eh?  5.02pm I just can&apos;t believe they&apos;re making us wait so long. &quot;Usain Bolt could have run 335km since this live blog started,&quot; calculates Andy from Earlsfield. Keep voting y&apos;all.  5.05pm And thanks to the many readers who have told me that the Prince of Orange is a member of Dutch royalty, and that not knowing that nugget of information exposes me as a total idiot.  5.10pm &quot;I&apos;m backing the Madrid bid,&quot; says Neil Withers, &quot;cos I had a fiver on them to win at 15 or 16 to 1 this morning. In a four horse race, when they&apos;ve got 89-year-old IOC legend Samaranch in the saddle? Bargain.&quot;  5.12pm &quot;Cool Rob&quot; is in Chicago. And he&apos;s unhappy. &quot;Memo to future US Presidents: do not waste time with dog and pony shows to impress Euro kleptocracies.&quot; Ouch.  5.15pm They&apos;re now filing into a new room for the announcement. I&apos;m not entirely sure what the whole new-room thing&apos;s about, as this one is smaller than the last and they&apos;ve had to leave loads of people outside. It&apos;s a bit more of a theatre this one, where the last was just a great big exhibition centre-type space.      The latest scenes from Chicago's Daley Plaza show the shocked faces of celebration-starved locals. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images    5.23pm Andrew from Chicago is &quot;not too upset over Chicago not winning the bid. I think it will be Madrid that wins, but I&apos;m pulling for Rio.&quot; You might not be upset, chum, but it looks like plenty of people were.  5.25pm Still a few minutes to cast your own vote (scroll down to 4.45pm)  5.27pm Everyone in the hall just stood up. I thought for a minute they were doing the Mexican wave, but it turned out to be wishful thinking.  5.30pm Action! And an email from Yves Tixier. &quot;Do you think the one-hour delay was for Rogge to try and convince delegates that this time, the Olympics should go to the best candidate city, and not the one that offered the best bribes to voters?&quot; He&apos;s from Paris, by the way.  5.31pm Our own Jonathan Edwards is co-presenting, and he tells us that &quot;a little under half an hour&quot; still separates us from the announcement. Hang on, he&apos;s just started speaking French! Badly!  5.33pm They&apos;re going to show us the highlights from Beijing first. Eagle-eyed readers will notice that this blog has been ongoing since 7.45am this morning. We feel entitled to a little impatience at this point.  5.35pm And now the highlights of Copenhagen! Which include, apparently, drinking milk and eating strawberries.  3.37pm And now the highlights of London! No decent strawberries here, sadly, but lots of people on bicycles.  5.38pm And now the highlights of Chicago&apos;s presentation. Do we really need to see this? They&apos;re out, dammit! Get on with it!  5.40pm &quot;The only people who are bummed out here in Chicago are white people who live in the suburbs,&quot; reports Chicago native Bobby Otter. &quot;Most people in Chicago didn&apos;t want the games. I&apos;m sure most of the city breathed a huge sigh of relief when we didn&apos;t get them. But as far as the IOC, what a joke ... the fact that Madrid is in the final two goes to show that Europe is still drastically over represented in pretty much everything, from the World Cup on down. Less Europe, more world I say.&quot;  5.41pm Now a video from the Tokyo team. Interesting that the first two cities to present were the first two to go, in order of presentation. Were they really the worst two cities on show, or do IOC delegates just have terribly short memories?  5.43pm Now a video from the Rio team. Going out on a limb here, but I reckon that a video from Madrid could be coming up sometime soon.  5.44pm It&apos;s a video from the Madrid team! You might have to wait for the IOC, but I&apos;ll be revealing the results of our own poll in just six minutes&apos; time. So if you&apos;ve not voted, scroll down and do your thang.  5.45pm Highlights of the voting now. People in suits shuffling bits of paper. A round of applause for Chicago who, says Jonathan Edwards, &quot;did a great job&quot;. Tokyo, meanwhile, get a round of applause for their &quot;excellent bid&quot;.  5.47pm We have got our first glimpse of the white envelope which contains the name of the winning city. But they&apos;re not opening it yet.  5.47pm So Jacques Rogge is about to make his announcement, after the IOC anthem. Our vote, meanwhile ended thus:Rio 64%Madrid 22%I&apos;m a grumpy killjoy 14%So the Guardian readership has a pretty clear favourite. But which way will the IOC go?  5.50pm &quot;Like in any competition, there can only be one winner,&quot; says Rogge. The envelope is on its way to him now...  5.50pm It&apos;s Rio!       5.51pm Dejection for Raul, mayhem for the Rio team. Tears. Real, genuine man-blubbing!  5.53pm Still scenes of celebration from Copenhagen. Not much else happening. Here&apos;s a suggested soundtrack, though:  5.55pm So it&apos;s over. After 10 and a bit hours. I&apos;ve got to say, any other decision would have been perverse: Rio&apos;s presentation was much better than Madrid&apos;s, South America has never, ever hosted an Olympic Games and Europe are hosting in 2012. I&apos;m stunned that Madrid got so far. It&apos;s a lovely city though. Really very nice.  5.57pm Apparently the crowds in Madrid are chanting &quot;tonto, tonto&quot; \u2013 &quot;fools, fools&quot;. Perhaps at themselves, for getting their hopes up so unnecessarily.  5.59pm Lawrence Bishop, who is from Atlanta, reports that &quot;local businesses lost a tremendous amount of money, time and effort&quot; in what sounds like a pretty depressing experience there in 1996 (sounds like absolutely nobody enjoyed that one), so maybe no disaster that Chicago missed out?  6.02pm So that&apos;s all from me.

SI  Speaking of great links ... The Sun&apos;s extracts from Sean Long&apos;s autobiography (Longy: Booze, Brawls, Sex and Scandal) make for a cracking reading. Here&apos;s one anecdote from many:  &quot;We were sat taking the piss out of each other when Ian &apos;Basil&apos; Millward came in. It&apos;s a good job because when he announced the team I for one came close to fainting. Only two players - Jon Wilkin and Martin Gleeson - were from the first team. &quot;Nobody could have predicted Basil&apos;s squad, including the bookies. There was money to be made on that game. Me and Glees got our heads together and decided to bet on Bradford to win. We spent Saturday afternoon driving round Billinge looking for a bookmaker that had the handicaps - but none had them ready. &quot;The following afternoon, a very excited Glees rang to say he&apos;d got the bet on Saints to lose by at least nine points. They weren&apos;t aware they were facing a bunch of trainees ... &quot;The bright spark that I am, I rang up Stan James and opened an account with my full name, address and bank details. Like Glees, I wagered \u00a31,000 to win \u00a3909 ...I never imagined for a second the shit that was about to hit the fan. Three days after, I was watching Columbo on daytime telly when I heard a knock on the door. &quot;As I tried to take in what was going on, the suited guy said: &apos;I heard you placed a bet with Stan James on your own team to lose against Bradford.&apos; My mind went blank and I could hear only one word in my head, &apos;Fuck, fuck, fuck!&apos; ... Judge Peter Charlesworth - who tries murderers when he&apos;s not on the RFL panel - fined us both \u00a37,500 plus \u00a32,205 costs. We had to pay the fines, court costs, our solicitors&apos; fees and do without our wages for the length of the bans. The bet cost me close to 50 grand.  Sure beats the usual turgid stuff we get these days from most sporting autobiographies, doesn&apos;t it?

Here&apos;s the video of Mr and Mrs Obama&apos;s pitch for Chicago. PW  11.07am: In addition to Barney&apos;s rolling blog, Owen Gibson will be reporting from Copenhagen on each city&apos;s final presentation to the IOC. Barack Obama told the delegates:  &quot;Over the last several years sometimes that fundamental truth about the United States has been lost. One of the legacies of this Olympic Games would be the restoration of that understanding of what the United States is all about and a recognition of how we are linked to the world.&quot;  Michelle Obama, who opened the pitch before inviting the president to join her on the stage, said:  &quot;Today, I can dream and I am dreaming that an Olympic Games in Chicago will light up the lives of neighbourhoods across America and across the world, and expose them to new sports and role models that will show every child that regardless of gender, race or physical ability there is a place for them too.

Plus the latest edition of You are the Umpire has landed, this week featuring Basil D&apos;Oliveira. PW  12.35pm: News from rugby league: Bradford have rejected allegations made by Sean Long in his autobiography that Bulls players were in on the act when Long and former team-mate Martin Gleeson were fined \u00a37,500 and banned for betting on St Helens to lose by nine points to the Bulls. The Bulls football manager, Stuart Duffy:  &quot;We refute all such allegations. We certainly weren&apos;t aware of any at the time and we&apos;ve no proof that any of our lads were involved.&quot;   PW  1.15pm: We&apos;re just ploughing through the 6,000-word verdict in the Kevin Keegan case. The best bit details how the relationship between Keegan and Dennis Wise broke down. The statement said:   &quot;Mr Wise telephoned Mr Keegan and told him that he had a great player for the Club to sign, namely Ignacio Gonzalez, and that he should look him up.  &quot;Mr Keegan tried to locate him on the internet but could find no reference to him. &quot;Mr Wise told him that he had been on loan at Monaco but having checked out the details, Mr Keegan was unimpressed and told Mr Wise that he did not think the player was good enough. &quot;Mr Wise then told him that the player was on &quot;You Tube&quot; and that Mr Keegan could look him up there but he found that the clips were of poor quality and provided no proper basis for signing a player to a Premier League Club. Moreover, no one at the Club had ever seen him play.  &quot;However, notwithstanding that he made it clear not only to Mr Wise but also to Mr Jimenez and to Mr Ashley that he very strongly objected to the signing of Mr Gonzalez (he was to be signed on loan with an option to purchase), the Club proceeded with the deal and the transfer was concluded the following day, on 31 August 2008.  &quot;The Club did so, according to its witnesses who gave evidence before us, because it was in the Club&apos;s commercial interests to do so.  &quot;It was what the Club described as a &apos;commercial deal&apos; by which the Club meant a deal which was in the commercial interests of the Club.  &quot;The &apos;commercial interests&apos;, according to the Club, were that the signing of the player on loan would be a &quot;favour&quot; to two influential South American agents who would look favourably on the Club in the future.  &quot;The loan deal cost the Club nearly \u00a31m in wages for a player who was not expected to play for the first team but no payment was made by the Club to the agents in respect of the deal.&quot;   SI  1.30pm: At one time they were gently ridiculed for having too many midfielders. Now, Spurs have four top strikers and, in a World Cup year, something \u2013 or someone \u2013 has to give, says David Hytner. Roman Pavlyuchenko hasn&apos;t had much of a look-in this season, despite some prolific appearances for Russia, but what more can Peter Crouch do at Spurs to get himself into Fabio Capello&apos;s thinking?

After flying in to Copenhagen this morning to speak on behalf of his former hometown, which is going head to head with Rio, Madrid and Tokyo in today&apos;s International Olympic Committee vote, Obama vowed that one legacy of the Games would be to rehabilitate America&apos;s image in the eyes of the world. Obama, the first serving US president to appear before the IOC, said that he hoped that one legacy of the Games would be to serve as a &quot;reminder that America at its best is open to the world&quot;. The president, whose decision to make a flying visit to Copenhagen to lobby in person has prompted criticism from his political opponents back home, told the 106 IOC members who will decide the destination of the Games this afternoon: &quot;This could be a meeting in Chicago, because we look like the world. And over the last several years sometimes that fundamental truth about the United States has been lost. One of the legacies of this Olympic Games would be the restoration of that understanding of what the United States is all about and a recognition of how we are linked to the world.&quot; He promised to put &quot;the full force of the White house and the State Department into making sure that not only is this a successful Games but that visitors from all around the world feel welcome and will come away with a sense of the incredible diversity of the American people&quot;. Obama was speaking in response to a question from an IOC member from Pakistan, Syed Shahid Ali, who said that &quot;travellers to the US can go through a pretty harrowing experience&quot;. In referring to his own background and the diversity of Chicago&apos;s population, Obama attempted to cut through any lingering anti-American sentiment among the IOC. Before her husband stood up to speak, Michelle Obama delivered a impassioned, highly personal plea that attempted to tug on the heartstrings of the 97 IOC members eligible to vote in the first round of the process. She spoke of her fond memories of growing up on the South Side of Chicago and watching the Olympics with her father, who developed multiple sclerosis in his early thirties. &quot;Like so many people, it inspired me and I found myself that dreaming that if I worked hard enough I could achieve something great,&quot; she said. &quot;[But] I never dreamed that the Olympic flames would one day light up lives in my neighbourhood. Today, I can dream and I am dreaming that an Olympic Games in Chicago will light up the lives of neighbourhoods across America and across the world, and expose them to new sports and role models that will show every child that regardless of gender, race or physical ability there is a place for them too. That is why I am here today.&quot; Michelle Obama arrived two days before her husband and, like other dignitaries including Brazlian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and King Juan Carlos of Spain, has spent that time wooing IOC members. But the president will be on the ground in Denmark for less than six hours. The final 45 minute presentations are the end of a three-year journey for the bidding cities that has intensified since the field was narrowed to four 18 months ago. The intervention of the Obamas is considered to have given renewed impetus to the Chicago campaign, which was in danger of being overtaken by a Rio bid that made a compelling case for delivering the Games to South America for the first time. The vote is expected to be very close, with a simple majority required for victory. In each round, the lowest placed city is knocked out. &quot;Any one of these four cities could deliver a great Olympics - this is probably the highest quality contest there has been,&quot; said the London 2012 chairman Seb Coe. &quot;It is a very close competition and it could all be decided by the final presentations.&quot; The influence of London&apos;s successful campaign could be seen in the pitches of both Chicago and Tokyo, the first two cities to present, with their emphasis on inspiring youth and leaving a sustainable legacy. &quot;Chicago&apos;s vision for the Olympic and Paralympic movement is about so much more than what we can offer the Games,&quot; said Michelle Obama. &quot;It&apos;s about what the Games can offer all of us it&apos;s about inspiring this generation and building a lasting legacy for the next.&quot; There was little direct mention of the economic advantages of staging the Games in the most lucrative sponsorship and TV market, but the endorsement of the Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and repeated references to the fact Chicago was &quot;the right choice, right now&quot; were enough make the point."}, {"sentences": ["Where to eat Torihei-YakitoriPosted by shinohararylandA chicken on a stick restaurant in Tokyo.", "\u2022 Everywhere in the major cities Molecular Tapas Bar, Mandarin OrientalPosted by ChrisJapanMolecular gastronomy in Tokyo.", "It&apos;s no surprise that one of Tokyo&apos;s most expensive hotels should have a good restaurant or two, but it&apos;s perhaps less usual to head to such hotels for fun dining.", "Somehow Tokyo seems the perfect setting for hi-tech cuisine.", "\u2022 Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Chuo-ku,Tokyo.", "It&apos;s next to Hanaono Shrine XEX appealPosted by briefcaseboy The two XEX bars in Tokyo are wonderful insider secrets.", "The first, situated in the Atago Green Hills Mori Tower, is 10 minutes from Roppongi and has spectacular views of the Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo Tower.", "\u2022 1-11 Sarugaku-cho, Shibuya-ku; 42F, Mori Tower, 2-5-1 Atago, Minato-ku Where to stay The Tokyo HostelPosted by Sissi If you want to immerse yourself in the busy environment that Japan offers, then your best bet would be to stay at The Tokyo Hostel, in Ryusen Taito-Ku.", "All in all this is an ideal hostel in Tokyo, as it offers great amenities and central location.", "\u2022 hostelbookers.com Sakura HousePosted by PinkPannyA great place to find cheap accommodation in Tokyo.", "If you&apos;re visiting Tokyo, a day out in Harajuku to people watch in some cafes is a great way to see the many different kinds of Gothic Lolita fashions worn by the Japanese.", "\u2022 30-8 Udagawa-cho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo Niwa-no-Yu OnsenPosted by getajobSituated next to the Toshimaen theme park, Niwa-no-Yu Onsen (garden spa) is a relatively new super onsen, about 15 minutes from Ikebukero by train.", "Super clean, very luxurious and not as gimmicky as some of the other themed onsen in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Hotels", "Cultural trips", "Food and drink", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T16:26:00Z", "title": "Readers' tips for getting the most out of Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/oct/02/tokyo-japan", "article": "Where to eat Torihei-YakitoriPosted by shinohararylandA chicken on a stick restaurant in Tokyo.

Past the Starbucks and take the first right. jiyugaoka.or.jp Yoshinoya fast food restaurantsPosted by suffolkboyIt was my first time in Japan, and I was looking for somewhere cheap to eat that wasn&apos;t a burger joint. I happened upon Yoshinoya (they&apos;re everywhere, look for the bright orange signs). The menu is mainly rice-based: the dishes include pork, beef etc, with ginger, curry etc. The dishes cost from 360 - 630 yen (approx. \u00a32-4) including rice and miso soup - fantastic value for money. I ate there four times in a 10-day holiday, and every time we were the only westerners there; as they say, if it&apos;s where the locals go, it must be good! \u2022 Everywhere in the major cities Molecular Tapas Bar, Mandarin OrientalPosted by ChrisJapanMolecular gastronomy in Tokyo. It&apos;s no surprise that one of Tokyo&apos;s most expensive hotels should have a good restaurant or two, but it&apos;s perhaps less usual to head to such hotels for fun dining. So hats off for not taking themselves too seriously in their Molecular Tapas Bar, which offers just two sittings per evening for seven people per sitting. Around 25 courses are served with liquid nitrogen, syringes, glass plates and steel menus to the fore. Each dish is explained, prepared in front of you and the emphasis is on having a laugh and enjoying the experience. A visit last week included dishes such as &apos;red, cappuccino candy floss&apos;, a brilliant homemade mozzarella, &apos;cucumber caviar&apos; and a beer with a Yakult froth tasting. Great fun and at \u00a360 a head, it&apos;s terrific value - maybe for a last night in the city. Somehow Tokyo seems the perfect setting for hi-tech cuisine. \u2022 Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Chuo-ku,Tokyo. 03 3270 8800 mandarinoriental.co.jp Where to drink The Golden GaiPosted by onedollyshoe The Golden Gai is a city block near Shinjuku station, made up of tiny alleyways. This block has around 250 teensy bars, all of which are unique. There are ground floor ones, first floor ones, film ones, literary ones, ones that look like a living room or kitchen, very welcoming ones and one or two that don&apos;t really like foreigners. They pretty much all have a seating charge of around 500 yen (\u00a32.75). Go and walk around and choose your bar. You might get the one where film directors have their own bottles displayed around the bar. \u2022 1-1-8 Kabukicho, Shinjuku-ku. Closest station: Shinjuku, east exit. It&apos;s next to Hanaono Shrine XEX appealPosted by briefcaseboy The two XEX bars in Tokyo are wonderful insider secrets. The first, situated in the Atago Green Hills Mori Tower, is 10 minutes from Roppongi and has spectacular views of the Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo Tower. The second, located in Daikanyama, is irrefutably the city&apos;s best bar for spring/summer; it features the city&apos;s trendiest folk and also serves very stylish teppanyaki. \u2022 1-11 Sarugaku-cho, Shibuya-ku; 42F, Mori Tower, 2-5-1 Atago, Minato-ku Where to stay The Tokyo HostelPosted by Sissi If you want to immerse yourself in the busy environment that Japan offers, then your best bet would be to stay at The Tokyo Hostel, in Ryusen Taito-Ku. The hostel is often home to a number of backpackers from all over the globe and makes for a fun and social accommodation option. Offering a superb selection of room options, from dorms to private rooms and at a great price too, this is an ideal place to stay when visiting the Japanese capital.The no curfew rule means that you have access to the hostel 24 hours a day. All in all this is an ideal hostel in Tokyo, as it offers great amenities and central location. \u2022 hostelbookers.com Sakura HousePosted by PinkPannyA great place to find cheap accommodation in Tokyo. They have a great hostel in Asakusa overlooking the prettiest fairground I&apos;ve ever seen, and for longer stays, they have apartments all over the city (we paid \u00a3550 for a month for a place in a fab location!) \u2022 sakura-house.com What to do Gothic Lolita CulturePosted by tokyotopia Japanese street fashion is famous around the world, especially for the Gothic Lolita style. If you&apos;re visiting Tokyo, a day out in Harajuku to people watch in some cafes is a great way to see the many different kinds of Gothic Lolita fashions worn by the Japanese. Make-up is also important and it still amazes me how detailed some of the designs are that people paint on themselves. One great resource is La Carmina, herself a Japanese fashion lover with an interest in Gothic Lolita and many other styles. She also has some great guides on where to go in the city for the less well known stuff such as theme restaurants and punk style clubs. \u2022 lacarmina.com Karaoke-KanPosted by Sissi The chain of Karaoke-Kans in Shibuya means that getting to belt out an 80&apos;s classic is always going to be a possibility on a Friday night. With several establishments dotted around the city, private karaoke rooms are available should you fear embarrassment from singing in front of others. These are available from around \u00a315 an hour, and most have an assortment of extra features, such as concert-style lighting, to add to the rock star experience. \u2022 30-8 Udagawa-cho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo Niwa-no-Yu OnsenPosted by getajobSituated next to the Toshimaen theme park, Niwa-no-Yu Onsen (garden spa) is a relatively new super onsen, about 15 minutes from Ikebukero by train. Costing 2,200yen for a ticket, you get towels, yukata, and even a free toothbrush and razor. Inside is a selection of different natural spring hot pools, sauna, steam room, cold pool, and then a lovely garden-set rotenburo outside. Once you&apos;ve bathed (usual caveats about Japanese bathing apply - shower first, so you&apos;re clean when you get in the pool), you can slip into your yukata and pop upstairs. A restaurant, bar, smoking terrace, and relaxation room await. The reclining chairs with the birdsong tweeting out of the speakers in the headrest are particularly good for a gentle sleep. As far as I can tell, there is no time limit on being there - the last visit we spent about five hours, bathing, sleeping and eating. Super clean, very luxurious and not as gimmicky as some of the other themed onsen in Tokyo. Worth a go if you can&apos;t get out to a countryside onsen and do it early in your trip, because after your first try, you&apos;ll definitely want to do it all again. \u2022 A short walk from Toshimaen station, on the Oedo line or Seibu Ikebukero line. web-japan.org"}, {"sentences": ["But to gasps from delegates and cries of dismay in Chicago&apos;s Daley Plaza, the city not only failed to make it past the first round of voting by the 95 eligible members of the committee, it came last, even after Tokyo."], "tags": ["Rio 2016", "Brazil", "Barack Obama", "US news", "World news", "Sport", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "Travel", "International Olympic Committee", "Americas", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T19:37:10Z", "title": "Carnival time as Rio wins 2016 Olympics vote", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/02/rio-wins-2016-olympics-vote", "article": "The International Olympic Committee made history by awarding the 2016 summer games to Rio de Janeiro, which will become the first South American city to host the event. At the same time the IOC delivered a slap in the face for Barack Obama, who took precious time out from struggles over health reform, the economy and the war in Afghanistan to fly 4,000 miles to Copenhagen to support his city, Chicago, in its bid to gain the 2016 Olympic Games. Obama became the first serving US president to lobby in person for the games, with his wife Michelle and Oprah Winfrey acting as outriders. But to gasps from delegates and cries of dismay in Chicago&apos;s Daley Plaza, the city not only failed to make it past the first round of voting by the 95 eligible members of the committee, it came last, even after Tokyo. Well before the second round of voting was held and Rio declared the deliriously happy winner, the fallout for Obama had begun. The Chicago Tribune declared the result a &quot;serious loss of face&quot; for the president, while the conservative-leaning Drudge report gloated with a banner headline: &quot;The ego has landed, world rejects Obama.&quot; Republican party activists were poised to make the most of the humiliation. Before Obama flew to Copenhagen, they were accusing him of favouring his &quot;Chicago fat cat friends&quot;; now they intend to push the point home by accusing him of ignoring pressing matters of state for a local issue. &quot;We&apos;ve got troops dying in Afghanistan, and instead of making a decision whether we&apos;re going to send in more troops \u2026 the president is spending his time making a failed bid to the Olympic committee,&quot; said conservative strategist Jordan Sekulow. Although Obama only flew into Copenhagen morning, the advance party of Michelle Obama and Winfrey had spent the previous 48 hours schmoozing IOC members at the Marriott hotel at which they were staying. At Thursday night&apos;s gala opening, they rubbed shoulders with other heads of state, sporting icons and celebrities including Brazil&apos;s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Pele and King Juan Carlos of Spain. Then, the mood was upbeat and the Chicago strategy appeared to be working as the wives of IOC members queued up to talk to the first lady and have their photos taken with Winfrey. Chicago had long been the bookmakers&apos; favourite and many observers reasoned that in a time of economic uncertainty the IOC might plump for the option that would bring bumper sponsorship and TV revenues. But there had also been lingering concerns over the level of public support, and issues surrounding the lack of financial guarantees from local government were only recently resolved.

As the Greenpeace slogan said: &quot;Right city, wrong date.&quot; Mr Obama was not in Denmark to save the world from climate change, but to promote Chicago&apos;s Olympic bid. His wife, Michelle, and Opah Winfrey were also there. They were not alone: King Juan Carlos of Spain, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and the Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama all pressed the flesh for their cities. Note, not their countries. Yes, Tony and Cherie Blair started the inflationary spiral by going to Singapore to help win the 2012 Olympics for London. But has this ritual got out of hand? Mr Obama was the first sitting US president to attend the International Olympic Committee&apos;s jamboree. Was it appropriate for him to do so? The next question is whether it was in the interests of Rio, Chicago, Madrid or Tokyo to win the games. The evidence is underwhelming. The games transformed Barcelona and were a success in Sydney, but the list of cities with empty relics and hefty bills is longer: Atlanta, Athens, Montreal and Moscow. The Beijing games were in a category of their own, sending a message that China had joined the modern world. But it locked up dissidents who uttered anything less than the authorised text. And then, of course, there is London. Started in times of plenty, the cost of making Stratford the largest construction site in Europe has more than doubled in four years. Surrounding boroughs are adamant they won&apos;t be saddled with the costs of running venues that are almost certainly going to require subsidies. The Olympic Park Legacy Company promises that a further 10,000 new homes will be developed on the site, 40% of them for families. Tessa Jowell, the Olympics minister, says that London has anticipated the legacy needs of the games in a way that no other Olympic city has. But past experience shows that it is easier to make promises than to fulfil them. One promise in the original bid, to increase the number of people playing sport or taking regular exercise, is already in trouble. Seen through the prism of looming public service cuts, the glitter of the games is not as golden as it once seemed. So, whether or not Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid should have reacted the way they did when they heard they had lost the bid to host the 2016 summer games is not clear. Having the modern games permanently stationed in its ancient home, Greece an idea that surfaced during the games in Athens, has lost traction since. Rio de Janeiro will now, in the words of its slogan, live its passion. The games will go to South America for the first time. It may be a while before they want them back."}, {"sentences": ["It&apos;s an old police warehouse in Little Tokyo renovated by Frank Gehry, and is an unbelievable space: 40,000 sq ft with steel columns, trusses, beams and skylights."], "tags": ["Los Angeles holidays", "Art", "Travel", "California holidays", "Los Angeles"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T23:07:07Z", "title": "A tour of the LA art scene", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/oct/03/los-angeles-art-galleries", "article": "Hidden gems in LA museums So many people come to LA and don&apos;t realise the quality of the city&apos;s art museums \u2013 they think Hollywood and Disneyland is all we have to offer. The Getty Center, the Los Angeles County Art Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art have some of the best collections in the world. At the Getty \u2013 after Ruben&apos;s Entombment, Van Gogh&apos;s Irises and sculptor Antonio Canova&apos;s Apollo \u2013 seek out James Ensors&apos; Christ&apos;s Entry Into Brussels. It is one of his best paintings. The Getty bought it even though they don&apos;t buy contemporary art. They couldn&apos;t let that go. The Museum of Contemporary Art has the best collections of contemporary art in the world. Housed in series of red pyramids, it gives most of its space to temporary exhibitions. The permanent collection includes pieces by Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenburg. The curve of the museum&apos;s stairway was modelled on Marilyn Monroe&apos;s torso. But it&apos;s MOCA&apos;s satellite, the Geffen Contemporary, that artists love to show in. It&apos;s an old police warehouse in Little Tokyo renovated by Frank Gehry, and is an unbelievable space: 40,000 sq ft with steel columns, trusses, beams and skylights. Currently closed, it will reopen on November 15 with Collection: MOCA&apos;s First Thirty Years. Not to be missed.     The Getty Center. Photograph: Paul Owen    Of course, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, with its encyclopedic 100,000 objects, is also a must. The 20-acre campus is being transformed right now by architect Renzo Piano. My favourite spot is the huge glass-fronted elevator in its Broad Contemporary Art Museum. Renzo called it a &quot;moving room&quot;; it is 21ft wide, 16ft high and 9ft deep. And in the shaft Barbara Kruger&apos;s three-storey installation covers each of the walls. You are literally inside the red, white and black artwork. It&apos;s pretty amazing. Take it to the third floor, and along with the numerous Warhols and Jeff Koons pieces, there&apos;s another of my pieces: Buildings=Guns=People: Desire, Knowledge and Hope (With Smog), 1985. Forgotten museum Not many people know about the Norton Simon museum in Pasadena. The LA Times has called it the &quot;greatest painting collection in the western United States&quot;. There are van Goghs (Portrait of a Peasant, The Mulberry Tree), Degas bronzes, Henri Rousseaus (Exotic Landscape), Modigliani (Portrait of the Artist&apos;s Wife, Jeanne Hebuterne), Picassos, Cezannes, Gauguins, Rembrandts. Old curiosities The Museum of Jurassic Technology is probably one of the wackiest places in LA. It&apos;s a sort of fake museum-cum-art installation of natural \u2013 and sometimes fictional \u2013 wonders founded and curated by David Wilson. Fact and fiction are blurred in displays on &quot;piercing devil&quot; bats that can fly through lead walls, a human horn and a gallery of Soviet dogs sent into space. After I&apos;ve freaked myself out, I head upstairs to the equally bizarre Tula Tea Room, with its beautiful samovars. Chinatown galleries     China Art Objects, LA     Chinatown galleries tend to be small and show younger up-and-coming artists: more homespun, affordable art. Three I always try to go to are: China Art Objects, Tom Soloman and Kathryn Brennan Gallery (formerly Sister). China Art Objects was one of the first galleries in Chinatown. Next up at the Thomas Soloman Gallery  is Brad Eberhand&apos;s Cross Sections (17 Oct\u201314 Nov). His subtle abstractions and overpainting style have made him something of a painter&apos;s painter. Kathryn Brennan&apos;s  is an unpretentious space that has exhibited Amy Sarkisian and, more recently, the folk-animism paintings of Robert Gutierrez. Death becomes them The Forest Lawn Cemetery has had a lot of publicity of late because of Michael Jackson&apos;s burial. I go to look at the world&apos;s largest oil painting in the chapel: The Crucifixion by Jan Styka. It&apos;s nearly 200ft tall and 50ft wide. If fancy paying a few stars a visit, my other favourite thing can be found in the cemetery gift shop: a grave cleaning kit. Artist-haunt bars These three bars are frequented by artists after Chinatown openings \u2013 the booze and food are cheap. Hop Louie (950 Mei Ling Way, 001 213 628 4244) is all 60s decor and Patsy Cline and Frank Sinatra on the jukebox. Grand Star Jazz Club (943 N Broadway, +213 626 2285), as you might expect, has great jazz but also hip-hop nights. The Mountain Bar (473 Gin Ling Way) is low-key, despite the China red walls, trendy DJs and art boffins. Over in Culver City, the Mandrake (2692 S La Cienega Blvd) has become the hub of the art community there \u2013 the heavyweight local gallery Blum &amp; Poe invested in it \u2013 and hosts film series, talks, even a knitting group. Eating out One of the fancier places I patronise is Capri (1616 Abbot Kinney, +310 392 8777). It&apos;s fairly legendary in the LA art world. German painter Martin Kippenberger was one of the original backers, and one of his paintings hangs in the restaurant. On the cheaper side are: Caf\u00e9 Via (451 Gin Ling Way, +213 617 1481) in Chinatown which feeds penny-pinching arty types with fresh Vietnamese food \u2013 and hosts the odd exhibition; Langers (704 South Alvarado) for the pastrami sandwich \u2013 go for #19 with Swiss cheese and cole slaw; and Cole&apos;s (118 E 6th St) for the beef sandwich with French dip \u2013 and the poetry readings. Where to stay Two hotels I find fun are the Standard in West Hollywood and the Thompson on Sunset Boulevard \u2013 mainly because they have interesting art on display. Right now the Standard (+323 650 9090, standardhotels.com, rooms from $188) has a projection piece by Kalup Linzy, in which he satirizes Hollywood tearjerkers and soaps. It&apos;s brilliant. There&apos;s also Gustavo Artigas&apos;s Vote for Demolition. He has voting booths around the city for the guests to cast votes on LA&apos;s least aesthetic buildings; one is in the Standard lobby. It&apos;s a sort of study of the democratic possibilities of changing one&apos;s own environment. The Thompson Beverly Hills (+310 273 1400; thompsonhotels.com) is in a good location for some of the swankier galleries and I love the view from the rooftop bar; plus you can get rooms about the \u00a3100 mark. Photographer Steven Klein&apos;s art is displayed in the rooms and public spaces. At the end of hallways his huge photographs of models are silhouetted against the windows as if on a light box. \u2022 BA (0844 493 0787) flies from Heathrow to LA from \u00a3355 rtn inc tax.

This was an era of primitive planes and tenuous technology and, with every flight, there was a risk of plummeting through the clouds back to earth. The rewards were exciting, a\u00a0tranche of records waiting to be broken, but at the \u00a0same time they had to battle deeply ingrained sexism. In 1926, for instance, the International Commission for Air Navigation authorised women to pilot commercial planes \u2013 but advised against allowing passengers on board. This made it rather difficult to make a living. With these barriers in place, some unlikely characters came to the fore, as underlined by Bernard Marck&apos;s beautifully illustrated new book, Women Aviators. This profiles 100 extraordinary individuals, and arrives just prior to Amelia, a new biopic of Earhart, starring Hilary Swank. The brilliant, androgynous Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, has attracted more attention than her contemporaries, but any of their stories would make for a compelling screenplay. Marck profiles the ridiculously accomplished Frenchwoman Marie Marvingt, for example, who preceded her flying career by learning to drive a train and pilot a steamboat; paddled a canoe from Paris to Germany; dominated competitive winter sports from 1908-1910; became the fifth best mountain climber in the world; spoke five languages; wrote poetry \u2013 in addition to being a\u00a0gifted dancer. Then, in 1911, two years after stepping on a plane, she won the women&apos;s flying contest, the Femina Cup. A\u00a0few years later she asked to serve in a fighter squadron during the first world war; on being refused, she disguised herself as a man and served as a sharpshooter in the trenches until her deception was discovered. She continued by championing the idea of flying ambulances, and acted in a way that made her nickname, the &quot;fiancee of danger&quot;, seem perfectly apt. Then there&apos;s Elise Deroche, known as &quot;the Flying Baroness&quot;, who became the first licensed woman pilot in the world, and recovered from a crash in which she sustained 18 fractures \u2013 including eight in one hand \u2013 to continue flying. Or Harriet Quimby, a journalist and screenwriter, who became the first woman granted a pilot&apos;s licence by the Aero Club of America, the first to fly at night, and the first female aviator to cross the Channel. Or the Belgian H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dutrieu, also known as the Woman Sparrowhawk, who was the women&apos;s world cycling champion in 1897 and 1898, before taking up stunt motorcycle performances in Paris \u2013 including her famous &quot;jump of death&quot;. When these were outlawed by the police, she soon moved on to flying, winning the inaugural Femina Cup. In the US, in the 1920s, the African-American Bessie Coleman shot to prominence. Coleman had grown up one of 13 children of sharecroppers in Texas, before moving to Chicago to become a manicurist. It was here she grew interested in flying, but despite backing from two influential businessmen, as a black woman in the US she was unable to study. She travelled to France where she became the first African-American woman to hold a pilot&apos;s licence, on her return to the US, she attracted huge crowds as a stunt flier, performing loop the loops and figure eights. She was widely known as &quot;Queen Bess&quot;. Hull-born Amy Johnson was determined to find out all she could about flight engineering, and became the first British woman to obtain an aeroplane mechanic&apos;s licence. She was also the first woman to fly from Britain to Australia \u2013 after only 85 hours of flying practise. Then she broke the light aircraft speed record for flying between London and Tokyo. An incredible future seemed assured. But, as with many of her contemporaries, Johnson&apos;s success was cut short. In 1941, while transporting a plane for the RAF, she ran into trouble and bailed out into the Thames Estuary. Her body was never found. Neither was Earhart&apos;s, after her plane disappeared in 1937 during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Coleman died in 1926, when her mechanic, William Wills, crashed their plane. Deroche perished in a crash in 1919; Quimby suffered the same fate in 1912. The risks they&apos;d taken were horribly, inescapably real.

I am tempted to call it artful. On the one hand it concerns itself with fame, fortune and the links between them from Warhol to Hirst, centring on artists who have used the mass media to create their own brand and persona. On the other, it is destined to be a surefire winner for Tate Modern, not to mention all the many collectors, artists and dealers involved, spinning money-minded art smoothly back into money under cover of historical scholarship. Pop Life deserves to be a hit, though, because it tries so hard to get the genie back into the bottle \u2013 to distil, as far as possible, a whole chapter of modern times in which a particular kind of art turned itself into pure commodity. So this is Andy Warhol offering two portraits for the price of one; and selling his own face to Vidal Sassoon for ads and his reputation to Drexel Burnham Lambert. It is Jeff Koons turning his most famous steel sculpture \u2013 of a balloon \u2013 back into real balloon, 50ft high and leasing it for PR purposes to Macy&apos;s. It is Takashi Murakami spreading his super-flat pop art all across the globe from art fairs and glossy magazines to actual shops. And not just art shops but branches of Louis Vuitton \u2013 where his bright logos sell the exorbitant handbags \u2013 and Tokyo 7 Elevens, where customers get a tiny plastic Murakami figure with their gum. It is (at a stretch) Sarah Lucas and Tracey Emin setting up shop in the East End and selling crappy T-shirts. At an even greater stretch, it is Andrea Fraser selling her body for one night to a collector for $20,000 in order that they may conjugate &quot;into an artwork&quot;. It is most certainly the gavel coming down on a Jeff Koons&apos;s love heart for approximately 80m times the price of similar gewgaws at Claire&apos;s Accessories, and Damien Hirst taking \u00a3112m at last year&apos;s Sotheby&apos;s auction. The tales are legion, the headlines ubiquitous: what a pageant of greed, what an allegory of supply, demand, ingenuity, inflation, excess. The only problem is how to convey it in objects. The first room at Tate Modern is a knock-out: Koons&apos;s Rabbit (1986), that gleaming cast of an inflatable bunny that turns a balloon into a voodoo doll, horrifying yet inanely reflective; Andy Warhol&apos;s terrific late self-portrait, a skull in a scarlet fright-wig bowing out into the darkness; Murakami&apos;s appalling monument of a manga fantasy woman, teensy waist, colossal breasts spouting skipping ropes of milk as she sweetly smiles: the frightening potency of graphics emerging in three dimensions. Each of these artists has a subsequent gallery \u2013 or three, in the case of Warhol, who surely deserves the space as patron saint of almost everything that follows. The curators have aimed for period authenticity by reconstructing some eventful shows. Keith Haring&apos;s Pop Shop, with its trademark wall drawings and its chiming till, has been recreated complete with fully operational shop. Nothing like the zip and register of the graphics, incidentally: insistently recognisable and undimmed by the years through the commercial ruse of timeless black and white. Less arduous, at least in practical terms, is the exact facsimile of Richard Prince&apos;s Spiritual America \u2013 open when I saw Pop Life, temporarily closed by police on grounds of obscenity. Spiritual America involved the rephotographing of Garry Gross&apos;s notorious photograph for Playboy Press of a 10-year-old Brooke Shields wearing nothing but mascara. Prince gave it an ornamental frame, low lighting and rich red walls \u2013 these are the &apos;quotation marks&apos; in which he supposedly offers his state of the nation address. Even now, art historians insist upon this work as social critique: showing America back to America. I don&apos;t see how they can tell. The work is silent \u2013 you might say dumb \u2013 on the subject of Gross&apos;s unconscionable photograph. And not the least revelation of last year&apos;s Serpentine retrospective was Prince&apos;s lifelong interest in the low, the filthy and corrupted. Still, he fits the bill as maker of the highest-priced photographs in the world. Jeff Koons&apos;s 1989 Made in Heaven show \u2013 soaringly, eye-poppingly gross \u2013 hasn&apos;t been recreated in quite a while. That may have something to do with the anal sex, or the gigantically impractical sculpture of Koons straddling the porn star Ilona Staller on a rock; or perhaps it has something to do with the bitter end of their marriage. That show \u2013 from the colourful billboard for a non-existent movie starring the lovers, to the unambiguous Ilana&apos;s Asshole \u2013 was rejected by the art world, which felt Koons had taken exploitation too far. But it is instructive to read the reviews, which fastidiously avoid the noticeably hardcore porn. Perhaps the art of those bad aesthetic times was prophylactically sealed against reality. Better to talk about provocation, institutional critique, the raising of consciousness, the way in which Koons always referred to high art \u2013 bling, but with added rococo \u2013 than the content. For what is the content, if not a poke in the eye? Bright yet dark, shrewd yet vacuous: Koons&apos;s art remains poised in equal tension. And when you get to Damien Hirst&apos;s gallery full of gold calves in formaldehyde, gold spot paintings, gold vitrines dazzling with diamonds, it is no longer so obvious to whom he owes the greater debt: the production line of Koons or Warhol? The British galleries of Pop Life give Tate Modern its first chance to show Hirst, Emin, Lucas, Gavin Turk et al as international history, which has the effect of deactivating their art. What were slick, rude, crude, epigrammatic, hilarious or wilfully dumb now look like the artefacts of air-conditioned archives. Not everyone will lament this, of course, but the Americans do generally get a better presentation. Warhol&apos;s silkscreened gemstones are shown in ultra-violet light, Haring has a great rap soundtrack, Koons gets all the floodlight he could want. The show is buzzy, theatrical, densely jammed and much more of a blast than expected. It is of course composed of fast art: nothing to detain you for long, though plenty to prime the post-show conversation. How quickly repetition set in as modus operandi: the series, the reiteration, the flogged horse, the running gag, the market-servicing multiple and edition. How often sex sold art, how often artists sold their looks, how indivisible art frequently seemed from prostitution, promotion and pornography. And how empty the provocations often were \u2013 and still are. The young Polish artist Piotr Uklanski has a wall of faces titled The Nazis, a bumper compendium of film stars in SS costume that has apparently caused controversy. Hollywood has bad faith, Clint Eastwood can&apos;t pull off the look compared to Klaus Kinski, Nazi uniform is chic? Go read your Susan Sontag. Now I don&apos;t know if this is Uklanski&apos;s point. Actually thinking about these works is not what they seem to demand. Some look pretty simple-minded now \u2013 Ashley Bickerton&apos;s famed self-portrait in corporate logos, everything by Pruitt Early \u2013 but even those that don&apos;t often come across as tendentiously crass. One-liners with no after-effect, they are like ineffectual fireworks. Have these times come to an end? The show certainly has a retrograde feel: Drexel and its junk bonds long gone, Warhol and Haring dead, many historic gambits \u2013 the artist as adman or celebrity \u2013 now repeated as farce. And it is hard to take latest variations seriously as anything much more than product placement by powerful dealers. And that is what is missing from this show \u2013 inevitably, necessarily \u2013 the entire troupe of impresarios, gallerists, dealers, and consultants who join the dots between Warhol and the hedge-fund collector. The people, in short, who make or sustain the market for the art and who are never likely to fade out. This story is not told here, nor does it yet have an end. But anyone who wants to know how this strain of art has remained strong for so long should buy the exhibition catalogue. There, among the solemn curatorial essays, are glimpses of the connections and transactions that are so mutually beneficial \u2013 everyone from the blue-chip collectors to the galleries who control what can be shown and the billionaire backers \u2013 without whom this show might not exist, nor, quite possibly, much of the art."}, {"sentences": ["Shoichi Nakagawa, who resigned as Japan&apos;s finance minister after he appeared to be drunk at a G7 press conference earlier this year, was found dead at his home in Tokyo this morning.", "Nakagawa, a Tokyo university graduate, began his career at the Industrial Bank of Japan."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-04T14:05:23Z", "title": "Former Japanese finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa found dead", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/04/japanese-finance-minister-dead", "article": "Shoichi Nakagawa, who resigned as Japan&apos;s finance minister after he appeared to be drunk at a G7 press conference earlier this year, was found dead at his home in Tokyo this morning. Police said it was unlikely that Nakagawa, who was found lying face down on his bed by his wife, had killed himself, but added that he had recently been taking sleeping pills. Investigators said there were no signs of foul play and no will or suicide note was found. An autopsy will be conducted after a preliminary examination failed to establish a cause of death. He is thought to have died late last night. Nakagawa was forced to resign in February, days after he slurred his way through a press conference at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Rome. The 56-year-old, whose capacity for alcohol was well known among MPs and political journalists, insisted he had only had a sip of wine at lunch and blamed his behaviour on jet lag and too much cold medicine. He resigned days later when the then prime minister, Taro Aso, failed to defuse criticism that his finance minister had embarrassed the world&apos;s second biggest economy in the midst of a global financial crisis. The current finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, said: &quot;I want to express my heartfelt condolences. He was doing a fine job as a finance minister, so it is regrettable.&quot; Aso paid tribute to Nakagawa&apos;s role in tackling Japan&apos;s worst recession since the war. &quot;I&apos;m in such a state of shock right now that I cannot put it into words,&quot; he said. &quot;I offer my deepest condolences.&quot; Nakagawa&apos;s behaviour had helped fuel criticism that the Liberal Democratic party [LDP] had become complacent after an almost uninterrupted 54 years in office. The party suffered a devastating defeat in the 30 August general election, which the Democratic party of Japan won by a landslide. Some had expected Nakagawa, a prominent conservative and critic of China&apos;s military spending, to help rebuild the party. Nakagawa, who had represented his constituency in Hokkaido in Japan&apos;s far north for 25 years, lost his seat in the election. During the campaign, he told his constituents he had given up drinking &quot;for the sake of Japan&quot;. Despite his fondness for alcohol, he was regarded as a charismatic and capable politician, with some in the LDP tipping him as a future prime minister.

Why did the president of the world&apos;s residual superpower have to fly to Denmark to put in an eloquent word or two for his adopted city&apos;s Olympic bid? And how \u2013 an inevitable Republican inquiry \u2013 did he not see Chicago&apos;s elimination coming? Cue 48\u00a0hours of predictably scathing debate, and add in a 25-minute Danish airport chat with the top US general in Kabul as the public service excuse for his doomed trip. Two big losers cheek by Viking jowl. In fact, of course, the Olympic fiasco was rock place incarnate. Messrs Hatoyama, Zapatero and Lula all turned out in person to boost Tokyo, Madrid and Rio. Remember how Tony Blair danced a jig for London? If you want the International Olympic Committee to take you as seriously as it takes itself, then the main man has to drop everything and perform. And what would Obama&apos;s plentiful foes have said if he&apos;d stayed at home? That this guy who owed Chicago so much couldn&apos;t even be bothered to hop on a plane when it needed him? Either way, they&apos;re throwing rocks. But such petty name-calling - pandering to an illusion of American majesty we thought had gone west with Wall Street - isn&apos;t the important thing about Obama in Copenhagen. That brisk airport discussion may have seemed like an excuse for presidential business as usual, the reason to wheel out Airforce One -but if you want to see a dead, desperate loss developing, the cursed campaign some even amongst his cheerleaders are calling Obama&apos;s Vietnam, then Afghanistan is the issue and General Stanley McChrystal may, or may not, be William Westmoreland. The president has a decision to make. McChrystal, put in place just months ago, wants more troops, commitment and a new approach. We can&apos;t win unless ordinary Afghans feel safe, he says: all the zapping and snapping from afar, all the blasting and retreating to barracks, does us no good. Nato is on the brink of losing. The White House has to give us the resources we need. Forty thousand more troops or defeat? Which is where Vietnam comes in. Both Iraq and Afghanistan were Bush&apos;s wars in the months after 9/11 and, idiotically, Afghanistan seemed the easy one. The Taliban politely advanced in serried rows, reliving routines from the Earl Haig warbook. Air power and fire power simply destroyed them. Victory! Except that these are the badlands where no conquest lasts for long, and retreat is as near as the next roadside bomb. Eight more Americans killed this weekend: the toll goes on and on. And now there&apos;s a step change in describing this conflict. It is Obama&apos;s war. He&apos;s the commander in chief who embraces the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who talks of democracy&apos;s mystic power, who wraps the Taliban and al-Qaida in one bumper terrorist bundle. Stop Osama bin Laden here or our civilisation may fall. See how swiftly the ghosts of Hanoi return. See, too, how the Democrats in office fracture and split. When McChrystal wants more, more, more, he also wants deeper, deeper, deeper. He believes he can remake a rotten government, produce firm structures of clean administration, recruit, train and motivate huge indigenous civil authorities, Afghan soldiers and police. All this against a background of killing, day after day. It&apos;s brave and determined, a true general&apos;s diagnosis:but it doesn&apos;t wash. Karzai&apos;s duff election \u2013 a &quot;foreseeable train wreck&quot;, as sacked UN diplomat Peter Galbraith put it today \u2013 effectively seals its fate. Armed force can defeat the Taliban, as Pakistan&apos;s army belatedly shows. If you can deploy scores of thousands of troops in a finite area like Swat, root out rebels who&apos;ve grown too bold, and rely on ordinary people who hate them to stand up and be counted, you can make progress. And if you can bribe and cajole Taliban factions, and the myriad tribal factions they depend on, there&apos;s hope. Corruption corrodes two ways. Pakistan can save itself. As it does so, Afghanistan becomes more of a sideshow \u2013 one that the Taliban can be left to run, because the single sure way of defeating them is to let the endemic chaos of governing the ungovernable do the job. Does that unleash al-Qaida? Chaos has already cracked that alliance. It won&apos;t come back. But pulling out, leaving Karzai to his fate, betraying those who&apos;ve trusted you? That&apos;s a hard, hard place. Or sticking in till the blood laps too high and Afghans who just want peace, Taliban peace, at any price, tell you to go? That&apos;s a grisly call, too. It&apos;s easy to deride presidents when their toddling town doesn&apos;t win instant glory. It&apos;s damnably difficult even to imagine the weight of the decision this president has to make: to stick or twist \u2013 and know there&apos;s pain, betrayal and many more rocks, either way."}, {"sentences": ["It beat Channel 4&apos;s Kevin McCloud&apos;s Grand Tour, which had 1.1 million viewers, 4% of the audience, between 9pm and 10pm, but lost out to BBC2&apos;s Charley Boorman: Sydney to Tokyo By Any Means, which drew 1.9 million viewers."], "tags": ["TV ratings", "Television industry", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-05T10:54:43Z", "title": "TV ratings \u2013 Doc Martin boots out Emma adaptation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/05/tv-ratings-emma-doc-martin", "article": "BBC1&apos;s new Jane Austen adaptation Emma began with more than 4 million viewers but was no match for ITV1&apos;s Doc Martin last night, Sunday 4 October.

Speaking during a three-day visit to Tokyo, Mandelson praised Japan&apos;s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, for his &quot;internationalist&quot; approach and &quot;willingness to challenge old thoughts&quot;, but called on him to pull down the barriers to free trade with Britain and the EU. &quot;What aggravates UK-Japan relations is what is not seen, the invisible hand that hinders access to Japan&apos;s markets,&quot; he told British reporters. &quot;Japan has in the past been a practitioner par excellence of operating behind barriers and preventing access to its markets.&quot; Mandelson said he was confident the new government in Tokyo had accepted it could no longer run the economy &quot;like an old boys&apos; club. They have to open the windows and let more fresh air in.&quot; He added that unless Japan gave up on non-tariff barriers including red tape and limits on foreign ownership of key industries \u2013 the true potential for economic co-operation between Japan, and Britain and the EU would remain unlocked. &quot;Both sides have to try a whole lot harder and make it more of a priority, in order to pave the way for negotiations about a new EU-Japan economic integration partnership,&quot; he said. &quot;Japan&apos;s rejection of global nationalism and commitment to openness could not be more important than against this backdrop of global recession.&quot; Despite his criticisms, Mandelson welcomed assurances from carmakers Toyota and Nissan this week that they remain committed to car production in the UK. In a meeting yesterday with Nissan&apos;s senior vice president, Andy Palmer, Mandelson pushed Britain&apos;s bid to become the European manufacturing base for the carmaker&apos;s electric vehicles. Nissan has already agreed to produce batteries for electric cars at its plant in Sunderland. &quot;I am excited that we are going to see battery production in Britain, and I&apos;m very hopeful that will be followed by full car production,&quot; he said. &quot;So between Britain and Nissan, it&apos;s all systems go.&quot; Palmer later said, however, that Nissan had yet to decide on a European venue for electric car production, due to begin about 2012. Last year, as EU trade commissioner, Mandelson described Japan as &quot;the most closed investment in the world&quot;, saying it was happy to benefit from open economies elsewhere but largely shunned foreign investment in its own. Foreign direct investment into Japan came to about 3.6% of GDP last year, according to Jetro, a Japanese trade organisation, compared with 15.1% in the US and 48.6% in the UK in 2007. Japan has said it will try to raise inward investment to 5% of GDP by 2010. Today, Mandelson cited the controversial decision in February to award the Japanese firm Hitachi a contract to build a train assembly plant in Britain as evidence of a &quot;lack of reciprocity&quot;. &quot;In the UK we have thrown open railway production to Hitachi, but no British firm would get corresponding access to Japan&apos;s market,&quot; he said. &quot;This lack of reciprocity can&apos;t endure forever. Some in Europe would rather take a tougher stance against Japan, so unless change comes, it will see less openness and more backlash.&quot; Mandelson called on Japan to learn from the success of its involvement in the British car industry. &quot;It is sad to say that there is no UK equivalent to Nissan or Toyota in Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;Britain&apos;s presence here is hardly weak ... but it&apos;s not the sort of presence you&apos;d expect to see in the world&apos;s second-biggest economy.&quot; Figures out today are expected to show an increase in new car sales in Britain last month as a result of the government&apos;s scrappage scheme, under which motorists receive a \u00a32,000 discount on models over 10 years old when they buy a new car. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said sale figures out today were expected to show the third monthly increase in a row, after rises of 6% in August and 2.4% in July. The industry body said Mandelson&apos;s announcement last week of an extension to the scheme from \u00a3300m to \u00a3400m was an &quot;extremely important decision&quot; that would encourage more car purchases. Mandelson hinted today that further extensions were unlikely. &quot;In Britain we have been careful not to overextend either the size of the car scrappage scheme or its duration,&quot; he said. &quot;Over-intervention can be as dangerous as no intervention at all. &quot;You have to be careful not to distort markets in a way that has an ill effect subsequently.

Oxford fell from fourth to joint fifth place with Imperial College London in the QS/Times Higher Education rankings, published today, widening the gap with Cambridge which was rated second in the world. University College London (UCL) leapfrogged Oxford coming fourth after Yale, Cambridge and Harvard. Overall the UK still punches above its weight, second only to the US. It has four out of the top 10 slots and 18 in the top 100. But there has been a significant fall in the number of North American universities in the top 100, from 42 in 2008 to 36 in 2009. The number of Asian universities in the top 100 increased from 14 to 16. The University of Tokyo, at 22, is the highest ranked Asian university, ahead of the University of Hong Kong at 24. Leading UK universities said institutions in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong were &quot;snapping at the heels&quot; of western institutions arguing they needed more funding to compete on the global stage. Earlier this week the outgoing vice-chancellor of Oxford warned the university needs more than \u00a31bn investment in the next decade to bring &quot;unfit for purpose&quot; facilities up to a world-class standard. John Hood said the university was budgeting to make a loss for the fourth year in a row. &quot;From a financial perspective these are genuinely worrying times,&quot; he said. &quot;Government budgets are over-stressed and endowments are extremely volatile, as are the markets for our entrepreneurial activities.&quot;Yesterday Oxford expressed surprise at its fall in the table. A spokesperson said: &quot;League table rankings can vary as they often use different methods to measure success, but Oxford University&apos;s position is surprising given that Oxford \u2026 has come first in every national league table.&quot; The rankings are based on an international survey of 9,000 academics, how influential the institution&apos;s research is and measures of teaching quality and ability to recruit staff and students abroad. Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of Universities, said: &quot;The broad message of these tables is clear \u2013 the leading UK research universities are held in high esteem internationally but countries like China and Korea, which are investing massively in their best institutions, are snapping at our heels. &quot;The precise accuracy of league tables like this can be debated but there is no mistaking the alarm bell warning that our success is at risk if we as a nation don&apos;t take action to fight off such fierce competition.&quot; She added that the UK was less well-funded than its competitors and if public spending cuts hit budgets they would be under increasing pressure. Universities are currently arguing for improved funding in a forthcoming review of the student finance system, to be launched by the government within weeks. They are increasingly calling for fees to be increased to safeguard the quality of their teaching. The league table rates teaching quality according to the staff to student ratio. A recent report by the Higher Education Funding Council for England suggested some students were struggling to get enough contact time with tutors. Phil Baty, the deputy editor of Times Higher Education magazine which published the tables, said: &quot;Oxford comes out with perfect scores on reputation but citations per staff have slipped slightly while UCL has improved dramatically. It&apos;s very tight at the very top so a relatively small change can move the pecking order.

Kaneko&apos;s program, Winny, allows users to trade files without revealing their IP address \u2013 the online equivalent of a phone number, which has been used by copyright owners to track down people suspect of illicitly trading copyrighted files online. Digital content providers say Winny infringes on their copyright by giving users access to their material for free. Kaneko, a former instructor at the prestigious University of Tokyo, was arrested in 2004. He became the first file-sharing software developer arrested in Japan. He was accused of helping two users disseminate copyrighted material on the internet with Winny, which can be accessed from his home page. In the 2006 ruling, a judge said Winny assisted in the perpetration of crimes. Violating copyright laws in Japan can bring up to three years in prison or a maximum fine of 3 million yen. But Presiding Judge Masazo Ogura rejected the initial verdict, saying it &quot;cannot be said that the defendant published the software to encourage copyright infringement,&quot; according to Kyodo News agency. Around 200,000 users, mostly in Japan, are believed to use Winny daily, according to the Association of Copyright for Computer Software, a Tokyo-based industry group for over 220 computer software makers. The association voiced &quot;regret&quot; over the decision. &quot;It is crystal clear that allowing people to use this network further encourages copyright violation,&quot; the association said in a statement. The reversal runs counter to recent rulings elsewhere. There has been a spate of cases in the U.S. in which people who run file-sharing sites or illegally share content have been ordered to pay fines. In addition, several members of a music piracy group, Apocalypse Production Crew, have been convicted for copyright infringement. Most recently, a man was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his involvement with the group. In Sweden, four men connected to The Pirate Bay, one of the world&apos;s largest file-sharing venues, were sentenced in June to one-year prison terms for abetting violations of copyright law.

But once in a while a title comes along that somehow punches the zeitgeist squarely in the face; that it&apos;s okay to talk about in public. There are games that pique the interest of lifestyle mags, Newsnight reviews, hot new musicians and other discerning cultural commentators. They&apos;re not better or worse for it, they&apos;re just &apos;cool&apos;. So here are, in my blinkered opinion, the ten coolest games of all time. I&apos;ve stuck to retail releases; there have probably been countless viral and augmented reality experiences that I&apos;ve missed \u2013 although those tend to be considered cool simply because they&apos;re created by the sorts of Hoxton-based creative media agencies that tell us what&apos;s cool in the first place.

Go on, you&apos;re cooler than me - what have I missed? Pac-Man, 1980Some games are born cool, some games achieve coolness and some have coolness thrust upon them. Pac-Man probably belongs in the latter category. There is nothing intrinsically hip about Namco&apos;s maze game, but from the start it was enthusiastically appropriated into popular culture, especially dance music. Early electro classics like Jonzun crew&apos;s Pac-Jam, The Pac-Man&apos;s I Am a Pac Man and Newcleus&apos; Jam On Revenge (The Wiki Wiki Song) were inspired by the huge success of the game, as well as the electronic age it ushered in and the iconic sound design. The fact that the eponymous character spent his time guzzling energising power-pill also struck a chord with an emerging generation of clubbers for some reason; hence Richard D James&apos; Power-Pill EP. And, of course, there&apos;s Marcus Brigstocke&apos;s classic quote, &quot;If Pacman had affected us as kids we&apos;d be running around in dark rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive music.&quot;WipEout, 1995Alright, it tried too damn hard. That capitalized E was designed to flirt with the ecstasy crowd, the visuals mixed Bladerunner chic with a Ministry of Sound lighting rig. Then there was the soundtrack, filled with mainstream big beat floor fillers, which was released as a CD just as the whole super club fad was kicking off. Sony&apos;s marketing department was sponsoring nights at fashionable haunts all over the world, putting demo pods in chill-out rooms, and turning up at festivals like Glastonbury (where the company once famously distributed Playstation flyers on serrated cardboard). Somehow a futuristic spaceship racing game become the poster boy for videogame cultcha. If it is possible to cynically buy coolness, WipEout was cool as fxxk. PaRappa the Rappa, 1996The idiosyncratic brainchild of musician Masaya Matsuura and artist Rodney Greenblat, PaRappa was a hippyish rapping sim combining goofy anthropomorphic characters, daft songs and Simon Says-type interaction, and effectively laying the foundations for the rhythm action genre. It arrived on the PlayStation in 1996, but Matsuura and his company NanaOn-Sha had actually been working on it for Sony since before the launch of the console, testing the mechanic using characters from Greenblat&apos;s Dazzeloids CD ROM game (don&apos;t listen to the revisionists who tell you Nintendo invented inclusive gaming with the Wii - they&apos;re wrong). Sony then brought Greenblat in to produce fresh characters with a global appeal and a legend was born. The game was enormously popular with female players in Japan, prompting a similar follow up, Um Jammer Lammy, as well as a sequel. The cute characters can still be seen adorning T-shirts to this day. Dance, Dance Revolution, 1998The last time I was in Tokyo a few years ago, you couldn&apos;t get into the arcades for the hordes of gyaru \u2013 fashion-obsessed school girls \u2013 playing Dance Dance Revolution for hours on end. Konami&apos;s massively popular coin-op and console series gets you to dance on coloured pads to a series of licensed and in-house tracks \u2013 either alone or against friends. Importantly, though, you could always add your own freestyle moves between the mandatory inputs and through this element of self-expression, a thriving culture of &apos;DDR Freaks&apos; emerged. The whole structure of the rhythm action experience was tweaked and codified here. Along with Guitar Freaks, it is utterly seminal to the genre. Music, 1998Yes, yes, more music gaming \u2013 there&apos;s a theme developing here. This was a sequencer package developed by UK studio Jester Interactive, under the creative guidance of Tim Wright who created a lot of the tracks for WipEout. It allowed PlayStation owners to create reasonably complex dance tracks using a huge library of samples and a riff generator. Several sequels followed, adding more complex sequencing and sampling features, as well as the ability to record and distribute tracks. These cheap, powerful applications were used as a stepping stone into music production by dozens of urban artists. Depending on your music tastes that&apos;s reasonably cool \u2013 and the baton has been taken up, to some degree, by the excellent Korg DS-10 synth for the Nintendo DS\u2026 Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater, 1999Here was a game that actually felt like hanging out at a skate park attempting idiotic tricks with your friends. It was utterly divorced from formalised simulations like FIFA or Madden and this gave it a similar counter-culture aura to the real thing. And of course, it rode the slipstream of the late-nineties extreme sports craze (brought about, in part, by ESPN&apos;s aggressive marketing of its X Games events in the US) and also the rise of emo culture. For a while everyone was a skater \u2013 even if it was just on their TV. Jet Set Radio, 2000Created by Sega&apos;s Smilebit team, previously responsible for the cult Saturn shooter Panzer Dragoon, Jet Set Radio was a bewilderingly fluorescent, hyper-kinetic urban adventure, where you had to form skate gangs and tag as many walls as possible to mark out your territory. The funky cell-shaded visuals led to a long-lasting trend which eventually drove everyone bloody mad, but it looked amazing first time round. The graffiti theme of the game garnered objections at the time, which only made it more voguish. The soundtrack was also fantastic, mixing J-pop, funk and grunge to pleasing effect. Rez, 2001Created by avid clubber Tetsuya Mizuguchi and inspired by the work of Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky, this avant-garde shooter is an exploration of the neurological phenomenon synesthesia, in which sensory information is confused so that you hear colours, see sounds, etc. The cool part is the merging of trippy vector visuals with an evolving electronic soundtrack, which responds to the in-game action, allowing players to build a pounding dance track as they go. Also cool was the Trance Vibrator peripheral, packaged with special editions of the game. This vibrating device could be held or sat on during play, ostensibly extending the synesthesia experience to touch. Some users found that the device became the focus of their gameplay experience \u2013 as this famed blog post on Game Girl Advance illustrated.  GTA: Vice City, 2002Grand Theft Auto has always enjoyed a frisson of cool, but Vice City went stratospheric. It arrived reasonably early in the PS2&apos;s life cycle \u2013 an era in which people were still referring to the PlayStation Generation in a vaguely reverent and corroborative manner. Vice City brilliantly captured the emerging fad for eighties nostalgia via a huge soundtrack filled with ironic retro hits. It was plastered with achingly hip reference points from Scarface and Goodfellas to Boogie Nights and Saturday Night Fever. And it featured sex, drugs, violence and swearing within the context of an amoral universe \u2013 those things are always cool. Just ask Brett Easton Ellis&apos;s accountant.  Guitar Hero, 2005I wasn&apos;t sure about including this, because it is essentially poncing about in your living room with a plastic instrument pretending to be Jimmy Page. But last month Courtney Love said that she loathed the game, which instantly made it absolutely acceptable. Created by Harmonix Music Systems, the series has become a music industry institution, providing a new channel for unknown bands to reach global audiences and introducing a whole new generation to groups like Blue Oyster Cult, Black Sabbath and Pixies. Which is sort of cool. Ultimately, Guitar Hero is the now the quintessential post-pub game \u2013 as long as you can find all the bits, then calibrate the audio after five pints of Stella."}, {"sentences": ["Nicholls&apos; detailed description of the incident is gripping as Murphy descends from laughable drunk in a Tokyo hotel to something much more unpleasant by the time they are airborne."], "tags": ["Paul Nicholls", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-09T08:00:02Z", "title": "Claims Five: The five best bits from Paul Nicholls' new book", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/oct/09/paul-nicholls-champion-trainer-autobiography", "article": "Harry Findlay, the flamboyant gambler and racehorse owner, once said that he named his chaser Herecomesthetruth after the phrase he invariably utters when Paul Nicholls is interviewed on television. In contrast to many other trainers, Findlay suggested, Nicholls could be relied on to be open and honest with the betting public when discussing his horses. Judging from Nicholls&apos; newly published autobiography, Lucky Break, the same is also true when it comes to telling his life story. As any fan of jumps racing would expect, there is plenty of material about his most famous horses, Kauto Star, Denman and See More Business, but there is also a wealth of insider stories, many of which would fall under the heading of &quot;excellent gossip&quot; if you had heard them told at Nicholls&apos; local pub in Ditcheat, Somerset. Lucky Break is a strong contender for the most entertaining book about racing I&apos;ve read. What follows is a countdown of the five bits that opened my eyes widest, though this is just a taster of the whole. 5) His weight problems Weight is not much of an issue for a trainer but Nicholls started out as a jockey, having been gripped by the horsey bug. As his father and grandfather were both burly, rugby-playing policemen, there was an obvious potential stumbling block but Nicholls says he was still light enough to ride on the Flat in his mid-teens. Then, as soon as he decided to be a jump jockey, he shot up to six feet tall, precipitating years of &quot;gnawing, nail-biting hunger&quot;. Nicholls claims, persuasively, that the crazy dieting regime necessitated by his height, together with his reliance on &apos;pee pills&apos;, continue to affect his health now. It seems to have been a terrible struggle (an early chapter is titled &apos;Food was like a drug to me&apos;) and the reader is not disposed to blame him if he is making up for it now. 4) When he worked in a bakery Just as there are a number of trainers who should probably not be left in charge of an off-licence, Nicholls seems an unlikely sort to work the night shift in a bakery. Luckily for him this part of his career came before the weight problems. When he reports that &quot;those four hours I spent each morning baking cakes and making doughnuts nearly drove me crazy&quot;, he is complaining about boredom rather than temptation. He decides he has to escape but, rather than quit, he opts to get himself fired, deliberately rolling an entire batch of doughnuts in salt rather than sugar. It is an early example of what seems a trend, Nicholls responding to adversity with emotion rather than logic. 3) That plane ride with Timmy Murphy To those who follow racing it is not news that Timmy Murphy, a very talented jockey, has had his battles with the bottle. Notoriously he was given a six-month jail sentence in 2002 after causing chaos while drunk on a flight from Japan, where he had ridden for Nicholls in the Nakayama Grand Jump. Nicholls&apos; detailed description of the incident is gripping as Murphy descends from laughable drunk in a Tokyo hotel to something much more unpleasant by the time they are airborne. Murphy is reportedly teetotal these days and is certainly enjoying a successful career but he would have won many more big races if he had not lost himself the job with Nicholls. 2) Raging at Martin Pipe It is quite possible that Nicholls&apos; greatest achievement will always be that he was able to unseat Martin Pipe from the trainers&apos; championship. Pipe changed the game forever with the advances he made in terms of getting his horses fit and, for a long time, his dominance of the sport seemed unlikely to end, except with retirement. Their yards are only 40 miles apart, so perhaps it is not surprising that there was a great deal of tension between them, as described at a few points in the book. But the depth of feeling on Nicholls&apos; side is intense, as illustrated when Pipe&apos;s Cyborgo suffered a sudden injury and was pulled up in the 1998 Cheltenham Gold Cup, accidentally carrying Nicholls&apos; See More Business out of the race with him. Not knowing exactly what had happened, Nicholls describes furiously confronting Pipe at the track in full view of spectators, believing himself to have been the victim of a conspiracy. He now accepts that was a &quot;crazy&quot; idea but, even though he knows his victim was blameless, &quot;part of me still wishes I&apos;d clocked Pipe&quot;. As Nicholls explains in the book, there were a number of factors that help to explain how he felt, but few of them would have been accepted in mitigation by the Jockey Club if blows really had been exchanged at the home of jump racing. 1) The hot tub I have never looked at Paul Nicholls and thought: &quot;There stands a man who has cut a swathe through West Country womanhood&quot;. But the next time I clap eyes on him, I may well be thinking that, because such appears to have been the case. There are more page references next to the index entry &apos;Paul Nicholls and girls&apos; than there are for &apos;Paul Nicholls and training horses&apos;. &quot;I enjoy female company, have had some lovely girlfriends over the years and remain close to quite a few of them,&quot; he says, which is possibly not what his current partner, Georgie Browne, wants to hear. All of this builds to a (pre-Georgie) climax on page 191, where Nicholls tells us about a Norwegian hot tub he installed after the departure of his second wife, which appears to have spiced up his love life no end. The tub is the venue for a 3am &quot;frolick&quot; involving Mick Fitzgerald and &quot;a couple of girls who had better remain anonymous&quot;. This is the same Mick Fitzgerald who said sex would be an anticlimax after winning the Grand National."}, {"sentences": ["In 1972 Plummer was attending a conference of city leaders in Tokyo when he was surprised to receive a phone call from Number 10 complaining about the traffic in central London and demanding to know what he intended to do about it."], "tags": ["London", "London politics"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-09T08:33:28Z", "title": "Former GLC leader Lord Plummer has died", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2009/oct/09/london-london", "article": "Desmond Plummer, a Tory leader of he GLC in the 1970s, has died.

The omission was rectified in the Birthday Honours the same year, but relations between County Hall and Downing Street remained prickly. In 1972 Plummer was attending a conference of city leaders in Tokyo when he was surprised to receive a phone call from Number 10 complaining about the traffic in central London and demanding to know what he intended to do about it. The previous evening, Heath had had to walk the 200 yards from the Commons to Downing Street because of a traffic snarl-up in Parliament Square, and had arrived 10 minutes late at a reception he was giving. Furious at the delay, the prime minister instructed a member of his staff to track down the man responsible and give him a dressing-down. Sensing a wonderful opportunity for free publicity (and relishing the prospect of having a little fun at Heath&apos;s expense), Plummer retorted that traffic jams would continue unless Parliament legislated for the GLC to build new roads. He had been lobbying ministers to this effect for years, he observed, but to no avail. At the conference the following day, to gales of laughter, Plummer related the incident to his fellow city leaders: &quot;All this because Ted had to walk from Parliament to a party he was giving at Number 10.&quot;  Tony Travers has written an obituary of Plummer for the Guardian and I will link to that when it appears.

He was a traditional Conservative moderate who had also been a member of the former London county council, towards the end of its life when it was dominated by the Labour party, led by proteges of Herbert Morrison. Plummer was the first non-Labour politician to run the capital since 1934, and the longest-serving leader of the GLC. While Harold Wilson&apos;s Labour government unleashed new social and economic forces in Britain, the capital was dominated by the Conservatives. After Plummer&apos;s win in 1967, the Tories went on to inflict a heavy defeat on Labour in borough elections during the spring of 1968, paving the way for Edward Heath&apos;s general election victory in 1970. Born in Temple Fortune, north London, Plummer went to school at Hurstpierpoint college, West Sussex, and then trained at the College of Estate Management, Reading, Berkshire. He\u00a0served in the Royal Engineers from 1938 to 1946 before pursuing a career as\u00a0a surveyor and estate manager. In 1952 he was elected to the then St\u00a0Marylebone borough council, serving as mayor in 1958-59. In 1960, he was also elected as the London county council member for St Marylebone, holding the seat until the council&apos;s abolition in 1965. He was one of the original members of the GLC in 1964, representing first the cities of London and Westminster, then, from 1973 to 1976, St Marylebone. In\u00a01966 he succeeded Sir Percy Rugg as\u00a0Conservative leader, taking the party to victory the following year and thus becoming leader of the council. As leader, Plummer was fond of driving about the city in a gold-coloured Mini Cooper, implying a modernity much in keeping with the times. His administration at County Hall promoted the &quot;motorway box&quot; solution to London&apos;s worsening traffic congestion. The idea of a series of ring roads at increasing distances from the city centre had long been promoted by the then Ministry of Transport. Bitter opposition was aroused by the GLC&apos;s &quot;ringway&quot; policies, and the anti-roads lobby was born. Only the East Cross route, near Bow, and a section of the West Cross route between the A40 Westway elevated dual carriageway and Shepherds Bush were constructed, although eventually the M25 would follow. The GLC was, in part, seen as an institution that could deliver an ambitious road system for London of the kind that Robert Moses had attempted in New York. Plummer&apos;s name remains on commemorative plaques on both the Blackwall tunnel, in\u00a0east London, and the Westway. Carnaby Street in the West End was pedestrianised during his period of office. Efforts were also made to remove all traffic from Bond Street and Oxford Street, though neither fully succeeded. Covent Garden market was moved south of the river to Vauxhall. The GLC at this time pioneered the policy of selling council homes to sitting tenants, an idea that would come to national fruition during Margaret Thatcher&apos;s government. Plummer&apos;s administration considered road pricing, while Plummer himself saw electric cars as offering a solution to pollution. In 1970 the transport minister, Barbara Castle, transferred London Transport to the GLC, allowing plans to be advanced to extend the tube to Heathrow and to build the Fleet (eventually Jubilee) line. Studies were undertaken into exotic plans for a monorail along Regent Street and an underground freight railway. The beautifully named Operation Moondrop attempted to keep roads clear by restricting deliveries to night-time. Plummer also tried to introduce a London-wide lottery, though the idea was killed off in the House of Lords. He had done rather well out of the Wilson government and his relationship with Heath was not particularly close, even though London had blazed a trail for the Conservatives nationally. The best-known story about their relationship concerns an occasion when, having been stuck in traffic in Whitehall, en route from No 10 to the Commons, Heath crossly demanded to speak to Plummer, who happened to be in Tokyo. Plummer used the ensuing telephone call to tell the prime minister that the jams would have been eased if only the government had funded the GLC&apos;s road programme. The carefully leaked row became front-page news in the following day&apos;s London Evening Standard. During his time as leader of the GLC, Plummer took on various public appointments, including membership of\u00a0a number of bodies in the arts, transport and planning. He also sat on the court of the University of London. After Labour took control of the GLC in 1973, he served as leader of the opposition for a year before resigning (he remained a council member until 1976). He returned to his property interests and became chairman of the Horserace Betting Levy Board (1974-82) and of the National Stud (1975-82), maintaining his long interest in horseracing. He was an outstanding swimmer, loved cricket (he lived latterly in St John&apos;s Wood, near Lord&apos;s) and was president of the London Anglers&apos; Association for many years. From 1983 to 1990, he was chairman of the Portman Building Society, later serving as president. Knighted in 1971, Plummer was made a peer in 1981 and attended the House of\u00a0Lords regularly. From there he spoke out in opposition to the abolition of the GLC during the mid-1980s. He continued to drive in to Westminster from his home, even in old age. In 2007 the London School of Economics held a seminar at City Hall, hosted by Ken Livingstone, to mark the 40th anniversary of Plummer&apos;s election win. Many former GLC and\u00a0LCC\u00a0members were able to look back at the city&apos;s development since the\u00a01960s. In a public conversation with the local government analyst George Jones, Plummer reminisced about leading the\u00a0capital during an extraordinary period. Livingstone, himself a traditionalist, took great care of his frail predecessor. Plummer&apos;s death represents a further break between contemporary London government and the postwar era. Local government leaders at that time presided over a city that was losing its population and, in relative terms, its economic dominance. The docks declined precipitously during the\u00a01960s and 1970s. Today, with another Conservative running a very different system of government, the capital faces\u00a0new challenges. Plummer embodied moderate Conservatism during a period of radical economic and\u00a0social change. His wife, Pat, died in 1998 after 57 years of marriage. He is survived by a\u00a0daughter. \u2022 Arthur Desmond Herne Plummer, Lord Plummer of St Marylebone, politician, born 25 May 1914; died 2 October 2009"}, {"sentences": ["The &quot;performance&quot; is repeated and recorded in eight worldwide metropolitans: London, Tokyo, Shanghai, Delhi, New York, Mexico City, Cairo and Lagos."], "tags": ["Art", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-09T23:06:24Z", "title": "Exhibitions: Kimsooja, Gateshead", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/10/exhibitions-kimsooja-gateshead-preview", "article": "A thin woman stands bolt upright with her back to us, as the city centre&apos;s population at large pass her by.

A former head of fine art at Middlesex Univer- sity, he sought to convey his turbulent spirit and love of nature through his art. While his work was exhibited frequently in Britain, especially London (and also Hong Kong and Tokyo), it did not slot easily into the current parameters of the British art establishment. Richard was born in Hampstead Garden Suburb, north London, the son of Lionel Robbins, soon afterwards appointed professor of economics at the London School of Economics and later to become Lord Robbins, chairman of the influential 1963 committee report on higher education. Richard went to King Alfred and University College schools before going to Dauntsey&apos;s school, in Wiltshire, after the outbreak of the second world war. He loved art and excelled at sport, particularly golf. After a spell in the army with the 21st Field Artillery, he went to New College, Oxford, to read English literature, played golf for the university and emerged determined to become an artist, which his father encouraged. After periods at Goldsmiths College, Ruskin and the Slade School of Art, Richard taught art at Belmont school for six years from 1952, by which time he was married to a sculptor, Wendy Dobbs, whom he later divorced. Richard moved on to Camberwell School of Art and Hornsey School of Art, later incorporated in Middlesex University, where he was head of painting from 1984 until 1990 and then head of the school of fine art until 1993, when he was made an honorary professor of fine art and retired from teaching. He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 2004. Unlike many contemporaries in art schools, he firmly believed in the importance of drawing.     Autumnal Hydrangea by Richard Robbins. Photograph: Highgate FIne Art    Even while he was still teaching, Richard managed to produce a wide range of paintings, etchings and sculpture. He adored colour and, under his hand, flowering shrubs would tumble brilliantly out of vast canvases. He was fascinated by the changing patterns of light, weather and seasons, and for a time concentrated on the Hampstead ponds of north London. At Lyme Regis, Dorset, where he had a cottage and studio, he tried to capture the swirling movement of seagulls, the surf, the sun rising over the horizon and people on the beach. Simultaneously, he sculpted a few fine bronze heads, including one of his father, which can be seen at the LSE. Once Richard retired, his creative energy surged and he concentrated much of his time modelling and casting groups of relatively small figures \u2013 at the scene of an accident witnessed some years before, in a 1950s dance hall, in a steam room. The Dance he worked on in wax from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, when the 19 figures were cast in patinated bronze or aluminium, which he then painted. This group was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1997, and the bronze version has been acquired by his Oxford college. Richard also produced several single golfers in mid-swing and more recently tackled the complex movements of both a rugby scrum and lineout. He was for many years captain of the Hampstead Golf Club. His Muswell Hill home, walls covered with pictures, shelves with sculpture and a collection of golf clubs in the front hall, was the scene of regular generous but simple hospitality \u2013 and vigorous discussion \u2013 with his much-loved second wife, Brenda, whom he married in 1961. Over recent years, he had suffered from heart problems, but was diagnosed this summer with leukaemia. He is survived by Brenda, by Philip, the younger son of his first marriage, and four stepsons. His elder son, William, died in 1998. \u2022 Richard Robbins, artist, born 12 July 1927; died 28 July 2009"}, {"sentences": ["Japan&apos;s confirmation today that its refuelling ships will be withdrawn from the Indian Ocean in January is the first real sign that the new Tokyo administration is honouring its election pledge to break free from decades of subservience to US foreign policy.", "He hopes to have a comprehensive plan in place before Barack Obama arrives in Tokyo on 12 November for a two-day visit.", "Further evidence of the shift in Tokyo&apos;s foreign policy priorities came last week when Hatoyama met his South Korean and Chinese counterparts, Lee Myung-bak and Wen Jiabao, in Beijing for talks on the formation of an &quot;east Asian community&quot; inspired by the European Union."], "tags": ["Japan", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-13T11:31:31Z", "title": "Japan begins to shake off US foreign policy influence", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/oct/13/japan-united-states-relations", "article": "Japan&apos;s confirmation today that its refuelling ships will be withdrawn from the Indian Ocean in January is the first real sign that the new Tokyo administration is honouring its election pledge to break free from decades of subservience to US foreign policy. The announcement had been expected for weeks after heavy hints from the prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, and other senior officials that Japan would seek other ways to contribute to peace in Afghanistan. Since 2001 Japanese vessels have provided fuel and water to US and allied warships in support of the war effort. Hatoyama, whose Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) has consistently opposed the mission, will instead attempt to ease US concerns with a raft of humanitarian measures. He hopes to have a comprehensive plan in place before Barack Obama arrives in Tokyo on 12 November for a two-day visit. &quot;We believe that civilian support for the people&apos;s livelihood in that country, such as agricultural reconstruction, will lead to a fundamental solution to what constitutes the basis of terrorism,&quot; said the government&apos;s chief spokesman, Hirofumi Hirano. Japan&apos;s determination to offer new, non-military solutions to Afghanistan&apos;s problems was evident at the weekend when the foreign minister, Katsuya Okada, made a surprise visit to Kabul to discuss long-term reconstruction with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. Japan has already committed itself to paying the Afghan police force&apos;s salaries for six months and is funding several education projects that it hopes will weaken the lure of the Taliban among disaffected Afghan men. Although the US and Britain have urged Japan to extend its refuelling mission beyond January, Washington has indicated it will accept a withdrawal in return for deeper involvement in Afghanistan&apos;s reconstruction. Among the extra measures being considered by Japan, which has pledged $2bn in aid over the last eight years, is job training for former Taliban fighters. The issue with the greatest potential to cause discord between Hatoyama and Obama lies much closer to home, on the southern island of Okinawa, where two-thirds of the 50,000 US troops on Japanese soil live. Under a 2006 agreement designed to reduce the US military footprint on the island, 8,000 marines will be transferred to Guam, a US territory in the Pacific Ocean, by 2014. The marines&apos; base, which covers a quarter of the overcrowded city of Ginowan, will be moved to a new location on Okinawa&apos;s west coast. But the agreement&apos;s future was thrown into doubt with the DPJ&apos;s landslide election victory in August. Hatoyama took office last month promising to review the deal, with some on the left of his party calling for the base to be moved to the mainland or out of Japan altogether. Publicly, the US says it is happy to give the Hatoyama government time to &quot;evaluate&quot; its stance. &quot;We view the United States and Japan as partners, equal partners,&quot; the US ambassador to Japan, John Roos, said last week. &quot;As partners, we want to listen to what they have to say and work with them on this issue.&quot; Privately, however, state department officials have indicated to their Japanese counterparts that the base agreement is not up for negotiation. Further evidence of the shift in Tokyo&apos;s foreign policy priorities came last week when Hatoyama met his South Korean and Chinese counterparts, Lee Myung-bak and Wen Jiabao, in Beijing for talks on the formation of an &quot;east Asian community&quot; inspired by the European Union. The leaders said they would explore the idea of a free-trade pact and co-operate more closely in other areas, including climate change and sustainable growth. In the long-term, Hatoyama&apos;s east Asian vision could involve the introduction of a single currency among the three countries, whose economies account for about 16% of the world&apos;s gross domestic product. The community could be extended to include India, Australia, New Zealand and the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations. &quot;Until now we have tended to be too reliant on the United States,&quot; Hatoyama said. &quot;The Japan-US alliance remains important, but as a member of Asia, I would like to develop policies that focus more on Asia.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo there&apos;s an experimental punk scene, where a lot of bands I like come from."], "tags": ["Music", "World music", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Indie"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-14T15:23:03Z", "title": "Turning Japanese: Notes from the underground \u2013 Part three", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/14/turning-japanese-notes-underground", "article": "My name&apos;s Ian Martin, and I&apos;m a 30-year-old British event organiser, DJ and record label owner. I came to Japan seven years ago after finishing university, just for an adventure. But I got really interested in the music scene and ended up sticking around. In 2005, I put out my first compilation of Japanese bands on my label, Call and Response Records. I&apos;m mostly into releasing post-punk and new wave stuff, but I put out some hardcore and noise too.  Recently, I put out a compilation featuring 21 Japanese underground bands covering Wire&apos;s Pink Flag album track-for-track. No one bought it because Japanese people don&apos;t know who Wire are. It was a really fun, if expensive, project to do. Shibuya-kei  is the only scene anyone really speaks about here. A lot of the people involved in it were already well connected to the music scene anyway, and it also had close ties with the fashion scene, which made it quite a hip thing to be involved in. It had an impact beyond just the musical aspect, which was important. After all, the music scene here is often unglamorous. Live venues are pretty shabby and music fans are quite drab, unfashionable people generally, so Shibuya-kei gave magazines something to write about. Really, though, it was just a catch-all term for indie music that was popular in the mid 90s and promoted by a few Shibuya record stores. There are still bands making the same kind of interesting music, but culturally speaking the media has found other things to make a fuss over.  Because there&apos;s no music press worth speaking of in Japan, it&apos;s hard for fans to break into the scene at first. But once you find a couple of bands you like, you can usually find more just by looking at who they play with. After a while you notice little scenes here and there. Organising events, you have to be aware of these little networks and recognise which bands will bring a decent crowd, as opposed to bands whose fans will just turn up to watch them play, and then sod off and ignore all the other people on the bill. In Tokyo there&apos;s an experimental punk scene, where a lot of bands I like come from. This is based mostly along the Chuo Line in places like Koenji, and in a few venues such as Shibuya O-Nest, Akihabara Goodman and Shimo-Kitazawa Basement Bar. Then there&apos;s a techno-pop/new wave scene that&apos;s absorbed some of the remnants of Shibuya-kei and mixed it with this 80s, Devo/Yellow Magic Orchestra/Plastics revival sound. There&apos;s also a thriving hardcore scene, and some districts like Shimo-Kitazawa, Akihabara and Koenji have their own musical identity too. Getting people interested in the music is difficult. There are so many bands out there, and they&apos;re mostly rubbish, so getting the message across \u2013 &quot;Hey, but this one&apos;s good \u2013 honest!&quot; \u2013\u00a0is a Sisyphean endeavour. Japanese musicians are often more technically skilled, partly because bands play for much longer before they get anywhere. You never get popular indie bands still in their teens like you do in the UK. Perhaps because of this, experimental music in Japan is light years ahead of the UK. The sort of people who go and see Japanese underground bands are a geeky niche, whereas to get popular, a band needs to attract a more casual audience, the sort that was indie enough to buy into Shibuya-kei but whose radar doesn&apos;t scan lower than that. These kinds of people generally look to British or US indie because it comes to Japan pre-packaged and with added credibility. I think some Japanese people don&apos;t give their country&apos;s music the time it deserves.

The designer label, which pulled in celebrity names including Victoria Beckham, Twiggy, Gwyneth Paltrow and Samantha Cameron to its London catwalk show and party in September, posted much better-than-expected second quarter sales of \u00a3343m, some 5% higher than the same period last year. The shares, which are now in the FTSE 100 and have doubled this year, rose 28.5p to close at 565.5p as analysts marked up their full-year profit forecasts. Stacey Cartwright, the Burberry finance director, suggested that the &quot;upper end&quot; of the City&apos;s \u00a3160m-\u00a3190m range was most likely. Most luxury goods firms have been hit by the recession, but Burberry took swift action to cut costs and jobs. The 150-year-old brand, which is known for its trademark beige plaid and trenchcoats, has been resurrected as a high fashion label. It has also been boosted by new Asian stores and weak sterling. The sales improvement has been boosted by Burberry&apos;s handbags, such as its totes, which range from a small nylon version for \u00a3150 to a large black alligator tote, trimmed with a barbed wire chain, for \u00a312,250. Snoods \u2013 pull-on scarf-cum-hoods which Burberry is selling for \u00a3150-\u00a3195 \u2013 have also been big sellers. Retail sales, which account for more than 50% of group sales, were up 14% in the first half \u2013 or 27% taking into account the boost from the pound/dollar exchange rate \u2013 with most growth coming from new store space and the buoyant Middle East market.

Europe and Asia, led by Britain and South Korea, remain the best-performing markets with the US and Spain \u2013 traditionally a big market for the brand \u2013 recording large falls. Wholesale sales were down an underlying 23% as customers cut back their orders to reduce stocks. Nearly half the decline, however, was the result of Burberry&apos;s own actions, such as shutting down the younger Thomas Burberry brand and changing Middle East outlets from wholesale to retail. Nine new franchised stores opened, including seven in China.

Following mounting concern about his whereabouts in recent days, sources close to the situation said Levene has not disappeared but was instead at the Priory hospital in north London receiving care. His lawyers would neither confirm nor deny the suggestion and the Priory refused to comment. Tonight the Metropolitan police confirmed it has been handed information about the case and is considering whether to launch an inquiry, though there is no guarantee this will lead to a full investigation. Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, the founders of Stagecoach, the \u00a31.2bn quoted travel firm, allege Levene owes them \u00a317.8m. The biggest claim so far to have emerged, according to high court papers, is from wealthy Essex businessmen Victor Lupson and John Bennett, totalling \u00a338m. The Guardian is also aware of other investors who suggest they are owed more than \u00a310m. Levene is also facing claims from Richard Caring, the rag trade tycoon who owns some of London&apos;s most famous restaurants including the Ivy, J Sheeky and Le Caprice. Raymond O&apos;Rourke, the chairman and chief executive of construction firm Laing O&apos;Rourke, has also had dealings with Levene, although the exact extent of his exposure is unclear. Levene, who is vice-chaiman of the League One football club Leyton Orient, is known to be a generous family man with an extravagant lifestyle. One leading city broker described him as a man who &quot;lived the dream&quot; and had a private jet on call. Others who attended Levene family functions suggested no expense was spared. A wealth manager who placed clients with Levene said he was &quot;quite plausible&quot;. His sales pitch according to the Gibraltar-based lawyer was that he could get access to share offerings in companies unattainable to ordinary investors. Known to his friends as &quot;Beano&quot;, he is now at the centre of claims that he failed to pay his clients millions in profits from share investments made on their behalf. In a high court writ, Gloag and Souter claimed Levene was given \u00a310m to invest in mining firm Xstrata and HSBC bank. The Scottish tycoons then instructed him to sell when they made \u00a33.8m each. They state they have not received the money. Seemingly one of the best-connected figures in the city, Levene counted the likes of Jeremy Isaacs, Lehman Brothers&apos; former London chief, as his friend. The north Londoner became a major league player, culminating in his appointment as vice-chairman of Nicola Horlick&apos;s quoted city fund Bramdean Asset Management. Levene is also being chased by two spread betting firms, which are claiming he owes them several hundred thousands of pounds. A writ filed on behalf of IG Index alleges the trader lost \u00a3720,000 on a Twenty20 cricket match between South Africa and the West Indies. Papers lodged by IG Index&apos;s lawyers in the Queen&apos;s Bench division of the high court claim that by October 2007 Levene owed IG Index \u00a31,778,500. Between February and November last year he repaid debts of \u00a3987,315 in four separate tranches of between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3350,000 each. The writ states: &quot;Accordingly, the sum of \u00a3791,185.03 remains due and outstanding.&quot; Another spread betting firm alleges Levene has racked up separate gambling debts. Levene failed to appear at crucial court hearings to defend himself, prompting the court to freeze assets and demand he surrender passports in a move that heightened speculation as to his whereabouts. Describing himself as having 25 years&apos; experience in the equity and derivatives markets, Levene has worked at some of the City&apos;s premier institutions including Phillips &amp; Drew, Tullett &amp; Tokyo and Trio Equity Derivatives, where he was managing director. He was also an executive director at hedge fund Integrated Asset Management. Concern over Levene emerged in July when a high court judge ordered him to pay Gloag, who is Scotland&apos;s richest woman, and Souter, who is chief executive of Stagecoach, a total of \u00a38.9m each plus more than \u00a312,000 in legal costs. The high court upheld the pair&apos;s claim that Levene failed to return capital and profits relating to investments made on their behalf. At the time, Levene reportedly claimed the matter was a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and was closed after payments were made to the pair. But representatives of Gloag maintained no payments had been forthcoming. Information on Levene was passed to the police by representatives of Gloag. &quot;A number of people including Ms Gloag have decided to fire the starting gun,&quot; said a person familiar with the situation. In a statement the Metropolitan police said: &quot;Last week certain information was passed to the fraud squad. Detectives are now assessing the matter to determine what action if any is necessary. At this time no decision has yet been reached whether an inquiry should be conducted.&quot; Lawyers for Levene refused to comment."}, {"sentences": ["He said he had some Russian clients coming over and he wanted them to sign a multimillion-pound deal.&quot; She added that when she worked in the Tokyo office of the same company, her London-based colleagues would often bring British colleagues over to Japan for &quot;sex trips&quot;, where they would tell the company they were introducing clients to Japanese firms, but were actually visiting a number of seedy sex clubs."], "tags": ["Banking", "Prostitution", "Equality", "Gender", "Politics", "Society", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-14T20:20:31Z", "title": "City bankers 'regularly offer prostitutes to clients'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/14/banking-prostitution", "article": "City bankers entertain clients and try to generate business by offering trips to brothels, MPs heard today. Kat Banyard of gender-equality pressure group the Fawcett Society told a Treasury select committee hearing into women&apos;s role in the City of London that there was a growing trend in the City to use prostitution to entertain clients. &quot;We took extensive evidence from individual women who said it was becoming frequent for meetings to be held in lap dance clubs, and I also had women speak to me and say that prostitution was being used in client deals or in ways to generate business \u2013 and that all of this culture created a very hostile environment, as you would expect, for female employees of those firms,&quot; she said. One former City worker who gave evidence to the Fawcett Society said that while working for a top international investment bank in the City, she witnessed a senior manager looking for a brothel to entertain some Russian clients. &quot;I was out drinking with some guys in my team when a very senior guy came over,&quot; she said. &quot;He asked if anyone knew of a good brothel in Edinburgh. He said he had some Russian clients coming over and he wanted them to sign a multimillion-pound deal.&quot; She added that when she worked in the Tokyo office of the same company, her London-based colleagues would often bring British colleagues over to Japan for &quot;sex trips&quot;, where they would tell the company they were introducing clients to Japanese firms, but were actually visiting a number of seedy sex clubs. &quot;It&apos;s a deeply troubling problem that needs to be discussed openly,&quot; Banyard said. &quot;If we&apos;re going to get more women into those institutions we need to change the culture before that happens.&quot; The committee launched the investigation into women&apos;s role in the City as part of its attempt to prevent another crisis. There will be two more hearings, during which more evidence will be taken from people such as Harriet Harman, the minister for women and equality, and Trevor Phillips, the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. But the select committee inquiry itself raised a few eyebrows on its launch in July as it emerged that only one of its 14 members would be a woman. Former Bank of England policymaker Charles Goodhart, who is now professor emeritus of banking and finance at the London School of Economics, told the committee that the worst financial crisis since the second world war could have been prevented if more women were on the boards of major companies. &quot;Women tend to be more cautious and have a longer term outlook. I think that men can be more aggressive and prepared to take larger risks,&quot; he said. &quot;There would have been less likelihood of the financial crisis if we had a larger number of female chief executives in the financial sector.&quot; He said that there were &quot;remarkably few&quot; female chief executives in the financial sector and that it is &quot;a great pity&quot;. &quot;I think that the longer term and cautious tendency that women have and less of the alpha male would be beneficial.&quot; Nichola Pease, who runs the fund manager JO Hambro, told the committee that equality legislation in Britain was preventing women from getting the top jobs in the City. She said that many firms were scared of hiring women because penalties for successful sex discrimination claims were unlimited. Another factor that put companies off employing women was that women in the UK could take up to 52 weeks of maternity leave, compared with just 12 weeks in the US. &quot;A year&apos;s maternity leave is too long, and sex discrimination claims that run into 10s of millions of pounds are ridiculous,&quot; she told the committee."}, {"sentences": ["Symbols to denote each sport, and to be used on signs and as marketing tools, were first used at the last London Olympics in 1948 and have been a regular feature of the games since Tokyo in 1964."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Lord Coe", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-16T15:06:28Z", "title": "London 2012 organisers unveil 38 pictograms to engage British public", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/oct/16/london-2012-pictograms-olympic-sports", "article": "They may be nothing more than a collection of stick men in various athletic poses, but London 2012 organisers said that the 38 official pictograms unveiled today were a key staging post in their attempts to engage the British public with every Olympic sport.

The 38 unveiled yesterday, representing the 26 Olympic sports and attendant disciplines, would be used on merchandise, posters, signposts and &quot;wayfinding materials&quot; during London 2012.

The pictograms designed for the 1972 Games in Munich became design classics and became familiar far beyond the context of the Olympics. London 2012&apos;s domestic sponsors Adidas will produce limited edition T-shirts for each sport and the advertising agency McCann Eriksson, which was named as a tier-three sponsor earlier this year in return for supplying marketing services on an in-kind basis, will begin work with them as part of a wider marketing plan. Denis Oswald, the IOC co-ordination commission chairman who is responsible for tracking London&apos;s progress, said: &quot;The pictograms of an Olympic Games are a unique link between the host city and the sports involved. The Olympic summer sports are delighted by these designs and I hope that they will not just help people to find their way to the events but will also encourage young people to try out different Olympic sports as we head towards 2012.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Anyway, my holiday&apos;s now totally been ruined before it&apos;s even started, by Charley Boorman: Sydney to Tokyo by Any Means (BBC2, Sunday)."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-18T23:07:46Z", "title": "Charley Boorman: Sydney to Tokyo By Any Means | Bear Grylls and Will Ferrell: Born Survivors | TV Review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/19/charley-boorman-bear-grylls-ferrell", "article": "I&apos;m a bit cross.

Or, when that doesn&apos;t happen, taking the bus or a plane like everyone else. It&apos;s all so very uninteresting.

And for their holiday, they&apos;ve gone to Sweden. It&apos;s more of a mini-break really, just a couple of days somewhere quite north and cold. And obviously they have to arrive by rapelling out of a helicopter. Then Bear scampers off to collect sticks for tinder or something, while Will wolfs down their emergency Twinkie. And that&apos;s how it goes on. Bear does the ridiculous stuff, the abseiling, the fires and the shelters. He constructs snowshoes out of birch twigs, climbs a tree to see where they are, finds food (very convenient, that deer&apos;s head, almost suspiciously so \u2013 or maybe they&apos;re just lying around all over the place in northern Sweden). And Will does the jokes: he&apos;s going to become a snowshoe cobbler if the movie thing doesn&apos;t work out, he says; will Bear give him the sign when it&apos;s time to drink their own urine?; oddly enough it was a boyhood dream of his to roast a deer&apos;s head on a fire, so thankyou Bear; all delivered in a beautifully deadpan way. He slips over, falls in the snow, loses his own penis, then suddenly and unexpectedly rugby tackles Bear to the ground. &quot;I hate that man,&quot; he says. &quot;Yeah, no one likes him, I can tell.&quot; (You may think you&apos;re joking, Will.) Anyway, it&apos;s very funny. And this is by far the most entertaining Bear Grylls show I&apos;ve ever seen. Bear himself actually becomes more likable. He even has a stab at humour himself. &quot;I think the low point for me was having Will mistake me for his wife in the middle of the night,&quot; he says.

The X Factor had a quarter hour peak of 13.7 million viewers, a 49% share, between 8pm and 8.15pm. ITV said last night&apos;s show had its biggest peak audience ever, with a five-minute peak of 14.8 million viewers eclipsing the 14.6 million who saw Alexandra Burke win last year&apos;s grand final. Rikki Loney was voted off last night&apos;s edition of the talent show after losing a sing-off with Rachel Adedeji. The talent show, which featured performances by Whitney Houston and judge Cheryl Cole, was up against BBC1&apos;s Casualty, which had a rare one-off Sunday outing to make way for the Brazilian grand prix qualifying rounds on Saturday. BBC1&apos;s hospital drama had 4.4 million viewers, 16% of the audience, between 8.10pm and 9pm, fewer than it normally gets in its regular Saturday slot. The network&apos;s costume drama Emma had 3.3 million viewers, 13% of the audience, between 9pm and 10pm, down on 3.5 million last week and 4.4 million for its opening episode two weeks ago. The final episode airs on Sunday. Emma managed just over a third of the 9 million who saw ITV1&apos;s Martin Clunes drama, Doc Martin. Helped by a big inheritance from The X Factor, Doc Martin had a 35% share of the audience. Channel 4 movie premiere The Last King of Scotland, starring Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy, had 1.3 million viewers, 7% of the audience, between 9pm and 11.30pm. Another 98,000 saw The Last King of Scotland on Channel 4 +1. The movie was up against BBC2&apos;s Charley Boorman: Sydney to Tokyo by Any Means, which had 2 million viewers, an 8% share at 9pml; and Match of the Day 2, which had 2.1 million viewers, 12% of the audience, between 10pm and 10.50pm. But the Channel 4 film beat rival movie offering Spiderman on Channel Five, which had 1.1 million viewers, a 4% share, between 7.40pm and 10pm. BBC2&apos;s Stephen Fry documentary series Last Chance To See finished its six-part run with 3 million viewers, a 10% share, between 8pm and 9pm. Last Chance to See was down just 100,000 viewers on its debut five weeks ago. Over on Channel 4, Come Dine With Me had 1.3 million viewers, 5% of the audience, with another 361,000 viewers on Channel 4 +1. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The Irish sculptor Edward Delaney, who has died aged 79, is best known for his two major public monuments in Dublin, the Thomas Davis and Wolfe Tone memorials, which were unveiled in 1966 and 1967 respectively. When the figure of Wolfe Tone, weighing three-quarters of a tonne, was placed in St Stephen&apos;s Green, there were complaints that it was too big. He rejected them out of hand: &quot;Tone figured life-size in a park setting would look like a leprechaun.&quot; Asked what the four famine figures flanking the fountain at the rear of the memorial had to do with Tone, he replied that the failure of the French-backed 1798 rebellion presaged the disaster of the late 1840s. &quot;I would like to have depicted him in French uniform, plumed hat and victorious sword. But history decided otherwise.&quot; The Davis memorial, opposite the gates of Trinity College, also attracted unfavourable comment, and was dismissed by one critic as &quot;an elephantine-footed&quot; monster. Delaney retorted: &quot;Truth lies in proportions, not in size.&quot; In 1971, the memorial was blown up and had to be reconstructed by the artist when only the head survived. Described as direct to the point of brazen, Delaney cultivated the image of the &quot;angry man of sculpture,&quot; as one newspaper portrayed him. He lambasted collectors who did not buy his work and was scathing in his criticism of some public art. The Irish public, in his view, had little understanding of sculpture: &quot;They think you are codding them, so if I get the chance to throw sculpture at them, I do it with style.&quot; He grew up in Farmhill, Crossboyne, Co Mayo. By his account, his forefathers, the De Laniers, were French stonemasons who came to Mayo in the mid-19th century. He recalled growing up &quot;surrounded by stone fireplaces made by my grandfather&quot;. But his father chose to be a farmer. Delaney left school at 14, to work as an assistant in a hardware shop. Wanting more out of life, he headed for Dublin. There, he &quot;infiltrated&quot; the National College of Art, attending classes without ever enrolling. He was drawn to sculpture after reading an article about the German sculptor Josef Wackerle and used bursaries from the West German and Italian governments to travel. His aim was to learn the art of lost-wax bronze casting, an exceptionally faithful method of casting that allows for fine detail. His quest led him to study in Rome and Munich, after which he worked in seven different foundries in Germany and northern France. He got to work with sculptors such as Toni Stadler and Giacomo Manz\u00f9, whom he considered &quot;the greatest sculptor in Christendom&quot;, and came to identify with the postwar tradition of European figurative sculpture. Other artists who influenced him were Marino Marini and Emilio Greco. His return to Ireland in the early 1960s coincided with an expanding art market, a consequence of economic growth and cultural change. Reflecting the optimism of the times, he established his studio in D\u00fan Laoghaire along with a foundry capable of casting monumental sculpture. Until then, such work had been cast only in London, Paris or Milan. He regularly exhibited in Dublin, showing lithographs as well as small bronzes. He also designed album covers for the Chieftains and illustrated Wolf Mankowitz&apos;s play The Samson Riddle. In the mid-1970s he built a studio in Carraroe, Co Galway, moving there permanently in 1980 to live and work on a 21-acre farm. He grew vegetables, but devoted most of his efforts to developing an outdoor sculpture park. The bronze figures of humans and animals that first dotted the landscape were in time joined by pieces in pressed steel. He represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale in 1959 and 1961, and exhibited his work in Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Budapest. He complained that London did not welcome Irish artists. Represented in many private and corporate collections, he created an altar piece for St Michael the Archangel church in Ballinasloe, Co Galway, and work for Our Lady&apos;s hospital in Drogheda, Co Louth. His six-metre-high steel sculpture Celtic Twilight is situated on the campus of University College Dublin. His bronze statue Eve With Apple was recently donated by a private collector to the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The piece was inspired by the artist&apos;s years in Germany and the postwar poverty he witnessed there. His reputation may ultimately rest on his small-scale work \u2013 animal and human figures, as well as more abstract creations. Of this work the critic Anthony Butler wrote: &quot;Place these small sculptures on some Atlantic headland, letting the wind whistle through their complex spaces and cupping the rain on their raw texture, and they would be as natural as the limestone cliffs of Aran.&quot; He is survived by two daughters, five sons, his wife Nancy (nee O&apos;Brien), whom he married in 1960 and from whom he later separated, and his subsequent partner, Anne Gillan. \u2022 Edward Delaney, sculptor, born 1 August 1930; died 22 September 2009"}, {"sentences": ["A controversial documentary about Japan&apos;s annual dolphin slaughter is due to be screened in Tokyo tomorrow, despite last-ditch attempts by hunters to have it banned.", "The Cove, an award-winning movie directed by Louie Psihoyos, is the highlight of the Tokyo international film festival, whose organisers belatedly included it in the schedule only after pressure from Hollywood actors such as Ben Stiller.", "Advance tickets for the screening in central Tokyo have sold out, according to organisers, who have made ecology the theme of this year&apos;s festival."], "tags": ["Japan", "Marine life", "Fishing", "Environment", "Film", "World news", "Documentary", "Festivals", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-20T13:16:07Z", "title": "Tokyo festival to screen Japanese dolphin slaughter film", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/20/dolphin-slaughter-film-tokyo-festival", "article": "A controversial documentary about Japan&apos;s annual dolphin slaughter is due to be screened in Tokyo tomorrow, despite last-ditch attempts by hunters to have it banned. The Cove, an award-winning movie directed by Louie Psihoyos, is the highlight of the Tokyo international film festival, whose organisers belatedly included it in the schedule only after pressure from Hollywood actors such as Ben Stiller. Fishermen in Taiji, the town featured in the film, have been in &quot;continuous contact&quot; with the Japanese government in an attempt to get the screening cancelled, the Guardian has learned. In a letter sent to the foreign ministry, Taiji council and the town&apos;s fisheries co-operative claimed the &quot;defamatory&quot; film had failed to present scientific evidence to support its claim that dolphins contain dangerously high levels of mercury. They denied dolphin meat was deliberately being mislabelled and sold as whale meat, and said the Cove had been filmed without permission, describing it as an &quot;insult&quot; to the town&apos;s 400-year history of dolphin hunting. &quot;We passed on the fishermen&apos;s concerns to the film festival&apos;s organisers, but it is up to them whether or not they show the film, as it&apos;s a private event,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman said. &quot;Please remember that only a very small number of Japanese people catch and eat dolphins.&quot;           The makers of the documentary used expert divers and hi-tech gadgets to film the slaughter of bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales. Advance tickets for the screening in central Tokyo have sold out, according to organisers, who have made ecology the theme of this year&apos;s festival. It may be the only chance many Japanese get to see the film, as there are no plans to put it on general release. Psihoyos faces arrest for alleged trespass during the making of the film, but he argues the cove is located in a national park. He has offered to show the film free of charge in Taiji. Organisers were hopeful the screening would pass off without incident, although sources involved in promoting the film in Japan said they could not rule out disruption by extreme right-wing organisations. Last week the foreign minister, Katsuya Okada, urged the dolphin hunt&apos;s critics to respect Japan&apos;s culinary traditions. &quot;People in different countries eat all kinds of things, depending on their culture,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;I&apos;d like people to understand that cultures are diverse.&quot; The documentary appears to have had an impact in Taiji, a picturesque town on Japan&apos;s Pacific coast. Its fishermen have not killed any bottlenose dolphins since the current season began last month, although they have slaughtered dozens of pilot whales, which are members of the dolphin family. They have also captured several bottlenoses, which are sold to sea parks and aquariums for as much as $15,000 (\u00a39,000) each. The freeze on the bottlenose cull recently led councillors in Broome, Australia, to reverse an earlier decision to end its sister-city relations with Taiji for as long as the hunts continued. Despite their denials that dolphin meat is contaminated, officials in Taiji confirmed last week they had started testing hair strands taken from residents for evidence of possible mercury poisoning. The voluntary tests began in June and will be offered free of charge to the town&apos;s 3,500 residents until next March."}, {"sentences": ["E3, the Tokyo Game Show, the GamesCom convention... all out of reach to most of us."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Events", "Game culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-21T12:22:33Z", "title": "Five unmissable videogame events", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/oct/21/games-events", "article": "For much of the year British gamers are forced to look on forlornly as the big industry events take place elsewhere. E3, the Tokyo Game Show, the GamesCom convention... all out of reach to most of us.  But this autumn sees an influx of UK-based happenings, from major festivals to one-off lectures. I&apos;ve jammed five real treats together here - all of them open to the public and well worth braving the chilly weather - and possibly a cheap hotel or two - for. And it all starts tonight...BAFTA Annual Videogame Lecture - Peter MolyneuxWhen: tonight, 18.30Where: Princess Anne Theatre, BAFTA What&apos;s going on? The creator of Populous, Theme Park, Magic Carpet and Dungeon Keeper, and co-creator of the Fable games will be providing this year&apos;s BAFTA videogame lecture. He&apos;s always got something interesting and provocative to say about the state of videogaming and may well provide some more details about Lionhead&apos;s Mylo project for the Xbox 360 Natal. This event is co-sponsored by the Guardian and Gamesblog&apos;s Greg Howson will be there to cover it.  Inaugural Lecture by William Latham: Computer Art, Games and BusinessWhen: October 27Where: Ian Gulland Lecture Theatre, Goldsmiths, University of London What&apos;s going on? Now a professor at Goldsmiths college, Latham is a real pioneer in computer art and graphics, starting out as a research fellow at IBM before setting up his studio, Computer Artworks and creating the astonishing Organic Art project. He later went into game development, overseeing the intriguing Evolva, and the excellent PlayStation tie-in with John Carpenter&apos;s sci-fi horror, The Thing. He&apos;s a fascinating talker, and the way he formulated his ideas for a procedurally generated artform in which shapes and simple lifeforms mutate as you watch, is rather mindblowing. Also, it&apos;s free and you get to play some of his games and art projects afterwards. You&apos;ll need to e-mail inaugurals at gold.ac.uk or telephone 020 7919 7033 if you&apos;d like to attend. GameCity SquaredWhen: October 27-31Where: Nottingham city centre, various venues What&apos;s going on? GameCity is Gamesblog&apos;s favourite videogame festival, a glorious grab-bag of talks, challenges, interactive sessions and curries. Access to genuine stars of the games industry is unparalleled - if you&apos;d have attended last year&apos;s Guardian Gamesblog curry quiz night you would have been competing against two guys from Harmonix and the creators of LittleBigPlanet... This year&apos;s event promises masses of fascinating stuff. Highlights for me include the IndieVillage, showcasing the best new independent game projects in association with IndieCade; Crysis Live, in which the city&apos;s market square will be transformed into a live interactive version of the hit first-person shooter; and &apos;Night Blooms&apos; a performance of ThatGameCompany&apos;s Flower game. There&apos;s also a potentially explosive curry session (pun sort of intended) on the perils of file-sharing, featuring Phillip Oliver, CEO of Blitz Games, Cliff Harris, CEO of Positech Games and Feargal Sharkey, CEO of UK Music. London Games FestivalWhen: October 24 - November 1Where: various venues around the capital What&apos;s going on? Now into its fourth year the festival has evolved into a collection of disparate and interesting events, mixing consumer demo-fests with high brow lectures. At the heart of it all is the lively Eurogamer Expo, where you&apos;ll be able to sample all of this winter&apos;s prime releases. There&apos;s also the London MCM expo at the Excel centre out in the Docklands, showcasing games, movies and manga to the general public. Gamesblog readers may also be interested in &apos;Emergent Design for Playful Engagement&apos;, a symposium concerning, &apos;new art and design methodologies and communities of practice that firmly put the user at the heart of the action.&apos; There are more details at the official site. Space Invaders: Art in the Computer Game EnvironmentWhen: December 17 - February 21Where: FACT, Liverpool What&apos;s going on? Exploring the collapsing boundaries between realworld and videogame spaces, this is a major group exhibition by some of the key digital artists on the planet. Famed video art pioneer Bill Viola will be presenting his first ever videogame project, while young Chinese artist Cao Fei is exhibiting his film COSplayers about local kids who dress up as game characters and enact favourite sequences. Augmented reality specialists Blast Theory will also be there with a bizarre ARG named Rider Spoke which involves playing hide and seek on bicycles.  I also like the sound of Riley Harmon&apos;s sculpture, What It Is Without the Hand That Wields: &quot;Hooked up to a modified version of the popular online first person shooter game Counterstrike, the sculpture responds to the player&apos;s online deaths by dispensing a small amount of fake blood from valves down the wall, creating a compelling physical manifestation of virtual kills.&quot; Throughout the event a selection of playable games will also be available, taking in a wide spectrum from Flower to Grand Theft Auto.

The change has been confined to niche activities, even though some \u2013 such as World of Warcraft or Second Life \u2013 are big niches. Now there is a worldwide move to bring the 3D web to a mass market, led by the building of &quot;virtual&quot; cities where avatars can walk, shop, club or whatever with links to &quot;real life&quot; activities. From Tokyo to Helsinki and from Paris to Philadelphia, cities are being constructed at a pace that recalls 19th-century railway mania; except, mercifully, it is a lot cheaper and won&apos;t have serious economic effects if there is a crash. People who haven&apos;t tried them can&apos;t take virtual worlds seriously but in key ways they are more &quot;real&quot; and communal than real life: it is much easier to speak to people in shops or galleries, since normal social inhibitions are absent. There has been a virtual central London in Second Life for three years offering clubs, shops, galleries and other distractions. This year it featured a Chelsea Flower Show and an arts and film festival including a spoof James Bond film. It is moving into education, corporate building and high-end fashion linked to sales in real life. Debs Regent (her Second Life name), who runs it, claims that it is gaining 2,000 users a week and is breaking even. \u00a0It now faces fresh competition from two new virtual Londons with contrasting business plans due to open in the next month or two. One is run by the German-owned Twinity, which already has a virtual Berlin (where I have an apartment) and a Singapore. It will focus initially on the community and enthusiasts \u2013 invited via a Facebook group \u2013 while also exploring commercial opportunities such as leasing Oxford Street shops to their real-life owners. The other new London, run by Alex Wrottesley, co-founder of Near, has an initial plan to harness what drives most people to the West End: shopping. His London is a faithful laser-mapped reproduction of buildings with blobs of light instead of avatars. The idea is that people will roam streets and if they like something in a window they can click and be taken to that company&apos;s website with Near taking a share of any sales. He claims to have signed up dozens of brands, including American Apparel, and says that as a result of subscriptions from corporate subscribers it will be making a monthly profit next month. Promotions include 50,000 DVDs being circulated via the Evening Standard. It is also using Facebook for recruitment and is in effect a Facebook application. The message is: why take a crowded tube to an overcrowded city centre when you can do it from home? These three are not the only virtual Londons. University College has built a 3D grid stretching as far as the M25, while the likes of Google and Microsoft are recreating cities all over the world, enabling others to do mash-ups by superimposing their own data on them. Google recently released its Building Maker, a simple way to capture a building shape in Google Earth for placement elsewhere. So far it has Cardiff but not London. Other versions of cities are being built for private clients. All the London builders welcome competition, if only because it gets more people used to the idea. All realise that the barriers between virtual worlds and social networks such as Facebook are falling fast. Some functions of virtual worlds such as chat could be done on a mobile, while people on networks might want to slip into virtual Oxford Street to shop. I am as sure of virtual worlds becoming a mass phenomenon as I am unsure which formats will prove successful. Twinity scores high on use of live media (websites, weather updates etc) but is not yet easy to access (though like Near it has yet to go public). Near is the most focused and Debs Regent&apos;s the most communal and longest established. It may be that there is room for lots of them.

According to the Tokyo-based market analysts Yano Research Institute, sales of language-related products and services fell by 5.2% in 2008 to $8.5bn. English-language schools have been hit hardest, with many operators blaming the sluggish economy and the fallout from the Nova Corp bankruptcy. The image of English tuition providers was tarnished when the nationwide Nova chain filed for bankruptcy in 2007. The language schools market dropped by 5.6% overall in 2008 with sales of adult courses dropping by over 9%, Yano reported. Susumu Ikegami, a spokesman for Geos Corp, one of Japan&apos;s leading English-language course providers, told the Japan Times that the market&apos;s downward trend -began about five years ago but that the Nova closure was a factor. &quot;Nova, which was the largest language school, caused distrust among the public,&quot; Ikegami said. More confidence in the ELT sector can be found in the Philippines, where statistics indicate that the numbers of Korean learners arriving for English-language courses is rising strongly. According to Philippines immigration department figures quoted by the Korea Times, the number of short-term student visas issued to Koreans increased from 6,000 in 2004 to close to 30,000 in 2008, with many learners attracted by low-cost English language programmes. India strengthens teacher training ties with Sri LankaIndia will set up a branch of its English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) in Sri Lanka to develop the skills of English-language teachers and coordinate education development policies -under an agreement signed by the two countries last month. According to Sri Lanka&apos;s presidential secretariat, the new centre will be located in Peradeniya, central Sri Lanka, and will be staffed by trainers from the EFLU campus in Hyderabad, central India, who specialise in teaching spoken English. The move is the latest push by Sri Lanka&apos;s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, to develop his country&apos;s English-language skills with India&apos;s help. So far this year the Indian government has sponsored EFLU to introduce a cascade training scheme in schools. Forty local -teachers, known as master trainers, have received special training to pass on classroom skills to colleagues. A further 40 master trainers are enrolled on a three-month course at EFLU in Hyderabad and will graduate next December. Internet teaching provider outgrows &apos;one-horse&apos; townEleutian Technology, the burgeoning provider of online language teaching based in rural Wyoming, is in danger of outgrowing its home town of Ten Sleep, which has a population of 300. Eleuton, which has established a successful network of US-based English-language instructors providing lessons via internet video conferencing to students in South Korea and teaching up to 14,000 hours a month, has applied to increase the size of its offices near the town. The company&apos;s application to build a 3,000-square-metre facility has received initial approval but residents are concerned about the impact that the bigger facility will have on the local community. Eleuton&apos;s founder Kent Holiday urged locals to back the expansion. &quot;Everything is always changing,&quot; Holiday said. &quot;You&apos;re either growing or your dying.

Let&apos;s just run through it one more time: the All Black coaching panel have opted to switch jobs for their forthcoming tour with Graham Henry taking charge of the forwards, Steve Hansen assuming control of attacking strategy and Wayne Smith slipping into the role of defence coach. At first glance, it looks suspiciously like the sort of ministerial reshuffle employed by governments keen to convince a jaundiced electorate they still have something new to offer. What&apos;s the story? The cynical view is that Henry fears a tough autumn and can now hide behind the cloak of experimentation if things go pear-shaped. Surely not. Henry, above all else, is a smart, shrewd competitor who loves nothing better than disproving those who underestimate him. As an experienced schoolteacher he is also aware of the benefits of a fresh voice every now and again. It has been a long, tough year and even coaches grow weary of the sound of their own voices. There is a certain logic in some other respects. Who better than Smith, one of the great backs coaches, to explain how best to frustrate a three-quarter line? Hansen, who has been copping a bit of stick following New Zealand&apos;s lineout problems in the Tri-Nations, could do with a new portfolio at this difficult time. And Henry? Let&apos;s just say it might suit him if rival coaches were to assume he has lost the plot. In the end, though, it still feels like a quietly desperate measure. It has all the hallmarks of one of those reality TV programmes, Wife Swap comes to mind, which invariably end in a messy slanging match. If the forwards improve dramatically, what does that say about Hansen? If the defence remains solid but the tries dry up, how satisfied will Smith feel deep down? And who is truly accountable if the ABs lose a couple of Tests? The players are entitled to wonder precisely where they stand. Which brings us on to the minimum requirement for this particular New Zealand squad less than two years away from a World Cup. It is entirely possible, if not probable, that New Zealand could lose four of their six matches on tour. Australia in Tokyo next week is something of an unknown quantity for both teams and Wales in Cardiff will not be easy, particularly if Warren Gatland scents uncertainty in his compatriots&apos; ranks. It would help if Gatland had Lee Byrne, Mike Phillips or Adam Jones available but there remain some promising players in his squad. Wales will fancy their chances, no question. Even the Italy Test is an unusual assignment, the decision having been taken to stage the game in the San Siro stadium in Milan. The Azzurri, if nothing else, will be desperate to impress. Then follow England and France in successive weeks, by which point the minds of one or two senior players may be drifting towards the beach. When you remember that Martin Johnson and Marc Li\u00e8vremont are both under some pressure to deliver a morale-boosting, agenda-setting win \u2013 regardless of injuries \u2013 the tour schedule suddenly takes on a darker hue. There is also one last hurrah against the Barbarians at Twickenham. Could this finally be the year the All Blacks lose their aura of invincibility in Europe? If the answer to that question is &apos;yes&apos;, Henry has a problem which all the job-sharing in the world will not solve. The Lions tour indicated that rugby in Ireland and Wales is healthy enough and England are due to come good after five years of navel-gazing. France, potentially at least, could be the toughest assignment of them all. They lose rarely in Marseille and Li\u00e8vremont is much closer these days to identifying his best XV. They have already beaten the Blacks once this year and their top clubs have made a positive start to the Heineken Cup. Much can change \u2013 and will \u2013 over the next six weeks but I suspect Henry will be privately content if he returns home with four wins from six outings. Anything worse and his crafty reshuffle will be deemed an abject failure. Pass masters Sometimes we spend too much time being critical. It can be easy to focus on the missed tackle when the try was actually created by clever decoy running or a perfectly judged offload. Passing, in particular, is an underrated skill which people tend to notice only when a mistake is made. Nick Evans threw the most sublime blind inside ball against Toulouse last weekend, relying on David Strettle to read his intentions. It could have gone badly wrong but when it goes to hand there is no better sight in the game. Whose try-line is it anyway? It has been a slightly surreal week already. On Monday night a few curious journos could be found at a trendy central London venue limbering up for the Investec autumn Tests with a night of improvised comedy in the company of Nick Easter, Lee Mears and Doddie Weir. You probably had to be there but it will be a while before I erase the memories of Weir&apos;s tartan suit and Easter&apos;s on-stage demand that I remove my trousers to salvage our sagging double act.

So far, so predictable \u2013 the surprise came when the split didn&apos;t happen. The group enjoyed further hit albums and critical adoration. And Cheryl Tweedy is now Cheryl Cole, tearful nice-cop of Saturday evening TV and \u2013 since the kiss-and-tell stories involving husband Ashley \u2013 Britain&apos;s favourite wronged woman. The shift in the media&apos;s presentation of Cole has been remarkable. From a Geordie brawler and apprentice Posh Spice she has turned into a beloved young star, forever &quot;in torment&quot; on weekly magazine covers but still able to tap limitless reserves of empathy. &quot;In these times of doom and gloom,&quot; the editor of Grazia said last year, &quot;all we want is a hug from Cheryl.&quot; Few need that hug more than record industry executives, and the Dianafication of Cole means this debut album is the most high-profile pop record of 2009 \u2013 flop-proof in a way girl-group solo records rarely are. Lead single Fight for This Love \u2013 set to be the fastest-selling single of the year \u2013 bears this out. Initially it&apos;s underwhelming: hollow drum sounds and a shuddering keyboard create a subdued backdrop for Cole&apos;s flinty vocal. But it has two big commercial advantages. First of all, it&apos;s deceptively catchy. Second, people can easily imagine it&apos;s about Ashley Cole. Cheryl Cole&apos;s public profile is based on her playing heroine to two pantomime villains. Often the moustache-twirling rogue is Simon Cowell, and the nation applauds; the rest of the time it&apos;s her own husband. Certainly, 3 Words is being presented as a response to those experiences. For watchers of &quot;tormented Cheryl&quot;, there&apos;s plenty more doggedness on offer, besides the single. &quot;We argue a lot no matter what we do,&quot; she hisses on Make Me Cry, adding: &quot;Careful what you&apos;re saying &apos;cos I&apos;m trying to stay with you.&quot; On Rain On Me she snarls:&quot;I won&apos;t run \u2026 &apos;cos if you think I&apos;m weak then that makes you strong.&quot; At times like those, 3 Words seems a co-dependents&apos; manifesto: on the jaunty Happy Hour the metaphor for a relationship is that classic romantic standby, alcohol addiction. But whether you care about her marriage or not, all this anxiety and defiance makes for a low-key, shadowy kind of pop record, whose best songs rarely take immediate hold. Its most upbeat moments are its weakest: Will.I.Am and Cheryl lumbering on to the disco floor on Heaven, and the tinny electropop of Taio Cruz&apos;s contribution, Stand Up. Elsewhere the main sound on 3 Words is R&amp;B, with any rhythmic trickery stripped out. When it works, as on Parachute, you end up with an austere take on modern pop that gives Cole&apos;s voice the space it needs. When it doesn&apos;t, songs such as Don&apos;t Talk About This Love just end up sounding a bit cheap. Confirmation that this is a recession-era pop album comes with the make-do-and-mend inclusion of Heartbreaker, Will.I.Am&apos;s solo hit from last year, billed now as a Cole track despite her contribution amounting to 30 seconds of backing vocals. The album may disappoint Cole&apos;s oldest fans. At its best, Girls Aloud&apos;s work with the Xenomania production team was smart, inventive and delightful. As a clean break with the Girls Aloud sound, 3 Words at first sounds like a throwback to the 90s, when acts like Louise Redknapp would put us to sleep with their unshakeably nice R&amp;B lite. Parts of this album never pass beyond conservative pleasantries. But the shift in sound was still necessary. The typical Xenomania production sound, as heard this autumn on Mini Viva&apos;s I Left My Heart in Tokyo, is too busy and shrill for Cole&apos;s voice to carry alone. She&apos;s not as full a singer as the belters and divas she presides over each week, but she&apos;s an expressive performer and a less showy backing lets that come through. Her showcase is the album&apos;s title track, built on dark loops of treated acoustic guitar and building into a claustrophobic dance track. It&apos;s as brave and novel a song as anything Cole&apos;s group have released, and shows how good she can be given a more imaginative setting. Most of 3 Words doesn&apos;t provide that: it&apos;s ultimately too tentative and slight to be more than a footnote in Cheryl Cole&apos;s unstoppable celebrity story."}, {"sentences": ["The franchise was soon extended across the world \u2013 with outlets in Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester and Rotterdam \u2013 but eventually folded, its founders moving on to other projects."], "tags": ["Internet", "Technology", "Digital media", "Media", "Email", "Tim Berners-Lee", "Search engines", "Blogging", "eBay", "Wikipedia", "YouTube", "Social networking"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-23T07:00:05Z", "title": "From the first email to the first YouTube video: a definitive internet history", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-history", "article": "The first email In late 1971 Ray Tomlinson, an engineer working on a time-sharing system called Tenex, combined two programs named Cpynet and SNDMSG in order to send the first ever network email. It had been possible to send email from one user to another on a single computer for nearly 10 years but Tomlinson was the first to use the primitive Arpanet to send text from one computer to another. While the same principles are used to send emails across the world today, the very first email (the contents of which Tomlinson says he has long forgotten) was sent between two computers sitting right next to each other. At the same time, Tomlinson also devised the format of modern emails, with the @ symbol dividing the user name from the name of the host computer (although he did not invent the symbol itsel). And why did he do it? &quot;Mostly because it seemed like a neat idea.&quot; The first virus Computer viruses and worms, essentially just self-replicating programs, were predicted as early as 1949 by the mathematician John von Neumann. It is generally accepted that the first was a virus called the Creeper, which infected Arpanet in 1971. It was created by an engineer called Bob Thomas working for BBN, the same company that employed email creator Ray Tomlinson. The Creeper was not, however, malicious. Infected machines would simply display the message, &quot;I&apos;m the creeper: catch me if you can,&quot; but did not suffer any lasting damage. The first piece of anti-virus software was created as a direct response to the Creeper&apos;s challenge. The Reaper was also a self-replicating program, which spread through the system in much the same way that the Creeper had, and removed the offending virus from infected computers. Just as quickly as it had spread, the Creeper was caught. The first online community     Larry Brilliant, co-creator of the first online community Photograph: New York Times    In 1981, while working for the WHO, Dr Larry Brilliant (below) created a primitive online conferencing system. Its original purpose was to organise the rescue of a helicopter downed on a humanitarian mission in Nepal. On his return to America, Brilliant showed his system to Apple founder Steve Jobs and, on his advice, launched a modified version of the software that would run on people&apos;s home computers. The next step was to develop a permanent text conferencing system \u2013 what we now know as an internet forum. The first example, known as the Well , began with a meeting between Brilliant and Stewart Brand, then editor of the Whole Earth Catalog , an early green-living manual. Brilliant pitched Brand an idea: he would use a version of the software to create a discussion forum for the items in the catalogue. &quot;But Stewart had the good sense to ignore my idea and instead he just opened it up for discussions of any kind,&quot; Brilliant recalls. &quot;It was the best discussion \u2013 of the meaning of life, sexual practices, travel advice, love, law; everything you find on the internet today except the commercialism.&quot; Brilliant adds: &quot;About 99.9% of what made the well great was Stewart&apos;s ideas of what could be talked about and his uncanny ability to bring online the smartest people of the day \u2013 senators, governors, campaigners and a whole lot of writers.&quot; The first smiley Professor Scott E Fahlman (below) worked at the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon in the early 1980s, at a time when it was making heavy use of online bulletin boards. Often someone would make a sarcastic remark and a few readers would fail to get the joke. At one point a humorous comment on the boards about a brainteaser involving mercury was interpreted as a safety warning, nearly causing the building to be evacuated. The group began devising some form of punctuation to mark posts that weren&apos;t to be taken seriously. It was Fahlman who suggested :-). &quot;I was probably not the first person ever to type these three letters in sequence, perhaps even with the meaning of &apos;I&apos;m just kidding&apos; and perhaps even online,&quot; Fahlman concedes. &quot;But I do believe that my 1982 suggestion was the one that finally took hold and spread around the world.&quot; The first multiplayer game Multiplayer games were developed inside the internet&apos;s first decade, paving the way for games such as Second Life that define much of internet culture today. Mud (which stands for Multi-User Dungeon) was the first text-based fantasy game, developed by programmers Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at Essex University in 1978, allowing players all over the world to interact. Arriving in &quot;the Land&quot; at a cottage next to a cemetery, new visitors could figure out the extent of their abilities, then explore, kill things and score points, with the ultimate goal of reaching the wizards&apos; level. Bartle admits that they weren&apos;t trying to be pioneering: &quot;We didn&apos;t know we were the first, we didn&apos;t know that there weren&apos;t hundreds of these games. It was the best way I could articulate what I wanted to say about the real world \u2013 by creating another world.&quot; The first search engine While studying for his master&apos;s degree at Montreal&apos;s McGill University in 1989, Alan Emtage, a young computer scientist, was also working as a systems administrator for the university. But he found rooting around online to locate software for the students to be a bit boring, so set about streamlining the process. He developed a set of scripts which would run automatically every evening to build a single, easily searchable database. Once word got out that Emtage could find pretty much anything on the internet, inquiries flooded in. Two of his colleagues, Mike Parker and Bill Heelan, were brought in to rewrite the system with him, and this version was named Archie. Emtage was suddenly at the heart of an online revolution. &quot;By 1991, that one machine in our office running Archie was using half the bandwidth of eastern Canada,&quot; he says. &quot;Our school of computer science director, Renato De Mori, was approached at a conference by one of his peers, who congratulated him on Archie and what a splendid job we were doing at McGill. We had never told the faculty about it so he had no idea what it was \u2013 but he smiled graciously and said thank you. When he got back to Montreal, he wanted to know what the hell the guy was talking about.&quot; And why name it Archie? Because of Archie comics? &quot;It was 100% not named after the comics! I hate those comics, I think they&apos;re the most insipid piece of writing ever. It was just &quot;archive&quot; without a V.&quot; The first browser Strictly speaking, the first web browser was Tim Berners-Lee&apos;s WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus so as to avoid confusion with the web itself. Berners-Lee created the program in 1991 while working at Cern, the European organisation for nuclear research. However, WorldWideWeb ran exclusively on the Nextstep platform, the early precursor to Apple&apos;s Mac OS X, and never reached a mass market. The first popular browser was Mosaic, which is generally credited with spreading the casual use of the web around the world. Created by University of Illinois students Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, it was first released for computers using the Unix operating system on 23 January 1993. It built on Berners-Lee&apos;s server by including support for graphics, sound and video clips. After its popularity boomed in the academic community, Andreessen and several fellow students marketed Mosaic commercially. It was a huge success, granting hundreds of thousands of people their first glimpse of the web. The first webcam The first webcam began operating in 1991, the same year as Tim Berners-Lee&apos;s World Wide Web, and had its origins in an even more important topic in computer science: the flow of caffeine around a research group. The group, based in Cambridge University&apos;s computer lab and led by Dr Quentin Stafford-Fraser, had a problem: the coffee machine was shared by others in more distant parts of the building. &quot;These poor souls would often arrive, mug in hand, to find no fresh coffee,&quot; explains Stafford-Fraser. &quot;So one afternoon, friends and I gripped an old camera in a retort stand and connected it to a spare computer, then wrote a program [known as XCoffee] that allowed anyone in our group to display a live image of the pot in the corner of their screen. &quot;When, in 1993, web browsers were first able to display images, my colleague Dan Gordon modified the software so that a browser could take the place of our program. As a side effect, the whole world could see the image. Millions did, and so the first webcam was born.&quot; Coffeecam finally shut down in 2001, when the computer science department moved to a new building. The first blog The first blogger may never be identified for sure, but the most likely candidate is American freelance journalist Justin Hall, who began blogging (not that the term then existed) in 1994 with a website called Justin&apos;s Links From The Underground. Hall was online early enough to get first dibs on the coveted www.links.net URL, and his website began as a sort of guided tour of the internet. It wasn&apos;t long, however, before Hall&apos;s personal life became the principal topic. Hall wrote candidly about his relationships, passions, plans and fears, sharing just about everything with his loyal readership. At one point he took a road trip across America, updating readers along the way. As for the terms, &quot;weblog&quot; was coined by the Jorn Barger in December 1997, and later abbreviated to &quot;blog&quot; by his fellow American Peter Merholz. Whether he called it blogging or not, though, Hall had been at it years before everyone else. The first cyber cafe Cyberia, Britain&apos;s first cyber cafe (see left), was set up in 1994 on the ground floor of the EasyNet offices in Whitfield Street, central London. It was the brainchild of EasyNet founders Eva Pascoe, Gen\u00e9 McPherson, Keith Teare and David Rowe, and quickly became the place to be seen for the digerati, with Mick Jagger attending its website launch and its female founders attaining minor-celebrity status. The franchise was soon extended across the world \u2013 with outlets in Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester and Rotterdam \u2013 but eventually folded, its founders moving on to other projects. Teare looks back fondly: &quot;It was 150 miles an hour for four years. And now there are hundreds of thousands of them, worldwide. Not Cyberias of course; just plain old cyber cafes. Never was a great business \u2013 but it\u00a0was a great experience.&quot; The first eBay sale The French-Iranian programmer Pierre Omidyar launched AuctionWeb in September 1995. It was later renamed eBay. There had been other virtual auction sites, but this one was better designed and better marketed. The first item to change hands at auction was a broken laser pointer offered by Omidyar himself, finally purchased for $14.83. Omidyar had the courtesy to contact the winning bidder and warn them they were buying faulty goods, but the buyer claimed to collect broken laser pointers, so the sale went through. The first Wikipedia entry &quot;Wikis&quot; date back to 1995, when software developer Ward Cunningham launched WikiWikiWeb, named after the shuttle buses at Honolulu airport (&quot;wiki&quot; means fast in Hawaiian, and in internet terms refers to the collaborative generation of content). The software&apos;s innovative application would later prove the key to the extraordinary success of Wikipedia, which itself originated in a free-content reference project known as Nupedia, founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur Jimmy Wales. Wales hired the philosophy academic Larry Sanger to run what they defined as &quot;a very open, very publicly editable series of web pages&quot;. The first article, quite randomly, was &quot;atonality&quot;, written by German academic Christoph Hust. But there was a flaw in the plan: after a year only 12 articles had been published because of the need for fact-checking and editing. It was not until 2004, when the collaborative wiki software was utilised, that Wikipedia was unleashed. Unfortunately, all of its original articles have been lost, as initially the software didn&apos;t save history as it does today. But the first words that appeared on Wikipedia, typed by Wales, were &quot;hello world&quot;. &quot;Once the wiki started, lots of people began to contribute, and that&apos;s when I realised it was pretty exciting and could really take off,&quot; Wales says now. &quot;Except that obviously it&apos;s a bit big bigger than I ever imagined.&quot; The first social networking site From the outset the internet was all about connecting people, with proto-social networks evident even in the early days of Arpanet and bulletin boards. But the pioneering US site Classmates.com was far closer to the model of social networking sites such as Facebook that dominate today, and inspired a host of imitations including Friends Reunited in the UK. Classmates.com began life in 1995 in the basement of former Boeing employee Randy Conrads. It was an instant hit, playing on many an American&apos;s desire to swap life stories with former friends or reignite a high-school romance (after the first 100 marriages, in 2002, they stopped counting). Conrads came up with the idea when he started attending reunions himself: &quot;I thought there was a lot of strength in high-school affinities, the desire to get together and travel long distances and spend a lot of money in hotels in order to talk to each other, and the internet, as it grew, could be a place for people to connect like that. I thought if I could do it for all high schools, maybe I could make a business.&quot; Conrads was the first person registered on the site, and soon he was not only rekindling friendships from the military school he attended abroad, but getting his classmates to invest in and work for the company. &quot;Running into those people again has been the start of several special relationships with some of the people I went to school with \u2013 not all, though.&quot; The first major dotcom failure     Kajsa Leander and Ernst Malmsten. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    It wasn&apos;t the first dotcom to go bust, but Boo was definitely the most high-profile of the first tranche of failures. Set up by two extremely well-connected Swedes, former poetry critic Ernst Malmsten and Vogue model Kajsa Leander, with the backing of some big business guns, Boo.com seemed to have a lot going for it when its was unveiled in the autumn of 1999. But the Boo story quickly morphed into an emperor&apos;s-new-clothes type yarn. Aspiring to be an online Harvey Nichols, it soon had a staff of 500 across seven countries hosting famously lavish parties. But the buzz dotcom brand of the moment was, in reality, a poorly functioning website in a market that didn&apos;t yet have the appetite to buy high-end designs online \u2013 these were the days of snail-paced internet connections and low-resolution design. Eighteen months down the line, with \u00a390m squandered, no one seemed that surprised when everything went horribly wrong. In his final memo to staff, Malmsten said simply: &quot;I&apos;m sorry that in the end we couldn&apos;t turn things around, and maybe that was my fault.&quot; The first YouTube video            It has been said before, but here it is again: YouTube is four years old. Four! The YouTube story began so astonishingly recently, in fact, that one of the events that inspired it was Janet Jackson&apos;s dress malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl \u2013 or rather, the fact that you couldn&apos;t find footage of it anywhere on the web. Little over a year later, former PayPal employees Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim had filled the gaping whole in the internet market for a video sharing facility. The first video on the site was posted on 23 April 2005, and remains there today. &quot;Me at the zoo&quot; is a man called Karim&apos;s 18-second long report from the elephant enclosure at San Diego zoo. It&apos;s both dull and awkward, enlivened only by a strange message flashing up half-way through exclaiming: &quot;Can you hear the goat. Meeeeeeh!!&quot; But its historical significance means that it has had well over a million hits so far."}, {"sentences": ["If the mainstream doesn&apos;t change our show, we&apos;re happy to swim in it.&quot; \u2022 Beug and Kafalas are looking for hosts in Beirut, Osaka, Tokyo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Bogota, Mexico City, Memphis and Detroit."], "tags": ["City breaks", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-23T11:01:25Z", "title": "New Jackass-style online travel show aims to rip up the guidebooks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/oct/23/this-is-my-city-video", "article": " This is My City - TrailerfromTim KafalasonVimeo.

We want a personal, intimate experience of a city. We want to convey the rhythm of a city, the atmosphere of a place, the unsteady trajectory of a night out that seems to never end and we want the viewer to feel like they are right there with us,&quot; he explains. &quot;We&apos;re trying to embrace what travelling is like for real. Whatever happens happens, and if it&apos;s a disaster you&apos;ll see that in the show.&quot; The show&apos;s premise is that local residents are always the best way into a place, and this has led them to meet some colourful characters. On their first night in Portugal, their adopted host - and stuntman - David treated them to a stunt-fighting lesson on the streets of the city, while in Berlin, the pair found themselves helping an artist with a project in the basement of an empty public swimming pool then partying until dawn in a huge abandoned house. Kafalas and Beug have funding for a 12-episode pilot series from independent backers and have taken off on an 11-week world tour. In the can are pilots in Philadelphia and Reykjavik and shows in Lisbon and Berlin. Up next are jaunts to Belgrade, Beirut, Osaka, Melbourne and Wellington, plus a second leg of filming next year. The destinations - some capitals, some &quot;second cities&quot; are intended to display &quot;a cross-section of the urban world right now,&quot; according to Beug. The films are currently streamed on the Vimeo website, and although the duo describe their concept as a &quot;guerilla&quot; show, they hope to sell them to a major US TV network. &quot;We are a guerilla show, yes. We shoot it ourselves, we produce it, we direct it, we&apos;re in it, we edit it, we have no lights, no sound person and no scripting. Our cameras are tiny and our only crew is one local producer in each city,&quot; Beug says. &quot;But we&apos;re guerilla because of the content we&apos;re after and not because we necessarily want to stay out of the mainstream. If the mainstream doesn&apos;t change our show, we&apos;re happy to swim in it.&quot; \u2022 Beug and Kafalas are looking for hosts in Beirut, Osaka, Tokyo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Bogota, Mexico City, Memphis and Detroit.

But David Cameron&apos;s latest policy announcement, all-women shortlists for selected constituency seats, is wrong-headed, ill-thought-through and destined to rebound. And, while a part of me should thus be cheering, more of me is irritated. The idea is to boost the number of female Tory MPs. Granted, the current figure \u2013 only 19 of the party&apos;s 198 MPs are women \u2013 is laughably unrepresentative of the country. But imposing it from the top \u2013 affirmative action in all but name (only they certainly won&apos;t call it that because that&apos;s what lefty American states do with black people) \u2013 is going to make life horrendously hard for the very people it&apos;s designed to help. Already, party member Jenny Combe, from Devizes, has described it as &quot;reverse sexism&quot; adding: &quot;I got where I am on my ability, not my sex.&quot; This is the crux: every opponent of the policy can argue that, surely, the very best candidate for any post should get it, and anything else is loading the dice: not just unfair but unConservative. They&apos;d be right. The thing is, positive discrimination/affirmative action is still hugely contentious, even in the places where it&apos;s been around for decades. They&apos;re still arguing about it in America. And in South Africa, too. There is an argument, which I can see, that, yes, it is technically unfair, but necessary for perhaps one generation: change the rules to give better jobs for minorities, regardless of their merit, and it might sting and anger for a bit but, within 20 years, an older fairness will have been righted, money and education can start playing a different part in upbringing, and the level playing-field can return. But female putative Conservative MPs are not \u2013 call this a sweeping generalisation if you like \u2013 impoverished and ghettoised. They have had every educational opportunity (other perhaps than going to Eton) that their male rivals will have enjoyed; and in an era when girls regularly out-perform boys. The other point that Cameron should have remembered, surely, is the party into which this policy is being crowbarred. I spent much of the last two years stepping out with a Tory activist, and she introduced me to a good number of her friends. The men were, without fail, charming, witty, loyal to a fault, delightful: and welcoming, even when I disagreed with so much of what they stood for. But, under the kindness and bonhomie, they still at times inhabit a cheeky playground banter of a world, not above stereotyping and finger-pointing in the same way the ocean is not above the sky. And these were the good ones. Think of all the nasty little Tory dweebs and wonks, the spinners and crunchers, the equivalent of Malcolm Tucker&apos;s vicious little boy army in The Thick of It (and believe me the Tories have them too). Into this snake-pit, next year, are going to step some new, female shoes. Already, of course, the shoes will have been scrutinised. They will have been photographed, analysed, leered over or ridiculed. Already, this week, two phrases appeared: &quot;Cameron Cuties&quot; and &quot;Chloe-bots&quot;, after Chloe Smith, first of the new young input. They&apos;ll have been called too fat, too thin, too dowdy, too sexy. They&apos;ll have fought an election, undergone trial by media, and then have to enter the corridors of power only to find themselves hobbled, hog-tied, by their own leader: their every utterance, every action, their every triumph or failure bedevilled by whispers and finger-pointing: a differently sniggering way to say, basically: &quot;Well, we all know how she get the job&quot;, and sanctioned right from the top. Do you see what he&apos;s done to me? I dislike and distrust Mr Cameron so viscerally that I&apos;ve managed to work myself into a froth of empathy for Tory MPs. Time for that lie-down. With this cake, I thee divorce. And good riddance The big new thing in my home town of Edinburgh, so I&apos;m told, is divorce parties. With cakes. Someone sent me a picture of one of the cakes. It features a triumphant, axe-wielding bride on the top, the jam-spattered hubby lying on the marzipan rocks three tiers below. Which is fine, in a way. Let them eat cakes. The cake design itself could even become something of an art form. Rather than the literal push-him-off-a-cliff thing, we could have the cerebral, the nihilistic: anguished broken male in one room, bitter, torn, hurting woman rocking gently next door. In meringue, with some nice apricot jam. The problem is, knowing Edinburgh, the parties. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any other city, or any other breed of woman, more ready for a party. Which is in so many ways a good thing. But. I lost count of the times, covering the festival this year, that I was bundled into the road by hen parties: cheery, gleeful, loud, feisty and probably not a bad bone among them but, taken all together, crowding you into the rain and dog poo, about as welcome as Jan Moir at a Boyzone concert. And that was just for the wedding. The divorce parties will be pretty much the same but with a mob grudge. Still, at least it&apos;s not Glasgow. A friend tells me of his recent trip there with a friend who was gay and introducing him to the modern Scotland. All was smiles and tolerance. &quot;No worries, big man. Gay, is it? Ach, no worries. It&apos;s the new Scotland! No prejudices here! Anyway. So, are you a gay Protestant or a gay Catholic?&quot; All roads lead to Rome for Anglican women-haters Three people I feel a tiny bit sorry for. Nick Griffin, who everyone wanted to be at least clever, and then cleverly beaten, but who looked, instead, like a thick, sweating, failed, fat vole. A man called Hide Saitocorrect, owner of a karaoke bar in Tokyo, who on Wednesday heard My Way for the 25,000th time (Clive James, as so often, had it nailed, many years ago in this very paper, when he pointed out that the only person who truly got away with that lyric was Sid Vicious). And the poor, self-pimping Pope, who announced midweek that Anglicans would now be welcome as converts. I don&apos;t want to come over all Richard Dawkins here. (Actually, I would love to, if only I was cleverer.) But surely it says much, and none of it too healthy, about modern organised religion when you can just open the knees of your cassock on a whim and pull in an estimated 1,000 new priests, from a different church, the Church of England, just because they don&apos;t like women. I may be a touch hazy on some niceties of the theology. It&apos;s being said that His Holiness is terribly keen to unite all Christians, urgently. (So much so that he accepts Holocaust-deniers.) But, standing away from the acres of text written about it all, the lamentations and the justifications, it strikes me as incredibly simple. There is a church, based in Rome, which believes in something or other. There is another church, based in Canterbury, which believes in sort of the same, but not quite so much, or at least not quite so\u2026 Mediterraneanly, and with fewer rules and odours, but also, presumably faintly frustratingly, fewer get-out clauses. For centuries, the two have been at war, often literally. Because each side believes, truly believes, that they are the only ones to interpret the Bible correctly, and what it &quot;says&quot; about, for instance, marriage, celibacy, equality, women, individual rights, conscience, free will, penitence and whether the chunk of cake is literal or figurative. And then \u2013 da nan! Suddenly, it is utterly butterly OK for the papal team to throw open their doors and invite in the Anglicans. The rules weren&apos;t, it turns out, so much rules as\u2026 suggestions. Faint, shadowy guidelines. Cobwebs, really. Hints. Nudges. Nothing to do with God, in fact. All probably taken out of context. Even more shamingly, the Anglicans who don&apos;t like women priests are reportedly rushing to put on the new strip. Yes, I&apos;m being fabulously reductive here. Go on then, fatwah me. Or is that the third bunch?"}, {"sentences": ["There were snaps of guerrilla gardens I had found in the 80s in New York, and a house in Tokyo stacked high with bonsai."], "tags": ["Gardening advice", "Gardens", "Life and style", "Photography"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-24T23:06:15Z", "title": "A time and a place | Dan Pearson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/oct/25/dan-pearson-landscapes-book-corbusier", "article": "I have been taking photographs of landscapes, gardens and environments since I was a teenager, to try to capture moods and to explain why they matter. It is a subject that has fascinated me since I was a child, as I was brought up in a house that, for the best part of 50 years, had been overwhelmed by the garden of the previous owner. It was a magical world of its own. A tangle that gave evidence of a life that had been lived there and the knot that nature had tied around it. The legacy of that experience inspired in me a passion to understand what it is that makes a place particular and, today, this is the driving force and the inspiration for my work as a landscape designer. When I was invited to lecture about my work I started to use many of these images to illustrate where my inspiration comes from. And then I came upon the idea of trying to pin down my own impression of the &quot;spirit of place&quot; (genius loci) in a book. Spirit of place derives as much from the way a place is used or thought about as it does from its physical aspects. It may be enhanced by the place being written about or painted, put to music or shaped by the hand of man, giving it form and purpose. The stories, the art, the memories, the beliefs, the monuments, the boundaries, the rivers, woods and architectural styles are all key to the way in which we relate to our surroundings. The book was three years in the making, trawling through boxes of dusty photographs and slides to illustrate what I soon realised was a journey of places and things that had inspired me. There were snaps of guerrilla gardens I had found in the 80s in New York, and a house in Tokyo stacked high with bonsai. There were buildings and favourite gardens, sculptures that had caught my imagination and resonated by giving places identity, and walks captured in images in an attempt to pin down the mood of the places I was moving through. My travels took me to landscapes that made me look harder. I discovered the potency of desert landscapes when I lived in Israel for a year, stranding myself somewhere different every weekend when the buses stopped running on Shabbat. I learned to &quot;read&quot; the land, or at least started a learning curve that will continue as long as I take the time to look. And taking time also revealed the way the places smelled, how the light fell, how the weave of nature and man intermingled. Though a walk on the Gower peninsula can be as enriching as a walk in the Californian deserts of Joshua Tree, my search continued to find places that retained the primitive. A three-day road trip across the South Island of New Zealand took in the dry tussock lands of the east and the wet mountains that pulsed with waterfalls and then the vast braided river beds to the west. It was here that I experienced nature&apos;s power when the Southern Lights appeared in unpolluted skies. The primitive bush that had remained untouched by man and had evolved unhindered was as frightening as it was awe-inspiring, and the hand of man was light and insignificant here, and made that much starker for the juxtaposition with the bush. But never in my life have I tasted such good fish and chips as those we found in the caravan at the end of the road at Jackson Bay, on the west coast. It was surreal to feel the comfort of such domesticity, sandwiched between the mountains, a morass and the wild Pacific Ocean. Despite my desire to find places that have been untouched, it is often the hand of man that gives a place a focus, for it provides something comforting and in scale with the way we live in the world. This is where gardens play their part, allowing us to access nature and, to a degree, feel part of it. I have always been moved by the marks in the landscape that we have made to define our place on the land. Dry-stone walls, as far apart as the Burren, on Ireland&apos;s west coast, the Yorkshire Dales and southern Spain, all made from the very stone that they sit upon, are the best example of man and landscape coming together. They give a place a sense of being occupied. With the layering that builds up over time comes a historical presence, and I have found myself equally drawn to architecture and memorials, be they dramatic statements such as Le Corbusier&apos;s chapel \u2013 Notre Dame du Haut, or the intimacy of the Palais Id\u00e9al, where Le Facteur Cheval, a postman in the last century, built his fantasy. Once I began to put the book together there were fascinating connections I had not seen so clearly before: the Pantheon, a temple to all gods, the oculus in the centre of the dome connecting to the heavens, and the James Turrell light sculptures I saw in Yorkshire, which abstract the heavens and make you aware of the passing of the clouds, the sky, the transitory flit of a bird. These places intensify your senses and perceptions, encouraging a mood of contemplation which places you both firmly in the here and now and also outside of time. All these places have made an indelible mark on my understanding of the world, our place in it, and how we look for and create beauty around us whenever possible. Each time I have such an experience it spurs me on to continue the journey, since each time my eyes are opened in a slightly different and often unexpected way. And I believe it is this sense of wonder through looking closely that really feeds the soul.\u2605 Dan Pearson&apos;s Spirit: Garden Inspiration is published by Fuel, at \u00a328.

It&apos;s a privilege I could never hope for in Spain, despite being born and raised in Madrid. There is always controversy about the way the world&apos;s great arts companies are supported in the nations that host them. The Arts Council is forever subject to criticism, but I&apos;ve seen what happens in countries where major companies have to fend for themselves or cuddle up to politicians. I am often asked why there is no major classical ballet company in Spain. It&apos;s a simple enough question and a logical one considering that most western nations have at least one. Many ballet companies around the world have excellent Spaniards in their ranks, dancers who have been nurtured and trained in Spain, but who are then orphaned by their mother country and forced to emigrate to pursue their careers. But the answer is highly complicated. The most common argument used to explain this anomaly of Spanish culture is that Spain does not have a tradition of classical ballet. Yet it is a fallacy. Spain had a corps de ballet from the 19th century through to the first decades of the 20th century. The causes are political rather than cultural or historical. As a principal of the Royal Ballet, I am privileged to be invited to dance all over the world. As well as more than 30 shows at the Royal Opera House last year, I performed in Russia, China, Japan, Cuba, Italy, Spain and the US. This has offered a unique insight into the different ways the arts are nurtured across the world. A common assumption is that artists will survive no matter how bad the situation a country finds itself in and that the arts have their own momentum. It&apos;s a cliche often reinforced with examples of great art being produced in difficult times by, say, Picasso or Lorca. In reality though, there are noticeable differences in the health of the arts from one country to the next. In the US and, with slight differences, also in Japan, the performing arts have minimal state funding. Instead, there are wealthy patrons, whether corporations or individuals, encouraged by tax breaks. While this has the advantage of unburdening the state, it comes with the temptation to allow influence to those giving the money. At best, it will mean the renaming of buildings or allowing patrons to decide the colour of the new front-of-house carpet, but, at worst, it can change artistic policy and impact on repertoire. The current economic climate has thrown up other disadvantages. In the last year, many companies in North America have been making redundancies in order to survive. The most extreme consequence of this can be seen in Japan, where most dancers do not receive a salary but are paid show by show and so need other jobs to survive. On one of my first visits as a guest in Tokyo, at the gala dinner after the opening night, I suddenly realised that the people waiting on table were the very same dancers with whom I had shared the stage a few moments before. I am usually extremely hungry after the show, but that night I lost my appetite. The French model, also practised with some differences in Italy and Spain, is based on government intervention through the Ministry of Culture. The majority of symphony orchestras, opera, theatres and ballet companies are publicly owned. The government soaks up the costs, running the arts as a state department like healthcare or education. The Council of Europe called this &quot;cultural monarchy&quot;, commenting: &quot;Ministers, whoever they might be, define their options and take their decisions in sovereign fashion, in a way according to the principles of enlightened despotism.&quot; This is also true of Spain. And when a government runs the arts, it creates a dependency of the artist on politicians and bureaucrats. If the political situation is volatile, the consequences can be terrible. For example, in the last five years, I have been invited to perform with the Scala Ballet of Milan by three different artistic directors. Although it is always a pleasure to perform with them, I can understand the insecurity and artistic frustration many of the dancers feel. Political patronage can cause difficulties in the opposite direction. Spain&apos;s contemporary dance company, Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza, has had the same director for almost 20 years, a perfect example of &quot;cultural monarchy&quot;. The British should be proud of their belief in the arm&apos;s-length principle. Between the government and the artists is an arts council. It has been adopted by many other countries, including most of Scandinavia, Singapore and Korea. The principle was instituted to prevent the intervention of political power in culture after the Nazi ordeal. Big artistic companies, like ballet companies, require support from the state. On the other hand, artists need to be free to be creative. This requires objectivity and transparency in decision-making, the intrinsic values of the current British model. Until a similar system is installed in my country, any personal initiative to found a classical ballet company, however well-intended, will be forever subject to the whims of the incumbent governments and therefore, as much as it saddens me to admit it, destined for failure.

The commercial justifications come by rote and there is always talk of &quot;tanks on lawns&quot;, a phrase used by the Premier League to justify its 39th-game scenario, which is not dead but merely resting. What they cannot wish away, though, is the disconnect when an institution transports itself ghost-like to an incongruous milieu. It feels all wrong. Globalisation is a war on setting, on place. It fashions a timeless TV universe in which the game is a sparkly prime-time spectacle that is everywhere and nowhere. It is jeux sans frontiers, though not a patch on It&apos;s A Knockout, in its day the third best international sporting event after the Olympics and World Cup, which move around precisely because they are floating global championships owned by everyone and no\u00a0one. Football&apos;s Champions League final skips about, too, but only to the game&apos;s cathedrals, all of them on our continent. The trick being played on us is that we will get used to it in increments, and soon barely notice that golf&apos;s European Tour is now a &quot;Race to Dubai&quot;. They must know this is spurious. There is an Atlantic of difference between staging a random regular-season game overseas and relocating the events that truly define a sport. Here, today, we can kill a myth by trying to visualise the Ashes in the United Arab Emirates, the Six Nations in Asia, the World Series in Japan, the Derby in Hong Kong, the NBA finals in London or Gaelic football&apos;s annual Croke Park craic in Sydney. It is inconceivable, too, that the Super Bowl could be staged at Wembley, and not just on account of the time difference (an 11pm start here). America does not commune on Super Bowl Sunday to look outwards. It assembles to direct its gaze within. These subtleties of mood and belonging are what we are being told to overlook, and will, in some cases, where rootlessness is built into the machine (golf), where new competitions sprout (cricket&apos;s Twenty20 Champions League), or when Derby County&apos;s American owners set up batting cages at Pride Park and sell replica baseball shirts. Seriously, one swing in a netted alley is enough to make you an American, or at least a baseball fan for a life. Beyond the exceptions, though, is a vast realm of shared local feeling, of resistance to appropriation by marketeers. &quot;Move it and they will come&quot; would be Kevin Costner&apos;s line, now, in Field of Dreams.

The case against Noriko Sakai has gripped Japan ever since the 38-year-old actress and singer went into hiding in early August, on the day she was called in for questioning after the drugs-related arrest of her husband. Tabloid tales of the couple&apos;s amphetamine use have been lapped up by an enraptured public in a country where celebrity drug use still counts as a genuine scandal. Today, 6,600 people lined up for the 20 seats in the public gallery at the Tokyo district court, a number topped only by the 12,000 who applied for a place at the opening day in the trial of Shoko Asahara, the cult guru whose followers carried out a fatal gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. Sakai&apos;s brand of saccharine pop made her a household name in the 1990s and earned her a huge following in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. She was arrested for allegedly using amphetamines during a family holiday in July; investigators also found minute traces of the drug in her Tokyo apartment. Dressed in a black suit and clutching a white handkerchief, Sakai admitted the charges and said she had been persuaded to take drugs by her husband, Yuichi Takaso, who describes himself as a professional surfer. His arrest prompted her to disappear for several days, prompting a hunt that at times seemed to be led by the media rather than the police. Prosecutors are seeking an 18-month jail term for a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, although most first-time offenders get off with a suspended sentence. Whether she serves time in prison, Sakai, who appeared in an anti-drugs campaign in the early 1990s, has been amply castigated by an unforgiving entertainment world. The media have characterised her alleged drug habit as a betrayal to the legions of fans drawn to her wholesome image as a twentysomething pop idol and, more recently, by her devotion to her 10-year-old son. Toyota stopped showing a commercial featuring Sakai on its website and her clothing line was pulled from stores across Japan. She was later ditched by her agency, Sun Music, and Victor Records withdrew her CDs from stores. In what appeared to be a plea for leniency, she tearfully told the court she would divorce her husband and swap showbusiness for a career in geriatric nursing.

The firm raised its net profit forecast for the current year to \u00a5155bn (\u00a31bn) from an earlier forecast of \u00a555bn. Earnings for the July-September quarter were down by 56.2% from last year, although the drop was smaller than forecast. Analysts attributed the boost in sales to global &quot;cash-for-clunkers&quot; schemes, which reward consumers who trade in old cars for new, fuel-efficient models. Honda said it expected to sell 3.4m vehicles for the year through the end of March 2010, a slight improvement on an earlier projection but still well down on the 3.52m it sold last year. Second-quarter operating profit fell to \u00a565.54bn from \u00a5148.85bn in the same period last year, due to falling sales and the yen&apos;s appreciation against the dollar. Toyota, the world&apos;s biggest carmaker, and Nissan are also expected to report improved second-quarter earnings next week, but Honda will emerge as the healthiest financially for the full year due to its more modest range of models and lower production costs. While sales of its Insight petrol-electric hybrid, Fit compact hatchback and Freed compact minivan have all benefited from government incentives to buy energy-efficient cars, there are fears that sales will stumble again once the measures are withdrawn. Government attempts to spur demand saw Honda&apos;s sales rise 15% in Japan last month and by 27% in China.

The tribunal&apos;s website provides comprehensive coverage of the Yugoslav war crimes trials. It includes victim statements, statements of guilt by those who have admitted responsibility for specific crimes and an interactive map showing the location of dozens of atrocities including those at Srebenica and Gorazde. The proceedings against Karadzic can be followed via webcast in English and French, as well as Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian. Judgments and initial appearances - when the accused faces the court for the first time - are broadcast live. All other sessions are broadcast with a 30-minute delay to allow for the removal of confidential information. Karadzic faces 11 charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly orchestrating a systematic campaign of murder, terror and deportation in the 1992-95 war aimed at seizing half of Bosnia and ridding it of all non-Serbs. His trial, which started on Monday at the Hague, got off to a rocky start. Karadzic boycotted the opening, to the outrage and frustration of those Bosnian Muslims who had travelled 1,200 miles by bus to see justice done. The trial is being conducted under the auspices of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the first war crimes court created by the UN and the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals. The tribunal&apos;s indictments address crimes committed from 1991 to 2001 against members of various ethnic groups in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. The proceedings are expected to be protracted. Karadzic, like the late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, has refused a lawyer and is expected to use his trial as a platform to mock the tribunal and challenge its authority. Milosevic \u2013 who died in custody \u2013 and the Serbian warlord Vojislav Seselj used similar delaying tactics to politicise and drag out their trials. Judges have been criticised by lawyers, victims&apos; associations and human rights activists for allowing the war crimes suspects to set the agenda and manipulate the court. The tribunal suffered a heavy blow when Milosevic, who had a heart condition, died before a verdict was reached. Prosecutors had hoped to convict the man considered the primary architect behind the tragic events that engulfed the former Yugoslavia.

Is there a more gymnastic orator in rugby? One minute he is encouraging an all-for-one cross-border team ethos with the Lions, the next he is slagging off standards on the English side of the Severn Bridge. There is always an ulterior motive for his verbal hand grenades but, on this occasion, his artful lob would appear to have landed slightly too close to home. The beauty of Gatland, of course, is that he loves to stir whichever pot happens to be bubbling in front of him. By criticising the Guinness Premiership as &quot;the weakest I have ever known&quot; and not good enough for wannabe Welsh Test players, he is clearly hoping to lure back the likes of Eifion Roberts, the Sale prop who would appear to most neutrals to be a genuine international prospect. Welsh regional rugby gets stronger and the Premiership gets further diluted, potentially weakening the English national team. Job done, get the beers in. Except that the situation is not quite that simple. It is true that this year&apos;s Premiership has not been mind-blowingly good to date. The ebbing tide of multi-national talent to the Top 14 \u2013 not just the English \u2013 and decreasing squad sizes have had a draining effect on clubs like Sale and Gloucester, both of whom are enduring tough seasons. Wasps, Saracens and Newcastle are rebuilding, Leicester are injury-plagued and only London Irish and Northampton have been playing with any real freedom. Yet Gatland is forgetting a couple of things. For a start, he is in effect criticising two proud Welshmen \u2013 the former national coach Mike Ruddock at Worcester and Sale&apos;s head coach Kingsley Jones \u2013 who will now be fully entitled to brandish two fingers the next time the Kiwi asks them for a favour. His trusty assistant coach Shaun Edwards may also have a word. Is Gatland saying that Edwards, still the beating heart of London Wasps, is now less effective at motivating players than he was in the days when Lawrence Dallaglio was captain? And what about the unsettling effect on people such as Roberts, Dwayne Peel, Gareth Delve, Ceri Jones and Warren Fury whose career choice he is basically criticising? On top of that, he has all but written England&apos;s team-talk for them prior to next year&apos;s Six Nations game against Wales. This particular English side respond best to having their backs against the wall and Welsh wins at Twickenham have not been frequent enough during the professional era to make too many claims on behalf of the inbuilt superiority of Welsh club rugby. Of course results such as the Scarlets&apos; away victory over London Irish in the Heineken Cup raise quizzical eyebrows. But Europe is a contrasting type of competition to the Premiership, demanding a completely different mindset. Is Gatland seriously suggesting the Scarlets would be top of the English league after six rounds if they were suddenly to be granted access? Ditto the Newport Gwent Dragons? Surely not. In fact, the more you think about it, the more Gatland may ultimately regret going public with an opinion that will galvanise every single club in the Premiership and make the English as a whole desperate to prove him wrong, possibly to the detriment of Wales in the long run. Where he is on more solid ground is in his implicit criticism of Premier Rugby officials, whose refusal to make an exception to allow someone like Peel to face the All Blacks does them few favours and comes across as petty and self-serving. Gatland&apos;s disdain, on that front, is entirely justified. Bagging everyone living east of Chepstow, however, is not so clever. Calendar boys Handbags, or rather man-bags, at dawn. The sacked Stade Fran\u00e7ais coach Ewen McKenzie, has accused his former employer, Max Guazzini, of recruiting players based on their looks in an attempt to boost sales of the club&apos;s beefcake calendar. &quot;I had certain players forced on me who, for me, shouldn&apos;t have been in a team targeting the Top 14 title,&quot; McKenzie told L&apos;Equipe. The Australian&apos;s views have gone down poorly in Paris. &quot;It is imperative for him to justify the reasons why Stade Fran\u00e7ais, which is a well known club in Australia, sacked him and all he comes up with are derogatory remarks,&quot; retorted Guazzini. &quot;From A to Z, everything he said was rubbish.&quot; Okay, but which players could Max possibly have recruited for their beauty rather than their beastliness? Take a look at the Stade team photo and make up your own minds. Turning Japanese There is as much worldwide interest in the venue as the outcome of this Saturday&apos;s Bledisloe Cup clash between New Zealand and Australia in Tokyo. If the locals respond to the so-called &quot;Rumble in the Rice Bowl&quot; it will underline the potential growth opportunities for the sport in Asia between now and the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.

The waters were placid, and the couple were excited about their wedding in November. They were not alone. Agents from North Korea were on the hillside. They overpowered the couple, took them to a waiting boat on Wakasa Bay and transported them nearly 500 miles to the Communist country where they were to spend the next quarter of a century. The disappearance of the couple was a local mystery and might well have remained so had it not been for a seemingly unrelated event thousands of miles away in the Middle East. Nearly a decade after the Chimura abduction, two North Korean agents stepped on to a Korean Air flight in Baghdad bound for Bangkok. In Bahrain the agents disembarked, leaving a bomb on board. The Boeing 707 took off again, exploded in flight, and 104 passengers and 11 crew were killed. The agents were subsequently arrested while trying to leave the country. One, a 70-year-old, killed himself with a poison capsule. The other, 26-year-old Kim Hyon Hui, attempted suicide in the same fashion but was stopped. Kim was later flown to Seoul where a trial revealed a fact that would cause diplomatic reverberations: North Korea had been regularly abducting Japanese citizens to help train special agents. Those agents would then pass themselves off as citizens from Japan, take part in terrorist plots and blacken the name of that nation. North Korea&apos;s antipathy towards Japan was ingrained after years of, at times, brutal colonisation from the 1900s to the end of the second world war. For Japan the news was the piece of a jigsaw that went towards solving the puzzle of numerous unexplained disappearances. Concrete confirmation came in July 2002 when North Korea&apos;s leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that &quot;over-zealous&quot; special forces had abducted a least a dozen Japanese citizens \u2013 men, women and children between the ages of 13 and 46. Eight had since died. &quot;It was regretful and I want to frankly apologise,&quot; said Kim. Chimura was one of those who survived, along with Fukie. They returned to Japan three months after Kim&apos;s admission, and after diplomatic wranglings were joined by their three children, who had been born in Pyongyang. Today, the family lives in Obama. But beyond these lives hopefully returning to normal, the anger of the Japanese government is plain to see. Last week Yukio Hatoyama&apos;s recently-elected government said it was launching an investigation into the abductions, an inquiry that would potentially identify scores more victims. Officially, 17 Japanese have been identified as abductees, although private groups put the number in the scores. Five have returned but the Japanese government contends that Pyongyang holds the remaining 12. Accounts of the eight deaths tell of some dying, remarkably young, from heart attacks, others suffering gas incidents, another killed in a road accident. Hiroshi Nakai, a cabinet member and minister of state for the abduction issue, said previous administrations had not been bold enough in their efforts. &quot;We are trying to start a new investigation with a new perspective on this issue. We think if we make further thorough investigations there would be more people who could be confirmed as abductees.&quot; At stake is not just the concern of the families but the delicate balance of diplomacy. Since North Korea carried out its first nuclear test the international community has been desperate to contain its proliferation. Six-party talks, including Japan, the US and China, have made arguably little progress. But in the latter days of the Bush administration and at the start of the Obama tenure, the US signalled a willingness to deal with Kim Jong-il directly. In August Bill Clinton became the highest-profile US visitor to Pyongyang when he secured the release of two American journalists captured while in a border area. There have also been face-to-face talks between diplomats as recently as last week in New York. Japan has viewed a thawing of relations between Kim Jong-il and the US with some concern and is determined the abduction issue will not be sidelined. &quot;Japan will never work on the normalisation of relations with North Korea without the resolution of the abduction issue,&quot; said Nakai. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter to Japan if the US normalises the relationship. The abduction issue is a roadblock \u2026 to normalisation for Japan.&quot; Meanwhile the Japanese government explores other avenues to keep the issue alive. It invites the media to visit the abduction sites \u2013 the Guardian took part in one for this article \u2013 and produces comic books and DVDs. It also broadcasts a daily three-hour shortwave radio programme to North Korea with taped messages from relatives and news from the homeland. Shigeo Iizuke has taken advantage of this to try to reach his missing sister, who vanished more than 30 years ago. In June 1978, Yaeko Taguchi, who was 22 and a bar worker, dropped her two children, aged one and two, at a daycare centre before going to work at the Hollywood cabaret in Tokyo&apos;s Ikebukuro district. She never arrived. Iizuke filed a report with the police and waited. Months turned to years. He and his wife adopted Taguchi&apos;s son, one-year-old Koichiro. Another sister took on the responsibility of raising the other child. Nothing was heard of Taguchi until the court testimony from Kim Hyon Hui, the Korean airline bomber. She confessed to being trained by a Japanese abductee for nearly two years prior to her terror mission. Subsequent investigations by Japanese authorities confirmed the teacher had been Taguchi. It also confirmed one of the key motives of the abductions. North Korea, sealed off from the world in a hermit-like state, needed its agents trained in the ways of foreign societies to be able to assimilate with those societies and pass unnoticed. &quot;My sister was a perfect candidate,&quot; says Iizuke. &quot;She had experienced married life, and children, was knowledgeable about fashions and trends and songs of young Japanese women. She was quite suitable to be a teacher of life to North Koreans.&quot; Now 71, with thinning, swept back hair, Iizuke clutches a picture of Taguchi, a laminated image of a woman with eyes closed in laughter, a broad smile spreading across a grainy face. He says he knows she is not dead, despite the insistence of North Korea. He has also since garnered more information about her desperate struggle against her abduction. &quot;It seems she was deceived and taken somewhere, maybe under the influence of a sleeping pill,&quot; said Iizuke. &quot;She was taken to a beach and although her route is sill not clear \u2026 she was taken to North Korea that way. When she came to, she was wrapped in a black bag. She begged the agent; she had left two small children behind.&quot; Iizuke, founding member of the Association of the Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea, firmly believes Japan now has to press harder for his sister&apos;s return. And he points to his adopted son as evidence for that. &quot;The boy my sister left behind in Japan was one year old. He&apos;s now 31. He does not remember anything about his mother. He does not remember her voice, he does not remember the warmth of her skin. Her son desperately wants to know of the reality of his mother.&quot; The disappeared Megumi Yokota The youngest, she was just 13 when taken in November 1977. Some believe she was a mistaken target, having witnessed agents in action. DNA analysis of ashes returned to her family proved it was not her. Yaeko Taguchi Abducted in June 1978. She was taken to North Korea and forced to teach Japanese etiquette to an agent who helped explode a bomb on a Korean Air flight in 1987. Keiko Arimoto While studying in London, she was lured to Copenhagen on the pretence of a job interview in July 1983. She has not been seen since.

Nintendo, whose raft of popular games includes the Super Mario and Pokemon series, said profits for the April-September period fell to \u00a569.49bn (\u00a3500m), down 52% from \u00a5144.83bn a year ago. The firm also failed to meet its own forecast, made in May, of a \u00a5100bn profit. Nintendo, the world&apos;s biggest maker of game consoles, said sales in the six months from April had fallen 34.5% to \u00a5548bn. The plunge forced it to lower its profit forecast for the full year from \u00a5300bn to \u00a5230bn. The firm said profits had been hit by the strong yen and a 20% cut in the price of the Wii last month. It sold 5.75m of the consoles between April and September, far fewer than the 10m it shifted in the same period last year. The lower price tag on the Wii, from $250 (\u00a3150) to $200 in the US and from \u00a525,000 to \u00a520,000 in Japan, failed to impress gamers, many of whom already own one. The results indicate that Nintendo, which has built on its profits every year for the past five years, may be losing its momentum now that the Wii market appears to have reached saturation point, leading some analysts to suggest that a completely new console offers its best hope of reviving hardware sales. Sony, on the other hand, has benefited from a similarly timed reduction in the price of its PlayStation 3 console to about US$300. &quot;The price cut on the PlayStation 3 was effective because people are getting a high spec Blu-ray disc player for a good price,&quot; said Yusuke Tsunoda, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities. The Kyoto-based company expects to sell 20m Wii machines in the 12 months through March 2010, 6m fewer than initially thought. The firm sold 11.7m DS machines during the six months from April, down from 13.73m a year ago. It expects sales of the handheld console to fall 3.8% to around 30m units for the full year. Nintendo, which has sold more than 56m Wii consoles worldwide, will be counting on the release of new software titles in the traditionally lucrative run-up to Christmas to boost sales."}, {"sentences": ["The pollen count in Tokyo is ridiculous, even in autumn&quot; - Giles Allison."], "tags": ["Football"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-29T17:00:00Z", "title": "Empty Rhetoric", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/29/the-fiver", "article": "BREAKING NEWS Wigan striker Marlon King has been told he is facing jail for groping a young woman in a trendy London nightspot and then breaking her nose after she spurned his &quot;disgusting&quot; advances.

Hull&apos;s players may well be behind their manager, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean they support him. And even if he hadn&apos;t made his bold claim just after jumping the queue at the training-ground canteen, Jimmy Bullard, Stephen Hunt and chums might just be jockeying for the best position from which to poke their gaffer with pointy sticks as he shuffles reluctantly down the plank. Whether or not Brown does have the support of a team going for only its seventh league win in 12 months this weekend is largely irrelevant, because in the gladiatorial arena of football management, it&apos;s the Hull City chairman who&apos;ll ultimately give him the McCartney-esque thumbs aloft or ... whatever it is that&apos;s the opposite of aloft. Yesterday the man in that position was Brown&apos;s good buddy Paul Duffen, but he resigned this morning in the wake of bleak news from auditors that Hull are facing financial meltdown in the wake of a maiden Premier League season that began with an astonishingly good sequence of results, before ending with an astonishingly bad one. &quot;Football is a results business and in the same way that I enjoyed the successes of the previous two seasons, so I must take ultimate responsibility for the disappointments of 2009,&quot; declared Duffen, who is expected to be replaced by his predecessor Adam Pearson, who has just resigned as chairman of Derby County. Having been forced to deny that Brown had been sacked yesterday, Hull City suits have announced that they&apos;ll issue an update on the situation regarding their vacant boardroom throne on Monday. In the meantime their manager must take his side to fortress-ish Turf Moor to face Burnley on Saturday, knowing that anything other than a win would make his position even more tenuous. Despite pulling off some genuinely marvellous results, which have been largely forgotten amid cheap shots about Bluetooth headsets, leopardskin mankinis and wooing the lasses of Humberside with his karaoke skills, Phil Brown will go to bed tonight knowing that his future is considerably less bright than the lamps of the solarium in which he sleeps. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;If I see another David Gold interview on the poor East End Jewish boy done good I&apos;ll impale myself on one of his d1ldos&quot; - tikka-tinged Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan doesn&apos;t fuel speculation that the then-Bongo FC co-owner might be about to purchase a certain football club in sarf Lahn, 2 April 2006. &quot;All that stuff was tongue in cheek and is in the past now.

Even Wilkinson himself has been enjoying comforting flashbacks amid the wood-panelled corridors of Pennyhill Park, the Surrey base where England&apos;s 2003 World Cup triumph was conceived. &quot;It&apos;s got that good feel about it,&quot; murmured the fly-half, looking and sounding happier than he has done in ages. It could, of course, be another mirage. England have grown so accustomed to losing Wilkinson that premature optimism always has to be tempered. Ahead of next month&apos;s Investec autumn series, even so, there is a distinct sense within the red rose camp that better times are around the corner despite the absence of 25 of the country&apos;s leading 64 players. It has clearly done no harm to morale that the scorer of 1,032 points for his country is finally enjoying a prolonged spell away from the treatment table. Martin Johnson, for one, is visibly relieved to have his champion back. &quot;Without embarrassing him, you&apos;re always going to miss world-class players when they&apos;re not there,&quot; acknowledged Johnson, awaiting the pleasure of picking a Test team featuring his former team-mate for the first time in his tenure. It is no use expecting one man, as Wilkinson keeps stressing, to guarantee victory \u2013 &quot;We&apos;ve had that before and it always seems to end rather miserably&quot; \u2013 but a depleted England clearly feel less naked for his presence. Either way, Wilkinson is determined to seize the day against the Wallabies next Saturday, openly conceding he feared his return from a serious knee injury would never come. &quot;I probably did think that,&quot; he confessed. &quot;I was out for a long time and when I did come back in, it was funny little cameo appearances followed by more lay-offs. That&apos;s why it feels so amazing now. There&apos;s something about being back in an environment which is about getting the best out of players. As I&apos;ve got older, the one thing that hasn&apos;t changed is wanting to make the most of every opportunity. I don&apos;t want to leave anything in the changing room for a rainy day.&quot; On the other hand, there are also signs of the belated emergence of a better-honed survival instinct since he swapped Newcastle for Toulon in the summer. &quot;My slightly younger outlook was running headlong into everything. Now I want to use up the same energy but also make sure I&apos;m in the right positions. If you&apos;re thinking: &apos;I&apos;m not going to go into that 100%,&apos; or &apos;I&apos;ll leave that tackle to someone else,&apos; you start falling into a dangerous area. Maybe I&apos;ve got more knowledge about what I want from myself. It&apos;s about being equally aggressive in a more precise way, rather than trying to run through brick walls.&quot; That same thinking is being applied to England&apos;s preparations so far, with Johnson sensibly deciding not to risk adding to the heavy injury toll with too many intensive training sessions. No one, as yet, seems to have identified the main cause of the recent carnage and while Rob Andrew, the Rugby Football Union&apos;s director of elite sport, is keeping a close eye on the body count \u2013 &quot;It is a situation we are concerned about&quot; \u2013 Johnson insists it will not be used as an excuse over the forthcoming month. &quot;We&apos;re probably having as bad a run as there&apos;s been but you can&apos;t dwell on it too much. We talked about cutting down on physicality in training but maybe it builds up resistance to injury. If you lay off, conversely, do you leave yourself more open on the weekend?&quot; Andrew, in the meantime, insists the jobs of Johnson and his coaches are safe through to the next World Cup regardless of results this winter. It would help, nevertheless, if England enjoyed more success than they achieved last November and Johnson, who confirms his starting XV on Tuesday, is confident England can start well against the Wallabies. &quot;We&apos;ve got people unavailable but we&apos;ve also got good guys coming back in,&quot; he said. &quot;If we go out and perform to the level this team can get to we can be very competitive. Australia have to play in Tokyo this weekend and Gloucester on Tuesday night. If they perform well against New Zealand I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll take a lot of confidence from it; if they lose five players to injury, I&apos;m sure they won&apos;t feel as great.&quot; The Wallabies are already without their fly-half Berrick Barnes, who could yet be ruled out of the entire tour with an ankle ligament problem. As for England, who will wear purple against Argentina in a fortnight, they insist an injured finger will not sideline Danny Care and are hoping Mike Tindall will prove his fitness for Gloucester at Sale tomorrow night."}, {"sentences": ["But Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo, said the firm could have further lowered its estimated losses for this year given the clear improvement in demand."], "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Sony", "Michael Jackson", "Technology", "Music", "Wii"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-30T12:02:08Z", "title": "Sony run of losses continues despite Michael Jackson sales boost", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/30/technology-sony", "article": "  The surge in interest in Michael Jackson&apos;s music was not enough to save Sony from its fourth quarterly loss in a row, but there are signs of optimism for the Japanese media group. The consumer electronics and entertainment company. Yesterday it reported losses of \u00a526.3bn (\u00a3175m) in the three months from July. Sony said it expected annual losses of \u00a595bn this year, a slight improvement on its initial estimate of \u00a5120bn.. Sony&apos;s susceptibility to the global recession was underlined this year when it reported a \u00a598.9bn loss for 2008. Its Sony/ATV music publishing venture benefited from the boost in sales of Michael Jackson albums following his death in June. Sales of PlayStation 3 game consoles also picked up, but Sony is heading for its first consecutive annual loss since it became a listed company in 1958. Sales in its gaming division improved after a 25% cut in the price of the PS3 last month. Sony sold 3.2m PS3s in the quarter compared with 2.4m in the same period last year. The price cut helped the PS3 outsell Nintendo&apos;s Wii console in the US for the first time last month. Nintendo, the world&apos;s biggest maker of videogame machines, said this week that its first-half profits had plunged by more than 50% due to sluggish sales of the once-dominant console and lowered its annual profit forecast by a quarter. Sony, like other Japanese manufacturers, has seen its profits hit hard by the rise of the yen against the dollar and the euro. The Japanese currency&apos;s appreciation wiped \u00a577bn from quarterly operating profit, Sony said. But Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo, said the firm could have further lowered its estimated losses for this year given the clear improvement in demand. &quot;In April to June and July to September, there was a sense that external conditions improved, and the euro didn&apos;t fall that much against the yen, so I thought they could have raised their forecasts a bit more,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the company is being cautious.&quot; Sony&apos;s Welsh-born chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer, has imposed a tough cost-cutting regime and refocused attention on the group&apos;s electronics business in to challenge rivals such as Apple. Sony is cutting 16,000 jobs and closing eight factories worldwide in an attempt to return to profit. &quot;The restructuring of our business is progressing smoothly on schedule,&quot; Nobuyuki Oneda, the company&apos;s chief financial officer, told reporters. Sony said its electronics and device divisions turned a profit in the second quarter, but that its flat-screen TV and game chip concerns had been hit by lower prices. Analysts said the consumer electronics industry&apos;s woes were expected to continue this year, but a modest recovery in the sector offered cause for optimism. Toshiba, Japan&apos;s biggest microchip manufacturer, said its semiconductor business returned to profit in the second quarter from cost cuts and better price stability, but warned that demand could weaken again. It has benefited from the popularity of Apple&apos;s iPhone and Sony&apos;s PlayStation 3 game console \u2013 both of which use its chips \u2013 but kept its full-year forecast for its electronic devices division to a \u00a560bn loss. Panasonic reported its first profit in three quarters, boosted by sales of DVD recorders and energy-efficient fridges, as consumers took advantage of government subsidies for eco-friendly appliances. It made an operating profit of \u00a549.1bn in the second quarter, down from \u00a5118.6bn a year earlier, and raised its full-year profit forecast by 60% to \u00a5120bn."}, {"sentences": ["Australia take on New Zealand in Tokyo , one of 15 internationals for the Wallabies this year in a fixture list their chief executive, John O&apos;Neill, admits has become too congested."], "tags": ["Rugby union", "Australia rugby union team", "New Zealand rugby union team", "Wales rugby union team", "Ireland rugby union team", "Sport", "Bledisloe Cup", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-30T17:09:19Z", "title": "Bledisloe Cup rivals fear international overload amid Asia push", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/30/australia-new-zealand-tokyo", "article": "Australia take on New Zealand in Tokyo , one of 15 internationals for the Wallabies this year in a fixture list their chief executive, John O&apos;Neill, admits has become too congested. The game has been arranged for commercial reasons as the major southern hemisphere nations look to exploit the Asian market, but the All Blacks captain, Richie McCaw, is concerned that too much is being asked of players. New Zealand and Australia leave Japan tomorrow for four-match tours of Europe, the culmination of a six-month Test programme. &quot;Ideally we would not be playing as many internationals in a year,&quot; said McCaw. &quot;Everyone says that but the reality is that it has become necessary. It would be nice in the future if we were not thinking like that, but we have to get on with things.&quot; O&apos;Neill said he thought 12 Tests a year should be the maximum but did not foresee a reduction from 15. &quot;It is financially driven,&quot; he added. &quot;There is a lot of talk on the International Rugby Board about the fixture list: the southern hemisphere has one view and the northern hemisphere, not surprisingly, has another. I am sure we will find a solution, but we want to continue playing in Asia and we are very serious about growing the game&apos;s footprint there. We have ambitions to get Japan involved in Super rugby further down the track.&quot; The Australia centre and vice-captain, Berrick Barnes, will not only miss the game against New Zealand but also the European tour after damaging ankle ligaments in training this week, and he faces several months on the sidelines. The Wallabies will also be without their other centre, Stirling Mortlock, for the next two weeks. He has been replaced in the squad by the 20-year-old outside-half Matt Toomua, who will play against Gloucester at Kingsholm next week when three of today&apos;s starting line-up will be on the bench. Wales will play 11 Tests this season but have the option of two more after last month signing a new participation agreement with their four regions. They have been talking with South Africa about a date at the beginning of June, but nothing has been decided. &quot;We are continuing to explore opportunities,&quot; said the Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, Roger Lewis. &quot;We have the flexibility to play 13 internationals a year and we have some options but nothing has yet been agreed.&quot; The Wales utility forward Jonathan Thomas will miss next week&apos;s international against New Zealand in Cardiff after receiving a two-week ban for punching Deiniol Jones during Ospreys&apos; Magners League defeat by Cardiff Blues last Saturday. Thomas&apos;s action left Jones needing a trip to the dentist. It was the latest in a series of lenient bans that has called into question the competition&apos;s disciplinary process. It is up to the three unions involved to deal with players from their own countries. The Ireland prop John Hayes received a six-week ban for stamping on an opponent&apos;s head while playing for Munster against Leinster last month, a punishment that was reduced by one week on appeal. &quot;We will have to look at the possibility of having independent disciplinary panels or, at least, independent chairmen,&quot; said David Jordan, the Magners League chief executive. &quot;Discipline has taken a different turn following the Bloodgate affair and gouging incidents in the summer and we all have to take a close look at our processes. &quot;We will have to look at our policy because there is always going to be a perception that a player is handled differently because of where he comes from. One of the reasons we brought in citing commissioners was that we had a season without any citings because coaches would not cite an opponent because of the tit-for-tat approach that had happened. Things have changed as a result, but we may have to go further.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["We had to produce a bill, receipt or invoice for every penny we spent, whether for two weeks in a Tokyo hotel or a cup of tea and a bun."], "tags": ["Politics"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-31T00:05:34Z", "title": "Simon Hoggart's week | Fox problem that's dung and dusted", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/31/simon-hoggart-week", "article": "\ue136It&apos;s pleasingly ironic that MPs were encouraged to exaggerate their expenses to replace a pay rise which would have attracted public opprobrium. Now they are suffering vastly more contempt than they would from a salary increase which would have been forgotten in a week. But the law of unintended consequences is constantly enforced. When I joined the Observer, we never had to produce paperwork for our expenses. It was assumed that no Observer man or woman would ever dream of fiddling. Then Lonrho took over and their executives were appalled by this gentlemanly nonsense. Why, everyone knew that journalists were chiselling frauds! We had to produce a bill, receipt or invoice for every penny we spent, whether for two weeks in a Tokyo hotel or a cup of tea and a bun. To their bafflement, expenses claims almost doubled. This was because, while a few were cheats, most journalists were completely disorganised and forgetful. Having to save each scrap of paper meant we could at last remember everything we&apos;d spent. You&apos;d think they would have cut their losses and gone back to the old way. But as the Freakonomics books demonstrate, common sense is only one very small factor in financial decision making. \ue136Now and again you find a truly awful hotel. I was in York the other day to see my son and his girlfriend in a university play before going on to Wetherby to give a talk. (This is the one where I tell people that MPs aren&apos;t so bad, most of them are honest and hard working, and so get shouted down, but politely.) It&apos;s always a bad sign when they take your money when you check in. The room was minute, maybe 5x10ft. A skylight the size of a TV screen couldn&apos;t be washed, so let in only a murky grey evanescence. There was stuff on the uncleaned floor. A shaving mirror was on one of those cantilever things, which was broken. There were no towels. As I\u00a0left for the play, they promised to send some up, but didn&apos;t. (Have you tried drying yourself with toilet paper?) I had a fitful night under a thin duvet apparently filled with plastic foam. The walls were so flimsy that you could hear the internal plumbing of the hotel and its guests: clank, wurghhh, boing, hack, gurgle. As I lay awake, I reflected that when the Pythons stayed in the Gleneagles, Torquay, the model for Fawlty Towers, at least they could swap notes and laugh about it together. I was alone. \ue136Leaving the place at last (the towels arrived 14 hours after I checked in), I saw a young man on a bike, navigating a series of dual carriageways and roundabouts by riding, near the kerb, on the wrong side of the road. He was talking into a mobile phone and must have had a fine sense of balance, because he was able to use his left hand to direct a V-sign to each of the many drivers who honked him. There&apos;s no need to write and tell me that most cyclists aren&apos;t like that. I know: it&apos;s only a small majority who get the rest a bad name. And I rather admired his skill and chutzpah. \ue136I&apos;ve mentioned our fox problem before. Now, not content with swaggering down the street like hoodies on their way to a kebab shop, they climb over the fence and dig up our lawn, apparently for fun. So my wife bought several brands of wild animal repellent. She might as well have been sprinkling chicken nuggets. The foxes returned every night. Then she read that what really scares them is elephant manure. A friend of ours lives in Africa, where pachyderm poo is as easy to find as empty burger boxes and Coke cans here. On his latest trip home, he heroically brought four carefully wrapped plastic bagfuls in his baggage, and bingo! Farewell foxes! If I were more energetic, I would set up a small import business and make a fortune. \ue136Another local problem is the Lib Dem council&apos;s bizarre decision to sell a glorious riverside site to developers for luxury homes. Every poll shows that residents loathe this scheme and the Tories, sensing they can use the fiasco to regain the council, are cashing in with gusto. The council has been as appallingly high-handed as anything from Militant days and have now only &quot;postponed&quot; the shambles because the developer&apos;s latest accounts will not be available until summer 2010. Everyone hopes that this is a face-saving device to get themselves off the hook. One person who has been unwontedly silent is our MP, Vince Cable, who, polls say, is the most popular politician in the country. His autobiography, Free Radical, is almost out and he is to speak about it at the Richmond Theatre a week tomorrow. But ticket sales are sluggish and some suspect that it&apos;s because he&apos;s failed to speak publicly against the council&apos;s awful plans. Vince, you are almost a national treasure! Ignore these local tyrants! \ue136Mention Tony Benn and you get hate mail from his admirers, and useful info from those who worked with him. Last week, I pointed out that some events do not appear in his candid diaries if they show him in a poor light. Now Monica Foot writes from north London: &quot;As his press officer in the Chesterfield byelection, I was amazed to see that he snaps his tape recorder OFF the minute he stops speaking himself.

It must be a strangely dislocated experience for Chris Latham, once a green and gold stalwart but now an honorary Pom living in Worcester. Even now he cannot quite help himself when discussing his old mates, using the word &quot;we&quot; as if he were still a current squad member. His competitive edge, at 34, remains sharper than the average butcher&apos;s knife. It is a useful reminder that England will be making a grave error if they assume the mob stumbling off the plane from Tokyo, allegedly riven by internal strife, are there for the taking at Twickenham next Saturday. That is certainly the belief of Australia&apos;s erstwhile full-back, whose views come with the impressive weight of 79 Test caps and 40 tries for the Wallabies \u2013 second only to David Campese \u2013 behind them. Latham always could kick a long ball and his instinctive punt is that Australia will be dangerous opponents, whatever the outcome against New Zealand today. His reasoning is simple and reflects the mindset of every Aussie athlete under the pump. &quot;A desperate Wallaby team coming over as underdogs with a point to prove is probably the best situation an Australian side could be in,&quot; stressed Latham this week. &quot;It is going to be a long tour, we haven&apos;t had the best Tri Nations and there&apos;s already a lot of off-the-field press talk but we relish those kind of challenges. On top of everything there is the opportunity to become the first Australian team since 1984 to do a grand slam. I&apos;ve no doubt that&apos;s what the boys will be focusing on, regardless of who didn&apos;t get made captain or whatever&apos;s been said. At the end of the day we&apos;re all professionals and we just want to play footy.&quot; Latham also suspects Australia may just see Twickenham as a more receptive venue than Dublin and Cardiff. &quot;Wales and Ireland are obviously going to be strong, not least because they&apos;ve been least interrupted by injury. Those two countries are the hard ones to beat. I&apos;m not saying England are going to be easybeats but there are going to be harder games than others.&quot; Listening to Latham&apos;s slow, measured opinions and dry country-boy delivery, it is easy to see why he served Australia with such distinction for so long. Growing up in far-flung Narrabri, he took up rugby seriously only at the age of 18, which may account for his continued enthusiasm. Coming to Worcester with his wife \u2013 her father is English \u2013 and young family has altered his focus but in no way diminished his desire to win. &quot;I don&apos;t see, with the squad we have, why we cannot finish in the top six. Individuals simply need to start believing we are good enough.&quot; At Sixways they are used to seeing Latham training at the club on his days off; despite a year that has included a fractured shoulder blade and a nasty head knock that caused a temporary loss of feeling in his limbs, he is confident his body will allow him to extend his stay for a third season. &quot;The injuries weren&apos;t age-related, they were freaks. I&apos;m a pretty honest person with myself and if I thought the body couldn&apos;t cope I wouldn&apos;t hang around.&quot; He has already learned a lot, either way, about the British psyche. &quot;I&apos;m not speaking negatively of the culture here but it certainly makes you appreciate your own upbringing and what you take for granted. It is difficult in midwinter when you&apos;re going out to train at around 10am and you&apos;re only just hitting sunlight. They&apos;re things you&apos;ve got to accept. You can&apos;t dwell on them or you&apos;ll get dragged down. Everything is different. My wife and myself are two super-organised people, probably overly so. We still weren&apos;t prepared for anything when we actually got here.&quot; He pauses momentarily, trying to articulate the biggest contrast. &quot;Home for me in Australia was where I slept and that was basically it. If I wasn&apos;t training I&apos;d probably be with my family at the beach or camping. Over here, home is pretty much where you stay and park yourself, particularly in the winter. A lot of life is about indoors. You have indoor play centres for kids; in Australia I never saw the point of them. Things like that are very difficult, if not impossible, to get used to.&quot; The style of rugby in this season&apos;s Premiership has tended to be equally alien. Latham made his name as a full-back always keen to have a go but Worcester, away to Newcastle tomorrow, are frequently required to display more caution. &quot;The main aim in the Super 14 is to score four tries and get a bonus point. That&apos;s the first focal point. Here, it&apos;s &apos;win at whatever cost and get away from the relegation zone&apos;. It&apos;s a mindset you&apos;d love to change. For me, playing open, running rugby is a lot more fun than tactical kicking.&quot; Like many others, he suspects the game&apos;s administrators have several other major issues on their hands. &quot;The collision part of the game is definitely getting into that grey area where the hits are bigger and fiercer. In some areas, referees and the touch judges are also destroying the pure aspect of the game, particularly at the breakdown. &quot;I remember when I first started and got caught at the bottom of a ruck. I got shoed out the back, legally, by about six or seven pairs of boots. You think, &apos;I&apos;m never going to do that again.&apos; Now you can get in there on the wrong side and, at worst, it&apos;s a 50-50 penalty. More games are being won or lost by kickers and I see that as the main difference between northern and southern hemisphere rugby. Here, it&apos;s all about winning field position and the tactical kicking battle.&quot; Players with Latham&apos;s can-do attitude, however, will always be resourceful adversaries and the next generation of Wallabies are no different.

Global capitalism, to judge from John Gray&apos;s analysis in False Dawn, rests on equivalent faults. Crisis and conflict are in the foundations. The book was written a decade before the credit crunch that might arguably have been market capitalism&apos;s &quot;big one&quot;. This paperback version has an updated foreword to embed the current crisis in the gloomy narrative of the original edition, which now looks prophetic. At least, for the most part it does. Gray did underestimate the reactive power of states to prop up the system in a global market earthquake. &quot;National governments\u2026 can no longer implement the ambitious counter-cyclical policies that lifted their economies out of recession in the postwar period,&quot; he wrote in 1998. But in 2008-09, that is what many national governments have done. Sadly, states have failed to enact reforms that might avert a similar future crisis. Global capitalism took a beating, but it has been hosed down with taxpayers&apos; money and is back in the ring. If we are indeed returning to some more brittle and discredited version of &quot;business as usual&quot;, the structural problems identified by Gray become all the more dangerous. At the heart of his analysis is a rebuttal of the right-wing assertion that free markets are a natural state of human affairs. Gray then demolishes the claim that liberalisation \u2013 opening areas of the economy to market forces \u2013 is somehow an act of democratic emancipation. Markets are indeed ancient, but they are traditionally restrained by social institutions. The kind of revolution desired by conservative ideologues requires, paradoxically, a massive application of central state power, subordinating society to the market. That makes the project of free-market globalisation hardly less deluded in its utopian aspirations than Bolshevik Marxism and similarly fated to a catastrophic unravelling \u2013 bigger, even, than the one we have just narrowly avoided."}, {"sentences": ["Known to road engineers, slightly alarmingly, as a &quot;pedestrian scramble&quot;, it is modelled on the famously frantic junction adjoining Shibuya station in central Tokyo."], "tags": ["London", "Boris Johnson", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-02T14:51:47Z", "title": "X marks the spot: new Oxford Circus crossing opens", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/02/x-oxford-circus-crossing", "article": "     Arta Johnson began her intrepid diagonal traverse of Oxford Circus at a brisk stride, only breaking into a gentle trot for the final few metres as the pedestrian lights turned red and the massed lines of buses and motorbikes revved their engines impatiently. &quot;Oh my, it&apos;s quite a distance,&quot; said the 69-year-old Canadian visitor as she reached the safe ground of the south-eastern pavement, just a couple of minutes after the redesigned junction was formally opened. &quot;I didn&apos;t realise I was being such a pioneer. I just saw the green man and set off. It didn&apos;t seem like I had much time so I had to pick up the pace near the end. We had these sorts of crossings about 40 years ago in Calgary, but they got rid of them after a while as there were a few problems.&quot; For many years the cramped, congested stretch where Oxford Street and Regent Street meet in the centre of London was one of the UK&apos;s least pleasant places to be a pedestrian. Much of the limited pavement space was filled with railings and concrete balustrades, intended to funnel the impatient crowds of tourists, shoppers and commuters across roads and into tube entrances but mainly bringing bottlenecks and, particularly ahead of Christmas, occasional gridlock. The redesigned Oxford Circus, which opened this morning after a two-year, \u00a35m makeover, contains two big innovations. As well as crossing the intersection laterally, pedestrians now have a 30-second window when all traffic stops and they can go at a diagonal along a giant X marked into the junction with metal studs. Known to road engineers, slightly alarmingly, as a &quot;pedestrian scramble&quot;, it is modelled on the famously frantic junction adjoining Shibuya station in central Tokyo. The redesign also removes roadside barriers and much of the pavement clutter. This boosts available space for pedestrians by around two-thirds, as well as \u2013 the designers hope \u2013 encouraging all road users towards a more thoughtful, responsible attitude. A team from Atkins, the engineering and design group which managed the project, used software of the type which created vast battle scenes in the Lord of the Rings films to create 3D animations showing how the throngs might interact. This appeared to prove that an X-shaped junction allowed the crowds, which can peak at around 40,000 people an hour, to cross far more efficiently. But there were nonetheless some understandable nerves as the first real-life pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles interacted following a slightly chaotic opening ceremony which saw Boris Johnson, the London mayor, strike a huge Japanese gong wheeled into the briefly closed junction. &quot;We are very confident that this will work well \u2013 once people have got the hang of it,&quot; a hopeful Johnson said afterwards. One police community support officer, who asked not to be named, had his doubts: &quot;You get a lot of pick-pocketing in the crowds so I suppose it&apos;s good there&apos;s more space. But it&apos;s based on the assumption that everyone&apos;s going to act intelligently, which is quite an assumption to make.&quot; While pedestrians get 30 seconds to make the 25-metre diagonal crossing, several early users were, like Arta Johnson, slightly unnerved at the speed with which the green pedestrian light switches to red, a tactic intended to spur on any dawdlers. But within half an hour the traditional last-minute sprint was going ahead as usual. Perhaps the biggest change was the lack of light-jumping by cyclists \u2013 the criss-crossing streams of pedestrians proved too thick even for bike messengers to brave. &quot;It feels like a long way to go, and it&apos;s maybe a little bit frightening,&quot; said Mads J\u00f8rgensen, 29, after completing the walk with his wife, Katrine. &quot;But then we live in Copenhagen.

Asked whether Australia were sacrificing short-term results in an effort to prepare a side for the 2011 World Cup, Deans defended the squad selection. &quot;The reality is you can only cater for the future by what you do now, and you can only cater for now by focusing on it. The suggestion is that we have left a lot of blokes behind who could be here. The reality is there is only one bloke who is fit that we left behind and that is Ali Baxter.&quot; &quot;Who mentioned rebuilding?&quot; he said when a similar question came up afterwards. At the same time he admitted that the fixture against Gloucester would be &quot;an education&quot; for a lot of the players involved, even though 10 of them were on the bench or in the starting XV against New Zealand last Saturday, and, as Giteau later pointed out, &quot;some of these guys haven&apos;t even played at Twickenham before&quot;. Pressed to explain his side&apos;s poor form in 2009, an exasperated Deans shrugged the question aside. &quot;We have not been able to beat NZ this year but in many ways we&apos;re not dissimilar to them. They also have a team in the Tri-Nations they weren&apos;t able to beat, South Africa, neither of us is Tri-Nations champions. &quot;International rugby is tough. France came down south and beat New Zealand, we were able to beat France, England were up 29-0 over France at half-time. Who is going to do well at the weekend? Don&apos;t know. We&apos;ll find out.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["If anything, New Zealand&apos;s 32-19 weekend win over Australia in Tokyo has increased the sense of expectancy, with both teams showing signs of an upturn en route to Europe.", "Saturday&apos;s game in Tokyo also highlighted the Wallabies&apos; inability to finish what they start."], "tags": ["Autumn internationals", "England rugby union team", "Martin Johnson", "Wales rugby union team", "Australia rugby union team", "New Zealand rugby union team", "South Africa rugby team", "Ian McGeechan", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-02T18:30:00Z", "title": "Martin Johnson faces race to reveal England's true identity", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/01/england-wales-autumn-internationals", "article": "The next four weeks should be as revealing as any since the knockout stages of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. If anything, New Zealand&apos;s 32-19 weekend win over Australia in Tokyo has increased the sense of expectancy, with both teams showing signs of an upturn en route to Europe. If the northern hemisphere sides are to silence their southern friends this month, they will have to do so the hard way. It is high time, certainly, for the more talkative home nations to walk the walk, starting with England and Wales this weekend. If Australia and the All Blacks leave Twickenham and Cardiff with comfortable victories, it will instantly stall the momentum generated by the British and Irish Lions in South Africa in the summer. Having seen Ian McGeechan&apos;s squad come so close to unseating the world&apos;s best team from a standing start, there is no excuse for backward steps at home. For Martin Johnson, in particular, these are crucial days. His England need to forge a consistent identity, regardless of injuries. What, precisely, is their modus operandi, apart from stopping the opposition playing? Lawrence Dallaglio was interesting in print . &quot;I&apos;d like England and the other [home nation] teams to have a harsher mentality. Let&apos;s get into these touring teams and send them home defeated.&quot; It is a timely rallying cry. Including three probable warm-up games in the summer of 2011, England have 22 games left prior to the World Cup in New Zealand. Essentially, that boils down to 10 fixtures between now and June, followed by 15 months of fine-tuning. It is a smallish window in which to fashion a world champion team, something England can presently only aspire to. At some stage Johnson will have to speculate a little, rather than rely solely on the tried and tested. In that respect, if nothing else, Australia are heading in the right direction, despite Saturday&apos;s seventh straight loss to New Zealand, a long flight from Japan and the distraction of Tuesday&apos;s trip to Kingsholm, where they would be ill-advised to order the sushi. Better to lose a few games now than arrive on Kiwi soil in two years&apos; time without a clue as to which youngsters might add something special. That is not to say the present should be ignored, merely that promising players like James O&apos;Connor and Will Genia could be world-beaters by 2011. Of course England need a couple of decent autumn results but, above all, they need to deliver a statement of intent. If there is a choice to be made between a 35-year-old, or a younger player of equal ability, now is also the moment to take a calculated punt. That impression was further strengthened by watching Saturday&apos;s Currie Cup final between the Blue Bulls and the Cheetahs. A mere six months ago, Heinrich Brussow was not even in the Springbok squad; subsequently, the Free State flanker has developed into one of the world&apos;s most influential players. The Blue Bulls still won, but it was a stirring, skilful contest in which even Victor Matfield and co began to look distinctly mortal. There can be little doubt the game, at the highest level, is faster and more intense than it was even two years ago. Fitness is increasingly paramount and, while Johnson is satisfied his men are making progress in that regard, the English set-piece platform is no longer a guaranteed antidote, even with the rolling maul back in business. The game moves on quickly these days and a forward pack without real pace is going nowhere. The Lions tour, in many ways, has also removed a whole load of caveats, given what McGeechan&apos;s squad achieved in a matter of weeks. Saturday&apos;s game in Tokyo also highlighted the Wallabies&apos; inability to finish what they start. England should be beating them at home; if not, their remaining autumn games against Argentina and New Zealand will assume a very different hue. It is a similar story for Wales. Start well and it could be a special season for them. What a shame Mike Phillips, Adam Jones and Lee Byrne are all crocked; a precious win over New Zealand is not impossible, even so. First they must hold their own at the breakdown, where New Zealand and South Africa continue to reign supreme, and replicate the kicking accuracy of Dan Carter and Morne Steyn. There is so much else. How will Scotland go under Andy Robinson? Better must be the hope. Will Italy&apos;s game against the All Blacks at San Siro in Milan prove a turning point in the Azzurri&apos;s history? What price England&apos;s women against the Kiwi counterparts? The game of the autumn, either way, will be the Springboks&apos; trip to Croke Park to face the grand slammers of Ireland. My feeling is that no touring team will return home undefeated. Then again, the north were making similarly optimistic noises last year."}, {"sentences": ["One of the early cyclists across the new junction, Dougal Wilson, a 38-year-old video director, confessed to some nerves, despite being sufficiently traffic-savvy to correctly indentify the inspiration, Shibuya in central Tokyo:  I&apos;ve got to confess, looking at it now makes me a little nervous.", "I&apos;ve used the Shibuya crossing in Tokyo and it seems to work well, but in Japan the pedestrians are a little bit more restrained, I suppose."], "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-03T06:00:00Z", "title": "Is the Oxford Circus X-crossing the future of urban cycling? | Peter Walker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2009/nov/03/oxford-circus-urban-cycling", "article": "     If, like millions of others, you plan to join the Christmas shopping throngs at Oxford Circus in London in the coming weeks, you might notice something different \u2013 a completely redesigned junction where pedestrians can cross the perennially jammed intersection of Oxford and Regent Streets diagonally, as well as laterally. A big part of this revamp has involved removing the metal barriers and concrete balustrades which formerly penned in pedestrians. Aside from greatly boosting the available space in one of Europe&apos;s most congested pedestrian zones, the grand theory goes that if you give people more freedom they will take greater responsibility for their own actions. This notion, known as shared space, or the naked street, was most vigorously popularised by the pioneering Dutch road engineer Hans Monderman. &quot;If you treat drivers like idiots, they act as idiots,&quot; was his maxim. At its most radical, for example in the Dutch village of Makkinga, all traffic lights, road signs and other bits of street clutter are removed. As is often the way, the UK has lagged behind some other European nations in trying out the technique, although a couple of places have made tentative steps. The idea has particular resonance for urban cyclists as it cuts to the heart of a key city transport debate: should cyclists, along with pedestrians, be kept apart from motorised traffic, or should everyone attempt to muddle along together in a spirit of mutual respect and responsibility? For a cyclist approaching the new-look Oxford Circus, this boils down to one, more urgent question: what&apos;s to stop an absent-minded pedestrian, particularly a visitor used to looking the other way at junctions, from stepping out right into my path at the wrong moment? At the official opening ceremony, I put this dilemma to London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, who broke off from his stream of cheery, punning soundbites (&quot;It&apos;s a crossing with the X factor!&quot;; &quot;This a triumph of diagonal thinking!&quot;; &quot;X marks the spot!&quot;) to consider it in full seriousness:  It&apos;s obviously a factor, but all the evidence from other European capitals about shared space is that it brings a greater sense of awareness between pedestrians and cyclists. People have got to learn to look out for each other and trust each other.  One of the early cyclists across the new junction, Dougal Wilson, a 38-year-old video director, confessed to some nerves, despite being sufficiently traffic-savvy to correctly indentify the inspiration, Shibuya in central Tokyo:  I&apos;ve got to confess, looking at it now makes me a little nervous. You get a lot of what you could call opportunistic pedestrians at this junction, and I am worried they might start dashing into the road. I think it&apos;s a good idea in theory. I&apos;m just not sure how well it&apos;s going to work. I&apos;ve used the Shibuya crossing in Tokyo and it seems to work well, but in Japan the pedestrians are a little bit more restrained, I suppose.  My personal belief is that schemes like this, not just in London but in many urban areas, are the future. I&apos;d far rather feel a part of the mainstream traffic rather than getting shunted into some narrow, glass-strewn, leaf-slippy bike lane. It&apos;s my road as much as any car driver&apos;s, and I perhaps resent such treatment. But equally, I accept that cycle lanes make many riders feel safer.

In dropping 10 players from his 32-man squad, with Ben Foden the most notable omission, Johnson has overwhelmingly gone for power at the expense of subtlety, not least in the unexpected shape of Ayoola Erinle, the human battering ram currently playing for Biarritz. The uncapped Erinle, at 6ft 3in and 17st 4lb, is potentially the type of impact replacement to make opponents wince, particularly in a backline set to contain the 6ft 7in Matt Banahan, the strong-legged Danny Hipkiss and the explosive Ugo Monye at full-back. Shane Geraghty, poised to start at inside centre outside Jonny Wilkinson, would appear to be the exception proving the rule that big is beautiful in modern rugby. Given Foden, Mathew Tait and David Strettle were all in the original autumn squad with the 29-year-old Erinle nowhere to be seen, England&apos;s recent injury blitz has clearly persuaded Johnson to opt for as few frills as possible against an Australia side which, if nothing else, will be battle-hardened following last Saturday&apos;s Bledisloe Cup encounter in Tokyo. Pretty patterns are far less important to Johnson than winning the collisions. This is great news for the Nigeria-born Erinle, formerly of Wasps and Leicester, and less so for Tait, Foden and the Australia midfield. Erinle, whose given name translates as &quot;joy in wealth&quot;, is an intriguing character \u2013 the son of a gynaecologist, he was raised and schooled in Reading and has publicly expressed an interest in astrophysics \u2013 but on the field he prefers the most direct route possible. Assuming he gets on to win his first cap, he could give a whole new meaning to Big Bang theory. England&apos;s management, though, make no excuses for wanting to play to the strengths of the players they possess. The Premiership tends to breed bashers \u2013 even if they subsequently relocate to France \u2013 and the attack coach Brian Smith, who probably had more sophisticated plans in mind when he took the role, admitted the coaching team have had a rethink following last autumn&apos;s harsh reality check. &quot;I think we probably make better decisions now, both in selection and in how we try and play,&quot; said Smith. &quot;We&apos;ve put together a way of playing to highlight our strengths. We&apos;ve pretty much cut our cloth accordingly in terms of selection. Our philosophy as a team is that we want to go after the opposition. We want to be proactive in all areas.&quot; Smith, in other words, recognises the need for England to be more aggressive, both with ball in hand and around the breakdown. Getting over the gainline and competing hard at the contact area against the top southern hemisphere sides matters infinitely more in contemporary rugby than sexy backline moves. &quot;Other countries will try and slag England off as being stodgy and boring but I don&apos;t buy into that at all,&quot; insisted Smith. &quot;Our challenge is making sure we&apos;re dangerous enough without making things over-complicated. If you try and get too tricky you can come unstuck.&quot; That appears to be England&apos;s overriding mantra ahead of this weekend&apos;s fixture, with Northampton&apos;s Courtney Lawes now virtually assured of a first cap off the bench at the age of 20. The expectation is that the former Tiger skipper Johnson will also pick an all-Leicester back row, with the World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson returning for Dylan Hartley, victim of a slight hamstring strain last week which could not have been worse timed. Thompson, interestingly, is one of five France-based players in the 22. It will scarcely ease Hartley&apos;s pain to hear John Wells, the England forwards coach, challenging individuals to make the most of the opportunities offered by injuries to others. &quot;The long-term scenario is that some people may not make the 2011\u00a0World Cup because time may have caught up with them. It&apos;s a great opportunity for these younger guys. We realise we&apos;ve got a number of quality young players coming through and it&apos;s very important they get game time. We want to see them front up and the suggestion is that they will.&quot; Australia are due to name their side on Thursday but Smith, a former Wallaby himself, was at pains not to pour fuel on the age-old sporting rivalry between the nations. &quot;I honestly think all that 1970s Pom-bashing is ancient history \u2026 the Australian rugby public have great respect for what England have done since they shoved it down Australia&apos;s throat in 2003 on home soil.&quot; As for insider knowledge, he insists he is past his sell-by date. &quot;I&apos;ve lived half my adult life in the UK and I&apos;m out of touch with a whole generation of players in Australia.

Polota, once a No8, set things rolling \u2013 literally \u2013 with a 40-metre canter that ended five metres short from where the fly-half Quade Cooper spotted Ryan Cross free out wide. The inch-perfect punt, plus the fly-half&apos;s conversion made it 10-0 before Gloucester replied in kind. Spencer turned down nine kickable points but then conjured up a cross-kick of his own which the right wing, Charlie Sharples, caught and released out of the tackle to put the 19-year-old Freddie Burns in on the overlap. Spencer missed the conversation and 21-year-old Cooper tipped the battle of the fly-halves firmly in youth&apos;s direction with a clinical break that Tyrone Smith turned into a try.

Now Mickey Mouse and his bosses at Walt Disney face another challenge: to win the hearts and minds of the nation&apos;s booming middle class. The company announced today that Beijing has approved the creation of a Disneyland-style park in Shanghai; its first in mainland China and its fourth outside the United States after Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong. The 1,000-acre site attraction will reportedly cost $3.5bn (\u00a32.1bn) \u2013 making it one of the largest foreign investments on the mainland. The announcement comes two weeks before Sino-American relations come under the spotlight with US president Barack Obama&apos;s visit. &quot;China is one of the most dynamic, exciting and important countries in the world, and this approval marks a very significant milestone for the Walt Disney Company in mainland China,&quot; the firm&apos;s president and CEO Robert Iger said in a statement. More detailed talks between Disney and Shanghai authorities are ongoing, with issues thought to include the local partners for the park. A Chinese consortium is expected to contribute about 60% of the investment. Analysts say it is likely to be years before the attraction \u2013 which may open in 2014 \u2013 is able to turn a profit for Disney, which has a multibillion pound annual turnover. But the company&apos;s parks also help to promote the overall brand. It already has branded language schools in Shanghai and its products are on sale in around 6,000 outlets across China. Though critics have often held up Disney as a symbol of American cultural colonisation, the company tweaks its products for new audiences. Feng shui experts were hired to advise on the layout of Hong Kong Disneyland, and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 shows are in Cantonese and Mandarin as well as English. But the site, which opened in 2005, has failed to attract as many visitors as expected. The company is preparing a $465m expansion to increase its appeal. Disney insisted that the Shanghai park would not compete with the Hong Kong site, but complement it. Analysts suggest the older location will still be more convenient for families in southern China, while the new site is perfectly placed for the fast-expanding middle class in Shanghai and other wealthy cities nearby. &quot;It&apos;s great news and we will definitely go,&quot; said Jin Guifang, from nearby Hangzhou. Her family visited the Hong Kong park two years ago at the request of her 12-year-old daughter Shihui. &quot;I enjoyed it as an adult too and since we came back Shihui has loved all the Disney stuff,&quot; she said. Christopher Marangi, senior analyst with Gabelli and Co in New York, told Reuters: &quot;They&apos;ve been laying the groundwork for a park for many years by exposing the population to Disney properties, film, TV and merchandising. &quot;Adding a physical presence in the form of a park would really complete and add to the value chain in China.&quot; From the Chinese point of view, building the theme park should create thousands of jobs. But villagers at the site have already begun to talk about relocation and compensation. &quot;If the country wants to develop this place, of course we have to support this,&quot; 62-year-old Shen Jinbao told Reuters. &quot;But the government must also treat the residents and villagers here well.&quot; Media struggle It&apos;s hard to escape western brand names such as Kentucky Fried Chicken and Nike in Chinese cities. But media companies such as Walt Disney and Rupert Murdoch&apos;s News Corporation have far less to show after years of slogging to break into the market. The government is still anxious about the potential influence of overseas media. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say this is a one-off gain,&quot; Vivek Couto, executive director of Media Partners Asia, told Reuters of the Disney theme park deal. &quot;But it&apos;s in a non-sensitive space. It&apos;s got nothing to do with television content that can be politically sensitive or competitive with other major Chinese companies in the space.&quot; Although Disney programmes are shown on Chinese television, the company has not been able to launch its own channel."}, {"sentences": ["This was a very strong team.&quot; It is for the moment, with Dan Carter selected at No10, although there is some doubt over his recovery from the bruise to his calf sustained in the victory over Australia in Tokyo last Saturday."], "tags": ["Autumn internationals", "Wales rugby union team", "New Zealand rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-04T20:33:16Z", "title": "All Blacks see chance to experiment against Wales", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/04/new-zealand-wales-autumn-internationals", "article": "Having seen his All Black selection lashed by hailstones at their training in Llandarcy, near Swansea, their coach, Graham Henry said how good it was to be back. The former coach of Wales, back in Cardiff under cover to unveil his team, then put his earnest face on and said the policy of the tour was first to enjoy the games and second to &quot;give everyone an opportunity, to see who is up to international standard&quot;. This sounded like a temptation to experiment. Into the starting team to face Wales comes Zac Guildford, 20 and from Hawke&apos;s Bay. Henry mentioned the challenges the wing has been through this year, referring to the death of his father, Rob, who had gone to support his son in the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Japan. On the bench will be Ben Smith, a 23-year-old utility back from Otago, another uncapped player. Recognising the perils of daring to suggest this was anything but serious business, Henry stressed the selection was in no way &quot;disrespectful. This was a very strong team.&quot; It is for the moment, with Dan Carter selected at No10, although there is some doubt over his recovery from the bruise to his calf sustained in the victory over Australia in Tokyo last Saturday. If Carter fails to be fit in time Stephen Donald will step up. Brad Thorn has a twinge in his neck, and if the All Blacks were to lose their second-row as well as their outside-half they would lose experience to the tune of 97 caps. And perhaps Wales might seriously believe they could end their 56-year drought against New Zealand. Richie McCaw is one reason why Wales are unlikely to win. He is safely installed at No7, the ultimate loosie, the outstanding player of his age. Martyn Williams, back in the nick of timeafter shoulder surgery to face McCaw, is blessed with a rugby genius of his own, but when it comes to the aura that has become as much a talking point before this Test as any haematoma, McCaw is a peerless purveyor of a sense of invincibility. McCaw said last weekend&apos;s game against Australia would prove useful preparation for facing Wales. &quot;Having that game under the belt will help,&quot; he said. &quot;We perhaps didn&apos;t have enough field position in the first half. We had a couple of opportunities and in one I spilt the ball when we probably would have had five points. So little things like that, if we can iron those out, we will put teams under pressure.&quot; In the absence of the suspended Tony Woodcock in the front row \u2013 and after talk about aura the scrum has been another hot topic, especially in Wales, trying to fill the large hole left by Adam Jones \u2013 Wyatt Crockett will win his second cap on the loose-head, and Neemia Tialata his 39th on the tight. &quot;Woodcock is a big loss but Wyatt&apos;s been with us all season as well and trained really well all year,&quot; said the All Blacks assistant coach, Steve Hansen. &quot;He probably deserves a crack anyway, so it&apos;s a great opportunity for him to come out and show us what he&apos;s made of.&quot; Brendon Leonard plays at scrum-half, with Jimmy Cowan dropping to the bench. Any notion of inexperience here, as on the wing, is countered by the presence of the somewhat uncompromising Ma&apos;a Nonu at inside-centre and the only slightly less robust Mils Muliaina at full-back. Might Wales really be in with a shout? Here&apos;s what their other former coach, Hansen, now in charge of the NZ three-quarters, had to say: &quot;When you&apos;re in a drought, every day is one closer to the day when it will rain. Wales will win one day. I hope it&apos;s not on Saturday.&quot; The forecast is for rain on the weekend but the Millennium Stadium roof will protect the All Blacks.

Police said they had yet to confirm the reports and were still no closer to finding Tatsuya Ichihashi, two-and-a-half years after Ms Hawker&apos;s badly beaten body was found buried in a bathtub on the balcony of his flat in Gyotoku, a suburban town in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo.     Tatsuya Ichihashi    Ichihashi, 30, has reportedly visited multiple clinics to render his face unrecognisable from the one that appears on tens of thousands of wanted posters. Several newspapers, citing unnamed police sources, said he had given false names and addresses at the clinics and failed to return for follow-up appointments, denying police the opportunity to arrest him. The family of Ms Hawker, from Brandon, near Coventry, voiced dismay at not being informed earlier of the most dramatic development yet in the hunt for her killer. &quot;We have received no official confirmation of the reports despite attempts to do so,&quot; Hawker&apos;s parents and two sisters said in a statement issued last night. &quot;[We] would like to know who the surgeons were. Where did Ichihashi, the only suspect, obtain the money for the operation, and who is hiding him? Which hospitals and clinics carried out the work and why would they operate on a man who is allegedly the most wanted man in Japan?&quot; The family said they would &quot;never give up hope&quot; that Ichihashi will be caught. &quot;He has had two years of freedom too long,&quot; they said. &quot;We would like the police to contact us and explain the situation properly, so that we know the facts, not just rumours.&quot; After initially praising the police effort to locate Ichihashi, the Hawkers lost patience with the investigation in March this year, ridiculing the release of five lifesize cutouts of the suspect as a gimmick. Takeshi Otani, a spokesman at Gyotoku police station, said investigators were in the process of confirming the sightings. &quot;All we have at the moment are reports by several clinics that a man who resembles the suspect underwent surgical procedures,&quot; Otani said. &quot;The media are saying it was definitely him, but we don&apos;t know that for sure. &quot;We didn&apos;t inform the Hawker family because we have yet to confirm the reports, but we have been keeping them up to date with the progress of the investigation through the British embassy in Tokyo.&quot; Otani said the Chiba prefectural police had put 140 officers on the case, adding: &quot;There are police officers across Japan who are doing their best to find Ichihashi.&quot; The Yomiuri newspaper said Ichihashi had visited a clinic in the south-western city of Fukuoka in mid-October, but his request for surgery to change the shape of his mouth had been refused. Later the same month he reportedly had an operation on his nose in the central city of Nagoya. Suspicious clinic staff alerted police, but Ichihashi failed to return days later to have his stitches removed. Photographs taken by the clinic revealed that he had undergone extensive cosmetic surgery, including the addition of a crease to his eyelids to give him a more &quot;western&quot; appearance, work to shrink his protruding lower lip and the removal of two moles on his left cheek. The patient&apos;s height matched that of Ichihashi, although if it was him, he had grown a beard and appeared to have put on weight, the Yomiuri said. Ms Hawker&apos;s naked body was found buried in a bathtub filled with horticultural soil on the balcony of Ichihashi&apos;s flat on 26 March 2007. The 22-year-old had been severely beaten and strangled, and her arms and legs bound with plastic cord. Ichihashi, who had stalked Ms Hawker and followed her home on one occasion, evaded nine officers and fled barefoot as they approached him for questioning later the same day. Hours before her death, security cameras captured Ms Hawker giving Ichihashi a private language lesson in a nearby cafe after he had begged her to teach him English. One theory is that he lured her to his flat after pretending he had insufficient cash with him to pay for the lesson. Subsequent leads have come to nothing, despite 8,000 reported sightings. In June, police increased the reward for information leading to his arrest from 1 million yen (\u00a37,000) to 10 million yen. Ms Hawker had been teaching English at a branch of the Nova English conversation school since October 2006, after graduating from Leeds University earlier the same year."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Next year will basically see a focus on cost cutting,&quot; said Koichi Ogawa at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-05T09:29:43Z", "title": "Toyota's return to profits fuels growing optimism in car industry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/05/toyota-profit-unexpected", "article": "Hopes that the global car industry is easing out of its slump gathered pace today after Toyota said it had returned to profit in the last quarter and cut its forecast losses for the full year. The world&apos;s biggest carmaker surprised industry observers by posting an unexpected \u00a521.8bn (\u00a3146m) net profit for the three months to September, drastically down on the \u00a5139bn profit of last year but a sign of recovery nonetheless. It also trimmed its projected losses for the year to March 2010 to \u00a5200bn, from an earlier prediction of \u00a5450bn. That would be a significant improvement on the \u00a5437bn annual loss it reported in March, the worst performance in the company&apos;s 72-year-history. It expects to sell 7.03m vehicles this year, up from its earlier forecast of 6.6m. Toyota, whose president, Akio Toyoda, last month said it was just one step from &quot;irrelevance or death&quot;, said cost-cutting measures and rising sales in Japan and China had helped offset to the damage to profits inflicted by the rising yen. Worries persist, however, that Toyota and other carmakers could see sales shrink again when government schemes in Japan, the US, China and Europe to encourage consumers to trade in old models for new, fuel-efficient cars come to an end. Toyota was expected to be the only Japanese carmaker to report a quarterly loss as it struggles under the weight of its huge global operation, built when it was registering record profits and chasing General Motors to become the world&apos;s biggest carmaker. Instead, its second quarter profits were markedly up on the \u00a5194bn loss it suffered in the April-to-June period. While demand in the US remains sluggish, Toyota has benefited at home from a revival in demand for its Prius petrol-electric hybrid, Japan&apos;s best-selling passenger car for the past five months. Currency woes Yukitoshi Funo, Toyota&apos;s executive vice president, admitted that conditions in the US, traditionally its biggest market, were a major concern and that the firm would have to further reduce fixed costs to offset the yen&apos;s strength against the dollar. &quot;The overall business in the United States for us is still very severe,&quot; he told reporters. Toyota&apos;s results marked the end of an earnings season that could have been worse for Japan&apos;s battered carmakers, which have been forced to shed jobs and slash production as they feel the pinch from the global economic crisis. Yesterday Nissan said it was expecting an annual profit amid booming sales in China, while last week Honda also reported better than expected earnings. Analysts warned, however, that Toyota&apos;s cost-cutting regime would have to stay in place while the industry continues to recover. &quot;Next year will basically see a focus on cost cutting,&quot; said Koichi Ogawa at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. &quot;They really have to go back into the black next year. And considering the industry as a whole, it&apos;s hard to see next year&apos;s conditions being so remarkably good. There will have to be cost cuts and then expanding markets in the emerging economies. &quot;Toyota looks a little less attractive than other companies such as Honda and Nissan.&quot; The results were announced a day after Toyota said it was withdrawing from Formula One in an attempt to save about \u00a550bn a year, leaving the sport without a single Japanese manufacturer. General Motors&apos; decision to not sell its European operations has been seen as a sign that the car market is recovering.

Panasonic, the world&apos;s biggest maker of plasma TVs, is offering \u00a5402bn (\u00a32.7bn) to secure a majority stake in Sanyo and take advantage of its expertise in rapidly expanding &quot;green&quot; businesses such as solar panels and rechargeable batteries. Sanyo is the leading global supplier of rechargeable batteries for laptops, camera and other gadgets and its clients in the car industry include Honda, Ford and Peugeot Citroen. Panasonic, meanwhile, is jointly developing batteries for hybrid and electric cars with Toyota. By combining their prowess in solar and fuel cells, the Panasonic-Sanyo alliance is expected to tap into the growing market for green energy storage and production. Panasonic said the tender offer would last until 7 December at the price of \u00a5131 per share, nearly half Sanyo&apos;s current share price. Sanyo shares plummeted more than 20% to \u00a5172 in Tokyo today, a day after Panasonic formally announced the tender. The bid is expected to be successful because Sanyo&apos;s three major shareholders \u2013 Goldman Sachs, Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking \u2013 have already agreed to sell their combined shares at the offered price. In 2006 Sanyo was forced to issue \u00a5300bn in preferred shares, each of which can be exchanged for 10 common shares, to the three financial institutions at \u00a5700 a share to help it restructure after a sharp downturn in earnings. The proposed takeover would give Panasonic a 70% stake in Sanyo, although it is unlikely to realise its aim of a 100% stake, as other smaller shareholders may not be tempted to sell their shares at a vastly reduced price. Panasonic has had to wait almost a year while anti-monopoly authorities in China and the EU examined the bid. The US&apos;s anti-trust watchdog is expected to give its approval soon. Sanyo has struggled to perform in Japan&apos;s highly competitive electronics sector, although part of the blame lies with a 2004 earthquake that crippled its main chip plant \u2013 a key factor in the subsequent rescue bid by Goldman and the Japanese banks. In 2007 an accounting scandal forced the Osaka-based firm to appoint its first president from outside the company&apos;s founding family.

But a spectacular &quot;bike tree&quot; invention from Japan bowled me over when I was in Tokyo a couple of weeks ago. Fed up with bicycles locked to railings, piled on top of each other, blocking doorways and roads, a local council in the city installed the mechanical masterpiece. It&apos;s basically an automatic storage system for cycles and operates with computer tagging of bikes and either storage in a building or a basement structure. There are a number of locations where these bike trees are now in place in Tokyo \u2013 some hold 600-odd bikes, others more than 6,000. The concept came from the massive Japanese steel company JFE, whose engineering works division first started them in 2007 but are now spreading. The idea is quite simple, although no doubt the technology is fiendishly complicated. Bike owners who want a secure parking spot must register and pay a monthly fee \u2013 1,800 yen (around \u00a312 a month) \u2013 and students get discounts. Bikes are fitted with a small electronic tag. When the bike is placed into the ruts of the bike tree machine, a sensor logs the owner&apos;s details. A mechanical arm then emerges, pulls the bike into a cylindrical well and stores it at high speed in a free location. To retrieve the bike, the owner swipes a card through a reader and the bike is plucked from racks and brought back down \u2013 or up if it&apos;s a basement design \u2013 to earth. The process of retrieval normally takes 15 seconds but can be slightly longer (it took 30 seconds in my experience). The advantages are plain \u2013 your bike becomes theft-proof, you are encouraged to cycle to work and local authorities don&apos;t have to deal with unsightly and sometimes annoying bicycle clutter. The downside is that it costs a lot of money and the infrastructure involves serious resources. The tree&apos;s inventors at JFE are very proud of their invention and naturally curious as to whether it would catch on Europe.

The encouraging thing about the injury is that, unlike the week before the 2007 World Cup quarter-final against France in Cardiff when I also had a calf problem, it is the result of a whack, not a strain. I did play against the French, but this time I am hoping to last longer than the 50-odd minutes I managed then. &quot;I am feeling good. We have been managing the injury all week but I had a run with the team today and it comes down to how I respond in the morning.

The aura thing does not bother me: it&apos;s someone&apos;s personal opinion and I don&apos;t read anything into it. &quot;I Just concentrate on the game. The All Blacks jersey is special: as players, we all know our legacy and when you retire you want to have left something in it. We are rebuilding and as long as we keep improving in the next couple of years, we will be a real threat in the World Cup.

Not this week. At the Wallaby hotel in west London yesterday, there was polite bafflement when Digby Ioane, one half of Australia&apos;s reshuffled midfield partnership, was asked what he thought of Danny Hipkiss and Shane Geraghty. &quot;I really don&apos;t know what they&apos;re like,&quot; was Ioane&apos;s endearingly honest answer. England, with just four starting survivors from last year&apos;s corresponding fixture, are a largely closed book to their visitors, if not themselves. The reverse is also true to some degree, which is why tomorrow&apos;s game is so intriguing. News that the Wallabies have signed up to the &quot;Movember&quot; campaign and are growing facial hair to raise awareness of prostate cancer has hardly helped. Such players as Ioane, Quade Cooper and Ben Alexander could wander up and down Kensington High Street for days, with or without bushy Merv Hughes-style foliage on their upper lips, and still fail to attract a glimmer of recognition. The stage is set, therefore, for a relative unknown with a wispy moustache to make a name for himself in a fixture which Robbie Deans, the Wallaby coach, describes as the hardest game of his squad&apos;s tour. This may come as news to Ireland and Wales but Deans&apos;s rationale is clear enough. His team need a win and the opening Test of a grand slam trip is always a defining moment. &quot;It&apos;s the toughest,&quot; Deans insisted. &quot;It&apos;s England at Twickenham. We&apos;ll have to earn everything we get.&quot; To that end, Deans has made some significant tweaks to the side which lost 32-19 to the All Blacks in Tokyo last Saturday. The vastly experienced flanker George Smith is back for his 107th cap in place of David Pocock to tackle England for the 12th time in his career, second only among his compatriots to George Gregan. Adam Ashley-Cooper, a swallow-diving try-scorer at Twickenham last November in the Wallabies&apos; 28-14 victory, replaces young James O&apos;Connor at full-back, with Drew Mitchell on the left wing. Cooper and Ioane, meanwhile, are set to form one of the more exotically named midfield combos in the stadium&apos;s 100-year history. Quade and Digby, or Digby and Quade? Either way, they sound like a pair of metrosexual interior designers. As Gloucester discovered on Tuesday, however, the New Zealand-born Cooper can play. He was taken aback to get the call to start against England \u2013 &quot;When I saw it up on the screen I thought: &apos;Is this real or is it a dummy team?&apos;&quot; \u2013 but has the ability to take some of the weight off his fly-half, Matt Giteau. Ioane, in turn, was shaping up as one of the most exciting players of this year&apos;s Super 14 until he suffered a shoulder injury which required surgery. The two Queenslanders are not yet Tim Horan and Jason Little reincarnated, but they have played enough rugby together to be comfortable. &quot;Diggers can really hit and if someone goes on his outside he&apos;s got the wheels to get there,&quot; reported the 21-year-old Cooper, who scored 16 points at Kingsholm in his more customary position of No10. &quot;I feel very safe with him there.&quot; England will be keen to test that confidence but, even with the returning Jonny Wilkinson at their disposal, should also be wary of a Wallaby pack which has quietly beefed itself up since the 2007 World Cup quarter-final in Marseille. Benn Robinson is rated by the English scrum coach, Graham Rowntree, as the premier loose-head among the Tri\u2011Nations teams and Stephen Moore is a hooker with presence. The former Puma Patricio Noriega is now the Wallabies&apos; scrum guru and the days of quivering at the sight of an English pack are long gone. Including Ashley-Cooper, Australia also have eight players who sampled victory at Twickenham a year ago and enjoyed the taste. If the full-back&apos;s pencil moustache is nothing to boast about - &quot;We all had the opportunity to drop out on 1 November but that would have cost you \u00a3300. The figure drops \u00a310 every day ...&quot; - he has a healthy respect for Wilkinson&apos;s sword. &quot;When I see an England jersey, I always think: &apos;Tough, physical and direct.&apos; But if you ask me the same question in relation to Jonny I&apos;d say: &apos;Classy, tactical and very clever.&apos; I&apos;ve encountered him before at the 2007 World Cup. He was on his game and directed that England team around like a genuine leader. Jonny?

So I bought Haruki Murakami&apos;s book What I Talk About When I Talk About Running to inspire me to feats of endurance hitherto alien to my body, signed up to the Animal Snowcamp, and boarded the train to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. The train bar was sardine-tight, so I adjourned to my sticky-floored cabin to imbibe the wisdom of Murakami&apos;s athlete friend: &quot;Pain is inevitable,&quot; he says. &quot;Suffering is optional.&quot; Gathering at the Board&apos;n&apos;Lodge &quot;eco lodge&quot; just outside Bourg \u2013 base camp for Les Arcs, La Rosiere and St Foy \u2013 the group, 14 of us, met and greeted. A quick tour of the accommodation revealed the recycling rules and how all the power has been sourced from green energy providers. Even their minibuses are converted to run on biodiesel. They know they can&apos;t remove your carbon footprint, but where they are given ecological choices, they take them, from renovating chalets with natural products to donating some profit to five environmental charities. But there were also pain-relieving essentials such as a bar, a sauna, video games, heated boot room, log fire, fine balcony views and a DVD library \u2013 as well as a menu that goes beyond the ski-resort staples.     Analysing (ie laughing at) videos of their progress.    On the camp, ranging in age from 20 to 50, there were people who could do tricks but had only been on dry slopes; there were solid riders who fancied a go at some showing off; those looking for general improvement, and those who wanted to get some vague control over the board and their fear (me). The pros \u2013 Dom Harrington, Johno Verity and Steve Addicott \u2013 are well spread, in terms of skills and teaching style, to cope with these needs. Lesson number one, though, was having any idea what anyone was talking about. Apparently we would be &quot;shredding the nar&quot; and, quite possibly, &quot;sicking the ill&quot;. Who or what were ollie and nollie? (I was later introduced to them, and I fell over.) Steve, who was happier talking in terms of &quot;sliding down a mountain of snow on a tray&quot;, started my education: 1. It is called riding, not boarding. 2. It&apos;s not cool to wear shades when you&apos;re riding, because it looks as if you care too much what you look like.And 3. There is a point on the board that it is totally &quot;wack&quot; (rubbish) to touch if you are in the middle of an ollie. Snowcamp is a pleasing mix of holiday and group learning. Locations (in the Paradiski area) are chosen daily according to conditions, and the group is split three ways for each half of the day, according to what people fancy working on. Off-piste and building kickers with Johno, &quot;jibbing&quot; with Steve (various tricks to make on-piste and edge-of-piste riding more fun) and, later in the week, snowpark stunts with Dom Harrington. Sylvia Niemojewska, queen of the warm-up, floated around, helping people&apos;s general riding. I was just getting comfy when the dread word &quot;switch&quot; came up. It&apos;s the equivalent of playing tennis with the wrong hand: leading with the other foot. It involves a return to that infuriating early phase \u2013 riding and falling over and swearing and falling over and wanting to kill things and falling over and eventually crying and falling over again. But &quot;switch&quot; is a good thing to master, I was informed, for general control \u2013 and for tricks. Steve has a talent for using images to help you: &quot;Remember, cowboy knees! Guns in holsters, like you&apos;re about to draw!&quot; He had us try bank slashes, &quot;tornado turns&quot; and swapping boards. We found natural kickers to try 180-degree turns in the air and generally cheered one another as we planted our faces in the snow. Feeling chuffed at improvements (well, lack of death) I decided to join Johno and go off-piste. What a feeling! That&apos;s what I thought, for nearly 20 seconds, before sinking. After 40 minutes of digging for freedom, I got so broken with exhausted anger I think I actually called out for my mum. My career as an extremophile was already faltering. But the deferred gratification comes when you return to a bog-standard run: it may be hard for an old dog to learn new tricks, but the process of trying does wonders for the basics. It was probably that feeling that brought one rider \u2013 a towering Scot called Steve \u2013 shooting over a ledge that returned him to a hard-packed piste, via a 10ft drop. I heard the board landing and looked round. Except it wasn&apos;t the board; it was him, on his collar bone \u2013 which snapped. As he was stretchered off, he still managed a smile. &quot;I forgot to ollie!&quot; he said. Suffering is optional . . . Murakami would have been proud. That night, as we watched and analysed (ie laughed at) videos Johno had made of our progress, the tales of derring-do came out. Steve explained how he ended up with two titanium front teeth; Johno talked us through a misdiagnosed shattered pelvis; and I recounted the gruesome tale of how I once very nearly grazed my finger. (For a shiver up your spine, hunt for the YouTube clip of Johno being caught in an avalanche \u2013 while filming another rider.) With booze and comfort on tap at the lodge, many evenings were spent like this, normally after an optional bar visit on the way home from the pistes. Finally, it was time to do a proper jump in the snowpark \u2013 hopefully incorporating some pose in mid-air other than the &quot;totally doomed human&quot;. A few tries; a few hard tumbles. Dom said what I have heard many times but never trusted: speed is your friend. &quot;Don&apos;t put a turn in before the jump,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s slowing you down. Just go straight and fast. You&apos;ll land easier. I tell you what, follow me. You&apos;ll be fine. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll get out of your way. Just stay in my tracks.&quot; He did get out of my way, by doing a casual mid-air somersault, presumably sending a text message as he spun over, then landed backwards to watch me. For once, I went for it. And he was right \u2013 it was easier faster. For one fantastic moment I properly understood why people love this ridiculous activity. I may, of course, have only been six inches off the ground, but I felt as high as a kite. \u2022 The overnight train to Bourg-Saint-Maurice from London via Paris with Rail Europe (+44 (0) 844 848 4070) costs from \u00a3124pp return in a 6-berth couchette.

In which case, he was almost alone among more than 800 team members, led by John Howett, the president of Toyota Motorsport. When interviewed by the BBC during qualifying for the Brazilian grand prix on 17 October and asked about his driver line-up for 2010, Howett said: &quot;We&apos;ve made an offer to Kimi Raikkonen. We think it&apos;s fair. We&apos;ve got a good track record looking after Scandinavians who like to enjoy themselves.&quot; Howett was either deliberately misleading the Ferrari driver, not to mention the television audience, or he did not have the faintest clue about the thunderbolt that was about to travel from Tokyo and impact on the team&apos;s headquarters in Cologne. Given the 57-year-old Englishman&apos;s status as one of the most honest and uncomplicated men in the paddock, it was undoubtedly the latter. The fact that the sole person responsible to the board of the largest motor company in the world did not see this coming says everything about the dangers of a relatively small business such as Formula One not so much embracing motor manufacturers, but allowing itself to be sucked in by their profligate ways. Formula One only has itself to blame for expanding rapidly with highly paid technicians and making the payroll a significant item of expenditure. That figure accounts for at least 30% of the Toyota team&apos;s $330m (\u00a3200m) 2009 budget, into which the parent company paid $214m, the rest coming from sponsorship and television fees. And this was a substantial reduction from a \u20ac390m ($580m at today&apos;s rate) budget in 2006. It will have mattered little to the Toyota board that their team ranked fourth in the spending chart behind Ferrari, BMW and McLaren-Mercedes or that the Formula One investment \u2013 and that is the correct word given the global profile and accelerated technical feedback provided for the road car division \u2013 would not have scratched the surface of an ashtray redesign on the Yaris. The company will lose an estimated $8.3bn and something had to be seen to be done. The board, many of whom would have known little about Formula One and probably cared even less, had no alternative. Their best intentions were crushed by a global recession the scale of which was beyond the imagination of even the shrewdest company accountant when Toyota committed to Formula One in 1999. No one in the sport should be in the least surprised. Trulli&apos;s wise-after-the-event analysis was prompted less by clever forecasting and more by the thought that Toyota were unlikely to re-employ him after another mediocre season. The Italian&apos;s frequently excellent qualifying runs were not matched in the races, to such an extent that rival teams, when planning pit-stop tactics, would go to great lengths to avoid having their drivers stuck behind the Toyota in what became known as the &quot;Trulli train&quot;. True to form, Trulli qualified sixth in Abu Dhabi last weekend and finished seventh, his lacklustre showing being exacerbated by Kamui Kobayashi as the novice, in yet another feisty drive, leapfrogged his team-mate while moving from 12th to sixth. Kobayashi is one of the many unfortunate victims of the withdrawal since he had done enough to warrant a full\u2011time drive with Toyota in 2010. It will be no surprise if one of the four new teams snaps up the 23-year-old Japanese. Either way, early reports of Formula One&apos;s death are exaggerated as the sport regroups. The disappearance in 11 months of Honda, BMW and Toyota could be seen as the tipping point as the emphasis returns to compact and efficient teams with racing as their core business. Regardless of the structure of the entry for 2010 and beyond, the processional race in Abu Dhabi \u2013 enriched only by a superb fight for second between Mark Webber and Jenson Button during the closing laps \u2013 demonstrated that you can spend millions on a facility that wants for nothing, but which is meaningless if the cars cannot run in close company and the track design, despite being brand new, incorporates chicanes that throttle the life out of wheel-to-wheel racing. The in-tray of Jean Todt will be filled with legal correspondence over Toyota suddenly quitting despite having committed to Formula One until 2012. The new FIA president needs, as a priority, to examine why teams such as Brawn and Toyota were able to legally introduce the double diffuser at the back of their 2009 cars, thus negating at a stroke the valuable work of the so-called Overtaking Committee and making the aerodynamic device de rigueur at the expense of overtaking on new tracks with their cardboard cutout, standard\u2011issue corners. Not, of course, that the double diffuser did Toyota any good as the Formula One team failed to score the maiden win that might, just might, have kept them in the sport.\u00a0"}, {"sentences": ["Orange juice in Marrakech, hot dogs in Copenhagen, steak in Buenos Aires, soba noodles in Tokyo, arepa con huevo in Bogot\u00e1."], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Life and style", "Alex James"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-08T00:06:25Z", "title": "Foodie boy: Alex James on the value of a three-quid fry-up", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/08/foodie-boy-alex-james-dining", "article": "I do like a really over-the-top posh restaurant now and then: the whoosh of spinnakering napkins in whispery candlelight; Mrs James in her favourite frock and, just like Marie Antoinette or the Holy Roman Emperor, comfortably and ruthlessly giving the thumbs-up or thumbs-down to all that passes before us, from the decor to the Herculean efforts of an entire army of highly drilled, highly strung personnel in the kitchen and in the dining room.

In fact, much as I love food as grand theatre, when I cast my mind over the great culinary delights of the world, it&apos;s nearly always cheap food that I find myself dreaming about. Nearly all of the contenders for my last supper, if I had to elect one, would cost less than \u00a33. There are some foods that have to cost less than \u00a33 to be authentic. Any more than that and they become an ersatz facsimile of themselves. For example, pizza in Manhattan peaks in quality around the three-to-four-dollars-per-slice mark, or it did last time I was there. Any less, they&apos;re skimping on ingredients, and any more than that, it&apos;s somehow not the real thing any more. I love pizza more than anything. In fact, for one entire American tour when I was young and foolish I ate nothing but pizza, and everything was fine. I like it so much I had an arrangement with a friend in Miami to FedEx me one from Cozzoli&apos;s in Coconut Grove because it&apos;s not possible to get pizza that is quite the same in this country. It really doesn&apos;t come close anywhere. My friend stateside managed to roll one up into a cylinder and get it into a FedEx overnight delivery tube, but it never arrived. Shame. Still, some things will always be better in situ. Orange juice in Marrakech, hot dogs in Copenhagen, steak in Buenos Aires, soba noodles in Tokyo, arepa con huevo in Bogot\u00e1. All street food, really, and if you really want to get in touch with where you are it is worth spending a little less on eating out than spending a little more. If there&apos;s one thing that is better in London than anywhere else, it would probably be the builder&apos;s breakfast. It costs around \u00a33 and is always good, apart from when it costs a lot more. For example, in hotels: hotels for some reason want to start skipping the beans and cooking the eggs beforehand.

Shanghai is set to rise from 25th place to 9th by then, with Mumbai likely to storm to 11th in the global gross domestic product per capita rankings from its current slot at number 29.

But, says PwC, systematic global data on the size of city economies has been lacking until now. PwC published the first set of global city GDP rankings in 2007 and has now updated these to 2008 with projections to 2025. Thomas Hoehn, an economics partner at PwC, added: &quot;Global economic activity is concentrated in the world&apos;s largest cities and it is important to understand how those cities compare, especially when many developed economies are experiencing economic difficulties while countries like China and India continue to grow.&quot; Delhi, Guangzhou and Rio de Janeiro are all likely to rise rapidly up the table between now and 2025, PwC says, as are Istanbul and Cairo. Lots of American and European cities, however, are set to slide sharply over the same period, with cities like Sydney, Singapore and Madrid likely to drop out of the top 30 altogether. The PwC estimates of city output are based on combining United Nations population estimates for cities in 2008 with estimates of GDP per capita at purchasing power parities, which equalise the approximate costs of living."}, {"sentences": ["The Australians were in Tokyo last weekend, had a game in Gloucester on Tuesday night and turned up at Twickenham without at least three men \u2013 Stirling Mortlock, Berrick Barnes and Nathan Sharpe \u2013 who would have been automatic choices."], "tags": ["Autumn internationals", "England rugby union team", "Australia rugby union team", "Martin Johnson", "Jonny Wilkinson", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-08T17:01:46Z", "title": "Autumn internationals: England 9-18 Australia", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/08/england-australia-autumn-internationalsmatch-report", "article": " As Martin Johnson delivered his post-match verdict, the motivational slogan on the gym wall above his head neatly captured the mood. &quot;To succeed, be prepared to suffer&quot; it read and at this rate England will cause their supporters plenty more angst before the autumn internationals are over. If Argentina&apos;s forwards were not already salivating at the prospect of Saturday&apos;s encounter, they should be now. In many ways this was a more dispiriting outcome for Johnson than last year&apos;s statistically heavier defeat to the same opponents. For the first half-hour England did all the right things, laid promising foundations and dutifully ticked all the boxes the management had demanded. And then? It was like watching a whole box of fireworks fizzle out one by one. The bonfire of English vanities, not for the first time since Johnson retired as a player, is crackling away merrily this morning. There can be no question the better side won. For the second year in a row under the crafty Robbie Deans, Australia sprang the sort of resourceful ambush which would have delighted Ned Kelly. Perhaps the most telling comment came from their skipper Rocky Elsom, bursting with pride at the manner in which his modern Hole in the Wall gang unpicked England&apos;s defence. &quot;We just felt comfortable they weren&apos;t going to break the line,&quot; shrugged Elsom. &quot;We didn&apos;t feel that was going to happen much.&quot; You could say that again. England never seriously threatened the Wallaby try-line despite fine performances from Jonny Wilkinson and Lewis Moody, in stark contrast to a largely monochrome collective effort. Johnson put it down to the visitors being more &quot;battle-hardened&quot; but that excuse does not really stack up. The Australians were in Tokyo last weekend, had a game in Gloucester on Tuesday night and turned up at Twickenham without at least three men \u2013 Stirling Mortlock, Berrick Barnes and Nathan Sharpe \u2013 who would have been automatic choices. England started planning for this game months ago, enjoyed two weeks&apos; unbroken preparation and cannot solely blame injuries for failing to lift the tempo when it came to the crunch. In part, the finger should be pointed at this season&apos;s stolid Guinness Premiership. Slow, unambitious rugby, as Warren Gatland has already pointed out, has been in vogue at club level in England and the national side were similarly workmanlike after a bright start. Johnson&apos;s selectorial conservatism, however, also backfired spectacularly. Instead of rewarding the sharp recent form of Paul Hodgson, Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes and James Haskell, he went for safer selections . With the exceptions of Wilkinson, Moody and Tom Croft, comparisons with their sharper, cleverer opponents were increasingly uncomfortable. No one summed up the difference in mindset more than the 21-year-old Wallaby scrum-half Will Genia, the son of a former cabinet minister in the government of Papua New Guinea. This was his eighth cap but he displayed the judgment and verve of a world-class talent. His close-range 21st-minute try also revealed an eye for a defensive gap. &quot;He creates a little bit of doubt in defences which saps energy and takes it toll over time,&quot; said a beaming Deans. &quot;He threatens the inside channels which means we&apos;re not just transferring pressure to the backs.&quot; Outside Genia, Matt Giteau and Quade Cooper also dovetailed beautifully and the Wallabies would have won by the length of Ramsay Street had Wilkinson not put in a defensive shift which conclusively proved he is fully recovered from his injury travails. Moody was equally brave and committed but after half-time England found themselves trapped on the back foot. Ineffectual tackling by Mark Cueto and Ugo Monye allowed Adam Ashley-Cooper to score his second try in as many Twickenham visits but the score was essentially a product of mounting pressure all over the field. &quot;With all that quick ball, you&apos;d be a fool to think you could keep a team out for ever,&quot; admitted Wilkinson. &quot;We&apos;ve got to improve in every single area.&quot; Australia have now won six of the eight games between the countries since the 2003 World Cup. At least Wilkinson could walk unaided to the post-match reception, although when he spoke about aspects of his game taking &quot;seven years to come to fruition&quot; he strayed into tricky territory. Drawing inspiration from Seven Years in Tibet may satisfy Wilkinson&apos;s Buddhist leanings but such patience levels are not available for international coaches. Johnson now has just six days to answer the eternal question of how to inject some dynamism into England&apos;s attacking game, with Simon Shaw&apos;s return to full match-fitness being closely monitored. Hodgson and Haskell are clear candidates for promotion and Hartley is set to start: the three H&apos;s, if nothing else, would offer more hustle. &quot;If you&apos;ve only got one option in the locker then you&apos;re stuffed,&quot; said Will Greenwood, offering Sky&apos;s viewers a succinct verdict on his ex-captain&apos;s tactical approach. There is also no escaping the fact that Argentina, despite injuries to Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, Felipe Contepomi and Juan Mart\u00edn Leguizam\u00f3n, can still select enough quality forwards to make life even tougher for England this Saturday. A second straight home defeat with the All Blacks to come? It would leave Johnson exposed to accusations that his England are simply treading water. Australia, meanwhile, have waltzed across the Irish Sea daring to believe a victorious grand slam tour could be brewing.

They managed just one try in those games, Nick Easter&apos;s effort against Australia a year ago. They have since gone 20 minutes short of five hours without finding their way over the line against South Africa, New Zealand and Australia and they barely created a chance on Saturday. If the statistics show that England made more passes than the Wallabies, that was largely because a significant percentage of them came in the last 10 minutes when they were chasing the game after going nine points down. They faded at the end of the first half and struggled when Australia lifted the tempo in the third quarter. England kicked more out of hand than Australia despite, until the latter stages, enjoying less possession. They played in the manner of most Guinness Premiership sides, taking few risks in their own half and playing for position, but their kick-chasing, apart from a couple of notable exceptions, was poor and by preferring to keep hold of the ball and take play through phases, the Wallabies sapped the home side&apos;s energy. &quot;We were not worried at half-time even though we were trailing by four points,&quot; said the Australia scrum-half, Will Genia. &quot;We knew the hard work we had put in would let us take them at the end and that is how it worked out.&quot; The England team manager, Martin Johnson, and all the players made available to the media, went on about how Australia had the advantage of coming off the back of the Tri-Nations and a Tokyo tussle against New Zealand the week before. But given that, in the summer, European teams on tour of the southern hemisphere always complain of fatigue, a more pertinent point would have been England&apos;s lengthy injury list. When Johnson announced his 32-strong elite squad last July, the average number of caps per player was 30. Saturday&apos;s 22 boasted an average of 19, with four players, Jonny Wilkinson, Steve Borthwick, Lewis Moody and Steve Thompson, accounting for 53% of the caps between them, leaving the other 18 averaging little more than 10. Australia&apos;s 22 averaged 28 caps a man. While Borthwick, Moody and Wilkinson made their experience tell, only the prop David Wilson stood out among the other starters. In contrast, two of Australia&apos;s emerging players, Genia and the centre Quade Cooper, played pivotal roles and the way Cooper complemented his outside-half, Matt Giteau, showed up how Shane Geraghty failed to blend effectively with Wilkinson. Geraghty, used to leading the line at Northampton, seemed overanxious to make every touch of the ball a telling one. He kept chipping off his weaker left foot, profiting Australia each time. &quot;We kicked away too much ball, especially in the second half,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;We gave the ball back to them too easily and let them off the hook. There were times when we needed to be slicker and that comes from having a long time in camp together. We will be better against Argentina on Saturday.&quot; Geraghty maintained his partnership with Wilkinson would improve over time, as it needs to if England are to threaten New Zealand&apos;s line later this month. &quot;I felt we blended OK,&quot; he said. &quot;We interlinked well at times and there is stuff we can work on in training. We should have gone on to win the game after being ahead at half-time, but Australia came on to us and made their experience tell in the end, managing the game well.&quot; Where England were significantly better than a year ago was at the breakdown where the presence of Moody and Wilson, coupled with the fierce tackling of Wilkinson, saw the men in white win the turnover count and earn eight penalties.

Nearly everyone in Japan has access to a powerful 3G mobile device, and making calls is just one of myriad functions available to their users. David Payette, UK MD of Japanese technology giant NEC says: &quot;We say Japan is usually six months to five years ahead in most technologies - in this case it is five years minimum.&quot; In Britain, payment cards that can be topped up with cash have yet to take over from debit cards and those that do exist are used predominantly for travel, such as London commuters&apos; Oyster cards. In Japan, similar cards, inserted into the back of mobile devices, can pay for everything from taxis to food, simply by waving the handset across a sensor. The Japanese also do all their banking on their phones - in fact, it&apos;s fair to say that what Payette refers to as these &quot;absolutely ubiquitous&quot; devices may usher in the first cashless society. Of a total population of around 130 million, between 40 million and 60 million own one of these mobiles. Advertisers able to reach those people have access to a huge captive audience. According to Japan&apos;s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the number of Japanese using mobile devices for web browsing reached 75 million in 2008, and 91 million subscribed to mobile internet services in March 2009 - around 85% of the country&apos;s 107 million mobile users. In the UK, that figure is just over seven million (or around 10% of the market). That said, trends witnessed in the Japanese market for many years are starting to be observed in the UK: mobile internet use in the UK is now growing eight times faster than that on PCs, according to market research company Nielsen. The future might arrive more quickly than many imagine. &quot;We can see a time in the UK when you could buy a concert ticket on your phone, then swipe your phone to get through the turnstile and buy a snack,&quot; says Payette, although he believes the biggest obstacle to this is arguments over how best to fund the rollout of next-generation mobile networks. &quot;The reason this won&apos;t take place tomorrow is that a lot of things need to fall into place.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["BBC2&apos;s Charley Boorman: Sydney to Tokyo By Any Means finished its six-part run with 1.5 million viewers and a 6% share, between 9pm and 10pm, and Match of the Day 2, which had 2.4 million viewers, a 13% share, between 10pm and 11.10pm."], "tags": ["TV ratings", "The X Factor", "Media", "Television industry", "Jedward"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-09T12:23:00Z", "title": "Record audience sees X Factor twins Jedward survive | TV ratings - Sunday 8 November", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/nov/09/tv-ratings-jedward-x-factor", "article": "The X Factor powered to a record audience for a second successive week with a peak of more than 15 million viewers watching twins John and Edward Grimes survive at the expense of Lucie Jones last night, Sunday 8 November.

The car contained the paraphernalia of a growing number of suicides in Japan, although investigators were puzzled to find there were no keys in the ignition. But their bafflement turned to suspicion when it emerged that Oide apparently had everything to live for. Less than 24 hours before his death the company worker from Tokyo had spoken of his joy at the prospect of getting married. &quot;At 41, I&apos;m actually looking forward to getting married, and today I&apos;ll meet my partner&apos;s family,&quot; he wrote on his blog. &quot;Recently, we&apos;ve spent all our time looking for a new place to live and talking about our new life together. This evening we&apos;re going on a two-night, three-day holiday.&quot; An autopsy showed that Oide had died from carbon monoxide poisoning, but that his blood also contained traces of sleeping pills. Just before his death he had transferred \u00a55m (\u00a333,000) to his &quot;fiancee&apos;s&quot; bank account. In a case that has gripped Japan, the woman Oide thought he was about to marry is suspected of murdering him and as many as five other men she befriended via online marriage sites. The suspect, named by Japanese websites as Kanae Kijima, allegedly squeezed millions of yen out of her would-be suitors before drugging them with sleeping pills and disguising their deaths as suicides or accidents. The copious column inches and air time devoted to the case since her arrest late last month portray the 34-year-old as a calculated serial killer who preyed on vulnerable men aged ranging in age from 27 to 80. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Kijima also worked as a home help for Kenzo Ando, an 80-year-old man who died in a house fire in May and whose body contained traces of sleeping drugs. She had visited his home the same day and was filmed withdrawing money using his cash card. Kijima, a mother of five now inevitably nicknamed the &quot;black widow&quot;, would reportedly agree to marriage and then claim to be in desperate need of cash to complete her studies before she could tie the knot. According to one weekly magazine, in an email to a 70-year-old lover later found dead at his home she said her parents had been killed in a plane crash and that she needed money to complete her music studies in the US. The suspect, who claimed to have worked as a nurse and a piano teacher, reportedly had multiple prescriptions for sleeping pills of the type found in her alleged victims. There is also evidence that she bought the items needed to cause carbon monoxide poisoning over the internet. Though she lived in a cheap rented flat, Kijima reportedly wrote about her opulent lifestyle on her blog. They weren&apos;t entirely empty boasts: she would reportedly turn up to dates at luxury hotels in a red Mercedes. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 November 2009.

This week, French actor-director Attal, 44 (and son-in-law of the late, great French singer Serge Gainsbourg), launches his own tribute to Paris, its lovers and its street life. His three-minute YouTube film, Kisses from Paris, features two beautiful young actors making out all over the city; it&apos;s as if Doisneau&apos;s couple have returned \u2013 and updated their kiss for a new generation. They speak in English, while on the soundtrack Rufus Wainwright sings a melancholy tune. Attal, speaking in an art deco cinema in a trendy Parisian neighbourhood, was commissioned by the Paris tourist board after they saw a five-minute film he made for the New York, I Love You project, a collection of shorts by various directors on the theme of love, set in different neighbourhoods of the Big Apple. (Attal&apos;s offering featured Ethan Hawke trying to seduce a not-unamused young woman he meets outside a restaurant.) Highly regarded in France, Attal, a short and stubbled figure, does not see working for the tourist board as selling out. He certainly doesn&apos;t need the money: he acts, directs and is the voice of Tom Cruise when the actor&apos;s movies are dubbed into French. His partner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, was last seen mutilating herself \u2013 and Willem Dafoe \u2013 in Lars von Triers&apos;s Antichrist. No, the simple reason for doing it, Attal says, is that he loves Paris and making films. &quot;I was born in Tel Aviv,&quot; he says. &quot;But I came here when I was one, and grew up in the suburbs. I am really Parisian.&quot; There is, however, another less prosaic reason for taking the job: &quot;It took me a day,&quot; he says, sipping an orange juice and chewing gum. The Paris tourist board gave Attal free rein, but with a small brief: he had to advertise the city, of course, but more importantly, he had to use the less well-known parts of Paris, not the usual shots of the Eiffel tower and the Louvre. &quot;I did get the Eiffel in,&quot; Attal says; but he shot it in an unlikely way \u2013 at night, with a metro zooming in front. Instead, Kisses from Paris is a journey off the beaten track, taking in the sights tourists tend to miss: there&apos;s a rock concert in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes, as well as footage shot around the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, the Palais du Tokyo, and the flea market at Saint\u00a0Ouen. It&apos;s an attempt to show the multi-cultural side of Paris, its art and music scenes, but it is also clearly designed to lure the young. The actors are young, beautiful and appealingly scruffy. They meet, fall for each other, and spend the day wandering around with their hormones raging. &quot;I don&apos;t want to leave Paris,&quot; moans Zo\u00e9 Schellenberg, who plays the young woman, in between passionate kisses. Attal&apos;s work is part of a burgeoning genre, the viral film, in which the lines between art and advert are blurred. The result, it is hoped, should take on a life of its own on the web. The fashion designer Vanessa Bruno recently dressed French it-girl Lou Doillon in her floaty clothes for a short film directed by St\u00e9phanie di Giusto. Released instead of a catalogue, the film debuted on Bruno&apos;s website and was shown in cinemas all over Paris. Marion Cotillard, who played \u00c9dith Piaf in the 2007 movie La Vie en Rose, starred in Lady Noire for Christian Dior, while the Swiss watchmakers IWC persuaded John Malkovich to make an appearance in a piece called Pilots. &quot;That watch was made for pilots,&quot; he tells two young airmen witheringly. &quot;There are no real pilots any more.&quot; Mariann Wenckehim, a brand expert for the London firm 20/20, says: &quot;A 30-second TV commercial or print ad can&apos;t provoke the same intensity, the same edge as a short film. A film that has a sense of humour and engages youth is definitely more interesting. Brands want to inspire, rather than shout.&quot; Paris certainly needs to promote itself. Although still the most visited city in the world, it has fallen behind London and Berlin in terms of cool. With Kisses from Paris, Attal hopes to do for the French capital what Doisneau did when he took two young people and turned them into an iconic image, still instantly recognisable almost 60 years on."}, {"sentences": ["Hours later, Ichihashi was under arrest for the murder of Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher whose corpse was found buried in a bathtub of sand in his flat in Ichikawa, a suburban town to the east of Tokyo, in March 2007.", "When the Hawkers arrived in Tokyo to plead for information on the second anniversary of their daughter&apos;s death this year, they appeared to be losing faith in the police investigation.", "Some reports suggested he had been spotted in Kabukicho, a red light district of Tokyo."], "tags": ["Lindsay Hawker", "Japan", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-10T18:36:31Z", "title": "Police capture Japanese master of disguise wanted for English teacher's 2007 murder", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/10/japan-murder-plastic-surgery-hawker", "article": "More than two and a half years after he became one of Japan&apos;s most wanted suspects, Tatsuya Ichihashi&apos;s genius for disguise finally proved to be his undoing. As he waited to board an early evening ferry in Osaka today, a passerby&apos;s gaze was drawn to the tall youth wearing a hat, sunglasses and a paper surgical mask. Hours later, Ichihashi was under arrest for the murder of Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher whose corpse was found buried in a bathtub of sand in his flat in Ichikawa, a suburban town to the east of Tokyo, in March 2007. Police officers put him on a bullet train bound for the capital, where he will undergo further questioning. His arrest, moments before he was due to sail to Okinawa, an island in Japan&apos;s far south, comes days after it emerged that Ichihashi had attempted to transform his appearance by undergoing extensive plastic surgery and had worked, undetected, as a labourer in the Osaka area for more than a year. Ichihashi is the only suspect in the murder of Hawker, 22, an English teacher from Brandon, near Coventry, who had been beaten and strangled. Her father, Bill, 54, welcomed the arrest as &quot;a good day for the Hawkers&quot;. He said he would travel to Japan as he &quot;wanted to look Ichihashi in the eyes&quot;. &quot;We wanted justice and we&apos;ve finally got justice,&quot; Hawker said. He said Ichihashi had shown &quot;no remorse&quot; over the last two and a half years. &quot;This has been a long, hard battle and the battle is over. We have worked tirelessly as a family, we have never given up. I hope the Japanese society give him the maximum punishment available.&quot; Ichihashi&apos;s father, a neurosurgeon, said he hoped his son would be brought to justice. &quot;You committed a crime,&quot; he said in a message broadcast from his home in central Japan. &quot;You must be brought to justice. I want you to atone for what you did.&quot; His mother had called a daytime television programme and urged her son to give himself up. &quot;It&apos;s mum, Tatsuya,&quot; she said in an audio message. &quot;Dad and mum have decided to speak about our feelings, although we know you won&apos;t like this,&quot; she said, before telling him to contact the police. Tonight, the couple, both wealthy medical professionals, appeared on television to apologise for their son&apos;s crime. When the Hawkers arrived in Tokyo to plead for information on the second anniversary of their daughter&apos;s death this year, they appeared to be losing faith in the police investigation. Despite 8,000 reported sightings and widespread media coverage, officers admitted they were no closer to finding Ichihashi, 30, a former horticulture student who had lived alone in his four-room flat. Some reports suggested he had been spotted in Kabukicho, a red light district of Tokyo. More recently he was said to have been enjoying the relative anonymity of 24-hour internet cafes in south-western Japan, paying a modest daily fee in return for a cubicle equipped with a sofa and a computer. In desperation, police increased the reward for information leading to his arrest from 1m yen (\u00a36,600) to 10m yen. The beginning of the end of Ichihashi&apos;s life as a fugitive began last week when police confirmed he had undergone several rounds of cosmetic surgery in an attempt to make him unrecognisable from the face that stared out of tens of thousands of wanted posters across Japan. He had given false names and addresses at the clinics and failed to return for follow-up appointments, denying police the opportunity to arrest him. Photographs released by a clinic in Nagoya he visited late last month showed a very different Ichihashi: he was minus two prominent moles on his left cheek, and had been given a thinner bottom lip, a higher bridge on his nose and a double-fold on his eyelids to give him a more western appearance. The Yomiuri newspaper reported that Ichihashi had visited a clinic in the south-western city of Fukuoka in mid-October, but doctors had rejected his request for surgery to change the shape of his mouth. The photos begged the question: how could a fugitive who fled penniless from the scene afford plastic surgery? The answer came early today with newspaper reports that Ichihashi had worked for a construction company in Osaka for 13 months, until last month, and saved about 1m yen. Using the name and address of a dead man from Osaka called Kosuke Inoue, Ichihashi rarely mixed with his colleagues and spent most of his spare time reading comics and watching videos in his room at the company&apos;s dormitory. Nicknamed Lanky because of his height \u2013 he is 5ft 11ins \u2013 Ichihashi never removed his red cap or black-rimmed glasses in public. When he was persuaded to join a company bowling trip in April, he hid behind a colleague in a group photograph. &quot;We gossiped that he was an odd guy but I never thought he was the suspect,&quot; a former colleague told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. &quot;It occurs to me now that he was saving the money for cosmetic surgery.&quot; Police found a passport application in his room, leading them to believe he may have planned to flee overseas. Ichihashi, who had stalked Hawker for several days before her death, followed her home on one occasion to beg her to teach him English, leaving his name and address on a piece of paper \u2013 the scrap of evidence that led police to his flat days later. He evaded nine police officers when he was approached for questioning on the day her body was found, fleeing in bare feet and with no money. Hours before her death, security cameras captured Hawker giving Ichihashi a private language lesson in a cafe near her home. One theory is that he lured her to his flat after pretending he had insufficient cash with him to pay for the lesson. Hawker had been teaching English at a branch of the Nova English conversation school since October 2006, after graduating with a biology degree from Leeds University the same year. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 13 November 2009.

If you don&apos;t think you can get away with pretending to work while you read for that long, you might want to print it out and read it on the train home later Picture Muhammad Ali. How do you see him? Standing snarling over Sonny Liston? Shadow boxing on the bottom of a swimming pool? Leaning into the ropes as George Foreman pummels his kidneys? Stooping, shaking, to light the Olympic flame? How about Ali flapping about on the canvas while an 18 stone wrestler sits on his face? Who wants to remember Ali that way? There are some things a person should never have to see happen to a man like Ali. This is the story of one of them. &apos;Six million dollars, that&apos;s why&apos; 25 May 1976. It is eight months on from his third and final fight against Joe Frazier, the Thrilla in Manila and Ali has been busy boxing stooges. At the age of 33, he has suggested that it would be his final year before retirement. In January he beat a Belgian named Jean-Pierre Coopman with a knockout in the fifth. In April, he turned up overweight for a bout with Jimmy Young, and was taken a full 15 rounds by a 15-1 outsider. Chastened, in May Ali travelled to Munich, where he knocked out Yorkshireman Richard Dunn in five rounds. Frank Keating was there for the Guardian.  &quot;Dunne done with, Ali spent last night getting himself and us psyched up for his next superdooper smackeroo \u2013 in a few days he ups his marquee from here to Tokyo where he takes on the gigantic Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki. Inoki will be able to run the full range of all-in wrestling moves and use ploys including karate chops, at which he is, according to Ali at his wide-eyed best, &apos;the most fearsome man in who-le, wi-de, wo-rld.&apos; Anything goes apparently.&quot;  Not quite anything. A special set of rules had been agreed for this prototype mixed martial arts fight. Ali would wear four-ounce gloves, and would be able to tag out of any grapple by touching the ropes. Inoki would be bare-handed. There was to be no kneeing, kicking, or hitting below the belt. Anyone thrown out of the ring would have 20 seconds to get back in. It was a hell of a sales pitch for a fight. The two would be contesting the title of toughest man on the planet. Of course the whole thing stank of the circus, and there were plenty of people who said so. Was The Greatest selling out? No doubt. After his fight against Young, Ali held a press conference in his hotel bedroom, and held forth from underneath the covers.  &quot;Why fight a wrestler and demean the boxing title in many people&apos;s eyes, Ali was asked. If his stated plan to retire at the end of the year was true, his answer was understandable. &apos;Six million dollars, that&apos;s why,&apos; the champion replied.&quot;  &apos;What&apos;s karate from a distance man? Nothing!&apos; The story of exactly how Ali came to be in that ring, underneath Antonio Inoki&apos;s spandex-clad ass, is tough to untangle. It&apos;s only 30 years on and the facts are already a mess, recounted by a disparate set of narrators, each as unreliable as the other. The idea of fighting Inoki supposedly came about in April 1975, when Ali was introduced to Ichiro Yada, president of the Japanese Amateur Wrestling Association, at a reception in the US. Supposedly, Ali bragged to Yada: &quot;Isn&apos;t there any Oriental fighter who will challenge me? I&apos;ll give him one million dollars if he wins.&quot; The stage-managed remark was worked into headline news in Japan. Inoki accepted the challenge and, eventually, Ali accepted a $6m final offer from Inoki&apos;s backers. In March &apos;76 the fight was made. The venue was the Budokan in Tokyo, and the date 26 June. Bob Arum had signed on as promoter, he remembered the deal happening like this:  &quot;Now Herbert [Muhammad - Ali&apos;s manager] came to me and he said these Japanese people have come to him with all kinds of money to go over and fight this wrestler, Inoki, in Japan. Professional wrestlers are performers, I thought, the thing is a fraud.&quot;  Ferdie Pacheco, Ali&apos;s doctor, has a different story:  &quot;Ali&apos;s fight in Tokyo was basically a Bob Arum thought-up scam that was going to be &apos;ha-ha, ho-ho. We&apos;re going to go over there. It&apos;s going to be orchestrated. It&apos;s going to be a lot of fun and it&apos;s just a joke.&apos; Well, when we got over there, we found out no one was laughing.&quot;  Either way, Ali was none too flustered about the prospect, as he told the Guardian&apos;s Keating: &quot;The guy comes for me. I just jab him, bop, bop, bop. He can&apos;t get close enough. What&apos;s karate from a distance man? Nothing. When I&apos;ve jabbed him enough, I&apos;ll knock him out.&quot; &apos;If this fight were a real go, I think that it would scare Ali away&apos; Even today, Inoki is hard to avoid in Japan. A brilliant self-publicist, he is as famous in his country as Ali is in the US. Nowadays he has his own brand of vitamin water and, among other things, his own line of condoms. As the advert says:  &quot;Condoms that have inherited &quot;Inoki-ism!&quot; Fighting condoms decorated with the Inoki DAAAAAAH! pose! USE WITHOUT QUESTION! USE AND YOU WILL FIND OUT! INOKIX 1000 - 12-pack \u00a51,050&quot;.  In 1976 though, Inoki was 33, and renowned only for his skill as a professional wrestler. In the 1950s, when television sets were becoming more common across Japan, pro-wrestling was one of the biggest ratings boosters. Inoki had been the protege of the great Rikidozan, the &apos;Father of puroresu&apos;. (Rikidozan, whose schtick was all about restoring national pride in the aftermath of the war, would later die of peritonitis after being stabbed with a urine-soaked knife by a gangster in a Tokyo nightclub \u2013 but that&apos;s another story). Many of Rikidozan&apos;s most popular fights were against American wrestlers. They had a formula: the Americans would usually fight dirty (using chairs, that sort of thing) and typically Rikidozan would come out on top after unleashing a traditional Japanese fighting move, getting one over on the sneaky Americans through his &apos;fighting spirit&apos;. Inoki inherited a similar spiel. He was a teenager working on a coffee plantation in Brazil when Rikidozan discovered him. Or so the story went. &quot;In those days it was like living as a slave,&quot; Inoki told the world in the pre-fight press conference. &quot;Now it is good to think I worked on the plantation in 45 degree heat. I struggled to eat, but such a life gave me the spirit to fight.&quot; Through the 60s Inoki rose to the top of the puroresu scene, and got to be so big that in 1971 he was kicked out of the Japanese Wrestling Association for attempting a takeover. He went looking for bigger paydays and greater fame, and hit upon the idea of mixed martial arts fighting. Before he met Ali, he had already fought a bout against the heavyweight judo gold medallist from the Munich Olympics, Wilhelm Ruska. Inoki destroyed Ruska, battering him into a TKO with &quot;a succession of three consecutive back suplexes&quot;. Given that Inoki was a pro-wrestler, suspicions that the fight was fixed were rampant. Ruska never suggested the fight was anything other than legit, but then neither did any other of the 20 or so fighters who Inoki fought in MMA bouts with over the next 13 years, Ali included. The experts were not convinced. Donn F Draeger was one of them. Draeger was an ex-US marine, author of the Comprehensive Guide to Asian Martial Arts and Sean Connery&apos;s fight-double on You Only Live Twice. He is someone that a certain kind of man, not necessarily the kind you&apos;d want to have a beer with, would describe as a &apos;legend&apos;. He wrote about Inoki&apos;s fights in a series of letters back from Japan to a friend in the US.  &quot;Inoki&apos;s recent &apos;defeat&apos; of Ruska was a farce. Ruska could murtilize him if he was allowed to do so; the whole thing with Ali is a promotion gimmick. If this fight were a real go, I think that it would scare Ali away, and that if Inoki insists on it being real, the thing will never take place.&quot;  &apos;When your fist connects with my chin, take care that your fist is not damaged&apos; As Ali arrived in Tokyo, the hype grew louder. Diplomatic relations between the two nations were tense, still suffering the from 1971&apos;s Nixon shock, when Tricky Dicky took the US dollar off the gold standard, causing massive appreciation of the yen and ruining the Japanese export market. The US had only relinquished administrative control of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. It was just the right environment for a bit of nationalistic jingoism. As he landed at the airport, Ali announced his arrival with typical subtlety. His cheerleaders cut a path through the thicket of photographers and fans surrounding them, bellowing as they went: &quot;There will be no Pearl Harbour! Muhammad Ali has returned! There will be no Pearl Harbour!&quot; The Budokan was sold out, with the best seats going for \u00a31,500. Anticipation was not confined to Tokyo. In New York Vince McMahon Sr was selling tickets to a closed-circuit telecast of the fight at Shea Stadium, and had flogged 32,897 seats at $10 apiece. At Shea the Ali v Inoki fight would be the main event on a double-bill with a live bout between Check Wepner, who had gone 15 rounds with Ali the previous year, and Andre the Giant. The footage from Shea was being relayed around the world, you could even watch it live at the Birmingham Odeon, \u00a35 for the cheap seats, or \u00a37.50 if you had someone to impress. When the two men came face to face for the first time, Ali announced he would nickname Inoki &apos;The Pelican&apos; because of his big bullseye chin. Inoki looked quietly back at him and replied, through a translator: &quot;When your fist connects with my chin, take care that your fist is not damaged.&quot; He then presented The Greatest with a crutch, to use after he had been thrown from the ring. Inoki said afterwards:  &quot;I don&apos;t know how seriously Muhammad Ali is taking the fight, but if he doesn&apos;t take it seriously, he could suffer damage. I&apos;m going in there fighting. I may even break his arm.&quot;  What happened next? Well, that&apos;s the bit nobody can agree on. &apos;OK, so when do we do the rehearsal?&apos; Whether Ali was aware of it himself or not is still the subject of debate, but there are plenty of people who insist that his handlers knew the fight was a fix from the moment they signed the deal and that, in return for his $6m, their champ was supposed to lose. The original plan, according to the boxing journalist Jim Murphy, was for the fight to finish with Ali throwing a punch that would accidentally hit the referee and knock him out. Ali would stoop over the ref in concern, and while he was distracted Inoki would knock him down with a kick to the head. The referee would then come around and count Ali out. That way, Inoki would claim the win, but Ali would save face because of his noble instincts. Except that when Ali found out he had to lose, however it was supposed to happen, he refused to countenance the idea. The organisers were left with a fixed fight that no one was prepared to throw. But according to Inoki&apos;s version of the story, Ali and his entourage had signed on expecting the fight to be an exhibition rather than a real contest. It was only when they went to see Inoki train, and watched him break and twist a series of sparring partners with a series of brutal drop-kicks and violent grapples, that the truth dawned. &quot;OK, so when do we do the rehearsal?&quot; Ali supposedly asked Inoki, only to get the answer: &quot;No, no. This isn&apos;t an exhibition. It&apos;s a real fight!&quot; Whichever version is correct, in the days leading up to the fight the camps of Ali and Inoki began to renegotiate the rules. All of a sudden, a list of restrictions was imposed on Inoki. He would not be allowed to throw Ali, or tackle him, and could not land any kicks unless he had one knee in contact with the mat. In another of his letters home, Donn Draeger had his own explanation for this late twist.  &quot;The rules have been so seriously modified that the contest is no longer boxing versus wrestling. Unless this were done there would be no way to choreograph the match and make it look convincing. Ali can grapple or punch the man down; Inoki is not allowed to leg-dive or tackle. That latter restriction is the same as prohibiting Ali from jabbing. What a farce!&quot;  Or, as the Japanese Wikipedia has it: &quot;As a result of realising the bout was genuine, the Ali camp demanded a new set of rules which basically stopped Inoki from doing much ... the Ali camp also demanded that no detailed version of the rules be made public before the fight.&quot; The Americans, Inoki&apos;s fans suggested, had bent the rules to their advantage at the last minute, just as they had when the Black Ships arrived at Yokohama in the 1850s and demanded the Shogun open Japan to foreign trade, just as they had when Nixon renewed trade relations with China and again when he took the dollar off the gold standard, just, in short, as Americans always did. The rules, now so convoluted as to be almost incomprehensible, were not revealed to the public before the fight, either at Shea or at the Budokan. They would have made the whole farrago seem like even more of a multi-million dollar mockery than it already was. &apos;It&apos;s haemorrhaging!&apos; 26 June 1976. The night of the fight. No one knew what to expect when the bell went, least of all Ali. What followed was 15 rounds of pure slapstick. CLANG. Before the ringing had stopped, Inoki had sprinted the 16-feet gap between the two men, and thrown himself feet first at Ali in a deranged two-footed tackle. Ali sidestepped, Inoki missed. Before the two could square up, Inoki threw another lunging kick, missed again, and landed flat on his back. And then things started to get really silly. Inoki didn&apos;t get up. He lay on his back at Ali&apos;s feet and refused to stand. As Ali circled him warily Inoki scooted around on his behind, like a hound trying to scratch its ass on the carpet. Occasionally he would kick viciously upwards at Ali&apos;s knees. He stayed like this for all but the first 14 seconds of the three-minute round. Inoki had come up with a cunning plan in response to the late rule changes. How could Ali hit him if he was already on the floor? Ali shuffled around looking perplexed. He tried taking a few sneaky toe-punts at Inoki&apos;s behind, but whenever he got close Inoki would flail out his feet. He hopped back and forth like a man trying to stamp out a fire with his bare feet. The only people more bemused than Ali were the tens of thousands watching the fight live and on TV. Ali started walking around the ring, out of reach of Inoki&apos;s kicks, taunting his opponent by shouting &quot;Coward Inoki! Inoki no fight!&quot; Unflustered by this, Inoki continued to lie flat on the canvas. It got bad. In the fourth round Inoki, still flat on his back, trapped Ali in a corner and started peddling kicks wildly at his thighs. Ali leapt up on to the ropes and tucked his legs underneath him, shouting in frustration and disbelief. It got worse. In the sixth, Ali tried to grab Inoki&apos;s ankle as he kicked him, but Inoki wrapped his other leg around Ali&apos;s calf and flipped him over on to the canvas. He then rolled over on top of Ali&apos;s chest and squatted on his face. It&apos;s not a great moment in Ali&apos;s career. The indignity of it even spurred him, in the next round, to throw his first punch. Bill Gallo remembered watching on the big screen at the Shea.  &quot;What could Ali do when his opponent spent his time safely flat on the floor and kicking the hell out of him? All Ali could do was look down at his foe, talking to him and waving his arms, urging the guy to get up and &apos;fight like a man&apos;. No dice, the canvas was a lot safer to the Japanese canvasback.&quot;  In the eighth, Angelo Dundee, Ali&apos;s trainer, demanded that Inoki tape the tips of his shoelaces because one of the eyelets came loose and was cutting Ali&apos;s legs. A wound had already opened up on his thigh. &quot;It&apos;s haemorrhaging!&quot; screamed the announcer, desperately trying to maintain the pretence that this was a genuine contest by injecting some drama into the farcical scenes he was describing. &quot;Ali&apos;s corner looks worried!&quot; In the 10th Ali threw his second punch. Like Gallo, Jim Taylor was by this point feeling pretty sure that he, along with everyone else who had paid for the privilege of watching, had been sold a dud.  &quot;In the 13th, Ali picked up the pace and threw two punches, making six in all unless you count the two times he reached out and grabbed Inoki&apos;s foot. Inoki actually tripped him to the canvas twice. Once he kneed him, whereupon Ali climbed through the ropes and threatened to go home.&quot;  The fight went a full 15 rounds. Ali threw six punches. Inoki&apos;s fans thought he had out-witted the cheating Americans. Ali&apos;s thought that Inoki was being cowardly. Everyone thought it was a waste of time. The crowd at the Budokan started throwing rubbish into the ring and chanting &quot;Money back! Money back!&quot; According to Donn Draeger, &quot;the Budokan janitorial people took almost a full day to clean up the garbage that was hurled at the two &apos;combatants&apos; as the result of their lousy performance.&quot; The fight, such as it was, was scored as a draw. Inoki had been three points up but, conveniently, he was docked all three for fouls. In theory the tie meant no one had lost face, especially as Inoki could claim he would have won had it not been for the penalties, whereas Ali could defend himself by saying his opponent had cheated. In reality, the entire thing was utterly humiliating for everyone involved. The two fighters, of course, could take consolation in the fact they were now several million dollars richer. &apos;It was terrible, it was embarrassing&apos; &quot;How could I knock him down when he was down already?&quot; complained Ali afterwards. &quot;I just couldn&apos;t hit him while he was on the floor.&quot; Inoki rebuffed Ali by pointing out he had been unfairly &quot;handicapped by the rules that said no tackling, no karate chops, no punching when on the mat&quot;. The fight stank, and made a huge financial loss, but Ali&apos;s camp had more serious concerns, as Bob Arum remembers:  &quot;So fine, OK. It was terrible, it was embarrassing. But Ali is bleeding from the legs. He gets an infection in his legs; almost has to have an amputation. Not only the [Ken] Norton fight would&apos;ve been not happening, but Ali could&apos;ve been a cripple for the rest of his life.&quot;  Ali was due to fight Norton in September. Inoki&apos;s repeated kicks to the leg had left him with two blood clots. Before he flew to the US, he was due to fight exhibition bouts in the Philippines and South Korea. Pacheco recalls advising Ali, as he lay in bed with ice-bags around his thighs, to skip the fights and go to hospital. As it was he went through with them, and spent two weeks in care in LA when he returned to the US. Pacheco, who would stop working with Ali in 1977, disgruntled that his concerns were being ignored, insists that Ali&apos;s mobility as a fighter never quite recovered from the kicking he took in Tokyo and the subsequent infection of his legs. Certainly he suffered in his fight against Norton, eking out a narrow win on points, and he would never knock anyone out again. &apos;In the ring, we were tough opponents. After that, we built love and friendship with mutual respect&apos; As for Inoki, the fight made him one of the most famous men in Japan. The &apos;Ari kikku&apos; is a fundamental part of any schoolboy&apos;s repertoire of playground fighting moves, along with windmilling your arms and giving Chinese burns. There are kids in Japan who know how to do the Ari kikku without even knowing who &apos;Ari&apos; is. Ali and Inoki became good friends. Inoki started using The Greatest, Ali&apos;s theme music, as his own signature tune, and he borrowed the catchphrase &quot;bom-ba-ye&quot; from Ali&apos;s fans at the Rumble in the Jungle. He repeatedly exploited it for commercial purposes, using it as the title for a song, a film and a series of showcase wrestling events. In 1986 he whipped up another great brouhaha when he fought, and beat, Leon Spinks, the man who had taken the title off Ali in 1978. In 1989, Inoki established his own political group \u2013 the Sports and Peace Party \u2013 and was elected to the lower house of Japanese government, continuing his wrestling career while in office. In 1990, astonishingly, he was sent as a special envoy to negotiate with Saddam Hussein over the release of Japanese citizens being held hostage in Iraq. He was, after all, the man who had conquered The Greatest in front of the eyes of the whole world. He eventually left office in 1995 amid accusations he had been bribed by the Yakuza. He fought his last fight in 1998, 38 years after he had made his puroresu debut. Ali flew out from America to watch. After Inoki had completed his final victory, Ali climbed into the ring and the two men hugged. Ali&apos;s representative read a message over the PA:  &quot;It was 1976 when I fought Antonio Inoki at the Budokan. In the ring, we were tough opponents. After that, we built love and friendship with mutual respect. So, I feel a little less lonely now that Antonio has retired. It is my honour to be standing on the ring with my good friend after 22 years. Our future is bright and has a clear vision. Antonio Inoki and I put our best efforts into making world peace through sports, to prove there is only one mankind beyond the sexual, ethnical or cultural differences. It is my pleasure to come here today.&quot;  You would never have known the fight was a gyp, but then maybe Ali and Inoki would rather keep it that way. You can watch footage of the fight for yourself here and here. Enjoy. There are several journalists whose work I&apos;ve used in researching and writing this piece, not least Jim Murphy, Aaron Tallent, Bill Gallo and Jim Taylor \u2013 thanks to them all."}, {"sentences": ["If you&apos;re into that sort of thing, you&apos;ll probably already have heard about TokyoFixedGear.com, an online store that specialises in funky kit, inspired by (and in many cases imported from) the fixie scene in Japan.", "Meanwhile, drop by Tokyo Fixed at 4 Peter St in London and make yourself trendy with some new riser bars."], "tags": ["Cycling holidays", "Cycling", "India holidays", "Travel", "London holidays"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-11T15:18:37Z", "title": "What's new in cycling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2009/nov/11/whats-new-in-cycling", "article": "One of the best things about being a cyclist is the amount of food you can consume without exploding. So finding a good excuse to ride the trails at Glyncorrwg MTB centre \u2013 other than glorious scenery and nice, flowing singletrack \u2013 has just become much harder. The Drop Off cafe, which has fed and watered exhausted riders for the past five years, is set to close on 30 December. Skyline Cycles, which runs the bike shops at both Glyncorrwg and Afan, will take over in January 2010. The cafe will host its closing party on 5 December to coincide with the Kona Mash-Up MTB event. Pitting cross-country whippets against downhill racers,\u00a0it&apos;s a chance to try your hand at two different types of MTBing and prove exactly where your skills lie. If you need somewhere to stay, check out Afan Lodge, which has really spacious rooms, bike lock-up, hose wash and mud boxes for kit. Meanwhile, in the big smoke of London town, a cycle cafe has recently opened on 74 Leather Lane. As yet, it is unnamed, but the coffee is great and Lawrence knows more than a thing or two about bicycles. Plus there&apos;s a track pump. What more do you need? If, in fact, you do need more, then Bike the Mendips has a new trip that may be just your thing. Their Biking and Bushcraft course will, as well as taking you on some of the area&apos;s famed MTB trails, teach you how to create survival shelters using your bike, start a campfire and forage for lunch. Adrian Boots from BTM says the emphasis is on fun, not formal training, but either way you&apos;ll get better equipped for your next bike tour. A day&apos;s course costs \u00a350 per person. Obviously, once you&apos;ve learned essential survival skills, you&apos;ll need to put them to the test. If you&apos;re looking for a challenge sooner than 2010&apos;s Etape du Tour, consider entering the Benameji MTB marathon. Racing 70km up a lot of hills in the beautiful (and sunny) Cordoba region of Spain may sound a bit of an effort, but with beer and lunch provided at the end it&apos;s generally perceived as being worth it. Pure Mountain holidays offer a four-day package from 21-25 November for \u00a3400, which on top of accommodation and food includes race registration and two days&apos; worth of guiding after the race. But it&apos;s not all about mountain biking and racing, oh no. Sometimes it is simply about riding a good-looking bike. If you&apos;re into that sort of thing, you&apos;ll probably already have heard about TokyoFixedGear.com, an online store that specialises in funky kit, inspired by (and in many cases imported from) the fixie scene in Japan. A fixed-gear bike is one that has only one gear, and the pedals will rotate as long as the back wheel is turning: stop pedalling and you&apos;ll be catapulted over the handlebars. But by virtue of their simplicity \u2013 no gear mechanisms, only one brake, simple geometry \u2013 they can be things of beauty. On 25 November, the shop stops being virtual and becomes a reality with its opening in Soho, London. The fixie culture isn&apos;t limited to the capital \u2013 Bristol has a dynamic scene, for example \u2013 but I can&apos;t be all places at once, so if you know of any great fixie shops, or indeed cycle cafes, anywhere else in the UK, let me know.

This gent has been building bikes for decades and running his brilliant bike maintenance course for almost as long. He will teach you everything from the best way to put on a tyre without using levers, to the dark art of wheel building. Having participated in one of his two-week spectaculars I can confirm that yes, it is a dark art. Now he is putting together a cycle tour trip to India to coincide with the Commonwealth Games in 2010. The trip is based in Delhi and will take in both the track and road cycling events, plus a fair amount of sightseeing. With over 20 Indian cycle tours under their belts, Alf and his wife, Theresa, are pretty experienced at arranging rides in the country, plus you get the bike wisdom of a veteran frame builder.

But Barack Obama will face tough challenges over the economy, trade and Japan&apos;s alliance with Washington from the moment he arrives in Tokyo tomorrow at the start of his first presidential visit to the region. Until recently, the US could depend on Japan \u2013 its closest Asian ally for 50 years \u2013 to smooth its path into trickier diplomatic territory nearby. But the recent election of a centre-left government in Tokyo intent on ending Japan&apos;s subservience to Washington is threatening to weaken what a former US ambassador to the country described as the most important bilateral partnership in the world. South Korea, another old ally, will push hard for progress on a stalled trade agreement, though administration officials have played down hope of a breakthrough. Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their most amicable for years. But some observers question whether closer ties will bring measurable results, and the friendship is not without its problems: today it emerged that Obama may ditch his sole meeting with the Chinese public unless Washington and Beijing can resolve disagreements over its format. In an interview with Reuters this week, Obama described China as a &quot;vital partner&quot;, but warned of &quot;enormous strains&quot; if economic imbalances between the country and the US were not corrected. Trade tensions have already been felt, with China attacking US tariffs on its tyres and steel pipes. But Beijing hinted today that it might allow appreciation of the yuan. American manufacturers complain the Chinese currency is kept artificially low. Obama&apos;s nine-day, four-country tour will also see him putting the case for the release of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to Burma&apos;s prime minister, Thein Sein, and other south-east Asian leaders in Singapore. But Obama&apos;s priority will be addressing the rift with Tokyo \u2013 caused by a 2006 agreement to reduce the American presence on the southern island of Okinawa, home to more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan. The US is keen to push ahead with the deal \u2013 12 years in the making \u2013 which would see the Futenma military base relocated from the crowded city of Ginowan to a remote site off the east coast. The move would also presage the transfer of 8,000 marines to the US Pacific territory of Guam. Japan&apos;s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, took office promising to review the agreement. His apparent preference is for the base to be moved out of Okinawa altogether, possibly to a location overseas. &quot;There are many issues that President Obama is concerned about and issues that Japan is concerned about, so we would like to discuss each theme,&quot; he told the Japanese parliament. &quot;I am convinced it will be a meaningful trip.&quot; Obama says he expects Japan to abide by the $10bn (\u00a36bn) agreement to relocate Futenma to a new offshore location. &quot;It is perfectly appropriate for the new government to want to re-examine how to move forward,&quot; he said in an interview with Japanese broadcaster NHK. &quot;I am confident that once that review is completed that they will conclude that the alliance we have, the basing arrangements that have been discussed, all those things serve the interests of Japan and they will continue.&quot; Hatoyama&apos;s unenviable task will be to reconcile Washington&apos;s demands with opposition to the US presence on Okinawa. At the weekend more than 20,000 people protested against the US presence, a show of force that coincided with the arrest of an American soldier accused of killing a Japanese man in a hit-and-run incident. Attempts have begun to get the leaders&apos; meeting off to an auspicious start, with Japan&apos;s pledge on Tuesday of 5bn yen in aid for Afghanistan over five years. The announcement was designed to assuage US concerns that Japan&apos;s commitment to the &quot;war on terror&quot; is wavering following its decision not to renew its refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of the US and allied forces in Afghanistan. The global economy and North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme will be a priority throughout Obama&apos;s tour, as will climate change, with the Copenhagen summit just weeks away. His hosts will also want to explore China&apos;s growing influence in the region. With the country forecast to overtake Japan as Asia&apos;s biggest economy next year, concerns persist in Tokyo about the prospect of closer ties between Washington and Beijing. &quot;That idea sends shivers down Japanese spines,&quot; said Richard Samuels, a Japan security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Obama&apos;s overarching message will be that &quot;the US is here to stay in Asia&quot;, Jeffrey Bader, the president&apos;s top Asia adviser, said last week, vowing that &quot;the US will be a player and participant on the ground floor, not a distant spectator&quot;. In China, North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme, and that of Iran, will be high on the agenda, as will Afghanistan and Pakistan. But no major announcements are expected and the White House effectively dismissed the prospect of a climate change agreement between the world&apos;s two largest carbon emitters. US officials have said Obama will also raise human rights. In his meeting this Sunday with the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations, Obama will press for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and more than 2,000 other political prisoners in Burma. His new policy of engagement with the Burmese junta is already paying dividends. Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asia, recently met Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon, while this week a senior Burmese diplomat suggested she could soon be released to play a role in elections planned for next year."}, {"sentences": ["Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo today at the start of a nine-day trip that will take in South Korea and China, but the issue that will haunt his visit will never be far away: Afghanistan, especially after leaked diplomatic memos exposed deep divisions in his administration."], "tags": ["US military", "US foreign policy", "Obama administration", "US news", "Afghanistan", "World news", "Hamid Karzai"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T22:05:52Z", "title": "Pressure grows on Barack Obama as memos expose rifts over Afghan policy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/12/barack-obama-afghanistan-troops-policy", "article": "Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo today at the start of a nine-day trip that will take in South Korea and China, but the issue that will haunt his visit will never be far away: Afghanistan, especially after leaked diplomatic memos exposed deep divisions in his administration. The correspondence from the US ambassador, Karl Eikenberry, expressing opposition to more US troops being sent unless the Afghan government makes a serious attempt to clean up corruption, came at an awkward moment for Obama. He was already being criticised for taking too long to reach a decision over how many more US troops to commit to counter a growing Taliban resurgence. Nato allies such as Britain have been waiting patiently for a decision, and the delay may have given encouragement to the Taliban, sensing uncertainty and vulnerability. Eikenberry&apos;s two forcefully worded diplomatic cables, sent last week to the US state department, reinforce that sense of dithering. He said it would be unwise to send more troops because of the corruption and ineffectiveness of Hamid Karzai&apos;s government. That puts him at odds with the US commander, General Stanley McChrystal, who is pushing for an extra 40,000 US troops for Afghanistan, on top of the 68,000 already committed. Without the extra troops, McChrystal has warned, the war against the Taliban could be lost. Eikenberry&apos;s immediate boss, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, did not comment on the leak, but she echoed some of his concerns at a press conference in Manila today when she criticised Afghanistan&apos;s &quot;corruption, lack of transparency, poor governance, absence of the rule of law&quot;. She added: &quot;We&apos;re looking to President Karzai as he forms a new government to take action that will demonstrate not just to the international community but first and foremost to his own people that his second term will respond to the needs that are so manifest.&quot; One of Eikenberry&apos;s main concerns is that more troops will simply mean less pressure on the Afghanistan government to take responsibility for security. Instead of helping to establish a credible Afghan army and police force, a build-up of international troops allows Karzai to focus his attention on other issues. Eikenberry, a retired army general and former commander in Afghanistan, has been at odds with McChrystal since the ambassador was still in uniform. But the differences between the two amount to more than just a settling of personal scores: they are the fundamental point of debate within the Obama administration. Obama and his generals, diplomats and political advisers have to decide whether extra troops will make a difference if the government in Kabul does not enjoy popular support. The Obama administration is mindful of the long history of failed US attempts at propping up corrupt, badly-run and illegitimate governments in Latin America, Asia and Africa. According to a US administration official, Obama has still not made up his mind about how many extra troops to give McChrystal in spite of eight meetings of his security team in the White House&apos;s situation room since September. Neither has he decided how to put pressure on Karzai to deal with the corruption that is undermining public support in Afghanistan. In the situation room on Wednesday Obama looked at four possible options, which appear to be whether to send 10,000 more troops, 20,000, 30,0000 or 40,000, and what they would do once they are there. At the end of the meeting he rejected them all and asked for further revisions of the options and more details of possible timelines for when the Afghan army and police would be ready to take over and US forces leave. The failure to reach a decision now means an announcement could still be weeks away, even though the head of the US Central Command, General David Petraeus, said the president was close to a decision. Obama could include on his trip a surprise visit to Kabul to confront Karzai, issuing him an ultimatum face-to-face. But it is unlikely Obama would make an announcement about a US troop increase either in Kabul or elsewhere abroad. The White House said he wants to explain his decision to the US people and that would probably involve a nationwide broadcast from Washington. But the week after he returns from Asia is the week of Thanksgiving, with Americans in a holiday mood, not wanting to hear about more troops for an increasingly unpopular war. Delay until next month becomes even more problematic. There would be an element of embarrassment in announcing more US troops for Afghanistan just before heading to Oslo to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize on 10 December. The White House line is that it is better that Obama takes his time, making the contrast with what Democrats argue was president George Bush&apos;s impetuous rush to war in Iraq. Administration officials argued today that there is in reality no difference between Eikenberry and McChrystal: both agree that Karzai has to clean up his government. But there is a difference: McChrystal wants the extra troops as soon as possible, not wanting to wait until Karzai takes action. As Obama travels round Asia his special representative on Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, is visiting Berlin, Paris and Islamabad to hear the views of US allies."}, {"sentences": ["The title is a mistranslation of someone&apos;s remark that Tokyo contains an awful lot of people."], "tags": ["Comedy", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-13T00:01:00Z", "title": "Film review: Lalapipo - A Lot of People", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/13/lalapipo-a-lot-of-people-review", "article": "The title is a mistranslation of someone&apos;s remark that Tokyo contains an awful lot of people.

Perhaps the process of achieving justice for the family of the British teacher can begin at last. However, the Hawkers are not the only victims of this sad episode; others will suffer, albeit indirectly and to a much lesser extent, from the ensuing cultural fallout. This is because the mainstream media has seized on the crime as an excuse to indulge in practically the only form of overt racism still tolerated today \u2013 the demonisation and denigration, en masse, of Japanese men. When British citizens are killed abroad, the countries in which the crime takes place rarely attract such negative scrutiny as Japan has with the Hawker case. As David McNeill remarked in the Japan Times a couple of months after the murder, the case unleashed a flurry of &quot;yellow peril&quot; scaremongering in the western media. Typical of the response was the Daily Mail, which sent a reporter to the Roppongi entertainment district of Tokyo (hardly the place to find a cross-section of Japanese society) to get the lowdown on Japanese men from foreign bar hostesses. They rattled off the old stereotypes of the men as &apos;&quot;strange, uncomfortable and unpredictable&quot;, &quot;so very different to us&quot;, impossible to understand and having an unhealthy attitude to foreign women. The paper announced that the murder had &quot;cast a sinister shadow&quot; over Tokyo&apos;s entire female expatriate community. &quot;In Japan,&quot; it proclaimed, &quot;British women constantly have to put up with unwanted male attention \u2013 such as the endemic groping on the trains&quot;. Later, it interviewed another British teacher who cautioned women to be &quot;wary&quot; before travelling to the country. Others have also capitalised on this crude stereotype. In September 2008, Radio 4 broadcast a play by John Dryden and Miriam Smith entitled A Tokyo Murder, which was loosely based on the Hawker case and which trotted out the same xenophobic caricatures about an uptight society with an underlying streak of insanity that refuses to co-operate with western forces of reason and justice. This year Clare Campbell included a discussion of the Hawker case in Tokyo Hostess, an investigation of the Roppongi bar scene and the Lucie Blackman murder \u2013 even though Lindsay Hawker had nothing to do with hostessing. As Susanna Jones commented in a review of Campbell&apos;s book, the only thing the murders have in common is that Blackman and Hawker were &quot;targeted by horrifyingly dangerous men&quot;. To imply that the presence of two psychopaths makes a whole country dangerous for foreign women is to leap to the most preposterous of conclusions. And it is not just the Blackman and Hawker cases that invite this approach. The same ignorant stereotypes are rolled out at any opportunity. Newspaper reports of the Nomura sex discrimination case emphasise the fact that the bank is Japanese, even though sex discrimination is endemic in banking and companies of every nation are routinely sued for it. Television programmes seek out oddballs to portray as mainstream, eating live fish, doing cosplay or collecting hentai manga. And cinemagoers would be forgiven for thinking that every other Japanese was a geisha or a yakuza. Any half-informed piece of disinformation seems to suffice where Japan is concerned. I have lived in Japan for nine years, I have a Japanese husband and son, and I can honestly say that the most striking thing about people here is how downright normal they are. They talk about mortgages. They worry about the flu. They walk the dog and coo at babies on trains. I have never felt threatened, have never experienced &quot;unwanted male attention&quot; or been assaulted. We have harassment and gender equality rules at work, all conscientiously observed. Ichihashi is viewed as a freak, and his picture hangs in police boxes beside those of the Aum cult members. This is modern normality, and if foreigners who came here actually bothered to learn the language and find out what people what ordinary Japanese people think they would appreciate that. Is it such a big deal if the Daily Mail indulges a bit of mindless foreigner-bashing? I think so. It affects the way my husband is treated in Britain and may hamper my son&apos;s ability to integrate into British society. The stereotyping also speaks volumes about the western psyche. It suggests that westerners resent and fear successful non-white cultures and that they cope by denigrating and dehumanising them. What Britain chooses to see in Japan says more about its own insecurities than about the Japanese, and if Britain wants any role on the world stage in the future, attitudes will have to change as Asia grows.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) ties the campaign \u2013 which has included accusations that the group&apos;s reports on the Jewish state are written by &quot;anti-Israel ideologues&quot; and that it has sought funds from Saudi Arabia \u2013 to a statement by a senior official in the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office in June pledging to &quot;dedicate time and manpower to combating&quot; human rights organisations. The criticism began with Israeli pressure groups and rightwing blogs, but in recent weeks it has drawn the support of influential individuals such as Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and Nobel peace prize winner, and HRW&apos;s own founder, Robert Bernstein, who said the organisation&apos;s reports were &quot;helping those who wish to turn Israel into a pariah state&quot;. He called on HRW to focus more on abuses by Arab governments. Iain Levine, HRW&apos;s programme director, said that while the organisation had long attracted criticism, in recent months there had been significant attempts to intimidate and discredit it. &quot;I really hesitate to use words like conspiracy, but there is a feeling that there is an organised campaign, and we&apos;re seeing from different places what would appear to be co-ordinated attacks ... from some of the language and arguments used it would seem as if there has been discussion,&quot; he said.&quot;We are having to spend a lot of time repudiating the lies, the falsehoods, the misinformation.&quot; Spearheading some of the criticism is NGO Monitor in Jerusalem, an Israeli group funded by wealthy US donors which includes Wiesel on its advisory board. It has accused HRW staff of having a &quot;political agenda&quot; to attack Israel. Criticism has particularly focused on the director of HRW&apos;s Middle East division, Sarah Leah Whitson, over a visit to Saudi Arabia. NGO Monitor accused Whitson of attempting to raise money from Saudi officials by highlighting HRW&apos;s criticism of Israel, a charge also made in a comment piece for the Wall Street Journal online that was subsequently widely distributed by the most powerful of the pro-Israel lobby groups, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). Shortly afterwards, the director of policy planning in the Israeli prime minister&apos;s office, Ron Dermer, denounced Human Rights Watch. &quot;We are going to dedicate time and manpower to combating these groups; we are not going to be sitting ducks in a pond for the human rights groups to shoot at us with impunity,&quot; he said. Levine said that Whitson&apos;s visit to Saudi Arabia was similar to trips by other HRW officials to Tokyo, Johannesburg and Tel Aviv to win the support of individuals interested in supporting human rights in their own countries and abroad. &quot;This idea that somehow the Saudi government is going to be able to influence us is nonsense. It&apos;s a cardinal principle of the organisation that we don&apos;t take government money,&quot; he said. But Levine added that Dermer&apos;s threat marked the escalation of the campaign against HRW. &quot;It was clear that you had a new government in Israel under Binyamin Netanyahu with a harder right approach. He certainly recognised that the criticisms of Israeli conduct in Gaza from a humanitarian law perspective was extremely politically damaging,&quot; he said. Levine said he believes many of the attacks were aimed at distracting attention from the report of the UN investigator, Richard Goldstone, which was highly critical of Israel&apos;s killing of civilians in its three-week attack on Gaza that started last December. Goldstone is a former member of the HRW board and the group has strongly backed his report. &quot;We have been under enormous pressure and tremendous attacks, some of them very personal, as have been the attacks against Richard Goldstone with really vituperative language used to describe him: obsequious Jew, self-loathing Jew and all the rest of it,&quot; said Levine. HRW came under renewed criticism last month from its founder, Robert Bernstein, in an opinion article in the New York Times in which he accused it of criticising Israel more than undemocratic governments in the rest of the Middle East. &quot;Human Rights Watch has lost critical perspective on a conflict in which Israel has been repeatedly attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah, organisations that go after Israeli citizens and use their own people as human shields,&quot; he wrote. Bernstein accused HRW of basing its accusations against Israel on the testimony of Palestinian &quot;witnesses whose stories cannot be verified and who may testify for political advantage or because they fear retaliation from their own rulers&quot;. Levine said that Bernstein went public only after the HRW board rejected his call for a change in direction. A few days later, Wiesel and others published a letter in the Guardian drawing attention to Bernstein&apos;s article, accusing HRW of playing a &quot;destructive role&quot; and calling for a review by the organisation&apos;s board. In September, HRW was shaken by accusations that its military expert and collector of war memorabilia, Marc Garlasco, is a Nazi sympathiser after describing an SS jacket as &quot;so cool&quot; in comments on a blog. Both he and HRW vigorously deny the charge, but Garlasco has been suspended pending an investigation. At the time, Levine called the attacks on Garlasco the latest salvo in the Israeli government&apos;s campaign &quot;to eliminate the space for legitimate criticism&quot; of the Israeli military."}, {"sentences": ["Kicking off his visit in Tokyo, he also sought to thaw the chill in relations with his hosts, America&apos;s closest allies in the region."], "tags": ["Obama administration", "China", "Japan", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-15T00:06:13Z", "title": "China's role on world stage is no cause for alarm, says Obama", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/15/obama-japan-china-visit", "article": "Barack Obama introduced himself as America&apos;s &quot;first Pacific president&quot; as he launched his four-nation tour of the region, vowing to deepen ties with Asia and arguing that China&apos;s rise should be welcomed rather than feared.

The new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, has vowed to make Japan less dependent on the US, but the two men agreed to put off the issue of resolving the future of US forces in Japan. However, police in China are reported to have detained dozens of dissidents in a crackdown ahead of Obama&apos;s arrival there today. Human rights campaigners said that at least 30 activists who were expected to apply for the right to hold protests directed at the Chinese government during the US president&apos;s visit were arrested. Reformers worry that Obama will play down China&apos;s poor human rights record in order to maintain good relations on issues such as the economy. &quot;We get the impression Obama doesn&apos;t want to talk about human rights on this trip, but it is precisely because of his visit here that these people are being rounded up and detained right now,&quot; Ai Weiwei, a Beijing-based artist and social commentator, told the Financial Times. Speaking yesterday during the first stop on his nine-day Asian tour, Obama told an audience of 1,500 in the Japanese capital: &quot;I want every American to know that we have a stake in the future of this region, because what happens here has a direct effect on our lives at home.&quot; American officials have portrayed the trip as an opportunity to develop relationships and make progress on non-proliferation, climate change and the economy, and are playing down expectations of any agreements. As in his previous foreign affairs speeches, Obama emphasised his personal ties in the region \u2013 referring to his birth in Hawaii, time in Indonesia and boyhood travels in Asia \u2013 and the administration&apos;s break with unilateralism. &quot;We welcome China&apos;s efforts to play a greater role on the world stage \u2013 a role in which their growing economy is joined by growing responsibility,&quot; he said. &quot;Power does not need to be a zero-sum game and nations need not fear the success of another.&quot; He held out a hand to North Korea again, calling for it to denuclearise; and to Burma, if it undertakes democratic reform and frees political prisoners, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma&apos;s prime minister will be present at the president&apos;s meeting with Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) leaders in Singapore. Obama also announced that the US will sign up to a trans-Pacific free trade agreement. That may help to deflect accusations of protectionism, which are likely to be aired throughout his tour. He stressed the need for &quot;balanced&quot; growth and said Asian countries should not be dependent on exports to the US. The economic crisis has underlined the interdependence of &quot;Chimerica&quot; in particular and the trade imbalance that has left China with vast US dollar holdings. Washington wants the Chinese currency, the yuan, to appreciate further; Beijing will repeat its concerns that US debt could endanger its dollar holdings. But Obama&apos;s Chinese visit is about more than money. The world&apos;s two largest carbon emitters are meeting just weeks away from the Copenhagen climate-change conference. China&apos;s influence on North Korea and Iran are central to Obama&apos;s non-proliferation agenda. Its handling of Afghanistan and Pakistan will also be high up in discussions. Obama&apos;s China policy is essentially his predecessor&apos;s; the relationship is increasingly amicable. But some fear attempts to broaden it could mean less meaningful engagement. &quot;Bush&apos;s approach was: you are rising in the international system and need to take on more responsibility,&quot; said Victor Cha, director of Asian affairs in the National Security Council under George Bush and now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;Obama is heaping on all these very, very high expectations \u2013 on issues like climate change and currency \u2013 and I think they are expectations that China cannot possibly meet.&quot; China sees itself as a vulnerable developing country as well as a rising power. And shared anxieties \u2013 such as those over proliferation \u2013 do not equal identical interests. &quot;China&apos;s own interests in those hot spots [North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan] make it deeply conflicted about playing a larger role on the world stage,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt\u00a0of the International Crisis Group. &quot;While the United States frames China in terms of its growing responsibilities as a major power, China continues to think primarily in terms of its own interests.&quot; To some observers, the administration is also too keen to please Beijing, wasting leverage rather than smoothing the path to greater gains. Obama&apos;s decision not to meet the Dalai Lama last month \u2013 aides say he will do so in future \u2013 &quot;doesn&apos;t send a signal that the US wants to work with China; it sends a signal they have basically got us,&quot; said Cha."}, {"sentences": ["As is the company&apos;s Project Natal, which Extra Time had hands-on time with at the Tokyo Games Show recently."], "tags": ["Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-15T00:10:02Z", "title": "Why TV sport will never be lonely again | Giles Richards", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/15/mediawatch-giles-richards", "article": "As the behemoth that is free-to-air sport reawakens, it&apos;s a timely reminder of a) How complex the issue of &quot;watching sport on the telly&quot; has become (The olden days: Turn on telly.

Time-shift viewing has killed destination TV \u2013 which means less water-cooler wittering but also fewer mass fixed-point, fixed-time shared experiences. Moments that are partly defined by the knowledge that everyone who can, will, be watching at the same time. Which, in the absence of us returning to the moon in the near future, leaves live reality TV shows and live sport. Hence the behemoth. Hence the endless search for new ways to consume sport and hence Sky Player on XBox 360. Launched recently and now available fully nationwide the application forms part of Microsoft&apos;s strategy to turn their gaming console into a broader entertainment device with a target demographic extending right across the family. On purchase the system downloads into the XBox and offers the movie channel library (over 400) a variety of entertainment channels, on-demand programming and, of course, all the Sky Sports channels plus ESPN. Fairly straight-forward stuff for the modern world (The olden days: Three channels tops, and one of those showed a girl playing noughts and crosses with a puppet half the time). But it does have several advantages over the dish on-the-house version, the main one being that subscription to the sports channels is available on a monthly basis (all four plus ESPN: \u00a343). This is the only way they can be seen on TV without a 12-month contract and is also slightly cheaper (\u00a31.50 per month). You&apos;ll also need a subscription to the XBox Live Gold service (\u00a34.99 a month, 12 months: \u00a339.99) but that also enables access to online gaming, downloadable content \u2013 TV, films, Twitter, Facebook and LastFM as well. The service is ideal for event-specific fans (The Ryder Cup, Lions Tours, cricket, US Open tennis and golf etc) and for shared households or people who move around a lot. We&apos;re looking at you students \u2013 no installation costs, no fitting a dish, no haggling about how you divide a year by five people when you&apos;re only actually there for nine months and you&apos;ve probably already got the XBox too (The olden days: Get out of bed at 1pm, watch Neighbours, shout at the South African Embassy for several hours. Union bar). And for grown ups who already subscribe to Sky Sports the Sky Player live sport channels are free if you already have Sky multiroom or broadband and only \u00a35 to upgrade to otherwise \u2013 effectively making the XBox your multiroom device, although the downside for technophiles at the moment is that the picture is only in standard definition. The ethos driving the development is, according to Robbie Bach, Microsoft&apos;s president of entertainment, about community. &quot;Half the fun is getting together to go to a game. We&apos;re producing a digital version of that social experience.&quot; Which means watching online with friends, communicating via headset and being represented by avatars at the front of the screen, who will leap up and perform actions (boo, cheer, laugh etc) as instructed by you. But isn&apos;t this an attempt to just lure people away from the real live experience? &quot;If you have an opportunity to go to the game \u2013 you should go to the game,&quot; says Bach, &quot;but the mathematics are that only so many people actually have that opportunity. Alternatively you can go on XBox Live and have a virtual social experience&quot;. Which seems, at first, a slightly disconcerting concept \u2013 watching at home &quot;with friends&quot; \u2013 but really is just a different way to participate in sport&apos;s unique moments. It is a new experience and it&apos;ll take a little getting used to but this is technology leaving the olden days behind.

The revolutionary piece of hardware uses 3D visual imaging to allow games on the XBox 360 to be played using full body motion \u2013 without controllers. The system has no confirmed release date yet but huge potential. A demo of driving title Burnout Paradise controlled solely by moving feet and hands was intriguing and, at this stage in the development of the system the motion sensing clearly works.

He made the demand during a summit in Singapore with Thein Sein and nine other leaders of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean). The meeting made Obama the first US president to be present in the same room as a Burmese leader since Lyndon Johnson met Prime Minister Ne Win in 1966. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters that Obama had raised the subject of Aung San Suu Kyi &quot;directly with that government&quot;, indicating that he had spoken directly to Thein Sein. There were conflicting reports whether the US president had shaken hands with the Burmese premier. After the meeting, Obama told reporters that he had &quot;reaffirmed&quot; an offer made earlier of better relations with Washington if Burma pursued democratic reforms and freed political prisoners. Speaking in Tokyo yesterday, Obama made a point of mentioning Aung San Suu Kyi by name, adding that Burma would only find &quot;true security and prosperity&quot; by releasing her and more than 2,000 other political prisoners. He acknowledged that years of US sanctions against Burma, coupled with engagement by its Asian neighbours, had failed to bring about change. &quot;Despite years of good intentions, neither sanctions by the US nor engagement of others have succeeded in improving the lives of Burmese people,&quot; he said. &quot;So we are now communicating directly with the leadership to make it clear that existing sanctions will remain until there are concrete steps toward democratic reform. &quot;There are clear steps that must be taken.&quot; Following today&apos;s meeting, the Asean leaders said they hoped the US&apos;s new policy of engagement with Burma would &quot;contribute to broad political and economic reforms&quot; and said next year&apos;s Burmese elections &quot;must be conducted in a free, fair, inclusive and transparent manner in order to be credible to the international community&quot;. But the statement made no mention of Aung San Suu Kyi and did not call for the release of political prisoners. Afterwards, Thein Sein expressed his appreciation that Washington had decided to re-engage with Burma. &quot;It will be a new chapter in the relationship to all the countries in the region,&quot; the Asean secretary general, Surin Pitsuwan, quoted him as saying. The meeting was the first between a US president and the leaders of Asean, which was formed more than 40 years ago at the height of the Vietnam war. Obama attended the meeting as part of a nine-day visit to Asia that began in Japan on Friday. The US and Asean have arrived at a rare consensus on the need to engage Burma to bring about political reforms and improvements in human rights. Obama recently launched a new policy of engagement with the country&apos;s military junta, while insisting sanctions would stay in place until there were signs of real progress. Aung San Suu Kyi is serving 18 months in detention after a Burmese court found her guilty of allowing an uninvited American guest to stay at her home in violation of the terms of her house arrest. Critics of the dictatorship denounced the trial and verdict as an attempt to exclude her from elections due to be held next year. Her opposition National League for Democracy won elections in 1990 but the result was never recognised by the junta, which has ruled Burma since 1962. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent 14 of the last 20 years in detention, has said she supports the White House&apos;s fresh approach, and earlier this month met Kurt Campbell, Obama&apos;s top diplomat for east Asia, in a rare trip outside her dilapidated mansion in the capital, Rangoon."}, {"sentences": ["Koichiro Kamei, managing director at financial research firm Market Strategy Institute in Tokyo, told Reuters that the recent gold rally appears sustainable because the market has not felt the &quot;real euphoria&quot; of a daily price jump of more than 3%."], "tags": ["Gold", "Randgold Resources", "Rio Tinto", "Xstrata", "Lonmin", "Shire", "Business", "J Sainsbury", "FTSE"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-16T09:06:21Z", "title": "FTSE reaches 2009 high as gold hits another record", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2009/nov/16/ftse-gold-record-high", "article": "A rally in the mining sector has pushed the Footsie to its highest level of 2009, on a morning when gold also hit another record high.

With its mines in Mali, C\u00f4te d&apos;Ivoire and Senegal, Randgold is well-placed to profit for the recent soaring price of gold. It hit a new high this morning of $1,132.95 per ounce.  Traders blamed the weakening dollar, which slid by 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies. There is now speculation that gold could reach $1,200 within a few weeks. Koichiro Kamei, managing director at financial research firm Market Strategy Institute in Tokyo, told Reuters that the recent gold rally appears sustainable because the market has not felt the &quot;real euphoria&quot; of a daily price jump of more than 3%. As gold is priced in dollars, a falling greenback pushes up its price. But there is also been an increase in risk-averse investors buying bullion, while some speculators believe that central banks could even follow India&apos;s example of moving their reserves out of dollars and into gold. &quot;The strength in the gold price is demand-driven, mainly as an alternative to the dollar,&quot; Catherine Gignac, a managing director of mining research at Sandfire Securities in Toronto."}, {"sentences": ["It remains to be seen, however, whether the president will show the bandwidth in the next few days to make mention of the Chinese citizen and activist Feng Zhenghu, who has been barred from re-entering the country and remains stuck in Tokyo&apos;s Narita airport, the very same airport through which Barack Obama passed on his way to China."], "tags": ["Twitter", "China", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Media", "Internet", "Censorship", "Barack Obama", "Freedom of speech", "US news", "Law", "Social media", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-16T16:00:01Z", "title": "Obama takes on the China firewall | Isaac Mao", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/16/obama-china-internet-freedom", "article": "In the leadup to the eagerly awaited arrival of President Obama in China, the government has gone to some lengths to avoid the Dalai Lama question coming to the fore \u2013 including an attempt to point to a history of slavery. (Last week, China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman implicitly warned Obama to avoid embracing the Dalai Lama by making reference to China&apos;s claimed liberation of Tibetan slaves: &quot;He is a black president, and he understands the slavery abolition movement and Lincoln&apos;s major significance for that movement.&quot;) But by focusing, to the point of paranoia, on forestalling any dissident upstaging, authorities may have overlooked a strategic question of greater immediate importance to the Obama administration: the Chinese blogosphere. Obama&apos;s reference to censorship and the internet in Shanghai today came as little surprise to those of us who attended a briefing last week organised by the US embassy. No traditional journalists were present; instead a range of prominent bloggers fresh from the fifth Chinese Blogger Conference in Guangdong province and a mix of opinion leaders were invited to three consulates in China, linked by a video conferencing system. The respected blogger Wen Yunchao said many internet users wanted Obama to urge Chinese leaders to release the internet from heavy censorship. In response, Wang Zheng, from Chinese Media University, argued that mainstream public opinion was not bothered about internet freedom \u2013 that they cared instead about financial freedom and freedom to travel. Bloggers in attendance swiftly tweeted Wang&apos;s remarks, triggering a big debate online. Within hours he had been given a new moniker by the twittersphere: Mr Mainstream. And still Chinese authorities march to the same old beat. In recent days they have detained several dissidents and civic right activists, including Zhao Lianhai, Yao Lifa, Zhang Mingxuan and Liu Zhengyou. It&apos;s the same mentality seen in the runup to the Olympic Games and after the Sichuan earthquake. The system is devoted to harmony in the short term, which leads to loss in the long term. But the booming internet cannot be controlled for much longer. It plays host to the panoply of opinions, collected in the form of a dynamic cloud, its shape constantly changing so that no one can map it. Followers of Mr Mainstream, upon hearing Obama&apos;s concerns about internet censorship, may respond by saying: &quot;We are not censoring the internet, we are merely enforcing existing laws.&quot; Maybe, but the internet has been anything but silent as Obama&apos;s trip approached. Beyond the moderated discussion on the official Xinhua news agency website, thousands of voices have sprung up on Twitter, collected from the twittersphere in a tag called #obamacn, started by Rebecca Machinnon, a famous China Internet expert. In his session with students in Shanghai \u2013 the only public meeting scheduled for his visit \u2013 Obama showed his shrewedness by sending a message about the internet and freedom of expression. One senses he knows something about the shape of clouds. It remains to be seen, however, whether the president will show the bandwidth in the next few days to make mention of the Chinese citizen and activist Feng Zhenghu, who has been barred from re-entering the country and remains stuck in Tokyo&apos;s Narita airport, the very same airport through which Barack Obama passed on his way to China."}, {"sentences": ["Ichihashi, 30, fled from police on the day Hawker&apos;s body was found buried in a bathtub of sand on the balcony of his apartment in Ichikawa, a suburban town in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, in March 2007."], "tags": ["Lindsay Hawker", "Japan", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-18T10:14:34Z", "title": "Lindsay Hawker murder suspect on hunger strike", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/18/lindsay-hawker-suspect-hunger-strike", "article": "The man suspected of murdering British woman Lindsay Hawker in Japan in 2007 has refused to eat or to answer investigators&apos; questions since his arrest more than a week ago.

Tokyo is now the culinary bible&apos;s most decorated city, with 261 stars - 34 more than last year - spanning 197 establishments. Pity Paris, then, which has not only lost its three-star title to the upstart in the Far East, but lags well behind in the overall \u00e9toiles count. The news from Japan was nothing less than a blow to the pride of all self-respecting Parisians. But only if they ignore the hulking discrepancy in Michelin&apos;s claims: Tokyo has 160,000 restaurants, compared to Paris&apos;s 40,000. That the former commands the slimmest possible lead in three-star restaurants is hardly cause for agony in the arrondissements. Viewed against that background, this is less a battle - and a fairly pointless one at that - between two great cities, than a spot of pre-launch hyperbole manufactured by the guide&apos;s publishers. What is the betting that when the next edition of the Paris guide is published in March 2010, Naret will once appear to remind us that the French capital is the culinary capital of the world? The Michelin guide&apos;s history in Japan has been fraught with controversy. When the first Tokyo edition appeared in 2007, Japanese restaurateurs and food critics bristled at the notion that a team of French judges could possibly understand the finer points of Japanese cuisine. To ward off similar criticisms, this year all seven of Michelin&apos;s undercover inspectors were Japanese. Their updated guide, with an initial print run of 150,000 copies in Japanese, will go on sale this Friday. But think twice before buying one.

He may find matters altogether less daunting when he steps out in front of 20,000 for his first match of the ATP World Tour finals in London&apos;s O2 arena, beginning on Sunday. Murray, the world No4, will not be the favourite but home support should be a decided advantage for this end-of-season elite eight-man tournament when all the players are a little weary. Last year in Shanghai the Scot scored a startling victory over Roger Federer, the world No1, to knock him out of the competition at the initial round\u2011robin stage for the first time. Yesterday Murray and Federer were drawn in the same group again, along with Argentina&apos;s Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, the reigning US Open champion, and the Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, with the top two to qualify for the semi-finals a week on Saturday. The other round-robin group comprises Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic, the holder, Nikolay Davydenko, and Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling, a late replacement for the injured Andy Roddick, this year&apos;s Wimbledon runner-up. Ideally Murray might have preferred to be in Nadal&apos;s group, simply because the Spanish world No2 appeared far from comfortable at the recent Paris Masters, and does not particularly enjoy playing indoors. However, the British No1 holds a career head-to-head advantage over Federer (6-3), Del Potro (4-1) and Verdasco (7-1), so should feel confident of reaching the semi-final, as he did on his debut last year. &quot;All of the guys are tough otherwise they wouldn&apos;t be here and at his best there is no one tougher than Roger,&quot; said Murray yesterday after being present at the draw made in one of the London Eye&apos;s windswept pods. London is the 15th city to host this end-of-season tournament. The pressure will be on him, though not to the same extent as Wimbledon where Murray reached the semi-finals this year. &quot;It&apos;s great that so many people are coming to watch at the O2 and that the ticket sales have been so good,&quot; Murray added. &quot;The Wimbledon build\u2011up with Queens makes it a lot longer and maybe in a couple of years&apos; time I won&apos;t notice it so much, but you&apos;d have to say this is not quite the same, though I&apos;m very focused.&quot;London is the 15th different city to play host to the year-end championships, which began in 1970 in Tokyo, with Murray attempting to become only the third player, after Spain&apos;s Alex Corretja and David Nalbandian of Argentina, to win the tournament without having won a major. Ticket sales have topped 250,000. &quot;It&apos;s incredible,&quot; said Murray. &quot;There is no shortage of interest in tennis and not just around Wimbledon.

Analysis of the companies in the FTSE 100 in January 2000, prepared for Guardian Money by stockbrokers Charles Stanley, reveals that cigarette makers British American Tobacco (its brands include Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall) was the best performer, rising 454%. Imperial Tobacco was not far behind; the maker of Davidoff, West, Gauloises Blondes and Rizla saw its shares jump 400% over the 10 years. Yet this was the decade that saw smoking banned in workplaces, pubs and restaurants, and large numbers of smokers stubbing out their habit. How did cigarettes make so much money? The reality is that the tobacco companies more than made up for declines in the west with fast-growing sales in countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan. Back in January 2000, BAT had a stockmarket capitalisation of \u00a37.2bn, a fraction of British Telecom&apos;s \u00a392.5bn price tag in the halcyon days of the TMT boom. Today BAT is valued at \u00a339.4bn, almost four times that of a shrivelled BT, which sold off its \u00a317bn mobile phone subsidiary and is now worth just \u00a311.4bn. After cigarettes, it was food, drink and commodity companies that made the most money over the decade. Resource stocks BHP Billiton, BG, Rio Tinto and Anglo American all gave investors a return of 150% or more over the decade. Meanwhile, Associated British Food, Tesco, Diageo and Whitbread all more than doubled in value. But the losers far outnumbered the winners. On the last trading day of 1999, in a moment of tech-driven millennial madness, the FTSE 100 touched a record high of 7000. It promptly fell 800 points over the next month and, 10 years on, remains substantially below its peak. BP has fallen by 5% over the decade, despite the phenomenal rise in petrol prices. Vodafone is down 55%, Lloyds has dived 85% and RBS is 87% lower. Yet in December 1999 the major investment banks were predicting that 2000 would see the FTSE rush up even further, to 7500 and beyond. CSFB&apos;s annual study of equity returns celebrated 130 years of stockmarket growth and predicted &quot;history shows that equities can remain above trend for reasonably long periods of time&quot;. Today, only 66 of the companies in the FTSE 100 on 1 January 2000 even survive. Mergers and acquisitions saw NatWest, Abbey, Reuters and Hanson move out, but most notable is the massive shrinkage of the buzzy net and telecom stocks at the time, such as Colt, Misys and Logica. When the 1980s Japan property bubble burst, we wondered how we could ever have believed that the gardens of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were worth more than nearly all of California. At the end of the 1990s, Microsoft was valued at more than the entire GDP of Canada. What is today&apos;s bubble? Some point to commodities, gold and China. Maybe the biggest lesson we have all learned is that markets are more prone to madness than rationality. The best shares for the next 10 years? Jeremy Batstone, Charles Stanley &quot;Who&apos;s to say that tobacco won&apos;t be at the top again in another 10 years? Possibly a miner, given strong demand for commodities, or maybe an oil stock on concerns regarding resource depletion, and possibly a sharp spike in oil prices (although the relationship between oil shares and the oil price is not exactly linear).&quot;     An empty cigarette packet with health warning Photograph: David Sillitoe    Dean Turner, Barclays Wealth &quot;The key to picking stocks for the next 10 years is to look at companies that have a strong competitive position over their rivals, including strong brands, leading market positions and growing markets. In addition, a good dividend yield and potential for growth are key selection criteria. With this in mind, I would pick natural monopolies such as oil or telecom companies, including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Vodafone. In addition, global leaders such as BAT in tobacco, Diageo in the drinks industry or Tesco in retailing are likely to continue dominating their respective industries. Nevertheless, the caveat is that competitive advantages tend to erode over time, so picking stocks so far in the future is inherently risky.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 26 November 2009 Below we perpetuated a spelling error instead of correcting it: Ichikawa, not Ishikawa, is a Tokyo suburb.", "\u2022\u2008A report said that the body of Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher, was found at a flat in Ichikawa, east of Tokyo: in fact the city is Ishikawa (Master of disguise arrested for murder of teacher found in bath, 11 November, page 9)."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2009-11-23T00:06:07Z", "title": "Corrections and clarifications", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/nov/23/corrections-clarifications", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 26 November 2009 Below we perpetuated a spelling error instead of correcting it: Ichikawa, not Ishikawa, is a Tokyo suburb. \u2022\u2008Lemmy rocks towards his bus pass like a force 10 gale, declared a review celebrating Mot\u00f6rhead&apos;s 63-year-old Ian Kilmister (19 November, page 38).

Over the past fortnight that momentous night in Sydney has felt increasingly distant, flickering in the memory like an old Pathe newsreel. Even Martin Johnson is beginning to sound like a hard-pressed politician, claiming signs of progress despite the contradictory evidence. &quot;Maybe it doesn&apos;t seem so to some people but we are making strides.&quot; As with the supposed economic recovery, it depends on whom you talk to. Johnson, of course, will for ever remain in credit on English rugby&apos;s swingometer, regardless of what lies ahead. Respect for his achievements as a player, even so, cannot obscure fault lines which urgently need addressing. Do the management, not to mention the Rugby Football Union hierarchy, truly believe England are looking good for the 2010 Six Nations and beyond? On the evidence of the autumn, even taking injuries into account, Johnson&apos;s inner cabinet are no closer to stockpiling trophies than they were 18 months ago. Although New Zealand&apos;s defence is as tight as any \u2013 they have not conceded a try in Cardiff, Milan or London \u2013 England&apos;s meagre tally of one try in 240 minutes of rugby also tells a story. Attack-wise, they remain about as fluent as an inexperienced pianist with frostbitten fingers. Their autumn campaign, in the end, yielded two try-less defeats and a truly dire victory over the Pumas. England, to be blunt, have looked a mediocre team under worthy but unenlightened management. At least they are a spirited, willing group. If not, the home side would not have resisted the All Blacks on Saturday for such a lengthy period. Nor are they alone at Test or domestic level in struggling to unlock defences or make headway at the breakdown. There will also be fit reinforcements by the time they regather for their opening Six Nations Championship game against Wales on 6 February. Yet even with their first-choice XV available, England&apos;s spell in the doldrums looks set to continue. The fixture list, for a start, is unforgiving. Three stamina-sapping away games await in the Six Nations, two of them against improving Scotland and France, while Wales and Ireland will both fancy their chances in south-west London. Two summer Tests in Australia will be followed by a punishing autumn schedule against South Africa, Samoa, Australia and New Zealand. Kill or cure is the phrase that comes to mind. Then there is the issue of Jonny Wilkinson. Playing opposite Dan Carter once again magnified the areas of his game that his defensive heroism and goal-kicking can tend to obscure. Both he and Johnson are warrior statesmen who do not always exhibit the breadth of vision possessed by the great strategists. England feel reassured by Wilkinson&apos;s presence but a below-par Carter still posed a far greater threat around the gain-line. England&apos;s blunt attacking edge is not solely a result of inspired opposition defence and redeploying Wilkinson away from the No10 playmaking slot may have to be contemplated. Johnson, meanwhile, must rein in his obsession with 30-something journeymen and display more faith in the more youthful likes of Shane Geraghty, Danny Cipriani and Courtney Lawes. The evergreen Simon Shaw is a shining exception \u2013 it was no coincidence Steve Borthwick enjoyed his best game of the autumn following Shaw&apos;s return \u2013 but, at 36, he cannot go on for ever. As many as 40 players will be considered for the revised 32-man EPS squad to be named in the first week of January and Johnson simply has to be a bolder selector. &quot;There are going to be some big calls to make and that will be driven by what we think is the best way to play going into the Six Nations,&quot; he said. If he consults his players, they will advise him that retreating into their shells and picking defence-oriented teams will not get England very far. &quot;We showed that when we express ourselves we&apos;re a very good team,&quot; said Ugo Monye, who was much happier back on the wing. &quot;When you&apos;re up against good sides, we can&apos;t be afraid to play.&quot; Fitness levels must also be re-examined: England were either ahead or level in all three autumn games and won only one of them. In fairness the early loss of Joe Worsley with a twisted knee scarcely helped, while Nick Easter, Delon Armitage and Riki Flutey were all badly missed. &quot;We were sitting there in October with half the squad going down,&quot; sighed Johnson. &quot;It doesn&apos;t make it that easy.&quot; The bottom line, though, is clear enough. England under Johnson in 2009 played 10 Tests, winning five and losing five. They have been beaten in their last eight games against New Zealand and their last six against South Africa. In five contests against Tri Nations sides at home soil in the past 12 months, the men in white have scored a princely total of one try. This lack of cutting edge meant New Zealand could splutter and still win comfortably, with Carter missing two kickable penalties and a couple of tries going begging prior to Jimmy Cowan&apos;s neatly worked 57th-minute effort. It will be fascinating to see how the All Blacks go against France this Saturday. If they manage a 100% success rate on their latest odyssey through Tokyo, Cardiff, Twickenham, Milan and Marseille, Graham Henry&apos;s decision to reshuffle his coaching panel will have proved far sager than some of us predicted.

It is a measure not just of England&apos;s decline but of Wales&apos;s improvement since Warren Gatland took over as head coach two years ago. They have this month asked New Zealand and Argentina more questions than England managed and victory over Australia would leave them close to breaking into the top five of the world rankings. When Wales won at Twickenham last year for the first time since 1988 they were not expected to do so with the home side playing their first game since reaching the 2007 World Cup final, a tournament in which Wales fell at the group stage. &quot;We have never been favourites in all the years I have played at Twickenham,&quot; said the Wales flanker Martyn Williams, who made his first appearance at the ground in 1998. &quot;If we beat Australia, it would give us momentum to take into the Six Nations, although there is a lot of rugby to be played before then. &quot;England have come under some pressure this month, but I never expected New Zealand to blow them away last Saturday. England have a number of players of real quality and have had a number of guys out with injuries. With their strength in depth, it is only a matter of time before they click but we are at the stage now where we have to go to a place like Twickenham believing we can win.&quot;&quot;The quality of players we have on the bench and in reserve is greater than in any of the previous years I have been involved. We targeted four victories out of four this month and it was bitterly disappointing to come up just short against the All Blacks. The Wales squad is an exciting place to be at the moment and we have to go out and perform against Australia.&quot; The Wallabies limped into Cardiff yesterday after their 9-8 defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield and a performance that had them labelled an international laughing stock back in Australia. Six players are struggling with injuries and they have had to include seven of the starting line-up in Edinburgh in the 22 for tomorrow night&apos;s match against Cardiff Blues. &quot;Australia is a defining game for us,&quot; said the Wales attack coach, Robert Howley. &quot;Everyone will appreciate that we beat them last year and coming into this match, we would like to think we are the favourites. The Wallabies will be disappointed at their lack of finishing power last weekend, but they are an incisive side with a number of world-class players. &quot;It will be a huge afternoon for us. We stepped up against Argentina last Saturday, climbed two places to sixth in the world rankings and we want to go into the Six Nations with the scalp of a top southern hemisphere team. Both sides like to play with the ball in hand and it could well be the game of the month.&quot; Wales name their side tomorrow but Dwayne Peel will play at scrum-half with Gareth Cooper, the player who started in the position against Argentina, released to play for the Blues tomorrow, along with Williams&apos;s understudy at open-side wing forward, Sam Warburton. The centre, Tom Shanklin, is fit again after missing out on the weekend with a nose injury. The Australia coach, Robbie Deans, warned Wales not to expect dispirited opponents to turn up on Saturday. The Wallabies have won only one of their three matches against the home unions this month after losing to New Zealand in Tokyo and he laid into the squad after a first defeat to Scotland in 27 years. &quot;We have another opportunity against Wales and we are fortunate to do so because it would have been tough to chew on that last effort,&quot; he said. &quot;There is really not much involved in turning things round. We got over the line three times against Scotland and it is a question of taking that first step. I have never known a more shattered shed [dressing room] than last Saturday: it was a team that knew they had contributed to their own demise in every way possible.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;But I have to stop talking here.&quot; Curriculum vitae Age 46Education1988 Completed a master&apos;s degree in composition design from School of Design of the Faculty of Fine Arts, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts &amp; MusicCareer1988 Started working for Nintendo."], "tags": ["Nintendo", "Technology", "Games", "Wii", "The Legend of Zelda"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-25T18:45:00Z", "title": "Legend of Zelda director Eiji Aonuma | Interview", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/nov/25/eiji-aonuma-legend-zelda-interview", "article": " Eiji Aonuma, director of the Legend of Zelda franchise, has an apology to make. &quot;The Water Temple in the Ocarina of Time was notorious for being very tough to conquer,&quot; he says. &quot;I am most sorry that it was not easy for you to put on and take off the heavy boots; that all the time you had to visit the inventory. &quot;I am,&quot; he continues, genuine regret evident in his tone, &quot;very sorry about that. I should have made it much easier to switch to the heavy boots.&quot; His favourite among his dungeon designs so far, the Ocarina of Time&apos;s ingenious Water Temple is marred in his eyes by this slight ergonomic flaw. &quot;Aside from the problem with the boots,&quot; he continues, &quot;I like the Water Temple so much.&quot; Aonuma&apos;s first job for Nintendo was the design of the intricate temples and dungeons for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and he has been director of the Zelda franchise on every title since Ocarina&apos;s 1998 release, including the latest instalment, Spirit Tracks (released on DS on 7 December in the US and 11 December in the UK). He is also working on a new Wii addition to the series. Welcome to the dungeon His background, however, is in the design of marionettes, not video games. &quot;At college, I was making wooden dolls. Not simple wooden dolls, but mechanical dolls, ones that were able to play musical instruments, able to dance. I loved people seeing them and being surprised, watching them wonder how these kind of things could be done, what kind of gimmicks were inside.&quot; From the start, he says, it was clear there would be parallels between making these dolls and designing dungeons for games. &quot;I did an interview , and had my first encounter with [Nintendo&apos;s chief developer] Shigeru Miyamoto, who happened to love the dolls I brought. He said: &apos;If you want to make things like that, Nintendo might be a good place for you to work.&apos; So that&apos;s how I decided to work for the company.&quot; Like Miyamoto, Aonuma confesses not to play games much as relaxation. Once again, he is apologetic, penitent. &quot;Sometimes I hear stories of other developers who play video games in their leisure time in order to remove the stresses of video game-making. I am sorry that I cannot be that kind of hardcore gamer myself. Whenever a lot of people are playing with certain software, I try to play these games because I want to know what&apos;s in them that is capturing so much attention. That&apos;s part of my job, though.&quot; Instead, Aonuma relaxes with music: he is the leader of a 40-piece band, founded by Nintendo employees. Their name is, of course, a Zelda reference: The Wind Wakers. He admires the Professor Layton series of puzzle games on the DS for their &quot;interesting presentation style&quot;, but says that he is no good at &quot;jump games&quot; such as Mario. &quot;I always miss the point where I should land, and I always cry out and say &apos;Wait a minute, is this the end of the whole story? Is there no rescue from that?&apos;&quot; This is, he says, the root of Ocarina of Time&apos;s auto-jump system. Aonuma approaches games as he approached his puppets: as a craft. They are mechanical puzzles, designed to inspire wonder as they are understood and solved. &quot;Surprise&quot; is a word he keeps returning to. He loved the way that his dolls &quot;surprised people&quot;, and what first drew him to Nintendo was his observation that they were &quot;trying to surprise people with video games&quot;. His highest praise for Miyamoto is that, after 12 years, he &quot;still comes up with ideas that really surprise me&quot;. Surprise, for Aonuma, means the wonder of discovery. It is because he does not want to spoil the &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; that he is reluctant to reveal details about the forthcoming Wii version. However, he does offer a teaser about transportation for the series&apos; protagonist, Link. &quot;I have an eight-year-old son myself at home, and quite recently he started playing The Phantom Hourglass for DS, because when the software first hit the market he was too young. When he started playing with the boat, I told him: &apos;In the next Zelda, you are going to be able to ride on the train.&apos; He answered: &apos;OK, Dad, first boat, and then train? Surely next time, Link is going to fly in the sky ... &apos;&quot; Aonuma pauses, grinning. &quot;I just don&apos;t know. If many people make many speculations ... some of them might be correct. Right now, I have to refrain from commenting on anything.&quot; Wii move One aspect of the Wii version that Aonuma is more than happy to talk about is its control system: it will be the first Zelda title to use MotionPlus. &quot;With this attachment, your minute hand movements are more precisely reflected \u2026 You can feel it so naturally and so intuitively. It&apos;s not just an improvement over the movement of Link himself: the realisation of your more minute movements on the screen will expand the entire gameplay. I believe that we will be able to offer some great innovations in the new Legend of Zelda. Of course I have to refrain from giving any details, but we are contemplating altering the way the game progresses in comparison with all the past Legend of Zelda franchises.&quot; He looks apologetic again as he catches himself short of giving something away. &quot;But I have to stop talking here.&quot; Curriculum vitae Age 46Education1988 Completed a master&apos;s degree in composition design from School of Design of the Faculty of Fine Arts, Tokyo National University of Fine Arts &amp; MusicCareer1988 Started working for Nintendo.

He has also been left with no support from his own government \u2013 due to a litany of petty bickering, false arguments, missed opportunities and broken assurances through which Labour ministers have raised government irresponsibility almost to an art form. I try to report news, not to comment on it. But watching Will, now 29, and his partner Kelly Doyle on television this morning, full of dignity, with not a shred of bitterness, it was impossible not to feel real anger at how they \u2013 and the dozens of other British citizens injured or killed in overseas terror attacks since 9/11 \u2013 have been abandoned and betrayed. The nub of the issue is straightforward. There is a loophole in Britain&apos;s compensation laws. Britons targeted by terrorism do get compensation from the government \u2013 but not if they fall victim overseas. I know the ostensible arguments against fixing the anomaly. Why don&apos;t the victims have travel insurance? Why should taxpayers foot the bill for their &quot;being in the wrong place at the wrong time&quot;? Why can&apos;t foreign governments pay? And, of course, where will it end \u2013 will government have to stump up if a British tourist gets mugged on the streets of Tokyo or Paris, Buenos Aires or New York? But even travel policies that do not exclude terrorist acts \u2013 and nearly half of them still do \u2013 cover only immediate emergency expenses. They do not provide compensation. As for the old taxpayer wheeze, it is surely worth remembering that victims such as Pike are taxpayers, too. Foreign governments? Some, though by no means all, will compensate foreigners for terrorism that occurs on their own soil. But the scale of payouts, even in cases where they might be available, is paltry compared with the cost to a British citizen of rebuilding his or her life back here at home. Finally, the &quot;wrong place at the wrong time&quot; argument, and the question of why terror should be treated differently from a mugging, a purse-snatching, or even a street murder. Terrorism \u2013 as the MPs and peers and other campaigners who have been pressing for a change in the law have pointed out \u2013 is an assault not on the individual but the state. Mumbai made this explicit. The attackers sought out their victims by passport. They wanted Americans or Britons to kill. If Pike had been Japanese, or South African, or Swedish, he would be walking today. Other major western governments \u2013 from America and Canada to France and Australia \u2013 recognise this, and have put a variety of schemes in place to ensure that their citizens get financial help if they are targeted by terrorists abroad. But here is the clincher. Tony Blair, as early as 2005 on the floor of the House of Commons, recognised the anomaly and said in effect he&apos;d set about fixing it. During his final years in office, he hummed and hawed and did nothing to make good on that assurance. After Mumbai, thankfully, there was new momentum in Gordon Brown&apos;s government to fix the problem. They, too, had been dithering. Even with the co-operation of the insurance industry and the volunteer help of a leading British law firm, Lovells, ministers and officials in effect talked out proposals to put a co-funded scheme in place. The government&apos;s efforts gathered new momentum. A ministerial committee met, with a brief from Downing Street finally to get a resolution of the issue. And they did, early last summer, agree to close the loophole \u2013 but only for future victims. Brown, to his credit, recognised this was absurd. He also knew that politically it risked becoming a repeat of the policy shambles surrounding the Gurkhas. It would have fixed only half the problem, leaving the victims and families in immediate, human need with nothing. So he told ministers to go back to the drawing board. Which they did \u2013 agreeing, finally, to help all the victims. An announcement was even pencilled in for September. At one stage, I was told the only reason it wouldn&apos;t happen the following week was for &quot;diary considerations&quot;. Then, it was put in the Queen&apos;s speech \u2013 and written into the text of the new crime and security bill. Incidentally, despite ministers&apos; having earlier said the cost would be prohibitive, the Treasury calculated the total cost of helping Pike and the others, and the families of those who had been not merely maimed but murdered, at only \u00a33.8m. The yearly bonus of a banker or two. And then \u2026 it didn&apos;t happen. Bob Ainsworth and a clutch of Ministry of Defence officials intervened with Downing Street at the last minute. Ainsworth is understood to have told colleagues he had got wind of news that the Sun newspaper had lined up an interview with a British soldier with a legal claim for similarly retrospective compensation for troops injured in Iraq. If that argument was accepted, they warned Brown, it could end up costing upwards of \u00a3500m, maybe even several billion pounds. So the prime minister U-turned. Let&apos;s set aside the unedifying prospect of government-by-the-Sun. Maybe there is a case for giving soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan in earlier years the same, more generous payments included under the MoD&apos;s recently improved compensation arrangements. As it happens, at least one MoD source has told me that morally and politically that would make sense. But that is a separate issue. Politically, the last-minute intervention was about the MoD serving notice that it expected the Treasury to stump up for the money if necessary. The reality, of course, is that this is more likely to be an issue for George Osborne than for Alistair Darling. And the fact is that soldiers, even soldiers who do not come under current MoD arrangements, have got compensation. Will Pike and the dozens of others like him have got none. And in this latest Whitehall political ballet, they have been abandoned all over again."}, {"sentences": ["Watt said today BrewDog had withdrawn one of its latest products, Tokyo*, because the group had banned it.", "With an alcohol content of 18.2%, Tokyo* was unveiled in July as the UK&apos;s strongest beer.", "The complaint against Tokyo*, from Alcohol Focus Scotland, was not because of its strength \u2013 the code takes no position on alcohol content, he said \u2013 but its allegedly irresponsible marketing."], "tags": ["Alcohol", "Health", "Scotland", "Food & drink", "Food & drink industry", "Society", "UK news", "Business", "Life and style", "Beer"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-26T18:39:24Z", "title": "Scottish brewer claims world's strongest beer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/nov/26/worlds-strongest-beer-scottish-brewdog", "article": "A small Scottish brewery with a taste for controversy has produced what it claims to be the world&apos;s strongest beer, one so alcoholic it is designed to be drunk in whisky-sized nips and comes with its own resealable stopper. The beer, which goes by the name Tactical Nuclear Penguin, has been made by a company called BrewDog in Fraserburgh, north-east Scotland. It has an alcohol content of 32%, roughly eight times the strength of normal beers and lagers, and will be sold at \u00a330 a bottle, or \u00a3250 for an additional share in the company. BrewDog says its beer, an &quot;imperial stout&quot;, is intended for connoisseurs. Only 500 330ml bottles have been produced, and it will only be sold online and at two off-licences in Edinburgh and London. &quot;This is completely pushing the boundaries,&quot; said James Watt, the firm&apos;s co-founder. But the beer&apos;s release immediately heightened the debate about responsible drinking, on the day that the Scottish government confirmed that it wants a legally binding minimum price for alcohol in Scotland to combat rising alcohol abuse and the surge in cut-price drink promotions by supermarkets. To the anger of public health charities, Labour and the Tories said they would oppose the SNP&apos;s proposals, which have been supported by Scotland&apos;s chief medical officer, Dr Harry Burns, and the British Medical Association. Both parties said the proposals were unworkable, penalised the responsible majority and were potentially illegal. Jack Law, chief executive of the campaign group Alcohol Focus Scotland, said BrewDog was guilty of &quot;childlike attention-seeking&quot; by releasing the beer on the day the alcohol bill was published. &quot;The fact they have achieved a new world record is not admirable, that&apos;s for sure,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a product with a lot of alcohol in it, that&apos;s all. To dress it up as anything else is cynical.&quot; Watt said the beer&apos;s scarcity and price made a nonsense of that allegation; it was the major brewers and supermarkets who sold beer at 40p a can who were truly to blame for alcohol abuse. He insisted BrewDog did not realise its launch coincided with the SNP&apos;s alcohol bill. &quot;This is about evolving the status of beer and changing people&apos;s perceptions of it,&quot; he said. &quot;It comes with a small wine stopper; we&apos;re encouraging people to enjoy this in the same way you would enjoy a whisky.&quot; Tactical Nuclear Penguin was named partly, he said, because the beer&apos;s record alcohol content came from freezing it in a local ice cream factory. That separated the water from the alcohol, concentrating the alcohol. It was then matured in former whisky casks for 18 months. The previous record-holder was a German beer, Schorschbraer, with an ABV of 31%, Watt added. According to market research, BrewDog may be hitting the right trend. Drinkers are increasingly buying more expensive, stronger beers and lagers \u2013 apparently because they want to enjoy themselves more in the recession \u2013 and drinking more at home. The market analysts AC Nielsen said bitter sales rose by 7% in value, but only 1% by volume, while drinkers spent 4% more on lager but drank 1% more than last year. The gap between pub and home drinking is also narrowing, with pubs and clubs claiming only 56% of Britain&apos;s alcohol sales. By next year, it said, more beer will be drunk at home. BrewDog describes itself as a &quot;craft brewery&quot; and markets itself on its edgy, maverick reputation. Fans who spend \u00a3250 on the new beer will also help fund a new \u00a32.3m &quot;eco-friendly, carbon neutral brewery in Aberdeen&quot;, it said. Its website boasts that it challenges the &quot;bland&quot; beers made by mainstream brewers: &quot;We are unique and individual. A beacon of nonconformity in an increasingly monotone corporate desert. We are proud to be an intrepid David in a desperate ocean of insipid Goliaths.&quot; But its release threatens to intensify a long-running feud between BrewDog and the Portman Group, the powerful industry-funded body which runs a voluntary but strict code of conduct for manufacturers and retailers on responsible marketing, which dates back to the firm&apos;s origins. BrewDog&apos;s first three beers \u2013 Punk IPA, Riptide and Hop Rocker \u2013 were investigated by the group after research into irresponsible drinks promotions identified the three products as being among 32 which might breach its code of conduct. The beers were eventually cleared but BrewDog retaliated by launching a beer with the provocative title of Speedball, named after the potentially lethal drugs cocktail of heroin and cocaine. Speedball was duly banned by the group. BrewDog relaunched it as Dogma. The Portman Group believes BrewDog has form for hyping controversy, by itself publicising Portman Group investigations and attracting headlines by claiming its products were being banned. In September, it launched a low alcohol brew, Nanny State, with an alcohol content of 1.1%. Watt said today BrewDog had withdrawn one of its latest products, Tokyo*, because the group had banned it. With an alcohol content of 18.2%, Tokyo* was unveiled in July as the UK&apos;s strongest beer. The Portman Group&apos;s chief executive, David Poley, said its investigation was not complete and no such ruling had been made. The complaint against Tokyo*, from Alcohol Focus Scotland, was not because of its strength \u2013 the code takes no position on alcohol content, he said \u2013 but its allegedly irresponsible marketing. The labelling states: &quot;&quot;Everything in moderation, including moderation itself. What logically follows is that you must, from time to time, have excess.&quot; Poley said the group&apos;s complaints panel had not yet issued a ruling, but would do so next month. For now, he said, BrewDog was free to sell Tactical Nuclear Penguin. &quot;We&apos;ve nothing to say about this new product: we&apos;ve had no complaints about it. There is nothing in the code which prohibits products simply because of their strength.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He was elected general secretary at the ITGLWF&apos;s sixth world congress in Tokyo in 1988."], "tags": ["Trade unions", "Labour", "Politics", "Peru", "Bangladesh", "Cambodia", "Americas", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-26T19:02:52Z", "title": "Neil Kearney obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/26/neil-kearney-obituary", "article": "Neil Kearney, who has died of a heart attack aged 59, was an inspirational leader in the international trade union movement. As general secretary of the Brussels-based International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers&apos; Federation (ITGLWF), he had just completed a series of union meetings and visits to supplier factories in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He had been to the country more than 50 times since 1988, in particular working with the Spanish multinational fashion retailer Inditex. Recently they had ensured that workers and families whose lives were devastated by the collapse of the Spectrum factory in Savar, north-west of\u00a0Dhaka, in 2005, in\u00a0which 64 were killed and many injured, received adequate compensation and medical assistance. His work with Inditex led to the first international framework agreement on employment standards which focused solely on the protection of workers&apos; rights in the supply chain of a\u00a0multinational in the textile and garment sector. His interventions with\u00a0Inditex in factories in Peru, Turkey,\u00a0Bangladesh and Cambodia led\u00a0to the reinstatement of hundreds of workers who had been sacked for\u00a0joining a trade union; the introduction of proper systems of industrial relations; and, in\u00a0Cambodia, the removal of short-term contracts of employment in favour of\u00a0open-ended ones. Neil visited more than 140 countries worldwide, and was tireless and passionate in his defence of those workers who continued to fall prey to the worst excesses of the international outsourcing of garment and footwear production to sweatshops. Born in Donegal, Ireland, Neil moved to the UK at the age of 17 and took a\u00a0job in banking, joining the union on his first day at work. In 1972 he joined the then National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers, where he served as head of the information and research department for 16 years. He was active in politics during that period, running for parliament twice in 1974. Four years later, he was successfully elected as a Labour councillor in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where he became leader of the opposition. A\u00a0lifelong socialist, he remained a\u00a0member of the Labour party until he resigned over the Iraq war. He was elected general secretary at the ITGLWF&apos;s sixth world congress in Tokyo in 1988. In a 21-year period of office, he had to contend with a massive upheaval in the sector, which led to wholesale migration of manufacture from the developed to the developing world. This had a great impact on the financial basis of the organisation, which had relied on affiliation fees from its member unions. To mobilise resources to help workers in developing countries, Neil successfully accessed international public funding to mount a series of projects. The elimination of child labour and the improvement of health and safety were prime objectives. Neil was a founding member of Social Accountability International&apos;s advisory board and, in this capacity, used his knowledge of International Labour Organisation conventions to develop the SA 8000 ethical standard, an industry benchmark on worker rights for supplier factories. He also joined the board of the UK&apos;s Ethical Trading Initiative, where he convinced member companies of\u00a0the need to replace social audits with proper systems of industrial relations in\u00a0supplier factories abroad. As the industry underwent major restructuring after the removal of quantitative limits on clothing imports in 2004, he was a prime mover in the establishment of the MFA Forum (set up as the international Multi-Fiber Agreement came to an end). It aims to improve the sustainability of national garment industries such as those in Morocco and Lesotho, which risk losing jobs as production switched to cheaper locations. He was instrumental in persuading Nike to disclose publicly its\u00a0supply chain in 2005, and a number of other companies soon followed suit. Neil seemed to thrive on his punishing travel schedules.

There was anger \u2013 and worldwide astonishment \u2013 when Denis Sassou-Nguesso, president of Congo-Brazzaville, published a book containing a foreword attributed to Mandela on its front cover. The foreword praised Sassou-Nguesso as &quot;one of our great African leaders&quot;. The Johannesburg-based foundation was quick to condemn the &quot;brazen abuse&quot; of 91-year-old Mandela&apos;s name and give a strong hint of litigation. Verne Harris, its acting chief executive, said: &quot;Mr Mandela has neither read the book nor written a foreword for it ... we will be taking appropriate action.&quot; Strictly speaking, Harris was correct. Mandela had indeed neither read the book nor written a foreword. Sassou-Nguesso was widely mocked for outrageous chutzpah in trying to sell books. But the case was not so simple. The South African government confirmed today that the words used in the foreword were Mandela&apos;s. They were delivered by him in a speech in 1996, according to a statement from Sassou-Nguesso&apos;s office. Tokyo Sexwale, a South African government minister who was reportedly a middle-man in granting permission for the use of the words \u2013 though not as a foreword \u2013 flew to Congo-Brazzaville this week to placate Sassou-Nguesso, who was smarting at the charge of dishonesty. Sexwale, a member of the Mandela foundation board, said: &quot;I came here to give him a message from Nelson Mandela, who regards him as a brother and a true friend.&quot; He continued: &quot;The message I want to state is the following \u2013 and it must be absolutely clear \u2013 the book of President Sassou is a great book, and the quotations of Mr Mandela in that book are supported by Mr Mandela himself. The publishers just made a small mistake of saying the word &apos;foreword&apos; but the quotation stands for itself. President Sassou-Nguesso is a leader in Africa \u2013 the words that had been put by Mandela in that book are correct.&quot; Sexwale said he did not wish to dwell on the misuse of Mandela&apos;s speech in Sassou-Nguesso&apos;s Straight Speaking for Africa. &quot;For us it is not an issue,&quot; he said. &quot;It is just a mistake.&quot; Mandela had written a personal letter to Sassou-Nguesso &quot;clarifying the situation&quot; and standing by the favourable words he spoke about him 13 years ago."}, {"sentences": ["Kisses from Paris, directed by Yvan Attal, features a young couple canoodling at the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes, the Saint-Ouen flea market and the Palais de Tokyo, and is two-parts cringey, three-parts brilliant."], "tags": ["Travel", "Flights", "Alps holidays", "Skiing holidays", "Switzerland holidays", "Green travel", "London holidays", "Oxford holidays", "Paris holidays", "Romantic trips", "Air transport", "Travel & leisure"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-29T00:05:17Z", "title": "Travel news in brief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/nov/29/oxford-sign-paris-istanbul-awards", "article": "Oxford to the Alps A new route to the slopes launches this winter, linking Geneva with the recently re-branded &quot;London Oxford&quot; airport, north of Kidlington.

While most of us can still nostalgically whistle Bolero, British skating has quietly been getting on with things. The result? The biggest squad to grace the Winter Olympics in years will be travelling to Vancouver next February with seven figure skaters \u2013 compared with two in recent years \u2013 in a squad of 14 representing Britain at the Games. The cherry on the cake is the Scottish brother and sister ice dance couple, John and Sinead Kerr, who have a realistic chance of winning Britain&apos;s first Olympic skating medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean made their comeback 10 years after gold in Sarajevo and took bronze in 1994. After finishing 10th at the last Olympic Games in Turin, the couple have made great progress. Last night they won the British Championship in Sheffield and tomorrow they fly to Japan \u2013 a country in which they have such a fanatical following that John says &quot;there must be some bizarre shop in Tokyo selling St Andrew&apos;s flags&quot; \u2013 to compete in the Grand Prix final. They are the first Britons to do so after qualifying as the fifth best pair in the world this year. That achievement could make a big difference to their Olympic hopes in a sport where perception is everything. &quot;It&apos;s important in this Olympic season that we&apos;ve got ourselves in this top-five bracket,&quot; Sinead says. &quot;Getting there has shown the judges we&apos;re seriously in the mix. Any time you put yourselves in the world&apos;s top five you give yourself a chance of a medal.&quot; An injection of funds from UK Sport \u2013 around \u00a345,000 per year \u2013 following their Turin performance changed the Kerrs&apos; horizons, allowing them to train full time in the US, coached by Evgeny Platov, coincidentally one half of the Russian partnership that beat Torvill and Dean to Olympic gold in 1994. Conscious of their age \u2013 John is 29, Sinead is 31 \u2013 they would love to add an Olympic medal to their haul before retiring. &quot;In the last year we have changed peoples&apos; perceptions,&quot; says Sinead, referring to the bronze the couple won at the European championships in January. &quot;Before we&apos;d been thought of as audience favourites but maybe not so good technically. But last year we made big progress in the technical part of our skating \u2013 we really improved, which is a difficult thing at our age. Now we&apos;re not just the entertaining couple, people see we can skate really good, too.&quot; Torvill, now known for her role in the ITV show Dancing on Ice, believes success for the pair could reignite the sport. &quot;There was always a hope that there would be someone to follow in our footsteps,&quot; she says. &quot;There was John Curry and Robin Cousins and then ourselves, and I think everyone always expected there would be another Olympic champion. &quot;In a way it feels sad that that hasn&apos;t\u00a0happened, it would have been nice if a couple or someone in another category kept the flag flying for British skating but possibly it&apos;s coming round again. I\u00a0hope so.&quot; Torvill&apos;s own path since retirement has played its part in promoting skating. The former Olympic champion says Dancing on Ice was never intended as a strategy for re-popularising the sport but it has worked out that way. Daniel Thomas, who coaches the promising teenagers Catherine Clement and James Hunt, describes queues going out of the door at their Chelmsford rink. &quot;They literally run out of skates when that show is on,&quot; he says. &quot;We struggle for room on the ice.&quot; That is music to the ears of Keith Horton, chief executive of the National Ice Skating Association and the man who has taken ice skating forward during his eight-year tenure. When Horton first arrived Nisa were practically bankrupt. &quot;I was originally recruited just to make Nisa fit for purpose but I ended up staying eight years,&quot; he said at the British championships in Sheffield.In 2005 Horton brought in licensing for coaches \u2013 reviewed on an annual basis with fees to be paid to Nisa \u2013 to raise standards in the UK. The changes were unpopular with coaches who had been used to making good money without interference or charges from the governing body, but Horton rode out the wave of complaints and says the results of his policies have been visible at the British championships. &quot;It&apos;s exciting, we have a depth of talent. Even at novice level, the quality of skating we&apos;ve seen this week has been unparalleled. I think the investments we have made are finally coming through.&quot; The biggest challenge facing the sport \u2013 at all levels \u2013 is a financial one. Basic skating lessons cost around \u00a37 for 15 minutes and talented juniors can spend around \u00a3150 a week on coaching, plus additional costs of skates, costumes, medical fees and travel. The only skaters to have received funding from UK Sport in the last Olympic cycle were the Kerrs; all the rest have had to be supported by their family. There are some council grants available for basic funding, and some rinks sponsor ice time for talented skaters, but for such an expensive sport cash is in short supply. Laura Freeman is a talented 16-year-old who dreams of becoming British champion in the next few years and is a case in point. She is supported by her mother, Julie, a single parent who works two jobs, seven days a week \u2013 at Tesco and as a childminder \u2013 to fund her daughter&apos;s progress. It is a herculean effort, for which there is no financial aid. As a result Laura&apos;s coach, Jenny Woolford, is desperately seeking sponsorship on her skater&apos;s behalf. Horton&apos;s dream is to secure funds to create a centre of excellence in Sheffield. He wants to recruit a renowned foreign coach, who can share his experiences with British coaches, and base skaters in Sheffield at a cost of around half a million pounds a year. &quot;I don&apos;t want just one couple achieving, I want to build a stable of skaters,&quot; he says. &quot;We need the centre, because we need our skaters all in one place, pushing each other. &quot;When John and Sinead went to train in Italy in 2005 it was the best thing they ever did; it gave them competition. It was the same with Torvill and Dean, they went abroad and trained, so did John Curry and Robin Cousins. We didn&apos;t have the set-up here to produce champions even then. That&apos;s what I would like to change.&quot; If the Kerrs do the business in Vancouver, their success may just help Horton&apos;s plan become a reality in the future."}, {"sentences": ["Motoman is one of hundreds of cutting-edge robots exhibited during the past week at the industry&apos;s biennial showcase in Tokyo.", "But \u2013 judging by the machines on display in Tokyo \u2013 the precarious state of the economy and Japan&apos;s ageing population have led to a new emphasis on their commercial and practical uses.", "Tokyo University&apos;s robotic wheelchair uses sensor pads that allow users to control their movements by shifting their bodyweight, while NSK&apos;s mobile &quot;human assist&quot; robot leads its owner past obstacles \u2013 a hi-tech guide dog on wheels.", "One of the most anticipated exhibits was the new, improved muscle suit from Tokyo University of Science \u2013 due to go into commercial production next year, which enables its wearer to perform strenuous lifting work and has obvious uses among the elderly and infirm."], "tags": ["Global economy", "Robots", "Technology", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-29T17:08:24Z", "title": "Army of humanoid robots takes Tokyo by storm", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/29/japan-robot-showcase", "article": "In an age when multi-skilling is at a premium, Motoman may prove to be the model employee. When he&apos;s not spot-welding on a car production line, he&apos;s flipping pancakes \u2013 with not a drop of spilled batter in sight \u2013 and can even be called on to perform routine blood tests. Motoman is one of hundreds of cutting-edge robots exhibited during the past week at the industry&apos;s biennial showcase in Tokyo. The robot industry in Japan was worth 522bn yen (\u00a33.65bn) last year, a figure that manufacturers hope will reach \u00a5900bn by 2016. Japan&apos;s recent contributions to the robot population owed much to the wacky and whimsical: interactive pets and humanoids that dance, teach and act as unfailingly polite office receptionists. But \u2013 judging by the machines on display in Tokyo \u2013 the precarious state of the economy and Japan&apos;s ageing population have led to a new emphasis on their commercial and practical uses. Robots may one day be our friends, but for now they are in more urgent demand as hired hands, performing the dirty, difficult and dangerous work humans cannot or will not do: packing, lifting, welding, bricklaying and sifting through the aftermath of natural disasters. That does not mean there is any lack of jaw-dropping innovation in the latest generation of industrial robots. Yaskawa, a leading robot maker, believes its Motoman range will banish humans from the shop floor. &quot;This year there is definitely an emphasis on robots with commercial uses,&quot; says Tohru Akama, a Yaskawa engineer. &quot;We were asked to develop robots that can perform tasks they weren&apos;t previously able to do at high speed, such as palleting and packing.&quot; Amid nagging fears that robots will one day turn nasty on their creators \u2013 or at the very least prove incompatible as colleagues \u2013 hopes are high that research platforms such as Hiro, a humanoid from Kawada Industries, will prove that we can coexist. &quot;At the moment it would be best suited to production lines,&quot; expert Maksim Radev says of this robot. Hiro can recognise colours and shapes, lift and manipulate objects with its ultra-dexterous mechanical arms and hands, and obey simple verbal commands. &quot;But Hiro can also recognise people&apos;s faces and match them to voices, so it would work well alongside humans.&quot; No industry show these days is complete without a nod to the environment. Here it came in the form of D+ropop, a curvaceous android crafted out of corrugated cardboard \u2013 and whose upper limbs and head are powered by eight lightweight motors. It&apos;s unlikely that D+ropop will be doing any heavy lifting, but &quot;she&quot; is expected to be in demand as a hi-tech mannequin or an advertising gimmick for firms keen to boost their green credentials. Industrial automation aside, Japan&apos;s ageing society and low birthrate have created a potentially huge market in helper and companion robots. Tokyo University&apos;s robotic wheelchair uses sensor pads that allow users to control their movements by shifting their bodyweight, while NSK&apos;s mobile &quot;human assist&quot; robot leads its owner past obstacles \u2013 a hi-tech guide dog on wheels. One of the most anticipated exhibits was the new, improved muscle suit from Tokyo University of Science \u2013 due to go into commercial production next year, which enables its wearer to perform strenuous lifting work and has obvious uses among the elderly and infirm. Other new-generation robots demonstrated levels of dexterity and subtlety unimaginable just a few years ago \u2013 enough, for example, to build Lego models, grip slices of cake without crushing them or transmit live video images as they slither through the rubble of an earthquake. Not all of the latest creations are quite as earnest. Sideshow frolics were provided by Topio, a silver humanoid who plays table tennis, while the diminutive Manoi Go \u2013 yours for \u00a31,000 \u2013 bolstered its reputation as the next cyber-star by showing off its breakdancing skills."}, {"sentences": ["The Japanese prime minister has also just been talking about the situation - telling reporters in Tokyo that he &quot;remains cautious over Dubai credit worries&quot;."], "tags": ["Banking", "Financial crisis", "Dubai World", "Stock markets", "Credit crunch", "Eurozone crisis", "Business", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Dubai"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-30T07:16:59Z", "title": "Dubai shares plummet as crisis continues", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/30/dubai-financial-crisis", "article": " 6.00am: Five days ago, the Gulf state of Dubai sparked alarm around the world. The news that state-owned company Dubai World wanted a six-month break from its debt repayments raised the spectre of a meltdown in the luxury playground of the wealthy, possibly leading to a panic that derailed the global economic recovery. Today, many investors in the Middle East will get their first opportunity to respond to the crisis - as trading has been suspended since the middle of last week for the Eid al-Adha holiday. We&apos;re also expecting more details from the UAE about exactly what financial support they will give Dubai. Over the weekend, the UAE central bank promised a special liquidity scheme to honour some debts, but on a case-by-case basis.  6.50am: As feared, shares have fallen sharply. The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange Index dropped by 215 points in the first few minutes of trading, down from Wednesday&apos;s close of 2910 points to around 2695. Dubai&apos;s own stock market is down by nearly 6%. And shares in Dubai World have plunged by 15%.  7.23am: Another important development this morning is that Nakheel, creator of those artificial islands that are shaped like palms, has asked the Dubai authorities to halt trading in three of its bonds, worth a total of $5.25bn. Nakheel asked for the suspension &quot;until it is in a position to fully inform the market&quot; about its restructuring plans.     Photograph: PA    These debts include Nakheel&apos;s $3.5bn (\u00a32.1bn) sukuk bond which was due for repayment on December 14. The crisis began last week when Nakheel sought a six-month delay on paying this off. Some of the foreign investors who hold a stake in this bond have been urgently seeking legal representation, amid fears that Nakheel might persuade local investors to allow it to default on the debt.  7.56am: One reason for Middle East investors to be jittery today is that the markets will be closed again from Wednesday morning until next week. The sell-off has gathered a bit of pace since trading began - with the main Abu Dhabi index now down 8.24% at 2670, a drop of 239 points. It is not allowed to fall by more than 10% in one day, so regulators could step in and halt trading if the slide continues. The National Bank of Abu Dhabi is down 9.7%. In Dubai, its main share index is 7.19% lower at 1942 points.  These falls come despite efforts by business leaders to calm the situation. Riad Kamal, chief executive of construction firm Arabtec, has said he is confident that Dubai will not default on its debts. &quot;Dubai should be given time to restructure its debt. I&apos;m not going to lose sleep over this issue,&quot; Kamal told Reuters.  8.18am: You know it&apos;s a proper crisis when the International Monetary Fund get involved. No suggestion yet that the IMF might have to ride in with a bailout, but a spokesman confirmed last night that it is watching the Dubai crisis closely:  We are continuing to monitor the situation following the unexpected announcement by the government of Dubai regarding a standstill on the debt of Dubai World and its Nakheel subsidiary, which has had an adverse impact on financial markets.   The United Arab Emirates is a strong resource-based economy and we welcome the announcement by the Central Bank of the UAE making available to banks a special additional liquidity facility. We look forward to further clarification by the authorities towards a cooperative mechanism to address the issues between these debtors and their creditors.  The IMF&apos;s statement underlines how much pressure is on the UAE to rescue Dubai. Yesterday&apos;s launch of the special liquidity scheme could help.... ....however, although the emirates&apos; central bank pledged more money for local and foreign banks in Dubai, it did not commit to backing all the debt of Dubai or Dubai World. Some analysts have warned that such &apos;imprecise promises&apos; might not reassure the markets.  8.30am: The share falls seen in Abu Dhabi and Dubai have not been mirrored around the world. In fact, many stock markets have seen pretty decent rallies today. Japan&apos;s Nikkei closed nearly 3% higher, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng index gaining 3.25%. The Japanese prime minister has also just been talking about the situation - telling reporters in Tokyo that he &quot;remains cautious over Dubai credit worries&quot;. In London, the FTSE 100 is down almost 30 points at 5215 (a 0.5% fall) Worth remembering that we enjoyed a healthy rally on Friday afternoon despite the Dubai crisis. Other major European markets have slid by a similar percentage. Another sign that the world market are feeling more optimistic is that the US dollar has lost ground against many other currencies, which has helped to push the oil price up. Despite the state of the US economy, investors still seek the safety of the greenback at times of crisis.  8.55am: It would be a mistake to think that the turmoil seen on the Abu Dhabi and Dubai trading floors will not spread, though. Egypt has been dragged into the sell-off this morning; the index of its 30 biggest shares has just dropped by 6.8%.     The Burj Dubai. Photograph: Nousha Salimi/ AP    Leading the slump is Orascom Construction - the largest publicly quoted company in Egypt - which has taken an 11% tumble. It is closely involved in the project to build the Burj Dubai, the world&apos;s tallest skyscraper - and seen by some as a symbol of the hubris that brought Dubai to its current predicament.  9.33am: The confusion over the precise details of the Abu Dhabi bailout appear to be pulling bank shares down this morning. Royal Bank of Scotland is down over 4% at 33p [helping to pull the FTSE 100 down by 40 points to 5204]. We learned last Friday that RBS has organised more loans to Dubai World than any other bank. It&apos;s not clear how much of that debt remains on RBS&apos;s books. We do know that HSBC is the bank most exposed to Dubai, with $17bn of loans; Standard Chartered also has major commitments in the area. Over in the UAE, the main Abu Dhabi share index has not clawed back any ground - it is currently 8.3% lower.  10.12am: There&apos;s quite a lot of anger over in Dubai over the way the crisis has been portrayed. Newsagents across the UAE were reportedly banned from selling The Sunday Times, and there have been murmurings about laws which mean anyone convicted of criticising the Dubai government or royal family could be jailed. So should the software developers behind a new computer game called Mystery World be worried? A trailer for the first player shoot-em-up has appeared online, in which the lead character stalks a deserted desert city in which cars are abandoned, bodies hang from lampposts, and offices are attacked.     Still from teaser trailer for Spike TV's Video Game Awards 2009    According to the Daily Telegraph, a Dubai government spokesman has said that the game will &apos;date quickly&apos; ...  10.20am: The Abu Dhabi and Dubai stock markets have just closed for the day after a gritty four-hour trading session, and the results are not pretty. The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (its main market), has tumbled 8.3% - its biggest one-day fall ever. It lost 241.92 points to 2668.23. In Dubai, its main index fell by 7.3% - which is its biggest fall since 8th October 2008 when the banking crisis was at its height. Dubai World ended down nearly 15%. With the FTSE 100 now down by 50 points at 5195, there is growing concern that we have not heard more from the Abu Dhabi central bank about its rescue plan ...  10.40am: Despite the crisis, though, the ruler of Dubai has no intention of compromising when it comes to the serious business of horse-racing. A spokesman for Sheikh Mohammed has told the Evening Standard that he still plans to buy some quality bloodstock at December&apos;s Tattersalls Mares Sale at Newmarket. This is the climax to the European sales season, and will give the sheikh the opportunity to keep pumping money into Britain&apos;s racing industry. He is one of the best things to have happened to British racing since the invention of the horseshoe. But there are fears in the industry that he may have to cut back, should Dubai end up defaulting on its debts.  11.04am: With the markets in Abu Dhabi and Dubai now closed, the key issue is the rescue package promised yesterday. The UAE central bank really needs to heed that warning from the IMF and announce some details quickly. We&apos;ll let you know as soon as there are any developments. Until then, thanks for reading and for the comments."}, {"sentences": ["The report said the capital was &quot;far more dependent&quot; on government funding than cities such as New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "London politics", "Conservatives", "Politics", "London", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-11-30T11:53:35Z", "title": "Boris Johnson wants US-style funding for London projects", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/30/boris-johnson-london-funding", "article": "Boris Johnson today called on the government to allow London to adopt a US-style scheme to raise money for projects, increasing his financial independence from the government. In a report published today, the Conservative London mayor and Merrick Cockell, the Tory leader of the umbrella group for London councils, included the idea of tax increment financing (Tif) to help fund projects in the capital during the economic downturn. The document, Investing for Recovery, highlighted London&apos;s special needs as &quot;the engine room of the UK economy&quot; with the biggest gap between rich and poor. Its publication comes as Johnson seeks to ward off the threat of budget cuts ahead of Alistair Darling&apos;s pre-budget report next week. The mayor, who also faces the threat of cuts under a future Conservative government, said the capital required cash from the state and &quot;something that won&apos;t cost a penny ... a bit more financial freedom&quot;. Tif, which relies on future tax revenue to fund schemes, has been widely used for redevelopment and community improvement projects in the US as an alternative to state investment, and Johnson said it would allow London to bring in more private investment. The report said the capital was &quot;far more dependent&quot; on government funding than cities such as New York and Tokyo. Johnson, who is in advanced talks with Conservative central office over a beefed-up mayoral role, said Tif was the &quot;beautiful idea&quot; he had in mind to give him more financial freedom. It is a potential model for the devolved London government and London boroughs if central government considers centrally collected taxes for local purposes, the report said. &quot;This is not about raising new taxes or having new tax-raising powers, but about earmarking future tax income raised in a local area to finance local regeneration,&quot; the report said. &quot;This would enable boroughs to boost economic development by investing upfront in enabling infrastructure. &quot;The freedom and responsibility to generate and manage local revenue streams will provide a significant incentive to investment, leveraging private sector funding. &quot;Tif would be a timely and proportionate response to the impact of the recession. The payback would be substantial. &quot;Introducing Tif would ensure that London can lead the way out of recession by generating and sharing in the &apos;growth dividend&apos;.&quot; The report also called for a fairer funding model that takes into consideration London&apos;s high turnover of population, the resulting strains on public services and the capital&apos;s &quot;intractable social problems&quot;, which include poverty and insufficient housing. Johnson, concerned that a Tory government could pull the plug on the long-awaited Crossrail project, said it was critical that this investment was kept alongside funding for improvements to the London Underground."}, {"sentences": ["Forgoing Tokyo, spurning New York, the reunion always seemed more about four old friends playing songs than an attempt at cashing in."], "tags": ["Blur", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Documentary"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-01T11:12:24Z", "title": "Blur to release reunion documentary in 2010", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/01/blur-to-release-reunion-documentary", "article": "     A new film chronicling Blur&apos;s 2009 reunion will appear in UK cinemas in January.

As onlookers clap their support, he abandons the flowers he&apos;s selling, tossing them towards his audience. When he bows, cars zooming past him, it&apos;s possible to make out the single word (written in katakana script) on the Band-Aid plastered to his head: Beyonc\u00e9.      The 'Beyonce hobo'. Photograph: Chris Michael    In many ways, the Beyonc\u00e9 hobo embodies the weird melding of pop culture, absurdity and vague disreputability that makes Akihabara \u2013 or Akiba, as it&apos;s known \u2013 such an appealing place to explore. This is where you come in Tokyo if you want to dress as a cartoon character without strangers muttering disapproval. And it used to be where you came to see your favourite idol \u2013 the young singers who&apos;d perform in Akihabara for free, hoping for a big break. But no longer. Last year, one particularly attention-starved aspirant climbed a lamppost, hitched up her dress and flashed her fans, then led them about like the Pied Piper. Soon afterwards, street performances were banned. &quot;Yeah, the cops got Asuka for disturbing the peace and indecent exposure,&quot; says my guide Patrick Galbraith, shaking his head and causing his spiky yellow wig to flop about. Galbraith is a PhD candidate in information studies specialising in otaku (&quot;geek&quot;) culture at Sophia University in Tokyo. He gives tours of Akiba dressed in an orange bodysuit and prickly yellow hairpiece \u2013 the outfit of Goku, protagonist of the Dragon Ball anime series. After Asuka&apos;s sordid adventure, and the far more troubling massacre that occurred in June last year, Galbraith wants to help dispel Akiba&apos;s reputation as a den of perversion and iniquity.     Patrick Galbraith dressed as a Japanese cartoon character gives a tour of Tokyo's Akihabara geek district Photograph: Chris Michael    We head for Electric Town, home of the modern big-box electronics shops, where saleswomen in miniskirts harangue passersby through megaphones. Here, Galbraith stops to demonstrate the emotional heart of otaku-ness. As pedestrians giggle, he squats, palms flat out, and adopts a scream/yell expression. This is Goku channelling his giant fireball, he explains, adding that it is precisely this kind of exaggerated intensity that drives Akiba&apos;s otaku culture. There&apos;s even a name for it: &quot;moe&quot; (pronounced mo-ay). &quot;Moe is a way to capture emotion you can&apos;t verbalise,&quot; he says. &quot;Don&apos;t know what else to say? Moe! It&apos;s like a second form of love.&quot; Moe takes many forms. In the Radio Kaikan building, a shop called Volks sells photorealistic dolls for \u00a3450 to collectors who then marry them to each other and buy them accessories. Nearby is Akiba&apos;s rental showcase. It&apos;s like a museum, but one where anyone can hire a small display case to show off their collection of rare toys, baseball cards, plastic tank octopuses \u2013 whatever they feel particular moe for.     Young girls in maids costumes on street advertising Maids cafe in Akihabara Tokyo Photograph: Iain Masterton/Alamy    Perhaps the best place to experience moe first-hand is at the @Home Cafe \u2013 one of a growing number of &quot;maid&quot; cafes, where waitresses enact a role-playing game with the customer as &quot;master&quot;. We take our seats and our maid, Minami, appears in a jangle of hearts, pearls and rhinestone. She scribbles my name in ketchup on my omu-raisu (omelette rice), then we have a rousing game of robot boxing which she clearly loses on purpose.  Later, all the maids go up on stage together to giddily belt out some J-pop songs. One man starts making strange gestures, as if pushing a beach ball forward. &quot;Moe,&quot; Galbraith murmers. &quot;He&apos;s sending love, reflecting it back, showing them their talents are appreciated.&quot; This is a version of otagei, stylised dance moves with names such as Romance and Matrix, all designed to transmit moe to the performer. The undisputed juggernaut of idol pop groups can be found on the top floor of the Don Quijote department store, where a band called AKB48 give a new meaning to the term &quot;girl group&quot;. The median age of the 48 members is 16; the youngest is just 12. It&apos;s no insult to say the girls have minimal talent \u2013 in fact, this is part of the point. Their bad singing and dancing endear them to the fans, who grow more attached every time one girl turns left when the other 47 turn right. Plaques on the wall honour fans who have attended an AKB48 show at least 100 times.     Exterior of large shop selling manga comics. Photograph: Iain Masterton/Alamy    Back on Chuo street, Akiba&apos;s artery, it&apos;s hard to imagine that samurai once paraded here on their way to present gifts to the Shogun. For 35 years, it was closed to car traffic every Sunday to leave the way clear for street performances. Now the police cruise along the back roads in patrol cars, stopping and searching people in costumes.  The authorities would clearly prefer Akihabara to conform to the squeaky-clean image promoted by former prime minister Taro Aso, a manga fan who helped pump billions of yen into the district (and paved the way for Starbucks and other chains) hoping that pop culture would save Japan&apos;s floundering economy. The embodiment of this hope is the shiny new UDX building, which hosts Digital Hollywood University and events such as Japan Anime Collaboration Market.  &quot;And yet,&quot; says Galbraith, &quot;the animation popular in Akihabara is made by and for otaku, who Japanese don&apos;t like. In this sense, there&apos;s a conflict of interest \u2013 a schizo policy of wanting to promote anime culture through Akihabara without actually having to deal with otaku who hang out here.&quot; To this way of thinking, the Beyonc\u00e9 hobo is doubly embarrassing: a decidedly non-corporate pop entertainer and, moreover, a homeless man in a nation where there aren&apos;t supposed to be any. To me, and to many others, he&apos;s a reminder that the seamy, silly side of otaku Akiba is something worth preserving. \u2022 The Akihabara Pop Culture Experience tour runs most Sundays from 1:30-4pm and costs \u00a55,800 (\u00a339).

Spending by manufacturers fell by 40.7% from a year earlier, the finance ministry said, the steepest drop since the third quarter of 2002. Capital spending by all Japanese companies fell 24.8% in the three months to September from a year earlier. The fall was faster than in the previous quarter, despite government attempts to stimulate spending. The news comes soon after the Bank of Japan agreed to inject trillions of yen into the financial markets in an attempt to prevent the world&apos;s second-biggest economy from slipping back into recession. Recovery is being hampered by falling prices, weak demand and the strength of the yen, which eats into exporters&apos; earnings. Analysts said the poor data meant that Japan would almost certainly have to revise downwards its third-quarter GDP results, due to be released next week. Predictions of a prolonged period of deflation and currency turmoil have led to a rare public disagreement between the government and the Bank of Japan. In a surprise move this week, the central bank said it would provide \u00a510tn (\u00a368bn) in emergency loans for the financial markets in a return to a watered-down form of quantitative easing. It had come under pressure to intervene amid deflationary fears and the rise of the yen, which reached a 14-year high against the dollar last week. The bank said it recognised that it was &quot;a critical challenge for Japan&apos;s economy to overcome deflation and return to a sustainable growth path with price stability&quot;, adding that it would offer the money at 0.1% interest over three months and accept government and corporate bonds as collateral. But Masaaki Shirakawa, the bank&apos;s governor, played down talk of a rift with the government: &quot;It was not government pressure that led to the latest decision. The BoJ has a heavy responsibility and it wanted to carry out its responsibility. We took this step because of concerns over recent developments in the global financial situation, as well as unstable currency movements that may have a negative impact on the economy.&quot; Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said: &quot;The BoJ deserves praise for its actions. I am delighted the government and the BoJ were able to share the same perception.&quot; But some analysts were unconvinced by the show of unity. Christian Carrillo, senior rates strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Securities in Tokyo, described the central bank&apos;s new funding measures as &quot;weak&quot;, adding: &quot;What is the purpose of this? The purpose is doing as little as possible, because they don&apos;t really want to help the government.&quot; Shizuka Kamei, the banking minister, was scathing about the BoJ&apos;s response. &quot;[It] was sleeping,&quot; he said. &quot;It woke up a little bit [but] is still sleepy-headed.&quot; The government, which recently admitted deflation had returned for the first time in six years, has offered a more pessimistic prognosis than the BoJ of the damage that sustained price falls could inflict on the economy. The bank said that, while the economy was improving, &quot;there is not yet sufficient momentum to support self-sustaining recovery in business fixed investment and private consumption&quot;. It also warned of the continued threat posed by turmoil in the currency markets. Analysts predicted investors would respond negatively to the bank&apos;s failure to return to fully fledged quantitative easing \u2013 flooding the banks with cash to boost lending \u2013 or to increase its purchases of government bonds. Hirokata Kusaba, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said: &quot;Banks already have access to cheap money, so the additional funds are unlikely to flow to the private sector. There will hardly be an impact on the real economy. The situation now is that even with money so cheap, companies are not investing and consumers are not spending.&quot; The BoJ flooded the economy with cash between 2001 and 2006 in an attempt to fight deflation. Shirakawa described this week&apos;s moves as a return to &quot;quantitative easing in the broad sense, [in] that we are trying to ensure banks are not faced with liquidity constraints&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Another former prisoner, Tokyo Sexwale, is a member of the Fifa fair play committee and an organising committee board member."], "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Fifa", "Sepp Blatter", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-03T20:13:20Z", "title": "Former Robben Island inmates highlight role of football in prison life", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/03/robben-island-world-cup-fifa", "article": "The Fifa official takes 66-year-old Lizo Sitoto by the arm, interrupting his story about how football helped &quot;save the lives&quot; of those imprisoned on Robben Island during the apartheid era and hurries him back to the area where the press is congregating to hear the words of Sepp Blatter. &quot;We can&apos;t let the press be late for our president,&quot; she says, illustrating the curious inversion of priorities the Fifa invasion of Cape Town for the World Cup draw has had on the city. In the event, the Fifa executive committee meeting that had symbolically decamped for the day to the island on which Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years overran and Blatter appeared more than an hour later. But Sitoto and the other former political prisoners who work giving guided tours of the island prison are full of optimism \u2013 and not a little wonder that the new Green Point stadium rising out of the mainland they could once see but never visit will next July host a World Cup semi-final. For him there are none of the mixed feelings evident among some of his countrymen, whose enthusiasm about the arrival of the tournament on African soil for the first time is tempered by the indifferent form of the home team, concerns over its legacy and debate over whether enough locals will be able to afford tickets. &quot;It&apos;s a dream come true. We fought for freedom so our country can get events like this,&quot; Sitoto said. &quot;I wish all the prisoners who stayed on Robben Island could witness this, rejoicing. Football saved my life. A person locked up and doing nothing cannot think. When soccer was there it gave us something to talk up about. That&apos;s why it&apos;s more than just a game,&quot; Sitoto said slowly, shielding his eyes from the notoriously harsh glare of the sun on the exposed rock that was his home for 15 years from 1963, when he was convicted of a range of offences against the apartheid state&apos;s regime. When he was allowed to tell it, Sitoto&apos;s tale of Makana FA \u2013 the association formed by the prisoners with its own rule book, qualified referees, disciplinary committee and leagues \u2013 put the week&apos;s debates over seeding formulas, video technology and extra referees firmly into perspective. Sitoto was a goalkeeper for Manong FC, one of nine clubs who each ran three teams from a squad of around 50. Little known until it was made into a film, More Than Just a Game, two years ago, the story of the prisoners who fought to have access to a sport that gave them hope remains inspirational no matter how many times it is told. The league ran in various forms from 1966 until the prison was closed in 1991. Playing first with makeshift rags and then with proper balls and in boots, some converted from women&apos;s footwear by prisoners who became skilled in the art of removing the heels and adding soles made of rubber tyres as studs, the matches were played according to Fifa rules on a dusty pitch. After being released in 1978, Sitoto spent 13 years in exile in Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sweden before returning to South Africa in 1991. Another former prisoner, Tokyo Sexwale, is a member of the Fifa fair play committee and an organising committee board member. &quot;This place represents the triumph of the human spirit,&quot; Sexwale said. &quot;What kept us together here? Loneliness from home, from our children, from our wives, fathers and mothers. We came here young, with our feet and eager to play sport. We were not allowed to play any indoor or outdoor games but in the end the spirit of survival prevailed. It was once illegal to have a football in this prison. And this morning I arrived with Sepp Blatter and members of the Fifa executive.&quot; Blatter was in his element. Having made it his personal mission to bring the World Cup to the continent for the first time, he is basking in the achievement. &quot;Football is the universal game,&quot; the Fifa president said. &quot;My first visit to South Africa goes back to 1992, when the new football association was formed. It was the first time I met Nelson Mandela. He came on Saturday 15 May 2004 in Zurich, when we could say South Africa was the winner [of the right to host the 2010 World Cup]. This is a great moment for the Fifa executive committee. For me personally, it is part of the story of humanity.&quot; Among the organisers and footballers involved in Makana FA on Robben Island were several ANC cabinet ministers, including the late national hero Steve Tshwete. Inmates who secretly followed matches from the prison&apos;s isolation wing included Mandela himself and the father of the former president Thabo Mbeki. The current president, Jacob Zuma, played for a club called Rangers and was also a referee. &quot;He was a good referee. But there were controversies about offsides and handball,&quot; Sitoto said.

After many months of six-figure job losses, official figures from the US department of labour indicated that employers eliminated 11,000 positions in November - the smallest number of jobs to be shed since December 2007. Analysts had forecast as many as 125,000 job losses. The statistics pushed many European stockmarkets into positive territory, including the FTSE 100 index which gained 50 points within minutes of the report. Wall Street futures soared ahead of the official opening of the New York Stock Exchange. &quot;We&apos;re almost back to normal, 11,000 jobs away from creating jobs&quot; said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo in New York. &quot;Those looking for gloom and doom forecasts for the economy will be disappointed. The economy is lifting at a much greater rate than expected.&quot; Government statisticians revised previous months&apos; jobless figures downwards, reducing earlier estimates for the number of jobs cut by 159,000. The report suggested a continuing erosion in employment in construction and manufacturing, although professional and business services sectors added jobs, as did employers in healthcare and education. Signs of an easing in unemployment are likely to come as a relief to the Obama administration, which has been anxious for indications that its $787bn () economic stimulus package is paying off in job creation. President Barack Obama brought together 130 corporate leaders, small business owners and economists for a jobs summit in Washington on Thursday to discuss the problem, and he is due to travel to the blue-collar steel producing city of Allentown, Pennsylvania, today for further discussions to put a focus onto employment creation. Certain experts urged caution, worrying that the November numbers could be &quot;rogue&quot; figures. Unemployment also fell slightly in July due to a large number of part-time workers giving up the search for jobs and dropping out of the labour force. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody&apos;s, told CNBC television that it would be worthwhile examining the numbers for the impact of seasonal adjustments: &quot;It&apos;s such a good number that it&apos;s just too good.&quot; But William Sullivan, chief economist at JVB Financial Group in Florida, said the figures backed up a recent improvement in sentiment that has sent stock markets upwards: &quot;It confirmed the bullish pace we&apos;ve seen unfolding in the equity market in recent months.

Where would Will Genia be this weekend if he were English? On the bench for a Premiership club, if he were fit, waiting for a hard-bitten coach to treat him like a responsible adult. He would definitely not be on the Barbarians&apos; bus, cruising towards Twickenham to face New Zealand alongside household names such as Victor Matfield and Joe Rokocoko. Nor would he have 11 Test caps and the admiration of both hemispheres. In Australia they do not believe in letting uncut diamonds gather dust. If nothing else, the 21-year-old scrum-half is proof of what can happen when selectors trust their instincts. &quot;I was thinking about it on the bus this week,&quot; he said. &quot;Suddenly here I am, looking at blokes who have played 50 Tests, guys who are greats of the game. It&apos;s an unbelievable feeling.&quot; At the start of the year he was a frustrated reserve for the Queensland Reds, not long back from the World Under-20 Championship in Wales. The Australians came fifth, having lost to an England side containing several stellar talents. And now? Genia will have started a second season as a Test regular before two highly rated English counterparts, Joe Simpson and Ben Youngs, have had a sniff of Test rugby. Another triumph for English conservatism? Answers on a postcard to the usual TW1 postcode. Rob Andrew, the Rugby Football Union&apos;s elite rugby director, did offer some mitigating reasons this week when asked why the cream rises to the top so much more slowly in England. Relegation does not encourage coaches to risk boy wonders; identifying the best prospects is complicated by the greater number of candidates; and softer pitches encourage a slower-paced game which suits more mature players. In the end, though, the problem is self-inflicted. While the RFU spends a fortune on player development, most coaches are disinclined to trust anyone under 25. The English system looks impressive on paper but, all too often, it propels its best youngsters into the Test arena at a snail&apos;s pace. Which is why Genia is such an intriguing case study. Until the age of 12 he &quot;didn&apos;t even know what rugby union was&quot;. Born in Papua New Guinea, the son of a government minister, he played backyard cricket in Port Moresby and wanted to be a pilot, until he was sent to boarding school in Brisbane. &quot;I kind of got into rugby because I was an islander and everyone assumed I&apos;d be good,&quot; he said. At 18 he was picked for\u00a0Queensland to face Japan, without having played a single game of club rugby. Even now he has only featured in 26 Super 14 matches, and those have been in a mostly struggling side. Yet toss him a Wallaby shirt against the All Blacks in Tokyo or England at Twickenham and he exhibits the cool composure of a veteran. It is a case of &quot;if you&apos;re good enough, you&apos;re old enough&quot;. To talk to Genia, either way, is to suspect that the Wallabies have indeed found their\u00a0long-term hinge, a No9 who stands comparison with Nick Farr-Jones and George Gregan. There will be dips in form but the newcomer has the work ethic of a young Jonny Wilkinson and the absolute determination of a spawning salmon. &quot;I went on a Reds tour last year, to Ireland and France, and realised I didn&apos;t just want to be a second-rate player coming off the bench, playing professional rugby for the sake of it,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to start, not just play 20 minutes here or there. The main lesson I learned was that\u00a0you have to prepare well and train\u00a0as hard as you can to get where you want to be.&quot; His school coach recalls a pupil so competitive he would refuse to leave training until he had landed a left-footed drop-goal from the touchline, but Genia\u00a0is no robot. Cleverly, the Wallaby coach, Robbie Deans, has encouraged his 5ft 9in half-back to play the game in front of\u00a0him,\u00a0rather than stick to a script. While\u00a0Genia ranks Ireland well ahead of the other home nations \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s a skill to be that patient and disciplined; I thought they were a real quality side&quot; \u2013 he is also a believer in quick-thinking, regardless of circumstances. &quot;You have to be on the ball and not hesitate,&quot; he said. &quot;The moment you do, the moment is gone. Instinct plays a big part in it. If you don&apos;t take your opportunities at Test level, it becomes a boring game.&quot; And there, in two sentences, lies the difference between Genia and the safety\u2011first\u00a0brigade who are suffocating English rugby. Maybe life as a politician&apos;s son \u2013 &quot;It was kind of weird because we didn&apos;t have much privacy and always had people over at home. Growing up I got bored of people sitting around talking \u2026&quot; \u2013 has bred a desire not to settle for the obvious. Premier Rugby, in its wisdom, has declined to allow Premiership players to represent the Baa-Baas today. Why? Even if only a couple of youngsters were allowed to rub shoulders with Matt Giteau and co it would expand the horizons of the strait-jacketed English game. Genia and Danny Cipriani are barely two months apart in age. Had the latter been born in Brisbane \u2013 or Port Moresby \u2013 he would have spared himself a lot of hassle."}, {"sentences": ["When 23-year-old Daisuke travels from his village to begin university in Tokyo, he embarks on the universal transition into the unknown."], "tags": ["Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-06T00:09:23Z", "title": "Sanshiro by Natsume Soseki | Book review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/06/sanshiro-natsume-soseki-book-review", "article": "When 23-year-old Daisuke travels from his village to begin university in Tokyo, he embarks on the universal transition into the unknown.

He scored 185 not out; the innings lasted 643 minutes; he faced 492 balls; and he felt as fresh as a daisy at the end of it all. Atherton wrote at the start of a chapter in his autobiography, Opening Up: &quot;If he is lucky, a batsman may once play an innings that defines him; one that, whether he likes it or not, he will be remembered for.&quot; The 185 was his innings and that chapter was simply entitled &quot;Johannesburg&quot;. Cricket followers needed no more explanation. It was 1995, England&apos;s first tour to South Africa since the end of apartheid, and it was one of the greatest match-saving knocks ever played by an England captain. Or by any captain. Now it is tempting to think that such an innings could never be repeated. Atherton acknowledges that this may well be the case, but not for the obvious reason. &quot;There are several players around now who could play that type of innings. Andrew Strauss could. I&apos;m sure Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid could. So might Mike Hussey. But they probably would not do so. Today they would be going for the win. &quot;In 1995 we never thought about winning that Test. It never occurred to us that it was feasible. That&apos;s changed. Expectations have risen. Sides have proven that you can chase 400-plus successfully.&quot; At Johannesburg in the second Test of the series after a much-criticised, delayed declaration by Hansie Cronje, England, having been outplayed from the start of the match, required a notional 479 for victory in just over five sessions. They finished on 351 for five having faced 165 overs. To win, England would not even have needed to score at three runs per over. Today Tendulkar, Dravid, Hussey and even Strauss might have fancied their chances of victory. Virender Sehwag certainly would have done. His blitz in Mumbai on Thursday, in which he smashed 284 in less than a day from 239 balls against Sri Lanka, meant he has now hit three of the four fastest double centuries in Test history. Sehwag, more than anyone, epitomises how the approach to batting has been overhauled in the 21st century. As a teenager he might have admired Atherton&apos;s epic. He shows no sign of wishing to emulate it. The advent of Twenty20 is one reason for the revolution; it has opened up the horizons of batsmen. The elimination of risk is no longer the highest priority, except in remote pockets of Yorkshire. Three weeks ago South Africa&apos;s Twenty20 batsmen knocked up 185 in 70 minutes on their way to amassing 241 in 20 overs at Centurion. It took Atherton almost 11 hours to get that far. Yet in the grand scheme of things Atherton&apos;s innings will remain far longer in the memory. A Twenty20 match is too short to permit a truly epic performance, which Atherton&apos;s certainly was. By the end of it everyone in Johannesburg was in awe of a new cricketing superstar, albeit a scruffy, shy, self-effacing one. Fourteen years on Atherton says: &quot;Whenever I do see old footage, it feels like a different person out there. It&apos;s like an out-of-body experience. It&apos;s as if I&apos;m watching somebody else. I dread to think what I&apos;d say now if I were commentating on that innings. Contrary to what many thought, I was a technically flawed batsman. I think I&apos;d have to point that out.&quot; But he was at his peak, aged 27, still unencumbered by the back problems that would restrict his movement at the crease in the second half of his career, and in his own low-key way he was striving to lead England to some brave new world, just as Strauss is doing now. In many ways it seems more than 14 years ago, a more colourful, haphazard time in which the captain had to bear more of the brunt on tour. John Barclay, an Old Etonian, a former Sussex captain and the current president of the MCC, was the tour manager; Raymond Illingworth of Pudsey was there as chairman of selectors and coach and some of the time he was assisted by two hand-picked (by Illingworth) colleagues from his generation, Peter Lever and John Edrich. And there was a physio, a scorer and a doctor who, Atherton concluded in his tour report, did not have enough to do. On the first day of the tour, while the players were concentrating on physical work at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, Illingworth and his fellow coaches popped round the corner for a round of golf. Somehow Illingworth, in the weeks before the tour was able to do several, well-remunerated articles in the Sun outlining the defects of some of England&apos;s cricketers. This was another era. Once the tour was under way it became apparent that Illingworth could not get on with Devon Malcolm, who could not get on with Lever, either. Atherton and Illingworth could get on OK \u2013 they were often bridge partners \u2013 but had numerous disagreements over the cricket. Meanwhile Barclay, who became a lifelong friend of Atherton, buzzed around trying to keep everyone heading in the same direction. &quot;It was a happy dressing room, I think,&quot; Atherton says, &quot;but there was plenty of colour and niggle. It would have been interesting to write about.&quot; Atherton is now the consummate media man, eager for a bit of spice at press conferences, which represents a considerable change of priorities to when he was captain. He admires the two Andys \u2013 Strauss and Flower \u2013 enormously, but as a journalist he just wishes that they were not quite so sensible. Dear old Illy never failed to provide good copy. The first Test of the tour at Centurion had been a rain-ruined draw, in which Graeme Hick played one of his best innings for England, 141, which would soon be forgotten after a thunderstorm prevented South Africa from having to bat in the match. At the Wanderers in the second Test England, having chosen to bowl first, squandered the new ball. South Africa took a first-innings lead of 132, which was extended to 478 when Cronje, eager that Brian McMillan should reach his century, belatedly declared 27 minutes before lunch on the fourth day. So began the first of Atherton&apos;s great duels with Allan Donald. (The reprise took place at Trent Bridge in 1998. There Atherton survived an appeal \u2013 justified \u2013 for a gloved catch, afterwards signing the offending glove for Donald to raffle in his benefit year.) Atherton talked me through his innings at the Wanderers two days after the match and we decided that the barrage from Donald was reminiscent of the spell he faced from Courtney Walsh in Jamaica in 1994. On that occasion Walsh bowled 14 ferocious consecutive overs, not resting until he had got his man. &quot;Donald bowled as quick as you can get,&quot; Atherton said then, &quot;as quick as Walsh but he was not so hostile. Nor was the crowd. Every time Donald bounced me I made a conscious decision to stare at him, to make eye contact and let him know I wasn&apos;t cowed. After a while that became an automatic reaction.&quot; Shaun Pollock, in his first Test series, was equally tricky, but with Alec Stewart as his partner, 75 runs were scored at a good rate at the start of England&apos;s second innings. Atherton found himself hooking the short balls. &quot;It wasn&apos;t intentional. There is a balance between being pumped up and controlled and maybe Stewie and I were too aggressive for a while.&quot; They were not going for the win, of course, merely trying to assert themselves against a fired-up South Africa attack. But soon Stewart was bowled by McMillan. Mark Ramprakash, in one of his hopeless phases as an England batsman, followed two balls later, driving wildly. &quot;There was no point in my worrying about Ramps&apos; state of mind out in the middle,&quot; Atherton recalls now. &quot;I went to see him that night.&quot; Atherton alone appeared up to the task. Graham Thorpe scored one run in 18 overs after tea before succumbing to the first ball he faced from Meyrick Pringle; Hick soon became Donald&apos;s 100th Test wicket. At the close England were a precarious 167 for four, with Atherton 82 not out. That night Atherton dined \u2013 and drank a few glasses of wine \u2013 with Stewart and Thorpe at Tokyo&apos;s, a Japanese restaurant a short walk from the team hotel. He slept well and woke early. Looking back now Atherton recalls that he was not great at resuming an innings the next day. &quot;Sometimes I would shut myself away, avoid alcohol, do all the right things and get out straight away the next morning. Later on I realised I needed to get out of the room, to stop thinking about cricket. Strauss has had a similar problem, often failing to get going the following morning.&quot; Maybe he should take note. However, Atherton was not so fluent on the resumption of play. &quot;My feet were moving across rather than down the pitch.&quot; He was usually motionless between deliveries, relaxing and conserving his energy, but even he tried some Robin Smith-style skips to get his body moving (Smith was now his partner). He nudged to 99, aware that he had been dismissed twice for 99 in his Test career. He clipped a short ball from Donald off his hip. &quot;When I hit it I thought that&apos;s three.&quot; In fact it hit the midriff of Gary Kirsten at short leg and bounced to the ground. &quot;It would have been an unlucky dismissal. But the adrenalin was pumping now. I was waiting for a short one next ball.&quot; It duly arrived and Atherton hooked it for four. He embraced a startled Smith, who expected Atherton to show his customary reserve in his celebrations \u2013 &quot;I just released all my emotions for a minute or so.&quot; Now the fluency returned. But at 11.45am Smith was out, caught at third man. Enter Jack Russell. Meanwhile in the dressing room Dominic Cork sat next to Angus Fraser, watching the game on television. Superstition demanded that he stayed in the same seat for the next five hours, rising only in between overs to stretch and go to the loo. Somehow Russell survived until lunch. Atherton ate spaghetti, browsed through the papers, did not bother with a shower and carefully fixed Thorpe&apos;s grille to his own helmet (a bouncer from Pringle had dented his). He said to Russell: &quot;They&apos;ll start twitching if they don&apos;t get a wicket in this session.&quot; In the afternoon Russell looked more secure. After mid-session drinks the 12th man, Richard Illingworth, reported back to the dressing room: &quot;Jack&apos;s looking knackered but Athers is as fresh as a daisy.&quot; Atherton described his state of mind in his autobiography. &quot;By the afternoon, and for the only time in my career I was in the zone. It is a state much talked about by sports psychologists and while I can describe my feeling, I couldn&apos;t begin to explain how to replicate it \u2026 I was in an almost trance-like state. It was a state of both inertia and intense concentration and I knew that I was in total control and they couldn&apos;t get me out.&quot; They could not get Russell out, either. &quot;At tea the mood in the dressing room was still tense but more upbeat,&quot; Atherton says. &quot;We had come so far that the thought of losing the match made me sick in the stomach. This was a different sort of pressure, the worst kind. Now it would be a massive cock-up if we failed to save the game.&quot; Cork, still in the same chair, experienced the same agonies. By now the South Africans were flagging, too exhausted to make much use of the third new ball. When the bails were removed Atherton had the energy to run from the field. &quot;Bob Woolmer [the South Africa coach] congratulated me graciously, the players engulfed me, Illy gave me a handshake.&quot; But do not take that to mean that Illingworth was only mildly impressed. It&apos;s is just that he and his generation did not do embraces. He said that Atherton&apos;s innings was &quot;one of the greatest ever played \u2013 I have never seen a better or gutsier knock \u2026 I have often said that there is a lot of Geoff Boycott in Mike and he proved it that day.&quot; Fourteen years ago, our own Kevin Mitchell made a similar comparison in these pages. &quot;There is one Englishman in South Africa who could once have done what Atherton did (possibly still could) \u2013 but it is doubtful if the nation would have wrapped Geoffrey Boycott in as ample and loving a hug as it did the man from Lancashire.&quot; For Atherton that evening there were drinks aplenty, with Ian Botham among others. Back at the hotel Russell, to his astonishment, was reunited with his wife, Aileen, surreptitiously flown out that day to South Africa by Barclay. Atherton was excused the next match at Paarl. Instead he was taken fly-fishing by Barclay for the first time in his life and he soon discovered that he liked it, which was not so surprising. You need patience in abundance for that as well."}, {"sentences": ["But more often than not 30 Rock is hilarious \u2013 witness the Tokyo University payoff in Jenna&apos;s misogynistic Japanese TV ad."], "tags": ["30 Rock", "Television", "Television industry", "Media", "Tina Fey"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-07T16:38:08Z", "title": "30 Rock: comedy of the finest order", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2009/dec/07/30-rock", "article": "Since moving from the Freeview hinterland of Five USA to the cable and satellite, er, middle-land of Comedy Central earlier in the year, 30 Rock is finally being treated with more respect.

The economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.3% from July to September, drastically down on an earlier estimate of 4.8%, the cabinet office said today. Last month&apos;s estimate had failed to factor in a huge decline in corporate spending as Japan&apos;s export-led economy struggles under the weight of weak demand and the soaring yen. While Japan was expecting capital investment to grow by 1.6%, today&apos;s figures revealed that it actually contracted 2.8%. The revision comes a day after the government announced a \u00a57.2tn (\u00a350bn) stimulus package in another attempt to prevent the economy from sliding back into recession. The GDP data means the world&apos;s second-biggest economy, which only emerged from its worst postwar recession earlier this year, grew a mere 0.3% compared with the previous quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 1.2%. Officials were clearly taken aback by the size of the revision. &quot;When releasing the preliminary figures, I commented with hope that a path for domestic demand-led recovery may have emerged, but now we need to re-examine that,&quot; Keisuke Tsumura, parliamentary secretary of the cabinet office, told reporters. The strength of the yen and falling prices have created a rift between the government and the Bank of Japan, which last week made \u00a510tn available to commercial banks in an apparent sop to the finance ministry. Japan&apos;s faltering recovery has also opened up divisions in the coalition government. Shizuka Kamei, the outspoken banking minister, successfully lobbied the prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to add a further \u00a5100bn to the stimulus package. That portion will be covered by a bond issue, placing further strain on Japan&apos;s vast public debt. Japan has introduced four emergency spending packages since September last year, totalling more than \u00a529tn. Hatoyama defended the new measures, but acknowledged, with considerable understatement, that the economy was &quot;not necessarily doing well&quot;. Analysts did not expect the package, which includes support for jobseekers and smaller companies, as well as more incentives to buy eco-friendly products, to have much of an impact. Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, said that while Asia would continue to fuel the recovery in exports, poor demand at home would continue to slow growth. &quot;The fact that manufacturers are saddled with excessive capacity and employment that cannot be undone by a cyclical upturn means cost cutting will continue for some time,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["The pursuit was only included in the Olympic programme at Tokyo in 1964, but supporters of the event point out that there has been a medium-distance endurance event in the Games programme since the modern Olympics began in 1896."], "tags": ["Cycling", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-09T20:11:36Z", "title": "Radical plans for Olympic cycling parity enter final lap", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/09/olympic-cycling-parity-victoria-pendleton", "article": "The next 48 hours could be the moment that Britain&apos;s women track cyclists have been waiting for, with the International Olympic Committee set to give female track racers complete parity with their male counterparts at five events each for the London Games. The IOC executive board today began considering what is set to be the most radical and controversial rejig of the cycling programme since the sport went open in 1996 and the outcome should be known tomorrow or Friday. Cycling&apos;s governing body has proposed that to make it identical to the men&apos;s programme, the women&apos;s track schedule should include four new events. Three are already raced by the men: the keirin motorpaced race, the team sprint \u2013 three riders over three laps for men, two and two for women \u2013 and the team pursuit, for three riders over three kilometres. The omnium, which is five races over five days for a general classification, would be new for both men and women. The match sprint for men and women would be unchanged. The individual pursuits for men and women over 4,000m and 3,000m, points races for both sexes and the two-man Madison relay are all likely to be dropped, hence the controversy of the proposed changes. The possible loss of the pursuits has been opposed by current British Olympic champions Bradley Wiggins and Rebecca Romero \u2013 pursuit gold medalists in Beijing \u2013 and Sir Chris Hoy, who swept the board in the match sprint, team sprint and keirin in China last year. The US track rider Taylor Phinney, who took over from Wiggins as world pursuit champion this year, spearheaded an online petition to save the individual pursuit, and delivered more than 4,400 signatures to the IOC on Monday. A letter of complaint, signed by international track riders \u2013 apparently all male \u2013 has been sent to the IOC and UCI. Lance Armstrong, seven-times a Tour de France winner, and the 1992 Olympic 4,000m pursuit champion Chris Boardman have spoken out. The pursuit was only included in the Olympic programme at Tokyo in 1964, but supporters of the event point out that there has been a medium-distance endurance event in the Games programme since the modern Olympics began in 1896. They contend that dropping the race is the equivalent of athletics dispensing with the 1500m. A compromise has been proposed which would retain the event. At first sight the principal British beneficiary of the proposed changes would appear to be Victoria Pendleton, Olympic women&apos;s sprint champion and a possible favourite in the keirin and team sprint, where she has taken world titles in the past. But after bemoaning the lack of parity in the past, and complaining that she had only one medal chance to three for her male counterparts, Pendleton now feels that the gender question has become bigger than her personal success story. &quot;This has been the bane of my life,&quot; she said recently. &quot;It became very clear to me if you&apos;re going to be successful in the media, it helps if you have a story. I didn&apos;t have one in Beijing. I went in as world champion and favourite, and won. So I thought, tell you what my story is, it&apos;s that it&apos;s so unfair that men have more chances to win than women. I didn&apos;t rant on about it, but it became the only thing that people wanted to talk to me about.&quot; Dave Brailsford, British Cycling&apos;s performance director, has described the changes as &quot;exciting and innovative&quot; and set his coaches to work to devise new programmes before the news was even made public. As well as Pendleton, there should be opportunities for her fellow sprinters Jessica Varnish and Becky James, while the women&apos;s team pursuit trio of Wendy Houvenaghel, Lizzie Armitstead and Joanna Rowsell could also have their eyes on London after tomorrow. Brailsford has called a press conference for tomorrow morning to update on Team Sky, Britain&apos;s new cycling team. A Sky spokesman tonight refused to comment on whether it would concern Wiggins, fourth in this year&apos;s Tour de France."}, {"sentences": ["A Labour MP was pursued by the Commons authorities and forced to repay nearly \u00a35,000 in &quot;non-parliamentary&quot; travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi after he ignored their demands for repayment.", "Joyce said the flight costs and bills came from trips by two all-party parliamentary groups of MPs and peers \u2013 one for the African Great Lakes countries of Rwanda and Congo, and the second for the Globe environmental group for a visit to Tokyo.", "Joyce told Bird the &quot;largest element&quot; of these costs came after the Globe group, of which he was a member, had &quot;run into cashflow problems&quot; just before he was due to fly to Tokyo."], "tags": ["MPs' expenses", "Eric Joyce", "Scottish politics", "Politics", "UK news", "House of Commons"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-10T21:36:07Z", "title": "Labour MP Eric Joyce had expense claims frozen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/dec/10/mps-expenses-eric-joyce-claims", "article": "A Labour MP was pursued by the Commons authorities and forced to repay nearly \u00a35,000 in &quot;non-parliamentary&quot; travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi after he ignored their demands for repayment. Eric Joyce, the MP for Falkirk who is already known for receiving the most expenses of any MP in Britain, was told in October last year that his parliamentary expenses had been suspended until he repaid \u00a34,985.60 in flight and hotel costs incurred on trips by two unofficial all-party groups of peers and MPs. As a further penalty for ignoring a series of official requests for repayment, Joyce was told that \u00a3319.85 in mileage claims and \u00a3595 in Commons expenses were being kept to use as down-payments towards the money he owed. In one of the most serious controversies to emerge from release of the latest MPs&apos; expenses claims, the documents reveal Joyce made a formal apology &quot;for the highly regrettable&quot; oversight a day after his allowances were suspended. Joyce said the flight costs and bills came from trips by two all-party parliamentary groups of MPs and peers \u2013 one for the African Great Lakes countries of Rwanda and Congo, and the second for the Globe environmental group for a visit to Tokyo. Joyce said the Commons authorities had pursued him for repayment more vigorously than normal because his debts had been spotted during an inspection by the National Audit Office, which had asked the Commons to take swift action to recover the money. &quot;That&apos;s why they jumped on it because the NAO had flagged it up on their ledger and they had been given a number of action points to clear up,&quot; he said. He insisted that none of these charges were for private, non-political travel or hotel costs. The Commons&apos; director of operations, Terry Bird, wrote to Joyce on 20 October 2008 reminding him that he had failed to reply to a letter on 11 September about the journeys paid for with his House of Commons travelcard. &quot;I am concerned that I have not received a formal reply and that you have not refunded the costs to the house,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It is therefore with regret that I have to inform you that I have instructed my staff to withhold money payable to you in respect of the parliamentary allowances until the sum mentioned above is recovered in full.&quot; A further email dated 22 October from the Commons&apos; head of validation and inquiry teams stated that a colleague &quot;has long been chasing Eric Joyce MP for some time regarding the repayment of funds relating to non-parliamentary use of the travelcard. &quot;We have finally tied Mr Joyce down and we duly expect a transfer of the required funds directly to Bank of England. &quot; After deducting Joyce&apos;s frozen mileage and Commons expenses, the outstanding sum was later recorded as \u00a34,070.75. Joyce told Bird the &quot;largest element&quot; of these costs came after the Globe group, of which he was a member, had &quot;run into cashflow problems&quot; just before he was due to fly to Tokyo. The payment was authorised by Commons officials, he said, but the Globe group had failed to repay them to him within the fortnight, as he had hoped. &quot;This is highly regrettable and I am sorry as it is clearly my responsibility,&quot; Joyce wrote. &quot;I should have been chasing it and I am afraid I have not been. The other elements of the costs are fully my personal responsibility for repayment.&quot; He accepted &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for an unspecified part of the money owed, and said that would be covered by his \u00a31,000 allowances payment for the month. He added: &quot;Once again, do accept my apologies for the poor administration involved in this saga and thank you for your assistance.&quot;Joyce, who chairs the Great Lakes region and genocide prevention all-party group, said today the costs of the trip to Rwanda and Congo had been put on his Commons travelcard because of a financial crisis caused by missed flights on the trip. But the group&apos;s backers failed to repay him quickly in a wrangle over reclaiming the money from their insurers."}, {"sentences": ["Herm\u00e8s \u00d7 Tokujin YoshiokaInstallation by Japanese designer in the windows of Maison Herm\u00e8s in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Media", "Digital media"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-11T07:00:01Z", "title": "Viral Video Chart: Wedding Twitters and cute uke", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/dec/10/wedding-twitter-ukelele-viral-video-chart", "article": "     When software developer Dana Hanna got married he pulled out his BlackBerry to send a Twitter update it before kissing the bride. &quot;Oh no, how could he?&quot; you might say, but actually it&apos;s a wry comment on how the virtual and real worlds are overlapping.

At the moment, he is feeling it\u00a0about a duo called Mini Viva, and those\u00a0with an interest in pop music will know that it&apos;s worth taking notice of Higgins&apos;s feelings. Under the name Xenomania, he and his creative partner Miranda Cooper are the architects of the sound that has defined pop this last decade. Their sparkling, sonically innovative signature has appeared on 40 top 10 singles (&quot;We have an 85% strike rate,&quot; Higgins says, cheerfully immodest) by, among others, Girls Aloud, Sugababes and Alesha Dixon. Their reputation is such that even Franz Ferdinand sought the team&apos;s writing and production skills for their last album, though the sessions were never used. Much, therefore, is expected of Mini Viva, and unless Higgins&apos;s instincts have gone off the boil, by this time next year the names Britt (sometimes Brittany) Love and Frankee Connolly could be as familiar as Dixon and Cheryl Cole are today. &quot;Even before they opened their mouths, I just knew,&quot; Higgins says of Love and Connolly, 20 years old and Geordie and Mancunian respectively. &quot;The first time I saw their photos, I knew they&apos;d be brilliant.&quot; Sitting in his office, known as &quot;the purple room&quot;, at Xenomania HQ \u2013 a converted rectory in a pretty village in Kent \u2013 he&apos;s surrounded by the rewards of being right about such things. The house in which he lives and works occupies a substantial plot in the middle of the village; the garden is so big that last summer it was the setting for &quot;Xenofest&quot;, an all-day private bash starring many of Xenomania&apos;s big acts. Upstairs, in a warren of rooms with centuries-old sloping floors, is where the hits are recorded, including Mini Viva&apos;s debut, I Left My Heart in Tokyo, which reached No 7 in\u00a0September. There&apos;s a powerful machine behind the duo: Xenomania, which put the group together after holding national auditions in 2007 (&quot;We thought we should prepare for Girls Aloud taking a year off, and we wanted to make music with a blank canvas, so we started auditioning&quot;), is in charge of the creative side, while Simon Fuller, the magnate responsible for the Spice Girls and the Idol talent-show franchise, is their manager. The music will be released on the newly resurrected Geffen records, former label of Elton John and Guns N&apos; Roses. &quot;They embody what pop is all about,&quot; says Geffen UK&apos;s MD, Colin Barlow. &quot;They&apos;re two great characters and the music is very fresh and uplifting. It&apos;s about dynamics, and that&apos;s what they have, a real dynamic sound.&quot; The involvement of such big guns has ensured plenty of early media coverage. Unusually, though, interest is also being shown in quarters that don&apos;t normally bother with pure pop acts. The NME ran a feature in its Radar new bands section, predicting they would be &quot;the next biggest girl band in the universe&quot; (the magazine also declared it was &quot;excited about Mini Viva&quot; in its End of Decade issue), they have been recommended by Q magazine and they have been taken on by a PR company that is more accustomed to working with unimpeachably leftfield acts such as Super Furry Animals and Belle and Sebastian. Why are they attracting &quot;credible&quot; attention? An extract from the Radar article explains it: &quot;The space-age duo&apos;s glacial treadmill-disco single, I Left My Heart in Tokyo, isn&apos;t really like other pop music.&quot; In other words, while Mini Viva may look like the typical hair-extensions-and-lycra girl band, the tunes are a cut above. Quality songs are what transformed Girls Aloud from reality TV nobodies of whom little was expected into hitmakers admired even by those who consider &quot;pop&quot; a dirty word, and Higgins intends to provide his new duo with the same standard of material. Mini Viva will sink or swim according to the quality of their songs, he says \u2013 if the songs are good enough, a bond will be formed between audience and band, something he considers crucial. &quot;You can&apos;t sell an album in 2009 without an emotional connection,&quot; he maintains. The absence of a connection has been the undoing of virtually all manufactured (Higgins prefers the term &quot;producer-driven&quot; to &quot;manufactured&quot;) acts of recent years, from Hear&apos;Say to most X Factor winners. Fuller agrees \u2013 and as creator of Pop Idol, the show that launched dozens of short-lived careers, he ought to know. He says, via email: &quot;Brian is absolutely right. It used to be the case that a song might jump off the radio and grab your attention in a single moment but today, it&apos;s different. There are so many channels into new music that a band needs to have an emotional bond if it&apos;s going to have any meaning. Unless you establish that emotional connection, you will simply fall by the wayside.&quot; Accordingly, Higgins foresees an old-fashioned gradual build-up for Connolly and Love. &quot;They&apos;ll need five or six top 10 hits in order to bed down, and they&apos;re capable of inspiring that many hits out of us. They&apos;re wonderful, but they need to bed in over time, and without a TV platform in this day and age, it could take till the second album.&quot; That&apos;s fine with Barlow, who says: &quot;In pop these days, it takes time. You have to be pragmatic and build awareness. We&apos;re in it for the long haul with Mini Viva.&quot; Nevertheless, a &quot;TV platform&quot; \u2013 an appearance on The X Factor, Jonathan Ross or other big show \u2013 would instantly introduce them to millions of potential fans. The problem is that there are so few slots available that they invariably go to the A-list likes of Mariah Carey and Take That. A new act, even one backed by Xenomania and Simon Fuller, hasn&apos;t got a hope. Early-evening magazine programmes, though, are happy to book them, and a couple of days later, Mini Viva appear on Five&apos;s Live from Studio Five. Dressed in retina-scorching Day-Glo skirts and vertiginous high heels, they sing an acoustic version of their new single, I Wish. Their voices blend so beguilingly that the show&apos;s co-presenter, Kate Walsh (of The Apprentice demi-fame), sways at her desk. Something Higgins said comes back to me: &quot;In Brittany and Frankee we think we have a unique blend of voices. I can hear tones of Millie Small [the singer of 1960s ska hit My Boy Lollipop] in Brittany, and an incredible ability to generate pathos as well, and in Frankee you have a perfect pop tone. She reminds me of Rihanna.&quot; The programme goes to an ad break, ignominiously fading Mini Viva out mid-song, but no matter \u2013 they have done what they came to do, which is to make people aware they are out there, battling for our pop pound. Minutes later, they bustle into the studio green room and curl up next to each other on a sofa, still buzzing from the performance. In an hour, they&apos;ll be leaving for Manchester to join the Clubland package tour, where they&apos;ll be one of a dozen acts to play two songs each to a crowd of very excited kids with glow sticks. &quot;I love touring,&quot; says Love, her enthusiasm implying she hasn&apos;t done much of it. She has a black beehive and a chirpy manner, while her bandmate has a passing resemblance to Rihanna and a dry wit. They describe their sound as &quot;shiny disco, but tongue-in-cheek&quot;. Do they agree with the NME&apos;s &quot;glacial treadmill-disco&quot; assessment? &quot;Glacial?&quot; repeats Connolly. &quot;Well, glaciers are shiny if you look at them in a certain way.&quot; Do they feel under pressure to live up the expectations other people have for them? &quot;We don&apos;t feel like we&apos;ve got to be the most amazing thing ever, but we don&apos;t want to be a five-minute flash-in-the-pan,&quot; says Love, who worked as a waitress and had never sung for anyone outside her family before her mother urged her to audition for the band. &quot;We&apos;d rather spend time on an album to make it good.&quot; The &quot;authenticity&quot; question arises. From their own experiences as fans (Love of Sugababes, Connolly of Destiny&apos;s Child), they agree audiences need to believe in them and feel their songs are aimed directly at them. &quot;When I used to listen to the Sugababes, that had meaning to me. They were three different-looking girls and they seemed approachable and not intimidating,&quot; says Love. Connolly, who was briefly in a girl band in Manchester, adds: &quot;You have to have that connection. Everyone will listen to our songs in their own little way.&quot; They are proud of the fact that, unlike most producer-driven acts, they have neither gone to stage school nor applied to TV talent shows. Love: &quot;I always thought The X Factor was a bit of a fix. If you&apos;ve got talent and get through without [reality programmes], it&apos;s better.&quot; Surprisingly, Fuller is of the same opinion. &quot;We want to build pop talent over the long term and this means you have to be authentic. I&apos;m not interested in faking or creating bogus movements or personalities - I simply want to work with great talent and then empower them to achieve their dreams. I&apos;ve always believed that pop music is a credible part of contemporary culture and I see these girls and their work with Brian reflecting life as it is now. It&apos;s that simple.&quot; Mini Viva&apos;s single I Wish is released on Monday by Geffen/Polydor"}, {"sentences": ["Here&apos;s Damon McMenamin: &quot;In a bar in Tokyo at the moment with the Everton supporters club."], "tags": ["Premier League", "Stoke City", "Wigan Athletic", "Birmingham City", "West Ham United", "Burnley", "Fulham", "Hull City", "Blackburn Rovers", "Sunderland", "Portsmouth", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "Chelsea", "Everton", "Bolton Wanderers", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-12T11:07:09Z", "title": "Premier League clockwatch - as it happened! | Tom Bryant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/12/premier-league-clockwatch-live-football", "article": " Afternoon: Today&apos;s Premier League fixtures are a mouthwatering, action-packed, line-up full of intricate dramas, delicately poised tragedies, crises, spectacles and tension.

And that&apos;s where he&apos;ll probably sit and freeze all day long. Stoke: Sorensen, Wilkinson, Shawcross, Abdoulaye Faye, Huth, Delap, Diao, Whitehead, Etherington, Fuller, Sanli. Subs: Simonsen, Higginbotham, Whelan, Beattie, Sidibe, Pugh, Collins. For Wigan Kirkland is back after doing his back in last week. Wigan: Kirkland, Melchiot, Boyce, Bramble, Figueroa, Gomez, Koumas, Diame, Scharner, N&apos;Zogbia, Rodallega.  Subs: Kingson, Amaya, Cho, Scotland, Sinclair, De Ridder, McCarthy. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral)  12.44pm: At the Britannia stadium, all the stewards have just been asked to change their orange hi-vis jackets for yellow ones, meaning that Wigan are presumably playing in their dazzling orange shirts. They look fairly confused about matters. The stewards that is, I&apos;m not sure the Wigan players care.  12.48pm: A prediction? Stoke City 1-0 Wigan. That&apos;s based entirely on the fact that Stoke&apos;s players won&apos;t be hungover because they won&apos;t have been partying it up earlier this week at the Christmas party they were forbidden from attending by their Humbug-yelling manager. The Wigan manager, Robert Martinez, however, was out earlier this week, having been included into Alex Ferguson&apos;s cabal of managers he  has tucked in his pocket  is friends with and who he took out to dinner. Also included were Sam Allardyce and David Moyes. Make of that what you will. Right, here comes kick-off.  12.52pm: A long-throw from Delap goes straight to Kirkland on his goal-line. That&apos;s the closest we&apos;ve come to what&apos;s more normally known as &apos;action&apos;. Here&apos;s our man at the ground Mikey Stafford, freezing his little fingers off in Stoke. &quot;Following on from Pulis and Beattie&apos;s Christmas Carol last week I can confirm my Dickensian fingerless gloves are out. I thought you would like to know Tom, there in your cosy, warm office,&quot; he shivers. &quot;Tuncay Sanli gets only his second start for Stoke as Pulis tries to bring sexy football to the Britannia \u2013 however Glenn Whelan and Liam Lawrence are absent from a muscular midfield. Super Saturday is about to commence ...&quot;  12.54pm: Whitehead sends the ball just wide of the left-hand post after taking a shot from just inside the area. It&apos;s all been Stoke so far. Although, to be fair, the word Stoke could be exchanged for another word beginning with s.  12.55pm: An email: &quot;Congratulations from Microsoft Award. 450,000.00 Pounds has been Awarded to you, Send Below your: Names,Age,Country,Sex,Tel,occupation to p.micro1@btinternet.com.&quot; Well, that&apos;s nice.  12.58pm: Wigan spend a good long time lining up a free-kick. Three of them stand over it, deliberating who will take the strike, which is in the middle 10 yards outside the Stoke area. The referee tinkers with the wall, the players check their laces, the tension mounts. Then Gomez plants it into the wall half a foot off the ground.  1pm: There&apos;s a reason Andy Gray is in the elevated position of Sky&apos;s chief football pundit and I&apos;m sat here typing as if cranked on speed. It&apos;s for the sort of analysis that allows him to say, as Rory Delap takes a towel to dry the ball, things like: &quot;He&apos;s drying the ball to get it as dry as possible&quot;. I just hope that one day, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, I&apos;ll be able to work that sort of stuff out.  1.03pm: &quot;I&apos;d love to see Wigan in orange play Chelsea in their yellow outfit,&quot; writes Marcin Kaminski. &quot;It might break my retina though.&quot; It would also give the stewards a real head ache. What on earth colour would their hi-viz jackets be? Pink?  1.03pm: You can, of course, get auto-updates of this here report. Well, you can now I&apos;ve turned the doo-hickey on.  1.05pm: Is that a goal? Rodallega got onto the end of a swinging free-kick which Sorenson saved brilliantly, however Boyce followed up and bundled the ball into the back of the net. No-one seems to know whether it&apos;s a goal or not, though, since Sorensen and Boyce have gone down in a heap clutching various body parts and no-one has celebrated.  1.06pm Yes! Yes it is a goal. Stoke 0-1 Wigan.  1.08pm: After scoring that goal, Emerson Boyce has wandered off the pitch, injured, to much bum-patting and &quot;Well done Boycey&quot; from his bench. They haven&apos;t replaced him yet, so presumably he&apos;ll come back on. What are the rules on that? How long is he allowed to be treated for. I should probably know. I don&apos;t though. So there.  1.10pm: You can, of course, email in about the rest of today&apos;s 3pm kick-offs, if you so wish. Here, for example, is Kevin Porter, doing just that: &quot;Wolves&apos; plight has deepened to the extent where any result from this game is bad for us. Is there any sign of either side fielding ineligible players, perhaps?&quot;  1.15pm: The tackles are flying in at the Britannia, and the boos have been ringing out around the ground in consequence. Boyce is back on the pitch, too. Wigan look like they have the ability to catch Stoke on the break and, oddly enough, are giving their massive defence problems in the air.  1.16pm: Another Delap long throw causes problems in the box, which Ricardo Fuller heads powerfully, but wide of the target.  1.20pm: &quot;Re. 1pm What! You are typing this?&quot; emails Michael Vallance, who appears to believe these delicately worded missives arrive by magic. He adds: &quot;Try dictation software ... and train it to recognise Andy Gray&apos;s voice too.&quot; But then you&apos;d just be watching Sky Sports, rather than my typo-ridden, ill-observed, humourless nonsense. Oh.  1.22pm: The goalkeepers are getting a real pasting in this game. After Sorensen was bundled into by Boyce, now Kirkland gets nailed. Stoke launch the ball forwards in the most Route One way possible. It bounces in the Wigan penalty area and, as Kirkland comes out to claim, Tuncay simply runs past the ball and barges the keeper. Whether it was deliberate or not, is unclear. If it was, it was a terrible foul. If it wasn&apos;t, the man simply has no spatial awareness and James Beattie must be wondering quite why he&apos;s not out there. Well, apart from the obvious reason.  1.24pm: Wigan really should have had a penalty there. Scharner was having his shirt tugged, his shoulders leaned on and his head pushed by (I think) Robert Huth as he tried to get on the end of a free-kick into the box. Mike Dean completely ignored the indiscretion.  1.27pm: Fuller makes a pig&apos;s ear of it in the box. The ball is played into his feet and rather than simply trap it and shoot, he proceeds to step over it, step round it and then gets tackled. Ah - no matter though, moments later Tuncay is played in along the left and, from a tight angle, he slams the ball into the back of the net. Rightly, he should probably have crossed, so that&apos;s an excellent finish. Stoke 1-1 Wigan.  1.30pm: Tuncay&apos;s got his pecker up, which is the sort of expression you could get away with in the 1950s but probably not so much anymore. I mean it in the 1950s sense, obviously, the other meaning is not something any of us should be thinking about now. Anyway, the point is, he&apos;s just connected with a Delap long throw to slam an overhead kick at the keeper. That was a combination of the prosaic and the poetic. The kick. Not his pecker.  1.31pm: N&apos;Zogbia hits a long-range free-kick a foot wide of the Stoke posts. Good effort.  1.34pm: Tuncay gets a yellow card for a second handball. The player, though, says the ball hit his chest. That is The News.  1.36pm: A half-time score from Scotland Motherwell 2-1 Celtic, where Mark Reynolds has scored on the stroke of half-time for Motherwell. There&apos;s four minute of extra time at the Britannia, incidentally. Which puts me four minutes from the sandwich I&apos;m going to get as soon as the whistle blows.  1.40pm: Fuller blasts a shot into the carpark from several miles out. He smiles, as if this all just a jolly jape, but really he should be lying prostrate on the ground cursing his right foot, his mother and father for providing him with the genes to grow it, and with life in general for the series of circumstances that led to him deciding to shoot in the first place. And with it comes half-time and a sandwich for me. Talk among yourselves. Quickly, in the snooker, Higgins has won the first frame and, as my colleague Scott Murray informs me, he&apos;s &quot;in among the balls&quot; in the second frame.  1.49pm: After getting in among the balls, Higgins has played a scrappy second frame in the snooker. I&apos;m paraphrasing Scott Murray, clearly. If I start watching the snooker, I&apos;ll be hypnotised by it and will spend the rest of the afternoon staring aimlessly at the screen, with that nagging feeling I should be doing something else, yet can&apos;t quite drag myself away from the balls.  1.53pm: I&apos;m afraid I haven&apos;t seen any of the Celtic game, so here&apos;s what the Press Association&apos;s match reporter makes of the first half - well, the bits where they scored goals.  &quot;Mark Reynolds&apos; late goal gave Motherwell the interval lead over Celtic in their Clydesdale Bank Premier League clash at Fir Park.Hoops striker Georgios Samaras, who had earlier struck the bar, put the home side ahead in the 14th minute with a fine drive.Celtic threatened to blow the home side away but Lukas Jutkiewicz levelled when he flicked in a Robert McHugh cross at the near post and Reynolds got the second moments before the break from a Tom Hateley free-kick.&quot;  1.55pm: There appears to be someone either para-gliding or parachuting somewhere near the Britannia Stadium. Whether or not he&apos;s aiming for the stadium itself, though, is unclear. Given that the teams are back on the pitch, though, he better get on with it. Wigan, however, have only sent 10 players onto the pitch. Is that deliberate?  1.57pm: The player missing is Emerson Boyce who appears to have injured himself coming back onto the pitch. He&apos;s replaced by Scott Sinclair, eventually, meaning Scharner will have to go back into defence. Higgins is 2-0 up and Scott tells me, &quot;Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan is sitting in his chair with that look on his face where he&apos;s trying to kid on that he doesn&apos;t give on. Possibly because he doesn&apos;t.&quot;  2pm: &quot;Congratulations on your financial windfall earlier in the match. Emails like that provided evidence of collateral sufficient for the loans that led to Dubai&apos;s expansion,&quot; writes Ian Copestake. &quot;So stop MBMing and go and build yourself hotel in the shape of a football.&quot; He&apos;s got a point.  2.01pm: I&apos;ll be honest. There&apos;s not much happening.  2.04pm: I say nothing&apos;s happening but that&apos;s untrue. Nothing much is happening on the pitch. In the stands, a man dressed as Father Christmas has just been led away by the police for constantly winding up the away support and flicking the Vs at them. He has a spider-web tattooed on his hand, which means he is perhaps not the sort of Father Christmas to whom you&apos;d want to lead your kids in a darkly-lit grotto.  2.06pm: Scharner heads the ball across the face of the goal having engineered himself some space in the box at a corner. A good chance that, which he earned from his own industry in the box. Good stuff. Wigan are on top at the moment. It&apos;s Motherwell 2-2 Celtic now, incidentally.  2.11pm: Stoke are very nearly in, perhaps having just read my last entry and taking offence. Fuller slides the ball across goal and it was definitely a shot. However, Tuncay nearly gets on the end of said shot to tap it in and, as Fuller notices him do that, he tries to make out it was a pass. It wasn&apos;t though. And we all know it. In Scotland, Celtic have just been awarded a penalty and have missed it. In the snooker it&apos;s Higgins 2-1 O&apos;Sullivan.  2.14pm: Salif Diao is off Glenn Whelan is on. Scharner, has been carded for a ludicrous tackle that could have earned him a red. Meanwhile, if you&apos;ve been wondering where Gary Naylor is - and how can you not be? - he&apos;s in Azerbaijan. God knows why. Still, he&apos;s not forgotten us: &quot;Greetings from the shores of the Caspian Sea, where I am drinking excellentAzerbaijani beer and following news from home. I&apos;m also about the rightdistance from Stamford Bridge considering Everton&apos;s chances. I&apos;ve a free day inBaku tomorrow, so do MBMers have any advice as to how to spend it?,&quot; he asks.  2.16pm: Birmingham v West Ham team newsBirmingham: Hart, Carr, Roger Johnson, Dann, Ridgewell, Larsson, Ferguson, Bowyer, McFadden, Jerome, Benitez.

Referee: Chris Foy (Merseyside)  2.22pm: Etherington plays in a brilliant cross to Whelan. The winger was halfway inside the Wigan half when he curled the ball to the penalty spot. Whelan, stretching, couldn&apos;t get his shot on target, though. Should have done better. A minute later, Tuncay fires another shot at goal which probably would have gone in but for the toe of Scharner, who puts in a block which takes the ball over the cross bar.  2.23pm GOAL! And what a goal! Figueroa scores a quick free kick from the halfway line!  2.24pm: He spotted Sorenson off his line and, while everyone had their back turned, he just hoofed it goalwards, neatly looping the ball over the keeper. It was so casual! A brilliant goal and Wigan&apos;s first shot on target in the second half. Stoke 1-2 Wigan.  2.25pm: Stoke are level! Stoke 2-2 Wigan. Shawcross attacks a corner and heads it into the back of the net. Kirkland came out and flapped in no man&apos;s land, leaving his goal completely empty. Shawcross has the simplest of tasks and just tucks the ball home.  2.27pm: Andy Wilkinson just puts in the mother of all reducers on Mario Melchiot and somehow only gets a yellow for it. That was a nasty, studs-up lunge and, really, he should be off.In Scotland, Fortune has come on as a sub for Celtic and immediately fired the ball into the top corner.

That was a fantastic delivery that deserved more.  2.32pm: &quot;Good to see Fergie entering into the spirit of the season despite his injury worries,&quot; writes Ian Copestake. &quot;Your photo is of the Manchester United Christmas party at which the team finally met its new back four, right?&quot; James Beattie is coming on and Fuller must be the man to come off. He&apos;s just made another hash of things, a feat he followed up by planting the ball onto the face of some poor chap in Row Z.  2.35pm: A recommendation for Gary Naylor. One that he&apos;d do well to take note of, too, given the nature of the second sentence. &quot;After spending three years on Baku I can recommend O&apos;Reilly&apos;s all day English breakfast,&quot; writes a man known only as &apos;Bing&apos;. &quot;I would advise you to stay away from the Whore Ship in the docks for obvious reasons.&quot;  2.37pm: At the Britannia Stadium, it&apos;s getting a touch frantic as both teams battle to get the winner. Both teams could get one too, the way things are going. Though, to be strict, if both teams get a winner, neither of them will actually be winners, but you know what I&apos;m saying. I hope.  2.40pm: PENALTY! But it shouldn&apos;t have been. Gomez is a mile offside, but gets brought down by Huth as the Wigan player ran onto a through-ball. The foul deserved a penalty, but since Gomez was offside, it shouldn&apos;t have been given. Rodallega ambles up to the ball, pauses, then rolls the ball gently at Sorensen, who saves with a look of utter derision at Rodallega&apos;s effort.  2.43pm: Wigan have gone shot-crazy. They have had three good efforts from a variety of distances, all dealt with well by the Stoke defence. This game is actually quite exciting. Perhaps because the quality is a little low but the frenzy is high.  2.46pm: How have Wigan not scored? Utterly frantically, they&apos;ve been lashing the ball goalwards at every chance and, have just been awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area that could have been another penalty. They hit three further shots - all blocked - and the referee brings what became an exciting game to a close. Stoke City 2-2 Wigan Athletic.  2.51pm: Some predictions gleaned from the assorted hacks lounging around the sports desk. The person who gets the most right - on a three points for predicting the correct score, one point for predicting the correct result (win, lose or draw) - stands to win all of the sweepstake pot. The sweepstake jackpot stands at \u00a38. That&apos;s eight whole pounds. That&apos;ll more than triple my wages for the day. In alphabetical order ...

He probably has it booked already but I thought I&apos;d email just in case,&quot; adds Kevin O&apos;Connor. Meanwhile Elliot Jacobs has emailed in something very funny, which I can&apos;t print. I&apos;m not sure my potential \u00a38 winnings will cover the legal fees. It was very funny though.  2.58pm: Everton&apos;s supporters are a worried bunch. Here&apos;s Damon McMenamin: &quot;In a bar in Tokyo at the moment with the Everton supporters club. There must be 50 worried Toffees here hoping they won&apos;t come unstuck.&quot; While Mavis Cruet, who has the sort of name that should grace either a Dickens novel or a Disney film, asks: &quot;David Moyes is trying to pen back Chelsea&apos;s maraudering wingers with a 4-4-2. Stroke of genius or about to leave us short in the middle and getting spanked? Any thoughts?&quot;  Spanked.  2.59pm: Some news that I&apos;ve nicked off the wires. David Beckham says he wants to play at the 2014 World Cup, despite the fact he&apos;s not exactly guaranteed a spot at the 2010 one. &quot;The 2014 World Cup? We&apos;ll see,&quot; he said in an interview with the Italian magazine Sportsweek. &quot;I&apos;d like to play until I&apos;m 40 and take part in another World Cup, but at this age you have to evaluate things year after year.&quot; Good luck.  3.03pm: For no other reason than a goalflash has just popped up and I&apos;ve had to read the team name twice to make sure, is there any more ridiculous a football club moniker than Technogroup Welshpool. They&apos;re currently 2-1 down at Rhyl, and they deserve to be if they&apos;re going to go around thinking that&apos;s an acceptable thing to call a football club. In the snooker, Higgins has fought back from 38 points down to, erm, 34 points down in the fifth frame but can go on and win it from here.  3.04pm: GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Wolves. Kevin Doyle with the goal in the third minute. That means Scott Murray is the only person who can win that game in our Race To Eight Quid predictions game. Rhyl are now 3-1 up against Technogroup Welshpool. Good.  3.06pm: Fulham&apos;s Damien Duff tries to chip the Burnley keeper but gets it wrong, next Nevland tries to beat Jensen but The Beast denies him too.  3.07pm: Higgins has won that frame, he&apos;s now 4-1 up against O&apos;Sullivan, who really should have won there.  3.08pm: Newcastle are a goal up against Barnsley, Kevin Nolan put the ball away in the sixth minute. In the Premier League at the KC Stadium, Samba has just hit one over the bar as Blackburn travel to Hull.  3.09pm: A chance for Everton: Jo got on the end of a cross and gave Petr Cech a worrying moment. The Chelsea keeper manages to claim the ball though.  3.11pm: &quot;Did you know that Setanta still exists here in Canada?&quot; emails Mike de Vries in, erm, Canada. &quot;It also happens to be the only way to get an interesting match on television. Mind you in order to actually watch the channel you have to order the Super Extreme Maximum Package and then pay about $15 for Setanta on top of that. Being of more modest means I&apos;m forced to watch whatever match the less-than-premium sports channel can scrounge up. Today its Bolton v City. Less than exciting. With that said I&apos;m depending entirely on yourself to keep me updated on the more interesting matches.&quot; I thought Bolton v City was the interesting match. Well, that and Rhyl v Technogroup Welshpool.  3.13pm: GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 Everton. Saha gets above Carvalho and nods it onto the post, from where it bounces out and onto Petr Cech&apos;s back and goes into the goal. A slightly silly own goal, then.  3.14pm: GOAL! Klasnic has just scored from an offside position for Bolton against Manchester City. Bolton 1-0 Manchester City.  3.16pm: The three early goals in the Premier League mean that our predictions, basically, are now all nonsense. Only Scott Murray can get three points from the Spurs v Wolves game, while only Paolo Bandini can get three points at Bolton v Manchester City. Oh dear.  3.17pm: Everton are playing very well at Stamford Bridge. David Moyes&apos;s decision to use two men up front seems to have caught Chelsea by surprise and Jo and Saha are causing the defence plenty of problems. Drogba has looked good too, though, which could be ominous. Well, if you&apos;re an Everton fan.  3.18pm: GOAL! Drogba scores. Chelsea 1-1 Everton. Lampard laid the ball off on the edge of the box and, on the spin, the Ivorian slams the ball home.  3.19pm: A rival silly football club name for Technogroup Welshpool: Elements Cefn Druids.  3.20pm: Here&apos;s Paul Doyle at Stamford Bridge, in an email he sent before Drogba&apos;s equaliser: &quot;So Chelsea have conceded form a set-piece yet again,&quot; reports Paul Doyle form Stamdford Bridge. &quot;But that hasn&apos;t been their only failing so far \u2013 their amorphous midfield has been bettered by the visitors, for whom Fellaini and Rodwell have so far been excellent in the centre and Pienaar, on the right, is continually pegging Ashley Cole back.&quot; Meanwhile, Ballack nearly earns a penalty for Chelsea but the referee decides not to give it.  3.22pm: Here&apos;s something you can take down the pub with you tonight: The fastest goal in England was scored by Jonathan Stead (Ipswich) against Blackpool after 0 minutes and 31 seconds. You won&apos;t make many friends with that news, but you can still say it anyway.  3.24pm: GOAL! Chelsea 2-1 Everton. Anelka prods the ball into the top of the net. In irony news, Shaun Wright-Phillips has just had to go off for Manchester City after getting a good clobbering in a heavy tackle. Irony, of course, because it&apos;s the diminuitive winger who may find himself on the end of a lawsuit for his part in the injury suffered by Dean Ashton, caused - so the striker reckons - from a challenge by Wright-Phillips.  3.25pm: GOAL! Dent scores for Sunderland, lashing the ball into the back of the net and past Portsmouth&apos;s David James - but in the reverse order. Sunderland 1-0 Portsmouth.  3.30pm: GOAL! Bolton 1-1 Manchester City. Carlos Tevez scores a wonderful goal. He hits the ball really well and, after it takes it a slight deflection, there&apos;s little Jaaskelainen can do about it.  3.31pm: Higgins is now 5-1 up and Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan is now &quot;getting a right hot funk on,&quot; according to the man they&apos;re calling the new Clive Everton, Scott Murray.  3.33pm: Here&apos;s our man Stuart James at St Andrews, where Birmingham are all over West Ham. &quot;Quite a rare sight here - St Andrew&apos;s looks to be close to full. With lower ticket prices and a run of six matches without defeat Birmingham have managed to rouse the disillusioned. Let&apos;s just hope they&apos;ve not turned out to see a goal feast. There have been fewer goals scored at St Andrew&apos;s this season than any other Premier League ground and the way this game is going that statistic is not under threat today.&quot;  3.35pm: &quot;Just noticed something about this season&apos;s fixture list. All teams are now playing at home for two games and then away for two games as opposed to the traditional one and one. With your immense footie knowledge do you know why this is?&quot; asks Anthony O&apos;Connell. Do I know why it is? I didn&apos;t even know it was true. As for immense footie knowledge. If I had that, do you think I&apos;d be here chopping this nonsense out, rather than, say, doing something useful with my time. O&apos;Sullivan has gone into snooker meltdown, incidentally. He&apos;s now 6-1 down against Higgins.  3.37pm: Tottenham get a good chance against Wolves but fail to tuck it away. They haven&apos;t had much of the play, there, which is a surprise. Burnley v Fulham is all huff and puff and little action, while Hull v Blackburn is much the same. Which isn&apos;t a surprise.  3.38pm: Some match reports for you: here&apos;s Glenn Gibbons at Motherwell 2-3 Celtic and here&apos;s freezing cold Mikey Stafford at Stoke City 2-2 Wigan Athletic and he has news of that terrific Figueroa goal.  3.39pm: Disneyland might want to reconsider their decision to twin their theme park with Swindon. They&apos;re 3-0 down against Bristol Rovers. Manchester City are getting on top of Bolton now, while Chelsea are apparently all over Everton.  3.41pm: Stephen Hunt sidefoots the ball at Paul Robinson&apos;s goal as Hull take on Blackburn, but he doesn&apos;t hit the ball with enough power and the former England keeper makes a good save - something he&apos;s had do a few times so far this half. It&apos;s still Hull City 0-0 Blackburn.  3.43pm: &quot;I am really angry now!!!!&quot; emails Duncan Melville, whose finger has apparently gone into spasm over the exclamation mark. &quot;Silly names is it? Cefn Druids, silly? Cefn Druids are a well established team and their history of winning the Welsh Cup eight times!!! Respect Man!&quot; Yeah, but they&apos;re not called Cefn Druids, are they? They&apos;re called Elements Cefn Druids. Which is a silly name.  3.46pm: GOAL! Bolton 2-1 Manchester City. A ridiculously curling shot from Gary Cahill, which appeared to be going wide until the last minute ... when it crept inside the top corner. Some quick Heineken Cup news: Ospreys have hammered Viadana, winning 62-7.  At White Hart Line, Huddlestone has just missed a decent chance for Spurs, while Defoe has had a good shot blocked.  3.47pm: Birmingham should be a goal up. Ridgewell played in a very good ball, which Cameron Jerome spanked over the bar when it was easier to score than miss. One goal against West Ham, you sense, could see the London club&apos;s metaphorical wheels falling off.  3.48pm: GOAL! Bolton 2-2 Manchester City. Micah Richards makes use of Bellamy and Adebayor&apos;s approach work to score like a striker. &quot;I don&apos;t understand what I&apos;m seeing in City,&quot; reckons Mike de Vries, admittedly before that last City goal. &quot;City look better than Bolton which isn&apos;t saying much but I just think they play like a team of decently talented strangers. They don&apos;t seem to be have any idea what their teammates are going to do. Not sure about the formation either: Adebayor wide right, Bellamy out left and Tevez playing somewhere between the &apos;D&apos; and the centre circle.&quot; It&apos;s half-time there now.  3.50pm: It&apos;s half time at the Stadium Of Light, where Sunderland are leading 1-0 against Portsmouth, who don&apos;t have a striker who has scored away from home this season. As the referee blows his whistle at St Andrews, it&apos;s Birmingham 0-0 West Ham.  3.52pm: GOAL! Chelsea 2-2 Everton. Jo has had to come off injured and he&apos;s been replaced by Yakubu. He attacks a corner and knocks the ball home. Chelsea are just dreadful at set-pieces this season.  3.52pm: Those Premier League half time scores for you: Birmingham 0-0 West HamBolton 2-2 Manchester CityBurnley 0-0 FulhamChelsea 2-2 EvertonHull City 0-0 Blackburn RoversSunderland 1-0 PortsmouthTottenham Hotspur 0-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers  3.57pm: Here&apos;s the latest in the Race To Eight Quid: Scott Murray: 3 pointsGregg Roughley: 3 pointsPaolo Bandini: 2 pointsTom Bryant: 2 points Our heads are all hung in shame.  3.58pm: Paul Doyle at Chelsea v Everton has this to say: &quot;Everton&apos;s players seemed overcome with indifference when Jo hobbled off injured a moment ago, but the Brazilian&apos;s replacement, Yakubu, is clearly more popular. He scored with his first touch (well, his second, since his first touch was to tee up his own shot) - what&apos;s more I reckon that&apos;s not the last goal Everton will get this afternoon - Chelsea&apos;s inability to defend balls into the box has had Carlo Ancelotti shaking his head forlornly for much of this half. It&apos;s one thing being beaten in the air by Fellaini, but Terry and Carvahlo are also being regularly outjumped by Saha, who&apos;s performing brilliantly.&quot;  3.59pm: &quot;Re. 3.46pm: &apos;A ridiculously curling shot from Gary Cahill, which appeared to be going wide until the last minute ...&apos; The last minute? Just how slow was the ball moving?&quot; asks Sean Moore. Very slowly Sean. It defied science. Like that Roberto Carlos free-kick, only in slowness, rather than bendiness.  4.05pm: &quot;Defence on set pieces had ALWAYS been a problem at Milan when Ancelotti was in charge ... no surprise at all that it&apos;s still a problem at Chelsea,&quot; reckons Simone Dozio. Paolo Bandini, our resident Italian football expert says, &quot;Hmmm, not really.&quot;  4.06pm: Benitez scores for Birmingham but neglects to heed the offside law, so it is ruled out.  4.09pm: &quot;Defending against set-plays has never been worse,&quot; writes Gary Naylor in Baku. &quot;Is that because teams spend what little time they have between matches training and not practising? I&apos;m always irked when footballers say, in amazement, of some deadball merchant, &apos;He&apos;d spend the whole afternoon practising free kicks!&apos; Why don&apos;t the others spend the whole afternoon practising defending free kicks?&quot; He makes a good point. My only worry is that, I&apos;m now not sure that Chelsea did concede from a corner. I only caught it out of the corner oy my eye, and it may just have been a run of the mill cross. Apologies. But then you don&apos;t come here for accuracy do you? You do? Oh.  4.11pm: GOAL! Bobby Zamora scores! No news on the celebration though. Let&apos;s hope it&apos;s a good one. That makes it Burnley 0-1 Fulham, news that has been welcomed by all in the Race For Eight Quid.  4.12pm: GOAL! Lee Bowyer gets on the end of Benitez&apos;s through ball. One-on-one with the keeper, he slips it past the keeper for his sixth of the season. Birmingham 1-0 West Ham. In Scotland, Rangers are killing St Johnstone, they&apos;re winning 3-0.  4.12pm: &quot;Re. Stoke&apos;s Santa,&quot; emails Luke Carlisle. &quot;Is that not Mike Ashley?&quot;  4.13pm: Here&apos;s Paul Doyle to put me out of my corner/cross misery at Stamford Bridge. &quot;Let me bring you some clarity. Everton&apos;s second goal came not from a corner, but a long throw-in.&quot;  4.14pm: GOAL!Klasnic scores again for Bolton. It&apos;s now Bolton 3-2 Manchester City. Who in their right mind would have predicted that? And it looks as though there are more goal on the way there.  4.16pm: Pity the lot of a poor football writer. You can just feel Stuart James&apos;s misery at St Andrews. &quot;The half-time food (cold tomato soup) is as bad as the football,&quot; he writes. There&apos;s something seething about the sentence.  4.17pm: Dempsey&apos;s shot for Fulham is cleared off the line, and Burnley are being tormented by Damien Duff, who is beginning to rediscover those legs that seemed to have deserted him at Newcastle.  4.18pm: Newcastle concede at last, it&apos;s Barnsley 1-1 Newcastle, after a goal from Emil Hallfredsson.  4.20pm: GOAL! Burnley 1-1 Fulham, Elliot sidefoots the ball home and that comes as good news to everyone in the Race To Eight Quid.  4.21pm: &quot;Has Roque Santa Cruz yet appeared in a match for Man City?&quot; asks Gene Salorio. &quot;Was Hughes so adamant about buying him - for what was it, something like \u00a318m - just to make sure that no one else got him? Or because Santa Cruz looks so decorative in a City kit on the bench?&quot; Off the top of my head, he&apos;s made one league start and one league cup start this season, scoring the sum total of no goals. Money well-spent then.  4.23pm: GOAL! Chelsea 3-2 Everton. Drogba delivers again. Pienaar went so sleep and Drogba pounced to score his 18th - 18th - of the season.  4.24pm: Take this, Stuart James. &quot;Since St Andrews is renowned for its cuisine I suspect Stuart James is eating gazpacho,&quot; writes John Lee. I beg to differ. The last (and only) time I went there - admittedly in a swanky, hospitality suite courtesy of some very nice people whose intentions in inviting are still not clear in my head - I was served soggy veggie sausages and fried eggs. While there&apos;s nothing wrong with a fry-up, I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s haute-cuisine.  4.25pm: &quot;Re. Gene Salorio at 4.21pm: I would choose the latter. He looks very svelte indeed in their black kit. Good thing he won&apos;t be getting it dirty,&quot; writes Mike de Vries. &quot;The Bolton v City match is turning into a good one. Lots of chances. Embarassing defending. Great stuff.&quot;  4.27pm: GOAL! Chelsea 3-3 Everton. Another mistake from Cech, who didn&apos;t come out when he should have done. Drogba tried to clear the ball instead, but cleared it into Saha&apos;s head, who steered the ball home.  4.27pm: Craig Bellamy has been sent off, though reports suggest he shouldn&apos;t have been. It was for a second yellow, given to him for diving when, perhaps, it should have been given the other way.  4.28pm: The latest in the Race To Eight QuidMurray: 6 pointsRoughley: 4 pointsBryant and Bandini: 3 points  4.29pm: Blackburn have just had three good efforts saved but they are yet to make the breakthrough.  4.29pm: &quot;You probably didn&apos;t need to see that to know that it came from another high ball into the box,&quot; says Paul Doyle of Everton&apos;s latest equaliser. &quot;Heitinga&apos;s freekick, Saha again eluded all the defenders, Cech flapped, and Ancelotti turned to his assistants to perform his now familiar head-shaking routine. Either he&apos;s listening to Type O Negative on invisible headphones, or he realises this can&apos;t-head-balls-clear lark has become a chronic problem.&quot;  4.30pm: &quot;Are Rangers really &apos;killing&apos; St Johnstone?&quot; asks Craig Alexander. &quot;As a Saints fan of 30 years but with no real means of seeing them these days you have me somewhat concerned. I thought that Rangers fans just stuck to spitting on away supporters or if we were lucky having pies and Bovril lobbed at us. Has Rangers&apos; plight finally registered with their fans such that they&apos;re resorting to more drastic measures?&quot;  Erm, yes, slight exaggeration. Sorry.  4.32pm: West Ham are beginning to make Birmingham worry. Dyer is on and he&apos;s having an impact. &quot;Re. Luke Carlisle wondering if Mike Ashley was Santa,&quot; emails Barry Walsh. &quot;Surely if Mike Ashley was Santa then Rudolph would be re-branded Rudolph the Coca-Cola sponsored red nosed reindeer.&quot;  4.33pm: &quot;I note from your photo that Ken Bates hasn&apos;t mellowed with age,&quot; chortles Gary Naylor.  4.37pm: For a day that looked like it was going to be quiet, there are quite a few stories here. Not least is the Craig Bellamy sending off. I think he may have been given his first yellow card in the tunnel for having an ill-advised moan to the referee. Don&apos;t quote me on that, mind. His second yellow, however, sounds like it may have been debatable. Meanwhile, at Chelsea, Petr Cech seems to have lost his confidence again. He doesn&apos;t know whether to come out, stay back, claim or punch at the moment. He&apos;s never really been the same since that clonk on the head, has he? Perhaps he might benefit from some time on the bench.  4.39pm: GOAL! Bolton 3-3 Manchester City. Another goal from Tevez, struck from 25 yards out to score his eighth of the season. Sensational stuff at the Reebok. Meanwhile, Noble has been sent off for West Ham, and that should mean Birmingham take control at St Andrews.  4.42pm: The scoreline at White Hart Line could be yet another story today if Wolves can hold out, it&apos;s still Tottenham 0-1 Woves. Notts County, fresh from being bought out by Peter Trembling today, have just pulled a goal back against Accrington Stanley. They&apos;re 1-2 down.  4.43pm: In the race to be shown last on Match Of The Day, the Hull v Blackburn game is well ahead in the running. To be honest, that sounds like exceptionally dull stuff.  4.43pm: Re. Bellamy&apos;s first yellow: &quot;The commentator said he received the first yellow at the centre circle after Bolton&apos;s second goal,&quot; emails Chris, from Maryland, helpfully.  4.46pm: As Ian Copestake has just pointed out, there could be eight draws in the Premier League today. Just one goal at each of Sunderland v Portsmouth, Spurs v Wolves and Birmingham v West Ham could make that happen. &quot;What are the odds on that?&quot; he says.  4.47pm: Cameron Jerome gets through, one-on-one with West Ham&apos;s Robert Green. He slots the ball neatly past the keeper ... and wide of the posts. A brilliant chance missed. Chelsea are piling the pressure on Everton, while City, despite being a man down, are doing the same against Bolton. Can Everton hang on?  4.49pm: Joleon Lescott gets a chance for City (who have welcomed Santa Cruz onto the pitch) but swivels and hits fresh air. Meanwhile Crouch has just had a chance for Spurs against Wolves, where there are a mammoth six minutes of extra time.  4.50pm: The snooker semi-final, which I&apos;d forgotten about to be honest, closed at the break with Higgins leading O&apos;Sullivan 6-2.  4.52pm: In the Championship, Barnsley have equalised, it&apos;s now Barnsley 2-2 Newcastle. At Stamford Bridge, with two minutes of normal time remaining, the home side can&apos;t find a way through. Everton are defending doggedly. Is this the start of the Chelsea decline? They could be in trouble if it is, given how many players they will lose to the African Cup Of Nations.  4.53pm: Result: Burnley 1-1 Fulham.  4.54pm: Everton scramble the danger away as Chelsea pile on the pressure at Stamford Bridge. The defending is desperate but effective.  4.55pm: GOAL! Sunderland 1-1 Portsmouth. Younis Kaboul scores in the dying seconds. He rips off his shirt, is given his second yellow, and gets sent off immediately. Dramatic stuff.  4.56pm: Saha has taken a knock at Stamford Bridge and he&apos;ll need to be subbed, which could lead to extended extra-time. Meanwhile Wolves have beaten Spus, the result there is Tottenham 0-1 Wolves. It&apos;s finished Bolton 3-3 Manchester City.  4.56pm: Lampard drills the ball just wide at Stamford Bridge! That was very, very close.  4.57pm: It&apos;s finished Sunderland 1-1 Portsmouth. That must be sickening for Sunderland&apos;s fans. They were cruising until that last minute equaliser.  4.57pm: Here&apos;s Stuart James at Birmingham: &quot;Some players are able to hide their emotions, never revealing their inner torment, and then there are people like Alessandro Diamanti. The Italian, pulling a face that suggested he was close to tears, ripped his shirt down the middle after seeing a free-kick flash inches over the crossbar. Brilliant.&quot;  4.59pm: It&apos;s all over at Stamford Bridge. Injury-hit Everton have held Chelsea to a 3-3 draw, and Chelsea have dropped their first home points of the season. Manchester United, if they score a few past Aston Villa, could go to the top of the table.  5.00pm: &quot;What is it with all this shirt tossing and ripping? Are they made of hair?&quot; asks Ian Copestake.  5.01pm: The game at St Andrews has finished, and Birmingham claim a 1-0 win over West Ham to continue their impressive form. They&apos;re now sitting just behind Liverpool, on the same amount of points, in the league.  5.07pm: Well, what a day. What started out as an unpromising fixture list has thrown up a host of stories. There was Figueroa&apos;s incredible halfway line goal in the Stoke v Wigan match, Chelsea find themselves entering a slump and should perhaps have genuine concerns over Petr Cech, while Everton can be extremely proud of themselves. To come away with a point at Stamford Bridge is impressive enough, but to score three with such a depleted squad is a fantastic result.  Manchester City, too, proved there&apos;s some grit there. To come back from a goal down, with ten men, to earn a 3-3 draw is encouraging for them. It&apos;s bad news for Bolton though, after scoring three times against City, they should really have expected to win.  5.09pm: The Race To Eight Quid is, frankly, an embarrassment for all concerned. Roughley and Murray share the pot but not with any glory. The final standings: Murray, Roughley: 3 pointsBandini, Bryant: 2 points We&apos;re all off to have a good long think about our careers.  5.10pm: I&apos;m off. Thanks for all your emails. You can follow Manchester United&apos;s inevitable win over Aston Villa with Scott Murray here."}, {"sentences": ["That&apos;s the situation at the moment.&quot; Giggs, who has been at United for 19 years, had a question mark raised over his future last season when Sir Alex Ferguson talked about phasing out some of the more senior players following the Club World Cup victory in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Ryan Giggs", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-14T20:08:25Z", "title": "Ryan Giggs hungry for a 20th season with Manchester United", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/14/ryan-giggs-united-bbc-sports-personality", "article": "Ryan Giggs says he is hungrier than ever for success and intends to stay at Manchester United. The 36-year-old believes he is in the best form of his career and spelled out how much more he wants to achieve after winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. When the Welshman collected the prize in Sheffield on Sunday he was still feeling the pain of United&apos;s home defeat by Aston Villa the previous day. He believes that underlines he is far from ready for retirement. &quot;I&apos;m hungrier [now],&quot; he said. &quot;I was sat there, obviously taking everything in \u2013 the ceremony \u2013 but still thinking about the defeat. It still hurts that we got beat. So if it&apos;s still hurting you, you&apos;ve still got that desire, so I&apos;ll carry on. That&apos;s the situation at the moment.&quot; Giggs, who has been at United for 19 years, had a question mark raised over his future last season when Sir Alex Ferguson talked about phasing out some of the more senior players following the Club World Cup victory in Tokyo. But continued to prove his worth and the manager said last week that Giggs and Paul Scholes would be offered deal for 2010-11. &quot; Over the last two or three years it&apos;s been quite relaxed, around this time of year we start talking,&quot; Giggs said. &quot;If I&apos;ve been playing well and I still want to carry on and the club want to sign me it&apos;s normally been quite relaxed.Hopefully that will be the case this year. It&apos;s nice to be wanted and obviously they know I don&apos;t want to be going anywhere else, I want to be ending my career at United. As long as I&apos;m enjoying it, and getting picked and the desire&apos;s still there then I&apos;ll carry on.&quot; Giggs says he was surprised by the BBC award and the Professional Footballers&apos; Association player of the year award he received last season. &quot;You expect to win things when you&apos;re a lot younger, and supposedly in your glory days, but I&apos;m probably playing the best I&apos;ve ever played at the moment and I&apos;m enjoying it more, which I think probably shows.&quot; Do the individual awards rival the trophies won with United? &quot;Winning the Premiership, you can&apos;t beat that because it&apos;s so difficult, and you&apos;re expected to win it with United. But this is an individual award, and the PFA award, I think this is more special because I&apos;m 36. You don&apos;t expect to win awards when you&apos;re at the end of your career.&quot; He credited Ferguson for continuing to have faith in him: &quot;He&apos;s helped me a lot as a manager, he&apos;s known me from such a young age.

The German Christmas market, of which there are more than 2,500 examples in Germany itself, has now gone global. Stroll through Tokyo or Chicago at this time of year and you are likely to encounter a string of wooden huts and stalls selling Germanic delicacies and knick-knacks. For several years it has been the same in Britain too, nowhere more so than in Birmingham, whose very own Frankfurt Christmas market has exploded from 25 stalls in 2001 to a record 180 this year, attracting 2.8 million visitors last year. Every year more British cities jump aboard \u2013 this year Hull, Northampton and Solihull. Not every market is a success, however. Bradford&apos;s has closed early this year, and Wakefield has just scrapped its market. All of which carries an obvious lesson. If you want a proper German Christmas market go to Germany itself. Cologne, Dresden, Nuremberg and Munich are well regarded, but there are dozens of others to choose from \u2013 many of them just a train ride away.

Graphic for MPs' expenses interactive. Photograph: guardian.co.uk    \u2022 Sinn F\u00e9in&apos;s Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness both claimed \u00a321,600 each \u2013 \u00a31,800 a month \u2013 in mortgage interest payments on a two-bedroom London flat in 2008-09. All Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refuse to take their seats at Westminster because they would be required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. The three other Sinn F\u00e9in MPs \u2013 Pat Doherty, Michelle Gildernew and Conor Murphy \u2013 also claimed \u00a31,800 per month each for a townhouse they share. \u2022 Adam Afriyie, Conservative MP for Windsor, and Richard Benyon, Conservative MP for Newbury, claimed nothing. \u2022 Bob Ainsworth, the defence secretary, submitted \u00a31.70 and \u00a31.98 claims for two electricity bills. The latter showed that a third bill was \u00a31.79. \u2022 Douglas Alexander, the international development secretary, claimed for a chimney sweep at a cost of \u00a3105. \u2022 Graham Allen, MP for Nottingham North, has a note on his form saying mobile phones are not allowed. A reduction in his &quot;telephone and telecommunications&quot; claim is written in. He also submitted a \u00a36,350 estimate for carpets. An additional piece of correspondence explains his London flat has not been recarpeted for the 14 years he has lived there (&quot;and probably much longer&quot;) and says that he will be submitting a claim of \u00a33,420, based on what he understands to be an allowance of \u00a330 per square metre under the expenses system. &quot;Let me know if this is regarded as reasonable, acceptable and wholly within the parliamentary rules,&quot; he finishes.   \u2022 David Amess&apos;s bathroom suite and ceiling suffered water damage and were replaced at a cost of \u00a33,663. A note on the Tory MP for Southend West&apos;s claim form said approximately \u00a31,000 would come from insurance. He later refunded \u00a3700 from this claim to the Commons. \u2022 Michael Ancram, the multi-millionaire former Conservative party chairman and ex-deputy leader, claimed \u00a3139.50 for the cost of his TV licence. He also claimed for a septic tank to be emptied twice (at a cost of \u00a3103 and \u00a3105 respectively), \u00a32,000 of cleaning costs, an annual security maintenance (\u00a3931.80), an annual service of a fire alarm (\u00a3299.75), &quot;renewal&quot; of glass window panes (\u00a339.43) and \u00a31,197.92 worth of oil. The Devizes MP&apos;s 2008-09 claim was reduced by \u00a3380.44 because some of the direct debits used to pay an electricity bill related to the 2007-08 expenses year. He also did not claim for a routine service on his swimming pool boiler. \u2022 Janet Anderson, MP for Rossendale and Darwen, claimed \u00a31,899 for redecoration, \u00a3596.60 for dry cleaning and \u00a3624.50 for garden maintenance. She claimed \u00a3749 for the redecoration of her hall, stairs and landing, \u00a3750 for painting and decorating three rooms, \u00a3150 for painting her back door, and \u00a3250 on repairing and painting the bathroom ceiling. A further \u00a3350 maintenance bill for &quot;other repairs and maintenance&quot;, which was queried, was later broken down into repairing a light fitting (\u00a3150), materials (\u00a3105) and paintwork (\u00a395). She also claimed \u00a31,086.75 for a &quot;drain doctor&quot; to unblock a drain and \u00a3690 on a structural survey of the gable wall. \u2022 James Arbuthnot, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, claimed \u00a343.56 for three garlic peeling and cutting fourpiece sets, bought from the shopping channel QVC. He claimed \u00a36,630 for cleaning and \u00a310,199.01 for service/maintenance, which included items such as opening up fireplaces in the bedroom and dining room, painting his summer house and &quot;tree works&quot; . But not all the claims appear to have been paid, as a \u00a32,528.24 claim covering three months from the start of June has been crossed out with &quot;more info&quot; written beside it. And on the claim for the following four month period, \u00a33,568.56 has been crossed out and replaced with \u00a32,334.52. A \u00a31165 claim for shingle on his driveway had a note attached to it saying there were insufficient funds to pay it. He also maxed out on a \u00a31,232.16 claim for &quot;fencing around paddock&quot;. In October, Arbuthnot offered to pay back \u00a313,486 after the audit by Sir Thomas Legg deemed him to have made excessive claims, including for the cleaning of a swimming pool.   \u2022 Charlotte Atkins, MP for Staffordshire Moorlands, claimed a total of \u00a37,470 on renovations from April 2008 to March 2009. She claimed \u00a34,420 in April 2008 on decorating the hall landing, stairs, sitting room and bathroom. In June she spent \u00a31,143 on fitting carpets and \u00a31,177 for new curtains. In February she claimed 2009, \u00a3730 for repairing and polishing a Victorian floor. \u2022 Norman Baker, the Lib Dem MP for Lewes who lobbied for more transparency on expenses, has been caught out for repeatedly late utility bill payments. He was threatened with court action if he did not pay his outstanding bill of \u00a3206.44 within two weeks. The MP received overdue gas and electricity bill notices from EDF energy in May 2008 and November 2008, as well as the final demand letter from Thames Water in October 2008. Between April 2008 and April 2009, Baker claimed \u00a318,459.96 for his rented London home, as well as \u00a31,359 on food, \u00a3198.41 on phone bills and \u00a3318.77 on broadband internet. He also claimed for \u00a3241 spent on newspapers. \u2022 Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper, the married couple in the cabinet, jointly claimed in the 2008-09 financial year \u00a31,889 for council tax, \u00a3900 for electricity, \u00a3299 for an alarm system and \u00a3364 for water. They divided the cost between them. Due to the fall in interest rates through the year they were initially paid more than they were entitled for their mortgage, but in May 2009 they each repaid the small surplus of \u00a31,350. \u2022 Billericay MP John Baron included a \u00a310 Christmas tip to his gardener in his expenses claim. \u2022 Sir Stuart Bell, MP for Middlesbrough and Labour member of the House of Commons members&apos; estimates committee, claimed \u00a329,033.56 on his second home in Westminster between April 2008 and June 2009 with a monthly food bill of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400. He put in two claims for his March expenses, one on ACA and one on PAAE, the second of which was refused except for a Virgin media bill for which he submitted a receipt. He also claimed \u00a3139.50 for a TV licence. In December 2005, he claimed \u00a3750 for food, but it was reduced to the maximum monthly allowance of \u00a3400. \u2022 Margaret Beckett, the former foreign secretary, submitted a bill for \u00a37,851.79, including a gas service of \u00a3463.60 and an insurance bill of \u00a31,391.74 on her Derby home. Her food bill for the year was \u00a31,650. The Derby South MP claimed nothing for her personal additional accommodation expenditure for April-June 2009. She had made a \u00a3600 claim for hanging baskets and pot plants in the last expense row, and dismissed it as a &quot;mistake&quot; even although her expenses showed she had made three similar claims previously. \u2022 Joe Benton, Labour MP for Bootle, paid \u00a319.99 for &quot;product support&quot; on a \u00a359.99 vacuum cleaner. \u2022 John Bercow, the Speaker, flipped the location of his second home from London to his Buckingham constituency in April. He had previously claimed about \u00a31,430 a month on mortgage costs at his London home as well as a service charge of about \u00a3440. His office it was because his children had entered full-time education in London. It was the second time he is known to have flipped. \u2022 Hazel Blears, former communities secretary and Labour MP for Salford, claimed a total of \u00a317,672.85 on her Islington property between April 2008 and April 2009. She had her claim for \u00a35,550 for April to June cut to \u00a34,261 due to a lack of receipts for utilities, council tax, phone bills and cleaning. She spent \u00a3200 a month on food, rising to \u00a3300 from December. December and January&apos;s totals have been scored out with the letters HAB or MAB next to them. Blears came under fire last year for not paying capital gains tax on a property she sold despite having told the commons it was her second home. She has since agreed to pay the tax. \u2022 David Blunkett and Sir Alan Haselhurst both claimed \u00a3100 for logs. \u2022 Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP for Reigate, submitted a \u00a3400 claim to repair a water wheel at his Surrey home in January this year. According to the invoice, the builders were told to &quot;rebuild walls to old water wheel structure&quot;, &quot;repoint low level areas as agreed to house&quot; and &quot;leave the job tidy&quot;. The same builders were paid \u00a3680 to rebuild his fireplace and &quot;replace 19 existing air bricks with new Eco Coverage air bricks&quot;. He also claimed \u00a3113 for a &quot;power digger&quot; in September last year \u2013 the invoice records that Blunt said the digger was for the &quot;maintenance of garden, wall etc&quot;. \u2022 Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for Worthing West, paid \u00a35.51 for fine art insurance. He has \u00a325,000 worth of &quot;kidnap for ransom&quot; cover included his insurance policy. \u2022 Ben Bradshaw, the culture secretary, uses Ecotricity. He claimed \u00a3771.43 for cleaning April-December 2008.   \u2022 Gordon Brown&apos;s wife, Sarah, made six phone calls from his Scottish constituency home to Canterbury, including one on Christmas Eve 2008 that lasted one hour 50 minutes. It emerged that these were to her friend Gill McNeil, an author who works part-time as a No 10 aide. The prime minister also appears to have claimed to have Sky TV extended to his bedroom and regularly paid as much as \u00a3700 every three months for cleaning. In total in 2008-09 he was claiming around \u00a310,000 to cover his utilities, council tax and service charges. He also claimed for grass cutting and service washes. Brown claimed \u00a3500 for the painting of a summer house on 14 August 2008. He repaid the money later. \u2022 Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, had a claim for \u00a3400 food allowance rejected in May 2009 since the rules had changed. \u2022 Malcolm Bruce claimed \u00a366 for pest control. \u2022 Andy Burnham, the health secretary, claimed \u00a3479 for a leak in his bathroom in London in April this year and also had a claim for \u00a311.95 for a TV licence rejected on the basis that he had no valid receipt. \u2022 Sir John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, claimed \u00a32,937 for building work in his kitchen, \u00a3646.25 for electrical work in his kitchen, and \u00a32,279 for gas flooring, tiling and electrical works in his bathroom. He was asked for a cheque for \u00a3800 after an overpayment in 2007. He was also late for claims for 2007-2008, including \u00a334 for electricity and \u00a3180 on his gas bill. He claimed \u00a3396.75 for the supply and fixing of a blind in his bedroom. \u2022 Liam Byrne, the chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed \u00a3379.74 for a bed and \u00a3470 of other furniture from shop in Walsall. In January 2009 he was barred from claiming \u00a350.92 total for three airbeds since it was deemed they would not all be for personal use. \u2022 The former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, MP for North East Fife, claimed a total of \u00a314,956 between April 2008 and April 2009. He claimed \u00a37,671 in rent for his London home, \u00a31,449.87 for the use of a garage at the property and \u00a3150.95 for phone calls made there. He also claimed \u00a34,350 for food through the year, \u00a3710 on cleaning and \u00a3180 on laundry, \u00a3568.32 on taxis and \u00a3168.10 on utilities. \u2022 David Cameron claimed \u00a31,198.57 for oil for the stove at his Witney home in Oxfordshire on top of monthly utility bills averaging \u00a3180 a month. The Tory leader claimed \u00a3867.57 for burning oil in October 2008, with a further claim in February 2009 for \u00a3331 for his second home, for which he claimed for a mortgage of \u00a31,081 a month. He also secured a 10% reduction in council tax on the property from his local council, though the value of the property meant he was still claiming back \u00a3196 a month for the band G tax. Just two days after issuing a public apology on 10 May for the &quot;bad&quot; system of parliamentary expenses, he submitted a \u00a31,081 claim for mortgage interest. His claim for \u00a31,459.10 on 12 May came four days after the scandal erupted when details of MPs&apos; expenses were leaked to the Daily Telegraph. Cameron claimed \u00a320,240.25 under the additional costs allowance (ACA) in 2008-9, close to the maximum of \u00a324,006. A Tory spokeswoman said: &quot;These are perfectly legitimate claims and what the ACA was intended for.&quot; \u2022 Bill Cash, the Conservative MP for Stone, who promised to repay more than \u00a315,000 after it was revealed he paid his daughter rent for her London flat, claimed \u00a34,800 for food in 2008-09. He claimed \u00a311,396.78 under the heading mortgage payments and rent in 2008-09, with seven of the monthly payments specifically identified as rent. He also claimed \u00a3115 for a residents&apos; parking permit. \u2022 Douglas Carswell, the Tory MP for Harwich who spearheaded the campaign to remove Michael Martin as Speaker for his handling of the expenses&apos; scandal, claimed \u00a32,960.21 for food in 2008-09. A Tesco receipt included 25 bottles of mineral water (24 sparking, one still), golden syrup, organic yoghurt, fairtrade bananas and high-fibre cereal. \u2022 David Chaytor, the MP for Bury North, has already admitted an &quot;unforgivable error&quot; when he claimed \u00a313,000 in interest for a mortgage he had cleared. The latest expenses show that his run-ins with the expenses office did not end there. He tried to claim for an ornate cast iron log effect stove worth \u00a3585 - specifically the Franco Belge Savoy electric stove with &quot;realistic flame effect and glowing log&quot; \u2013 but was declined. Administrators added a note to his claim which read: &quot;more info needed&quot;. Commons officials also disputed a claim for \u00a32,189.96 for six new windows and a door at his constituency home, which Chaytor insisted he needed &quot;because the former windows and door were very old and the timber was rotten&quot;. Then, following a claim dated 30 March 2009, the House of Commons administrators wrote to him warning: &quot;Unfortunately there are insufficient funds available in your allowance to permit payment to be made in full&quot;. Chaytor claimed for \u00a310,654.15 in mortgage interest payments for his constituency home between 1 April 2008 and 31 March this year and claimed \u00a34,800 on food, submitting a claim for \u00a3400 each month as part of a total claim for the period of \u00a323,186.45. \u2022 Christchurch MP Christopher Chope&apos;s bathroom was previously &quot;quite dated&quot; according to an invoice for \u00a31,325 to improve it. \u2022 Charles Clarke, the former home secretary, claimed \u00a3743 for three &quot;Sidewinder&quot; Roman blinds (&quot;fabric: Vision, Ivory \u2013 lined in Ercu&quot;) for his second home in his Norwich constituency. He also claimed \u00a3419 for a dishwasher from John Lewis. \u2022 Kenneth Clarke, the shadow business secretary, claimed \u00a32,665 for cleaning his London home in one year, according to his additional costs allowance for his London house for 2008-09. Clarke claimed for cleaning four times: \u00a3650 for 13 weeks&apos; cleaning between April and June 2008 at \u00a350 a week; \u00a3650 for 13 weeks&apos; cleaning between July and September 2008 at \u00a350 a week; \u00a3650 for 13 weeks&apos; cleaning between October and December 2008 at \u00a350 a week; and \u00a3715 for 13 weeks&apos; cleaning between January and March 2009 at \u00a355 a week. The former chancellor also had his expenses deducted by \u00a3532.30 in February this year after he fell foul of new rules that required MPs to provide receipts or invoices for items costing \u00a325 or more, apart from food. Rob Reed, parliament&apos;s assistant validation officer, wrote to Clarke on 6 February saying that he had failed to provide receipts for gas insurance and CMS key holding. He also queried his gas bill. A month later Clarke&apos;s office provided the information. Commons officials had noted earlier that Clarke had undercharged by \u00a3300 on his council tax. A Commons official wrote on his expenses form of 17 October 2008: &quot;Spoke to member, confirmed its [sic] 3 months and \u00a3234 should be \u00a3534.&quot; \u2022 The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, claimed \u00a3160 each month to cover &quot;garden maintenance&quot;, including keeping his hedges and front bushes trimmed. He has since agreed to repay some gardening expenses after Sir Thomas Legg set the retrospective level of acceptable claims for gardening at \u00a31,000 a year. Legg wrote letters to MPs requesting repayments after auditing the last five years of expenses. He also claimed \u00a370.50 for &quot;drain clearage&quot; in July 2008. He has repaid \u00a3910 after Sir Thomas Legg in October, who set the retrospective level of acceptable claims for gardening at \u00a31,000 a year. In 2008-09, Clegg claimed \u00a31,156 for his mortgage and \u00a3174 for the council tax. In the following financial year, he was claiming \u00a3155.86 a month for the first quarter, coupled with \u00a38.50 in &quot;ground rent&quot; each month. \u2022 David Clelland, Labour MP for Tyne Bridge, has a robotic vacuum cleaner, the iRobot Roomba 560. The \u00a3224.99 robot vacuum cleaner contains an automatic sensor to guide itself around the home - a tool that could prove useful in delving through the 40,000 pages of expense claims. According to the promotional material, it &quot;reaches deep into corners to remove and detect&quot; dirt.   \u2022 Harry Cohen, Labour MP for Leyton and Wanstead, was deducted the \u00a336.41 he attempted to claim on shower gel. He claimed \u00a36,206.23 - reduced to \u00a34,255 \u2013 for the refurbishment of his ground floor cloakroom. He also claimed \u00a339.99 for a radio. He claimed \u00a33,000 for work on his bathroom. \u2022 Derek Conway, who was expelled from the Conservative party over the &quot;misuse&quot; of public money to employ his sons, claimed \u00a359 for plumbing, which included a toilet handle being &quot;greased&quot;. The Old Bexley and Sidcup MP also put in a claim of \u00a3937 for bathroom goods bought at Peter Jones, in Sloane Square. That included two toilet roll holders for a total of \u00a376, two towel rails for \u00a3254, and two &quot;limed oak toilet seats&quot; for \u00a397, although the public was spared the cost of a third toilet seat which he returned, according to the claim. Conway also claimed \u00a31,075 for a mattress, \u00a31,450 for seagrass carpeting and \u00a3139.50 for a TV licence. He failed to provide receipts for some items and was asked by the fees office to furnish proof of purchase. \u2022 Ann Cryer, the Labour MP for Keighley, wrongly claimed \u00a3350 for food in May this year under the old expenses system. The fees office rejected the claim and told her that from April 2009, MPs could only claim a \u00a325-a-night &quot;subsistence allowance&quot; for every night they stayed at their second home. In her revised claim, she claimed for 10 nights at her flat in Westminster in April and 11 during May, receiving \u00a3525 in total for subsistence. In April 2008, Cryer received a final demand for non-payment of \u00a3352.92 in water charges for her London home, for a bill sent on 1 February 2008. Cryer appears to have a passion for radios. On 16 June 2008, she charged the taxpayer \u00a3199.95 for a Roberts radio bought from upmarket department store Peter Jones on Sloane Square, where she also bought an \u00a318 toilet brush. She then claimed \u00a3174 for two radios \u2013 a Pure Chronos digital clock radio and a second Roberts radio, this time a black solarDAB\u2002model \u2013 bought on 16 December 2008 from Peter Jones. They were later delivered to her Westminster home. In March 2009, Cryer had the bedroom of her Westminster flat recarpeted by Peter Jones. The duck egg-coloured Majestic Velvet carpet cost \u00a373 a square metre and Cryer claimed back the full \u00a31,252.77 for the carpet and underlay, parking charges for the carpet-fitters and other sundry costs. \u2022 Alistair Darling, the chancellor, claimed \u00a37,550 in mortgage interest and \u00a33,066.48 for his council tax bill on his constituency home in Edinburgh in 2008-09. \u2022 Quentin Davies, who crossed the floor to Labour in 2007, made an initial claim of \u00a320,700 (later reduced to \u00a35,376.91) for building work including repairs to a bell tower at his constituency home, an 18th century mansion near Boston in Lincolnshire. He submitted bills for \u00a318,000 to repair the bell tower&apos;s damaged bricks with &quot;York Handmade bricks&quot; and use of &quot;good quality second hand slates&quot; in roofing on the main house. He submitted the bills for the &quot;sake of clarity and transparency&quot;, but told Commons officials he &quot;emphatically was not&quot; claiming for the bell tower repairs, which cost \u00a39,869. Instead, he wanted \u00a35,380 as a contribution towards the \u00a310,330 costs of retiling the mansion roof. In a previous claim in 2005, Davies spent \u00a310,033.33 on renovating the windows on the property, and had previously claimed insurance for his home&apos;s antique furniture and \u00a3115 to have his Aga serviced. In September 2008, the fees office told Davies that he had overcharged \u00a318.76 and \u00a3371.71 for council tax and utilities, so had his allowances claim cut to \u00a310,409.89. \u2022 David Davis claimed \u00a3368.14 for servicing of a tractor and \u00a3256.45 for hedge cutting work. The Telegraph had previously revealed that he claimed \u00a3414 having for his sit-on tractor mower serviced. \u2022 John Denham, the communities secretary, claimed \u00a3350 in November 2008 for repairs after flood damage caused by an overflowing cistern. In May 2009 he claimed \u00a3517 for a bookcase. In April 2009 he claimed \u00a32,800 for repainting to &quot;external elevations&quot;. \u2022 Jim Devine, MP for Livingston, first got in trouble over his expenses when he submitted invoices for electrical work worth \u00a32,157 from a company with an allegedly fake address and an invalid VAT number. The latest records show that he overcharged the Commons by claiming for 12 council tax payments of \u00a392 on his nominated second home in London, instead of the 10 he had paid. He was ordered to repay \u00a3185.49, which he did by cheque. He was also repeatedly refused payment on monthly \u00a3180 cleaning bills because he failed to provide receipts and once tried to charge \u00a3127.62 in mobile phone charges which were refused. Devine&apos;s expenses from April 2008 to May 2009 included \u00a3193 spent at Timpson, the shoe repairs and engraving company. He claimed for \u00a311,706.27 in mortgage interest payments and \u00a34,325 in food and subsistence allowances. His receipts for \u00a369.10 (at 2pm) and \u00a364.25 (at 4pm) from the Golden Lion in Stirling are both dated 11-02-06. \u2022 Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson had a claim for \u00a325 for &quot;cleaning&quot; withheld until he could produce a receipt. He shares a flat in Greenwich with fellow DUP MP Sammy Wilson. They were asked to pay overdue service charges on their flat. By the letter they were told: &quot;It is vital that you keep up to date with service charge payments as failure to do so is a breach of your lease and is thus enforceable by the courts. If we do not hear from you we are instructed to pass the debt to the management company&apos;s solicitors whose fees will be added to your debt.&quot; \u2022 Former health secretary Stephen Dorrell claimed \u00a32,240 for food and \u00a325 for cleaning a blocked bath. \u2022 When Tory MP Nadine Dorries, submitted a \u00a39,000 claim last year, a House of Commons official wrote on the form: &quot;Due to lack of cooperation by member, assumption that costs relate to (blanked out) address, as stated on ACA nomination&quot;. Another official added: &quot;ok to proceed&quot;. Dorries declined to explain what the note meant. \u2022 Alan Duncan, who was axed from the shadow cabinet after saying MPs were living on &quot;rations&quot; following reforms to their expenses, claimed a total of \u00a318,177.97 in mortgage payments and rent in 2008-09 and \u00a31,273.97 for burning oil. \u2022 Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield, claimed \u00a34,674 for food. \u2022 Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, received a warning from Waverley council for failing to pay his council tax instalments. In May 2008 he was told he faced court proceedings if he failed to pay the total \u00a31,734.38 bill within 10 days. The payment bumped his monthly claim up to \u00a33,733.34 that month. In the same year he twice had a claim for \u00a340.34 for home insurance rejected for failing to file receipts. When he did file receipts the claim was queried because the address on his receipt was his first, not second, home which was listed at his constituency address. The receipt was subsequently paid.The 2008-09 receipts list his Surrey home as his second home but show he had less expensive tastes. He spent \u00a33.98 on two polka dot mugs and \u00a312.99 on a garden hose. Overall he claimed \u00a323,724.70 for his additional costs allowance that year. \u2022 Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary and MP for Epsom and Ewell, claimed \u00a3896.92 for the service charge on his London flat in 2008-09. Overall his second home cost the taxpayer \u00a311,236.56. In May he appeared to overclaim for his council tax bill after the expenses office demanded receipts to back up his claim for \u00a3106.33, but when the receipt was produced it was for only \u00a361. He claimed only once for cleaning that year \u2013 for a \u00a3120 &quot;spring clean&quot; in October. Grayling has since agreed to stop claiming for his London flat after controversy when it emerged that he was putting in expenses even though he lives only 17 miles from the House of Commons. \u2022 Dominic Grieve, the shadow justice secretary, received a final demand for a \u00a396.27 water bill warning him that a debt collection agency would be deployed or court action taken if he did not pay up. &quot;This is serious \u2013 act now to avoid further action,&quot; it said. In the year 2008-09 he claimed a total of \u00a317,642.44 on his second home in Marlow, Bucks for interest payments on his mortgage and in council tax. It also included two claims of \u00a370.50 for gardening services. \u2022 Peter Hain, the Welsh secretary and MP for Neath, claimed \u00a3188 for &quot;felling dangerous trees&quot;. He had a claim for a Sky television package at \u00a335.51 turned down. \u2022 Philip Hammond, the millionaire shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, claimed a total of \u00a324,000 in the year 2008-09 for mortgage interest on his second home in London. \u2022 Sir Alan Haselhurst, the deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, continued charging the public for his gardening at his home in his constituency of Saffron Walden. Last summer, from April to September, he charged the taxpayer \u00a31,719 for the upkeep of his garden including buying strawberry plants, dressing his lawn and trimming a branch from a weeping willow which was hanging by an electricity wire beside his drive. He also charged \u00a3100 for a load of logs. He paid gardeners to work on his grounds for 40 hours each month. He also charged \u00a358 for ten bags of salt for his water softener in April 2008 and \u00a333.22 for a pack of Maxtra filter cartridges in September 2008. Haselhurst designated his London property as his second home after making extensive claims for his constituency home. \u2022 John Healey, the housing minister, had bills worth a total of \u00a3367.03 blocked for not presenting receipts, which he then provided. \u2022 David Heathcoat-Amory, the Tory MP for Wells, claimed \u00a36,500 over seven months in 2008 for what appear to be gardening services, including \u00a316 a month for &quot;mower/strimmer/leafblower&quot;, \u00a32.69 for &quot;slug pellets&quot; and \u00a31.69 for &quot;twine&quot;. \u2022 Nick Herbert, the shadow environment secretary, claimed \u00a322,720.20 in mortgage interest on his second home in his Arundel constituency. The Telegraph had previously revealed he had charged taxpayers more than \u00a310,000 for stamp duty when he bought the \u00a3490,000 property in 2006. \u2022 Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, was asked to supply actual amounts, not nominal figures, for claims less than \u00a325. \u2022 Tory MP Douglas Hogg, who became notorious for claiming for the cost of having his moat cleared at his country manor house, was one of the MPs who &quot;flipped&quot; his home. In May last year, he told the Commons authorities: &quot;You know that in previous years I have made the ACA claim in respect of my Lincolnshire home. My present intention for the coming year is to make the claim in respect of my London-based home.&quot; Among the claims for the new home in Westminster, central London, are \u00a340 a week for a cleaner, \u00a34.99 for weedkiller, and \u00a32.99 for refuse bags. In December, he claimed \u00a3303 for refurbishing his bathroom including &quot;adjust bi-fold door in en-suite shower&quot;. \u2022 Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, had his claim reduced because he had claimed more than he was entitled to. \u2022 Geoff Hoon, the Labour MP for Ashfield and former defence secretary, already known for claiming back the costs of two televisions in two years, claimed \u00a344.02 for a slow rice cooker and a &quot;health grill&quot; from Comet in January 2009. \u2022 Gerald Howarth wrote to the fees office to explain his decision to claim for Sky Sports as follows: &quot;Since I already pay for the Sky Sports items at my main home I do not see why I should pay twice - hence my decision to claim these items from now on. I trust you agree!&quot; The fees office did not agree, telling him it did not consider the use of the Sky Sports package as &quot;essential to your parliamentary duties&quot;.  \u2022 Liberal Democrat frontbencher Chris Huhne claimed \u00a31,975.80 for gardening expenses between April 2008 and April 2009. The MP for Eastleigh, who didn&apos;t claim for a London home, filed a total of \u00a35,189.62 for the period. He claimed \u00a3802.14 in cleaning bills, \u00a3275.01 for utilities, \u00a3347.49 in phone bills and \u00a31,648.68 for council tax. He also claimed for his \u00a3139.50 TV licence. \u2022 Jeremy Hunt, the MP for South West Surrey and shadow culture secretary, claimed \u00a310,357.64 in mortgage interest, utilities and council tax bills, including \u00a322 a month for cleaning services. \u2022 The former defence secretary John Hutton &quot;flipped&quot; the designation of his second home after using MPs&apos; expenses to spend thousands of pounds of taxpayers&apos; money improving the London property he owns. He flipped his London home with a constituency home in Barrow and Furness after spending \u00a323,196.57 on mortgage payments, food, painting and decorating, cleaning and gardening in 10 months on his property in Hammersmith and Fulham, west London. A month before he told the Commons authorities his rented home in Cumbria would become his second home and therefore eligible for parliamentary expenses, he submitted a \u00a32,600 decorating bill. He also submitted bills for laying turf in his garden and removing a tree. Hutton denies any wrongdoing. &quot;Flipping&quot; has been used to describe the practice of switching second home designation. It is not in itself considered illegal. Hutton was among 71 MPs whom the parliamentary authorities revealed to have &quot;flipped&quot; their second home allowances since April last year. Hutton flipped his second home designation to a rented property in his Barrow and Furness constituency on 1 January. His claims on his west London home were so extensive that when he claimed \u00a31,300 to cover the deposit for the rented home in Barrow in March, he was told by Commons administrators he had exceeded his annual additional costs allowance. Hutton said he was prompted to change his second home designation to his constituency by his elevation to defence secretary. He was appointed in October 2008 but he only wrote to the Commons authorities informing them of the change in his second home designation in February 2009. Barrow had been his main home for the previous three years, during which time he occupied senior cabinet positions as the secretary of state for pensions, and then business. &quot;I had only just been made secretary of state for defence and it became clear that I was going to spend the lion&apos;s share of my time in London,&quot; he said . &quot;I am absolutely sure my designation was right and reflected my arrangements.&quot; He added that the \u00a32,600 decorating was carried out in August, before he was sent to the Ministry of Defence, even though he only claimed the cost in November. \u2022 Eric Joyce, the Labour MP for Falkirk, was pursued by the Commons authorities and forced to repay nearly \u00a35,000 in &quot;non-parliamentary&quot; travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi after he ignored their demands for repayment. As a further penalty for ignoring a series of official requests for repayment, Joyce was told that \u00a3319.85 in mileage claims and \u00a3595 in Commons expenses were being kept to use as downpayments towards the money he owed. Joyce made a formal apology &quot;for the highly regrettable&quot; oversight a day after his allowances were suspended. He said the flight costs and bills came from trips by two all-party parliamentary groups of MPs and peers \u2013 one for the African Great Lakes countries of Rwanda and Congo, and the second for the Globe environmental group for a visit to Tokyo. The Commons&apos; director of operations, Terry Bird, wrote to Joyce on 20 October 2008 reminding him that he had failed to reply to a letter on 11 September about the journeys paid for with his House of Commons travelcard. &quot;I am concerned that I have not received a formal reply and that you have not refunded the costs to the house,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It is therefore with regret that I have to inform you that I have instructed my staff to withhold money payable to you in respect of the parliamentary allowances until the sum mentioned above is recovered in full.&quot; A further email dated 22 October from the Commons&apos; head of validation and inquiry teams stated that a colleague &quot;has long been chasing Eric Joyce MP for some time regarding the repayment of funds relating to non-parliamentary use of the travelcard. &quot;We have finally tied Mr Joyce down and we duly expect a transfer of the required funds directly to Bank of England.&quot; After deducting Joyce&apos;s frozen mileage and Commons expenses, the outstanding sum was later recorded as \u00a34,070.75. Joyce told Bird that the &quot;largest element&quot; of these costs came after the Globe group, of which he was a member, had &quot;run into cashflow problems&quot; just before he was due to fly to Tokyo. The payment was authorised by Commons officials, he said, but the Globe group had failed to repay them to him within the fortnight, as he had hoped. &quot;This is highly regrettable and I am sorry as it is clearly my responsibility,&quot; Joyce wrote. &quot;I should have been chasing it and I am afraid I have not been. The other elements of the costs are fully my personal responsibility for repayment.&quot; \u2022 Sir Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, was accused of making an &quot;excessive&quot; and extravagant claim after trying to charge \u00a31,035 for a Stressless Orion leather recliner chair and stool from the Arighi Bianchi furniture store in Macclesfield, Cheshire. The chair cost \u00a3935 and the store charged \u00a3100 for delivery. Kaufman told the Commons authorities in March 2009 that the chair was to replace a &quot;38-year-old chair&quot; but his claim was cut very heavily. Officials reminded Kaufman about the &quot;green book&quot; rules from July 2006 that warned members against any claims which might seem &quot;extravagant and luxurious&quot;. They reminded Kaufman that only costs directly linked to his parliamentary duties could be claimed back and said it was an inappropriate claim under the rules. They deducted \u00a3935 from his claim. Kaufman was also involved in a drawn-out dispute with the authorities over his habit of making a quarterly claim of \u00a3245 to cover general handyman and maintenance jobs in his London home. In January this year, Commons officials questioned the payment because it was not supported by any receipts or evidence for costs above \u00a325, but Kaufman said the payments were agreed by the fees office in 2006. In a censored email, the Commons&apos; head of quality assurance said: &quot;I feel sure that this particular cost relates to various services he receives from a &quot;local family&quot; [sic] who cook, clean and provide general handyman services. I cannot recall exactly, but I suspect that we suggested that the member group these various services together and claim \u00a3245 as, at that time, this sum did not require receipts.&quot; But, since April 2008, that had changed and MPs were now required to supply receipts for any charges over \u00a325. Kaufman protested and said none of the jobs \u2013 which included descaling his shower head and &quot;putting bulbs in difficult places&quot; \u2013 exceeded \u00a324.99 in value. His last claim for \u00a3245, in December 2008, was withheld. \u2022 Sally Keeble, the Labour MP for Northampton North, received a goodwill payment of \u00a312 from Anglian Water following a &quot;cryptosporidium incident&quot;. \u2022 Ann and Alan Keen, the married MPs dubbed &quot;Mr and Mrs Expenses&quot;, were asked to repay \u00a3353.41 of \u00a34,284.30 for service charges on their London flat. \u2022 Robert Key, the Conservative MP for Salisbury, claimed \u00a358.75 for a plumber to &quot;remove screw from waste disposal unit.&quot; \u2022 Julie Kirkbride, the Tory MP for Bromsgrove, claimed \u00a3100 for a &quot;Regal blanket&quot; from the Peter Jones department store in London&apos;s Sloane Square and \u00a390 for &quot;repairs to dining chairs&quot; last year. \u2022 Jim Knight, the employment minister and MP for South Dorset, had his claim for life insurance rejected. \u2022 Jacqui Lait, the Conservative MP for Beckenham, takes sheets, pillow cases and table cloths to a cleaner in her constituency. \u2022 Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, received an overdue demand for a \u00a3400 maintenance and service charge on the Westminster flat he rents. In total, charges for having a second home in London away from his Cambridgeshire South constituency amounted to \u00a321,434.84 in 2008-09. Previous revelations about his expenses showed he had spent \u00a34,000 renovating his country home, which was then designated as his second home, before he sold it. He has repaid \u00a32,600 of those decorating fees. \u2022 Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough and chairman of the public accounts committee that is responsible for overseeing government spending, was threatened with legal action over non-payment of a \u00a3461.56 gas bill and received a letter from British Telecom warning of a restricted service if he did not pay overdue bills. But EDF refunded him \u00a3534.11 for overpayment of electricity bills via direct debit. \u2022 Oliver Letwin, the Tory MP for West Dorset and chair of his party&apos;s policy review, claimed \u00a321,073.12 for his constituency home \u2013 including \u00a32,653.07 for household heating oil. He previously agreed to repay taxpayers&apos; money used to repair a pipe underneath his tennis court but in the year 2008-09 he made no further claims for maintenance. \u2022 Michael Lord, the Conservative MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, claimed \u00a31,965 for garden maintenance and \u00a34,800 for food. He claimed a further \u00a32,507 for &quot;chimney lining&quot; and also the cost of his TV licence (\u00a3139.50). \u2022 Peter Luff, the Conservative MP for Mid Worcestershire and chairman of the Commons business committee, claimed \u00a31,979 for carpets and \u00a3248 for curtains from the Peter Jones department store, \u00a3535 for a dryer and \u00a3350 for a mattress from John Lewis, and \u00a3450 for a Laura Ashley chest of drawers. He claimed \u00a319.90 for a &quot;one retro salt and pepper mill&quot; and one &quot;silicone mitt&quot; at \u00a314.95. \u2022 Andrew MacKay, the Tory MP for Bracknell, claimed more than \u00a39,000 last year for refurbishing his home. He resigned in May as parliamentary aide to David Cameron after it was revealed that he and his wife, Tory MP Julie Kirkbride, were claiming for two second homes, but no main home, both funded with taxpayers&apos; cash. The new expenses documents show that he claimed \u00a36,000 to have the outside of his Westminster home redecorated, and the rest went on the bathroom and central heating. \u2022 Angus MacNeil was not allowed to claim \u00a384.98 for a computer printer for his flat. He also failed to submit proof of mortgage interest payments (the fees office wrote asking him to provide it as soon as possible) and had payment for two overnight stays in Edinburgh withheld pending more information about whether he was performing parliamentary duties. \u2022 Denis MacShane claimed for a pair of black-out curtains and a kettle from Dunelm Mill in Rotherham. The curtains cost \u00a329.99 and the kettle \u00a316.99, a total of \u00a346.98. In June 2009, MacShane received a letter from an assistant validation officer after submitting an \u00a380 claim for &quot;cleaning&quot;. In the margin of the form, was written: &quot;Not allowed after 19/5/09 \u2013 Mr Speaker&apos;s statement.&quot; The letter said: &quot;Therefore we can no longer reimburse the cost of \u00a380 in respect of your &apos;cleaning&apos;. Your claim has been reduced accordingly and the remainder of your claim, totalling \u00a31,117.32, has been processed.&quot; In June 2008, he claimed \u00a3529.47 for a TV set and DAB radio from Currys in Fulham. The receipt showed \u00a3249.99 for the television, \u00a399 for product support (insurance), a 2m Belkin cable for \u00a340.19 and a \u00a3139.99 Roberts radio. A receipt for \u00a31,800 was submitted in August 2008 to renew and fill window seals and renew a section of wood in a basement floor &quot;and to decorate walls where damp came threw&quot; [sic]. The receipt included: &quot;Material, labour, congestion charge and parking.&quot; There were numerous claims for dry cleaning from September 2008 to February 2009. \u2022 Shahid Malik, the communities minister, who controversially claimed \u00a31,050 for a plasma television, also claimed \u00a348.94 for a TV wall bracket for it. In March this year he claimed \u00a3850 for a protective device of some sort; almost all details were blanked out but one document did state: &quot;It has a traditional diamond lattice standard, supplied in white and a range of other colours ... if required.&quot; Its measurements were given as 1,542mm wide and 2,600mm high. However, the fees office refused to pay this claim until it received further information &quot;surrounding the necessity for such a purchase&quot;. Malik replied that &quot;being a justice minister, Home Office minister at the time and being a high profile parliamentarian who is outspoken on the extremism, terrorism and white supremacists I hope you agree it is a reasonable [measure].&quot; He went into more detail about his existing security measures, but much of this was heavily censored: &quot;On all the doors and windows in the flat there is some form of [redacted]. On the front door there is a [redacted] on the front two windows there are [redacted] on the two windows above them there is [redacted] at the garden door there is a [redacted] \u2013 the double doors which lead to [redacted] are the only point where there is no [redacted].&quot; An email from the head of quality assurance at the Department of Resources agreed to pay the claim, if Malik had not used up all his relevant allowance: &quot;If the MP has enough funds, please pay the claim for a [redacted],&quot; it said. In March 2009 Malik also claimed \u00a31,547.40 for damp and other repair work, including a lock for his gate and a security light. He also claimed \u00a31,900 to replace a window and doors, again for security reasons, but this was also withheld by the Commons fees office &quot;pending further information&quot;. The Daily Telegraph reported in May that Malik had claimed \u00a366,000 for his second home over three years while paying less than the market rate, although an inquiry by Sir Philip Mawer, the prime minister&apos;s independent adviser on ministerial interests, concluded that he was paying the market rate. Malik claimed nothing for his second home in his most recent expenses claim for April to June 2009. The table of MPs&apos; living arrangements shows that in that period he also changed the location of his second home, which is in London. His spokesman said he was too busy with ministerial business to clarify these living arrangements. A spokesman for the minister said Malik was pleased that the latest figures had been released and was in favour of &quot;transparency and disclosure&quot;. He noted: &quot;Sir Thomas found that Mr Malik has acted fully within the ACA [additional costs allowance] rules at all times, both in this year and in previous years. He concluded that Mr Malik has nothing to pay back, and nothing further to explain.&quot; \u2022 John Maples, the Tory MP for Stratford on Avon, spent \u00a3166.00 in March 2009 on pumping out his septic tank and draining 2,000 gallons of water from his fish pond. He claimed only for \u00a394, the &quot;same as usual&quot;, supplying a receipt from his annual septic tank clear-out the previous year. \u2022 Michael Martin, who became the first Speaker to be forced from office for 300 years when he stood down in response to MPs&apos; criticism of his handling of the expenses scandal, made a variety of claims for his house including \u00a356.49 for a toaster and \u00a358.49 for a kettle. He also claimed for a rug (\u00a321) and pillowcase and sheet (\u00a324.28). He made nine claims for window cleaning totalling \u00a3160 and two for curtains (\u00a329.24 and \u00a342.53 respectively, although the latter included &quot;storage items&quot;). In April 2009 he claimed for his annual council tax bill of \u00a32,559.03. He stood down as an MP on 22 June. \u2022 Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory chief whip, claimed for his second home in Derbyshire, including for a power shower upgrade in 2008-09 costing \u00a3487.62, plus \u00a3544.34 from a bedroom repainting job. He charged the taxpayer \u00a350 a week for his cleaner. But Commons officials queried two bills totalling \u00a31,625 claimed in September last year, telling the MP that they might not pay until he &quot;provides us with additional information as to the nature of the items purchased, as this is not clear from the invoices provided&quot;. Both bills are heavily redacted and today&apos;s published data does not resolve the mystery. \u2022 Tony McNulty, the former Home Office minister, received a letter withholding \u00a3300 for council tax as he had not submitted a receipt. A House of Commons validation officer wrote, on June 3 2008: &quot;The Department of Resources is required to withhold the amount of \u00a3300 in respect of council tax pending a receipt or copy invoice. The remainder of the claim totalling \u00a31,760 has been processed.&quot; The remainder of the claim, submitted in May 2008, related to two months&apos; rent at \u00a3880 per month. McNulty also claimed \u00a31,720 for housing costs between June and July 2008, \u00a3850 in August, \u00a31,600 for September and October 2008 and \u00a31,400 for November and December 2008. \u2022 Oldham West MP Michael Meacher wrote to the fees office to tell them he was still owed \u00a31.49 from his July 2008 claim. Some months earlier, he was overdue paying his council tax. \u2022 David Miliband, the foreign secretary, received an overdue council tax reminder threatening legal action from South Tyneside council, which covers his South Shields constituency home, for late payment of \u00a364.44. &quot;To avoid recovery proceedings: the overdue amount of \u00a364.44 must be paid in full within seven days of receipt of this notice. If you fail to pay the overdue amount by the date stated, this will result in the full outstanding balance of \u00a3685.44 becoming due. If after a further seven days you have failed to repay this amount the council will commence legal proceedings for the full amount plus costs. These costs will total \u00a362.&quot; Miliband also claimed \u00a3132.96 for gardening expenses, including \u00a317.96 for bark chippings and \u00a3115 for 11 and a half hours&apos; labour. The invoice from the gardener adds: &quot;Please let me know if you would like pots making up at front and back this year, given the relatively short amount of time you&apos;ll be here and their labour-intensive nature.&quot; \u2022 Alan Milburn, the former health secretary, claimed \u00a36.75 for John Lewis hand wash. &quot;Soap&quot; was written on his expense claim form in January 2009. He claimed \u00a374.50 for kitchenware and glasses from David Mellor in Sloane Square, \u00a387.50 for ground rent and \u00a396 for cleaning. In February this year he claimed \u00a3151.55 for a floor lamp and ceiling light from John Lewis and bulbs. A further \u00a319.50 was claimed for a sheet set from M&amp;S. A month later, in March, he submitted a \u00a3760.85 claim for household items, from John Lewis. The items included a Pure Siesta DAB digital clock (\u00a358.60), lacquered silver place mats (\u00a348), lacquered silver coaster sets (\u00a319.50), a king-size duck down duvet (\u00a3107) and six pillow protectors (\u00a358.50). The household items also included a baking sheet, roasting dish, and four mini-quiche dishes without prices displayed and a saute pan and chopping boards. In July 2008, he received a letter demanding an &quot;overdue&quot; \u00a3133.34 for the upkeep of his London flat. It said: &quot;Should payment not be received within 14 days of the date of this letter, an administration charge of \u00a350 plus VAT and interest on the arrears will be calculated at 4% above the base rate.&quot; Between June and July 2008 he claimed for a \u00a319.99 Argos iron and a \u00a314.95 Tesco vacuum cleaner. In April 2009, Milburn claimed \u00a355 for towels &quot;for London flat&quot;. The towels were from John Lewis. \u2022 Anne Milton, the Conservative MP for Guildford, claimed a total of \u00a3184 for a year \u2013 one night&apos;s stay in a London hotel when snow fell heavily in February this year. She does not claim for a second home, although she is entitled to as her home is more than 30 miles from parliament. \u2022 Andrew Mitchell, the shadow international development secretary, scrawled out his claim for the final quarter of 2008-09 (\u00a37,867.54) on a sheet of Commons notepaper, explaining that he had receipts for some of the money \u2013 including phone bills, house insurance, TV licence and utilities \u2013 but not for his mortgage or for &quot;a whole year&apos;s per diem [allowance] for food&quot; totalling \u00a31,720. Of a total annual claim of \u00a321,802.05 he writes: &quot;Balance owing, \u00a37,581.74.&quot; Mitchell pays what he describes as a &quot;service company&apos; in his Midlands constituency \u00a32,700 a month for &quot;cleaning and laundry&quot; two gardening visits (\u00a370) and \u2013 in one instance \u2013 \u00a330 to get an electrician in to replace a light. Parliamentary officials withheld some claims pending receipt of evidence. He referred to one of his staff as &quot;the girl who opens the post&quot; in a letter to the fees office. \u2022 Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Great Grimsby, claimed \u00a34,100 for a replacement boiler in March 2009. In February, he claimed \u00a374.99 for a replacement kettle from House of Fraser. In June 2008 he claimed \u00a3478 for a washing machine. In a piece for the Guardian, his wife Linda McDougall wrote: &quot;I&apos;m fed up of being blamed for everything that goes wrong. For the past 30 years or so we had a Russell Hobbs &apos;Forgettle&apos;. It lasted so long it was a family legend. When it finally gave up the ghost I decided to replace it with another Russell Hobbs. I chose the model at \u00a375.99 because it looked attractive and durable and I thought it would probably &apos;see me out&apos;. A proper consideration for the bus pass generation. Since Austin hardly ever uses it he should shut up.&quot; \u2022 Anne Moffat, the Labour MP for East Lothian, had a \u00a314.99 claim for air bed insurance declined. \u2022 Laura Moffat, the Labour MP for Crawley in Sussex, claimed just \u00a3158 in a year. She claimed \u00a338.70 for an electricity bill and \u00a3120 for one night&apos;s stay in a London hotel. Her majority of 37 is the smallest in the UK. \u2022 Margaret Moran, the Labour MP for Luton South, claimed \u00a322,500 between April and September 2008 at her home in Southampton for &quot;urgent and essential works due to dry rot&quot;. \u2022 David Mundell, the only Conservative MP to represent a Scottish constituency, rents a flat in Westminster for \u00a31,408 a month, but his claim is now capped at \u00a31,250. \u2022 Dan Norris, the Labour MP for Wansdyke, made an 80p claim for telephone and telecommunications. \u2022 Lembit \u00d6pik, the Lib Dem MP for Montgomeryshire, paid electricians from his Welsh constituency to travel 418 miles to fix electrical problems at his London flat. Workmen from the same firm also visited \u00d6pik&apos;s home to replace light switches and other work. The total cost was \u00a31,791.52. \u2022 George Osborne was told in April this year, a month before the expenses scandal broke, that there were insufficient funds in his parliamentary allowance. In a letter to the shadow chancellor on 16 April, parliament&apos;s assistant validation officer told him that his claim of \u00a3841.63 for March 2009 could not be paid in full. He was instead paid \u00a3790.56. The letter said: &quot;Unfortunately there are insufficient funds available in your allowance to be made in full.&quot; Osborne had been claiming the maximum on his additional costs allowance for his Tatton constituency home in 2008-09. This included \u00a31,794.77 a month in mortgage interest rate. Osborne&apos;s expenses claim also include a receipt for a \u00a3790.50 bill for the cleaning of his Tatton home in March this year. The bill on 25 March included a four-hour domestic clean on 4 March at \u00a370.50; an external window clean on 25 March at \u00a325; a quarterly blitz clean on 25 March at \u00a3140; carpet cleaning on 25 March at \u00a3150; chimney sweeping on 25 March at \u00a3180; and jet washing the outside of the house on 25 March, \u00a3225. \u2022 Eric Pickles, the Tory MP for Brentwood and party chairman, is a modest claimant for second-home costs: \u00a3208.86 a month in rent, \u00a315.47 for cleaning, \u00a356 for food in a typical month last year. The total was \u00a34,495. \u2022 John Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, claimed \u00a320,508.21 for nine months&apos; mortgage payments on his second home. This works out at \u00a32,278.69 per month. Additionally, he claimed a further \u00a33,497.79 for housing costs (rent or mortgage payments) between 1 January and 31 March this year. \u2022 John Reid, the former home secretary, received a letter in February 2008 from TV Licensing warning him that his accommodation was under investigation as their records showed there was no licence there. In April 2008 he claimed \u00a350.91 for items at Homebase, including refuse sacks and a Bag for Life. He also claimed \u00a3549 for a TV, \u00a350 for two key fobs and \u00a31,477 for a chaise, chair and pouffe, from the Glasgow branch of DFS. In the same month he claimed \u00a3274.78 for a tool kit and a Dyson from Argos. On 2 October 2008, he had a letter from Scottish Power about a \u00a365.79 overdue gas bill. The following day he had another letter from Scottish Power demanding \u00a337.91 that was overdue. In December 2008, he refunded \u00a354.34, which he had overclaimed in 2008-09 for electricity. On 3 March, he received a letter from the assistant validator at the Commons. &quot;You have made 11 claims of \u00a3113 for reimbursement of council tax,&quot; it said. &quot;The annual council tax bill amounts to \u00a31,136.70. Therefore, you have overclaimed by \u00a3106.30.&quot; \u2022 Conservative frontbencher David Ruffley, the MP for Bury St Edmunds, had a moth problem and spent \u00a330.95 on anti-moth products at Peter Jones in Chelsea. \u2022 Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, stopped claiming for a second home in London in the first quarter of 2009-10 and instead started claiming for hotels. Salmond, the MP for Banff and Buchan, claimed \u00a3182.34 for hotels and \u00a3406.60 in food in 2008-09. A note on a claim from the Commons fees office says: &quot;Spoke to Mr Salmond&apos;s office, he has given up ACA home at Dolphin Sq [an area close to parliament where many MPs have flats] and is now staying in hotels whilst in London.&quot; \u2022 Former home secretary Jacqui Smith claimed \u00a3555.74 for a Panasonic 32-inch widescreen full-HD LCD television, \u00a3244.90 for a DVD player, \u00a3611 for a new double bed from John Lewis, \u00a3269 for a Barton double bedstead and \u00a3342 for a natural two-pocket mattress. She also claimed \u00a3136 for coal, \u00a370.50 for repairs to an Indesit washer, and \u00a331.09 from Wickes for building materials including building sand, concrete, a knife lintel, gravel board and concrete trimming. She billed for a replacement shower at \u00a3499.37. After it was revealed that she had claimed for two soft porn films watched by her husband and other films, there was acknowledgement of her cheque for \u00a3400 on 28 March 2009, &quot;as discussed subsequently this reimburses the house for amounts paid towards Virgin Media package for your constituency home less the cost of the basic broadband package&quot;. She claimed three times for the \u00a367 bill that included the porn films. \u2022 Alison Seabeck, the Labour MP for Plymouth Devenport, was contacted by a debt collection agency over on an unpaid \u00a387.32 mobile phone bill. \u2022 Andrew Selous, the Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire, claimed for \u00a32.95 spent at the Commons: \u00a32.40 on a lamb dinner and a 55p mug of Horlicks. \u2022 Grant Shapps, the Tory MP for Welwyn and Hatfield and shadow housing minister, makes no claim for a second home, but does charge for occasional hotel stays in London, at prices ranging from \u00a3145 a night to \u00a3339 on one occasion. The MP&apos;s total Additional Costs Allowance (second home allowance) claim for 2008-09 was \u00a34,104. \u2022 Caroline Spelman&apos;s gas bill at her Midlands home reached \u00a33,300 for the year. The shadow communities secretary charged \u00a3248 for a year&apos;s worth of cleaning costs at the end of the last financial year, 2008-09. She had a \u00a3600 half-yearly water bill claim rejected because the money had not yet been take from her account. &quot;Please claim the \u00a3600 in October 2008 when the balance is paid,&quot; officials told her. Under the more rigorous regime now in place she also had a \u00a3442 claim withheld pending evidence of receipts. \u2022 Richard Spring, the Conservative MP for West Suffolk, claimed \u00a3204.38 for newspapers in the financial year 2008-09. He reads the East Anglian Daily Times, Times, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, plus, on Fridays, the Bury Free Press, and on Saturdays the Financial Times. He does not buy the Guardian. \u2022 Anthony Steen, the Conservative MP for Totnes, has announced his retirement from parliament after being criticised for comparing his &quot;very, very large house&quot; to Balmoral, and saying his critics were merely jealous. His claims for April to June 2008 include \u00a3627 for &quot;general maintenance to buildings&quot; and for a new water pump and filters, an \u00a385 service of his Aga, and \u00a3465.30 for fitting a new gas valve to a Rayburn. It also appears to show illegible figures totalling more than \u00a31,400 for &quot;garden manure&quot; which have been crossed out, apparently by the claimant himself. Steen also claimed \u00a3151.58 for a service in July 2008 for what appears to be pumping equipment in a well, and for a total of \u00a31,628.74 for furniture removal and storage between July and August 2008. A handwritten note reads: &quot;Mr Steen has confirmed that these removal costs were to transport furniture from his main home to his second home.&quot; Recurring problems with his boiler led to three separate claims totalling \u00a3550.56. \u2022 Jack Straw, the justice secretary, conceded he had made an error over five years covering his council tax claims, amounting to an overclaim of \u00a31,415. In a handwritten note Straw wrote to the parliamentary authorities in July 2008: &quot;I am sorry about this. I am afraid the reality of life over the past few years is that I have often had to complete claims in marginal time.&quot; Straw appears not to have realised the council gave him a 50% occupancy discount. He also claimed \u00a32,380 for decorative repairs to his constituency home including bookcases in an alcove. \u2022 Labour MP for Sherwood Paddy Tipping, a member of the Commons standards and privileges committee, had a \u00a350 claim for &quot;dog minding&quot; turned down. The amount was included in a \u00a3750 decoration bill and a Commons official noted: &quot;Member says man who did the repairs was the cheapest quote but he included &apos;dog minding&apos; in the bill \u2013 disallowed.&quot; \u2022 On 23 June 2008 Sir Peter Tapsell, the Conservative MP for Louth and Horncastle, wrote a letter to the Commons finance department, reading: &quot;I understand that my quarterly allowance is now \u00a36,001.50!&quot; The exclamation mark is because he considered this low, rather than high. &quot;My rent at [his address] is \u00a321,668 per annum or \u00a35,417 per quarter ... The current rate of Westminster council tax is pay is ... \u00a3309.43 per quarter. That makes a quarterly total of \u00a35,726.43.&quot; This left, he said &quot;a gap&quot; of \u00a3275.07. &quot;My utility bills obviously come to more than \u00a3275 a quarter. Do you want me to send you receipted invoices for these also?&quot; The office did, though Tapsell&apos;s second claim included, rather than utilities, his contents insurance bill. &quot;You will see that this insurance premium costs \u00a32,515.93 per annum, which my secretary tells me works out at \u00a3628.98 per quarter.&quot; Throughout the year he was paid \u00a324,004, the maximum permissible. \u2022 Kitty Ussher, the Labour MP for Burnley and former Treasury minister, received \u00a316,723.93 for building work on her London home in 2008-09. In 2009-10 she &quot;flipped&quot; her second home to her constituency address. She received \u00a33,000 of the \u00a36,150 claim for kitchen units because she lost the receipt. The Commons took \u00a3107 off her claim for electricity and gas and \u00a350 off her claim for her telephone in November 2008. \u2022 Ed Vaizey&apos;s claims show evidence of being worked out on paper, complete with carried ones, rather than by calculator; unfortunately for the Oxford-educated former barrister, however, his arithmetic is frequently wrong. In April 2009 the MP for Wantage and close ally of David Cameron underclaimed by \u00a310, totalling his mortgage, council tax and utilities bills for the month at \u00a3774.18 instead of \u00a3784.18. The following month he claimed for \u00a3136 in council tax despite attaching a receipt for \u00a3142. The previous financial year&apos;s claims show him out again by \u00a320 in February 2009 and by 10p in April 08 \u2013 both underclaims \u2013 though in July 2008 a mistaken attempt to claim twice for council tax rates was spotted by the finance office, as was a duplicated claim for 2008. An invoice submitted by Vaizey for new curtains and blinds in May 2008 had been miscalculated, apparently by the supplier, to total \u00a3278.58 instead of \u00a3270.58. He claimed a further \u00a3204.94 for more curtains in July, and for \u00a3680 on carpets in September, as well as \u00a3658 in April 2008 for a new washer/dryer and dishwasher. The Vaizeys favour cream lined curtains on brass hooks in the living room, and blackout roller blinds (in ecru) upstairs. \u2022 Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East, initially had his \u00a31,995.94 claim for this year&apos;s service charges for his second home rejected, after fees officials ruled that the payment had to come from last year&apos;s allowances. Vaz had been sent warning letters from the service company for non-payment of the \u00a31,995.94 fee from February this year. The fees office told him his allowance for last year had been reached, and offered to pay only \u00a3175.48 towards the fee. Vaz&apos;s pleas for the full costs to be carried over to this financial year were rebuffed, because he was sent the bill in February. But, in April, Vaz submitted a new claim for the full sum: today&apos;s documents suggest that it was paid in full. In May last year, Vaz was also ordered to repay \u00a3840 to the fees office after putting in a duplicate claim for monthly payments towards his second home; he had twice &quot;flipped&quot; his second home in the previous year. His latest expenses claim shows he has already failed to pay the first council tax instalment on his Westminster flat in time; in May he received an overdue notice for \u00a3207.43 and a warning he faced legal action unless it was paid within seven days. \u2022 Sir Peter Viggers, the Tory MP for Gosport whose claim for a floating duck island came to define the expenses scandal, helpfully lists what he calculates as his annual expenses for the finance office: this includes \u00a36,648 on gardening (including wages for his gardener, who comes for eight hours a week at \u00a316.25 an hour), \u00a31,410 for grass cutting, \u00a3220 for garden irrigation, \u00a3460 for pest control, and \u00a3125.37 for maintenance of his Aga. With his mortgage and utility bills, he calculates, this brings his annual expenses to \u00a320,631.64. A handwritten note dated November 08 reads: &quot;Spoke to Sir Peter. Not appropriate to claim interest on increased borrowing taken to free equity of house.&quot; He agreed to reimburse. Viggers was paid \u00a39,070.50 towards the \u00a310,200 cost of stamp duty on his house purchase. \u2022 Theresa Villiers, the shadow transport secretary, was ticked off by the freeholder of her second home in Lambeth, close to Westminster, for not paying the \u00a3150 ground rent and \u00a3416 for insurance. But she made clear in a letter to Commons officials that it was not her fault. The bill had been sent to the previous owner because the freeholder had not kept his records in order. Villiers charged a monthly mortgage of \u00a31,061 to the taxpayer in 2008-09; plus a monthly \u00a3134 in council tax and an annual service charge on her flat of \u00a31,246.45 and \u2013 like many MPs \u2013 her \u00a3139.50 TV licence. One of her bank statements from RBS is shown with 106 lines redacted because they represent private transactions. This leaves just six lines visible to prove she pays standing orders of \u00a325 and \u00a319 a month for gas and electricity. \u2022 Former Labour minister Tom Watson, who shared a flat with MP Iain Wright, received a final demand from Thames Water on 24 June 2008, for \u00a3211.91. It warned the debt would be passed onto a debt collection agency if it wasn&apos;t paid. Watson&apos;s expense claims for half a service charge and half the council tax were duplicated by Wright, who claimed the full amount on the property. \u2022 David Willetts, the shadow universities secretary, has tightened up his accounting procedures when claiming the parliamentary costs allowance to pay for the running of his second home. Expenditure which was previously rounded up to \u00a3200 a month for &quot;utilities&quot; or &quot;council tax&quot; is now itemised more precisely as &quot;Utilities, \u00a3152&quot; and &quot;Council tax \u00a3162.&quot; Claims for &quot;food&quot; of \u00a3250 (the monthly maximum was \u00a3400) in 2006 have been scaled down to \u00a375 by 2008, though mortgage bills have risen in the same period. Willetts&apos;s claim for reimbursement of \u00a388 a week for a cleaner was challenged by officials because it was not backed by evidence, but the MP for Havant produced a note from his cleaner confirming the arrangement. Charging for half of his monthly BT phone bill \u2013 a standing order for \u00a384 \u2013 was also queried. \u2022 Lib Dem MP Phil Willis, claimed \u00a323,814.92 between April 2008 and April 2009, which included a \u00a33,999.73 kitchen from MFI. He spent \u00a32,377.31 for two new bathrooms at adjacent properties in London and billed the taxpayer for \u00a31,118.65 of the work. He did not claim for the other half of the work as it was for his daughter. The new kitchen included a \u00a3599 washer-dryer and a \u00a3499 dishwasher. \u2022 The husband and wife MPs Sir Nicholas and Lady Ann Winterton are both standing down from their parliamentary seats after David Cameron called their conduct &quot;indefensible&quot; in paying off the mortgage on their London flat with the help of expenses, before putting it in a family trust and claiming another \u00a3120,000 to rent it from their children. It is unfortunate, then, that their &quot;pleasant two-bedroom flat&quot; is described in less than glowing terms by an estate agent asked to appraise it in February 2008. &quot;Whilst [name of the property] is a well thought-of block, it is somewhat staid in comparison with other blocks built more recently,&quot; notes the agent. Having been censured by the standards and privileges committee, the couple were ordered to leave the flat by 1 September last year; \u00a3940 in removals fees were duly claimed for 28 August. \u2022 Rosie Winterton, the MP for Doncaster Central and health minister, claimed \u00a3180 for an Iranian rug, bought from Oriental Carpets in Wallingford, Oxfordshire. It included a &quot;Certificate of Origine&quot;. In April 2009 the assistant validation officer asked for her to supply supporting receipts for a claim for &quot;furniture/electrics&quot; for \u00a3796.10. She wrote on 28 May: &quot;In view of recent rulings on furniture, I think it would not be appropriate to proceed with the claim for replacement furniture and replacement electrical equipment. I am sorry if this causes any problems but hope you will be able to action my request for withdrawal of the claim.&quot;  \u2022 Shaun Woodward, the millionaire Northern Ireland secretary, claimed \u00a31,418.49 per month in mortgage payments. He employed accountants Saffery Champness. \u2022 Sir George Young, the shadow leader of the Commons, had his cleaner&apos;s bill of \u00a325 a month challenged by Commons officials because the MP&apos;s claim was not backed by a receipt, as anything above \u00a325 \u2013 previously \u00a3250 \u2013 must now be. &quot;I will forgo the \u00a325 for May,&quot; the MP replied. A plumber&apos;s bill for repairs \u2013 \u00a350 worth of labour \u2013 included \u00a34.80 for a &quot;plug socket&quot; in generally frugal claims.

In the UK there is a massive dancehall scene. This is understandable: there are around 500,000 Jamaicans living here, and an estimated 7% of Londoners are of Jamaican heritage. But despite an almost negligible Caribbean diaspora in Japan (estimated to be somewhere in the low hundreds), the Jamaican-born sound of dancehall is hugely popular there. During the rise of Bob Marley&apos;s worldwide popularity, it seems Japan caught the reggae bug, and the country has been harbouring a love for the stoner-friendly sound ever since. Initially, the Japanese were keen on reggae&apos;s more soothing styles: roots reggae, one-drop and lover&apos;s rock. An annual reggae festival, Reggae Japansplash, began in 1985 and has since been host to the more mature sounds of Gregory Isaacs and Marcia Griffiths (who was the leader of Bob Marley&apos;s backing singers, The I Threes). But it&apos;s not just Jamaican reggae artists that are popular in Japan. There are a number of homegrown stars like derisible female singer Pushim, that sell hundreds of thousands of records.\u00a0More recently, reggae&apos;s bass-heavy, rump-shaking son, dancehall, has been gaining lots of young fans in Japan. Japan has been appropriating American music since the 1920s, when it began to embrace jazz. It therefore wouldn&apos;t be too gauche to postulate that the recent popularity in Japan of dancehall is directly proportional to the success that Jamaican dancehall artists have received in the US. The 2003 single Pon De River from Elephant Man&apos;s Good 2 Go album received chart success in the US, and the album later went gold in Japan. Fellow Jamaican artists like Sean Paul and Beenie Man have also seen a large amount of success in Japan following notoriety in the US. For the past few years, there has been a thriving dancehall scene in Japan. Nightspots like Club Harlem in Tokyo regularly host dancehall nights, where local clubbers dress up in cliched dancehall wear (Bob Marley T-shirts and lots of red, green and gold), plait their hair into cornrows, and perform sexually explicit dance moves while warbling in a cod-Jamaican accent. Incidentally, diminutive Japanese rump-shaker (and former ballerina) Junko Kudo was the first non-Jamaican to win the Dancehall Queen title (an award given to the woman who can dance most provocatively in front of a baying pack of dancehall-loving lechers), in Montego Bay, in 2002. An achievement her mother should be \u2013 and apparently was \u2013 very proud of.\u00a0The godfathers of the Japanese dancehall sound are Mighty Crown, a Yokahama-born sound system, who regularly play to huge stadiums of people. Inspired by legendary sound systems like Kilimanjaro and Saxon, they entered the revered Irish and Chin World Clash (a competition in which selectors effectively compete to see who has the best and most exclusive selection of reggae tracks) in 1999 and won, becoming the first non-Jamaican sound system to do so, thus propelling them to worldwide reggae notoriety.\u00a0Hoping to bask in the same serene sunshine of dancehall glory are MCs like Corn Head, Akane, and Moomin (whose persona is much closer to the cuddly, hippo-like cartoon creatures than, say, menacing dancehall MC du jour Mavado).\u00a0In fact, dancehall culture is so popular in Japan that there are now schools teaching enthusiasts how to speak in Jamaican patois.

Reports said the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, told the Japanese ambassador to Washington, Ichiro Fujisaki, that Japan must honour a 2006 agreement to move the Futenma airbase \u2013 located in a crowded city on Okinawa \u2013 to the island&apos;s remote east coast. Fujisaki told reporters the discussion had centred on &quot;the importance of US-Japan&quot; ties, but Clinton reportedly made it clear that the US expected &quot;swift implementation&quot; of the existing accord. Last week, the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, said he needed more time to determine the base&apos;s future following electoral promises to lessen the Japanese dependence on US foreign policy. The original $10.3bn (\u00a36.4bn) relocation plan would also see the transfer of 8,000 marines and their families to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014. Discussions about the relocation began well over a decade ago amid mounting opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa, which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan. The bases are routinely blamed for noise and air pollution, and residents live with the threat of a catastrophic accident. Although serious crimes are relatively uncommon, attitudes changed after three US servicemen were convicted of raping a 12-year-old Okinawan girl in 1995. The Japanese defence minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, said Tokyo had set itself a May 2010 deadline to decide the base&apos;s future, but added that he hoped an agreement would be reached sooner. Japan&apos;s decision to postpone a decision has been met with an exasperated reaction by US military officials. Last week, General James Conway, the commandant of the US marine corps, said the delay was &quot;unfortunate&quot;, adding, &quot;The Futenma replacement facility is absolutely vital to the defence that we provide for the entire region.&quot; Hatoyama&apos;s indecision is also harming his popularity at home, about six months before upper house elections that could give his Democratic party of Japan control of both houses of parliament. In a poll published by the Mainichi newspaper yesterday, 68% of respondents said they were concerned about ties with the US. The Futenma debacle and Hatoyama&apos;s handling of the economy saw his cabinet&apos;s approval rating slide to 55%, down 9% from last month, the poll revealed. Almost four months after his party swept to power in a landslide election victory, Hatoyama appears no closer to reaching a decision on Futenma. He could choose to honour the original agreement, but the delay suggests he is more sympathetic to moving the base to another part of Japan. The social democratic party, a junior partner in Hatoyama&apos;s coalition government, supports moving the base out of Japan and has threatened to leave the coalition if the existing accord is implemented. Barack Obama&apos;s irritation was evident earlier this month when the US president snubbed an offer from Hatoyama to explain his thinking on Futenma&apos;s future on the sidelines of the climate change summit in Copenhagen."}, {"sentences": ["Its 1975 Tokyo declaration states unequivocally that &quot;physicians shall not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading procedures, and in all situations, including armed conflict and civil conflict&quot;."], "tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Torture", "Human rights", "World news", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-22T12:00:00Z", "title": "Israel's doctors must allay torture fears | Antony Lerman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/22/israel-palestinian-doctors-torture-allegations", "article": "One of the disturbing features of the persistent use of torture by many countries in conflict situations around the world is the role some doctors play in condoning it. The World Medical Association (WMA), which &quot;promot[es] the highest possible standards of medical ethics, [and] provides ethical guidance to physicians&quot;, is crystal clear on this practice. Its 1975 Tokyo declaration states unequivocally that &quot;physicians shall not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading procedures, and in all situations, including armed conflict and civil conflict&quot;. True to its principles, in October, in response to reports about the possible collusion of doctors in the abuse of prisoners in Iran, the WMA passed a unanimous motion at its annual meeting in Delhi urging national medical associations to speak out in support of the rights of patients and doctors there. But is the WMA being selective in its condemnations? The specific problem of doctors&apos; complicity in the torture of detainees in the Middle East was raised at an international patients&apos; rights conference in Turkey in November. In a presentation she made, Dr Ruchama Marton, head of Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHR-I), called for the WMA to play a central role in establishing a network &quot;to voice complaints and provide assistance to those who are willing to struggle against torture&quot;. National medical associations and human rights organisations should work together &quot;to campaign against torture in general and against the participation of physicians in torture procedures&quot;. In saying this, Marton was thinking about what some regard as the very unsatisfactory situation in Israel. Evidence has been produced by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) and PHR-I of doctors examining interrogated Palestinians before, during or after torture without documenting, reporting or resisting, and by providing medical documents and information to the bodies responsible for the torturing. These are all expressly prohibited under WMA and Israel Medical Association (IMA) guidelines, as is even the presence of a doctor where there is torture. These allegations have never been seriously investigated by the IMA, despite persistent urging by PHR-I as part of its long struggle against the use of torture and its bringing of the issue to the attention of the WMA. In the summer the IMA cut ties with the human rights body, accusing it of fomenting antisemitism. Dr Yoram Blachar, the chairman of the IMA, wrote in a letter that &quot;the outrageous situation is that PHR&apos;s activity serves as fertile ground for antisemitism, anti-Israelism and anti-Zionism&quot;. In May, a letter sent to the WMA council through the chairman, Dr Edward Hill, signed by 725 doctors from 43 countries, and supported by PHR-I, requested that the WMA investigate the IMA for failing to conform to its code on the absolute prohibition of doctors participating in and condoning torture. And it called for the immediate resignation of the then president of the WMA, Blachar. In November, Dr Derek Summerfield of the Institute of Psychiatry at the University of London, convenor of the group who signed the May letter, wrote to the new WMA president, Dr Dana Hanson, on behalf of the lead signatory Professor Alan Meyers of Boston University, and again pressed for action to investigate the IMA. And he also referred to the apparent discrepancy between the treatment of reports of collusion in torture in Iran and in Israel. At the end of October, Meyers spoke to WMA council chair Dr Edward Hill and was told that the WMA would neither be responding to nor commenting on the May letter. So far, that stance seems remain in place. The current situation is deeply unsatisfactory. Even though Israel&apos;s supreme court in 1999 finally ruled that methods of torture used at that time by the security forces were illegal, a loophole was left for interrogators who tortured in &quot;ticking bomb&quot; situations, which ultimately allowed old forms of torture to creep back in by the mid-2000s, as a 2007 report by PCATI showed. So there is good reason to be seriously concerned about the use of torture today. It is important to recognise that torture would not be possible without the support and safety net of doctors and that doctors are key in exposing and stopping the practice. Israel therefore needs to do two things. First, allegations that Israeli doctors colluded in torture must be confronted and thoroughly investigated. Otherwise, this ongoing affair can only damage the reputation of the vast majority of doctors in Israel, many of whom belong to PHR-I, who will have no truck whatsoever with torture and who assiduously apply their principles of medical ethics equally to all who come into their care, irrespective of national, ethnic or religious origin. Second, PHR-I proposals for guidelines to help doctors identify torture and for legislation that would make it obligatory to report suspicion of torture and protect whistleblowers \u2013 measures that would protect doctors&apos; independence and make it much harder for interrogators to use torture \u2013 must be adopted by the IMA and the government. No double standards are being applied to Israel here. By implementing the proposals, Israel would simply be conforming to WMA guidelines \u2013 and doing at least one thing that would help repair its international position. \u2022 Comments on this article will remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight"}, {"sentences": ["She was born in Tokyo, the daughter of a cultivated British lawyer who&apos;d written a book on Go, the Japanese board game, and was brought up in California by her mother, a former actress, along with her younger sister, actress Joan Fontaine (Screen Legend 67)."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-22T19:05:36Z", "title": "Philip French's screen legends: Olivia de Havilland", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/22/olivia-de-havilland-screen-legend", "article": "Few actresses have appeared in as many films so regularly revived on TV as Olivia de Havilland, most notably Gone With the Wind (1939), for which she received the first of her five Oscar nominations, but also the eight adventure yarns she made with Errol Flynn, among them Captain Blood (1935) and The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). She was born in Tokyo, the daughter of a cultivated British lawyer who&apos;d written a book on Go, the Japanese board game, and was brought up in California by her mother, a former actress, along with her younger sister, actress Joan Fontaine (Screen Legend 67). A rivalry with Joan that led to a long-standing breach between them may have started when the nine-year-old Olivia said she had made a will that said: &quot;I bequeath all my beauty to my younger sister Joan because she has none.&quot; Olivia was named after the heroine of Twelfth Night, and in her first film (though not the first released) she was Hermia in Max Reinhardt&apos;s 1935 A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. An overwhelming number of her pictures were to be costume dramas, ranging from the English court in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939) to the late Victorian New York of The Heiress (1949), a version of Henry James&apos;s Washington Square, in which she won her second Oscar as a supposedly mousy spinster. To these roles she brought sparkling eyes and a radiant smile in an open face, her speciality being demure middle-class ladies. When in 1950 she turned down the part of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire (it went to her Gone With the Wind co-star Vivien Leigh), she said: &quot;A lady doesn&apos;t say or do these things on the screen.&quot; Yet like her close friend Bette Davis, she had fought Warner Brothers to get better, more challenging roles, and two of her best postwar performances brought her out of bonnets and into the modern world. The first was the dual role of good and bad sister in Robert Siodmak&apos;s noir classic The Dark Mirror (1946), and a harrowing performance as an incarcerated housewife in The Snake Pit (1948), a historically important Hollywood expos\u00e9 of the grim conditions in state mental hospitals. From the 50s onwards, her film roles were few and she usually played elegant matrons. The most interesting are Lady in a Cage (1964) as a crippled widow trapped in a lift and terrorised by sadistic intruders, and Robert Aldrich&apos;s gothic melodrama Hush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), in which, as a last-minute replacement for Joan Crawford, she torments Bette Davis. Her most distinguished later role was a Texas rancher&apos;s ailing wife in Sam Peckinpah&apos;s exquisite TV film of Katherine Anne Porter&apos;s novella Noon Wine (1966). From the 1950s, de Havilland has lived in France, married from 1955 to 1979 to her second husband, the editor of Paris Match, Pierre Galante, with whom she had a daughter. After their divorce, they remained friends and she nursed him through his final illness in the 90s. In 1965, she was the first woman to preside over a Cannes jury; it gave the Palme d&apos;Or to Dick Lester&apos;s The Knack. De Havilland on typecasting &quot;I think playing bad girls is a bore.

She gave at least half-a-dozen outstanding performances, usually played Englishwomen, though she never lived in Britain, and most of her films set in this country weren&apos;t made here. She was born in Tokyo a year after her equally beautiful actress sister, Olivia de Havilland, their father a British patent lawyer, their mother a retired actress. When the marriage broke down, their mother took them to California and remarried there. The brunette Olivia was the first to enter films and when the blonde Joan followed her, their mother insisted she take her stepfather&apos;s name, Fontaine. Unlike Olivia&apos;s, her career began slowly, but 1939 was a great year for both: Olivia appeared in Gone With the Wind and opposite Errol Flynn in two movies; Joan played the sole female role in George Stevens&apos;s great imperial adventure yarn, Gunga Din, and Cukor&apos;s The Women. Although she played bitchy femmes fatales in Ivy (1947) and Born to be Bad (1950), her most distinctive work was as good women experiencing troubled relationships with older men \u2013 as the second Mrs de Winter in Hitchcock&apos;s Rebecca (1940), the heiress who marries the duplicitous Cary Grant in Suspicion (1941), the woman carrying a torch for Charles Boyer in The Constant Nymph (1943) and the eponymous heroine of Jane Eyre (1944). She was Oscar-nominated for the first three, receiving the statuette for Suspicion. Her greatest variation on this role, and the best film she appeared in, is Max Oph\u00fcls&apos;s Letter From an Unknown Woman (1948), a film she co-produced and starred in as a discarded mistress in fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna. Her subsequent work was generally less interesting, mainly society ladies and aristocratic figures. She was a Bavarian princess in Wilder&apos;s The Emperor Waltz (1948); a medieval heroine in Ivanhoe (1952); a misled wife in Ida Lupino&apos;s The Bigamist (1953); and a misled fiancee in Fritz Lang&apos;s Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956). Her film career ended in a fairly decent Hammer horror flick, The Witches (1966). Fontaine married and divorced four times: her first husband was actor Brian Aherne, and two others were producers. A lifelong feud with her sister, begun in childhood, is part of Hollywood legend and became quite bitter in 1941 when both were Oscar-nominated and Joan won. That Olivia went on to win twice made little difference, and in 1987, when they attended the Academy Awards&apos; 60th anniversary, they were furious to discover they&apos;d been booked into adjacent hotel rooms and demanded to be moved. The frostiness has continued and they&apos;ve now become two of the few surviving stars of Hollywood&apos;s Golden Era.

For one thing, the 28-year-old business consultant is impeccably turned out, from his perfectly knotted striped tie to his scuff-free brown leather shoes, bought after a champagne breakfast with some female friends. He is patience personified when passers-by do a double take while he poses for the Observer&apos;s photographer. When I ask him when he decided to become an unrepentant &quot;grass eater&quot;, he doesn&apos;t flinch. It is not an unkind reference to his diet. Sakurai is a proud member of a new tribe of Japanese men who have eschewed traditional notions of masculinity and adopted a gentler, more &quot;feminine&quot; persona. He is a soshokukei danshi \u2013 herbivorous boy \u2013 a term coined two years ago by the commentator Maki Fukasawa to describe the proliferation of men who, in appearance and attitude, bear little resemblance to the two dominant Japanese male groups of the past century: soldiers and their peacetime offspring, corporate warriors. The typical herbivore cares, sometimes a little too much, about his appearance, eats sparingly, prefers afternoon tea with female friends to an evening spent drinking and shows little interest in the obsession that consumes so many of his peers: sex. Sometimes referred to as ojo-men (ladylike men), they are mounting a counter-attack against the baby-boomer generation, whose lives revolved around company, colleagues and, a distant third, their wives and children. Some dismiss the genre as the product of inventive marketing for male cosmetics, skin-tight fashions and, at the most militant end of the spectrum, male bras, minus the lacy frills. But Megumi Ushikubo, author of The Herbivorous Ladylike Men Are Changing Japan, says men such as Sakurai are the vanguard in a quiet social revolution. Ushikubo, president of a market research firm, reckons that as many as 60% of Japanese men aged between 20 and 34 display at least some herbivorous tendencies. &quot;They don&apos;t have the material aspirations of previous generations,&quot; says Ushikubo, whose interest in the phenomenon was piqued by calls from companies unable to sell fast cars or alcohol to young men. &quot;They have no appetite for food or sex. You ask them what they want out of life and they say, &apos;Nothing much&apos;.&quot; Rather than bond over beer, the average herbivore invests his time and money in activities once regarded as the preserve of young women: shopping trips, dining out, personal grooming and cultural pursuits. The herbivores have no personal experience of the bubble years of the 1980s. Instead, Sakurai&apos;s generation reached adulthood as the economic edifice started to crumble, and unemployment and contract work replaced jobs for life and twice-yearly bonuses. &quot;Young men went through a crisis of confidence towards the end of the 1990s,&quot; Ushikubo says. &quot;The economy isn&apos;t performing well, so they don&apos;t see the point of working too hard, because they think things will never improve.&quot; Less amenable to sociological analysis is the herbivores&apos; ability to suppress their carnal instincts. Sakurai, who says he has been single for several years, puts it down to an overdeveloped fear of rejection and commitment. &quot;I have lots of female friends I&apos;m attracted to,&quot; he says. &quot;But you weigh up the risks and benefits and come to the conclusion that things are best left as they are. I&apos;m lucky to work in an industry where there&apos;s no stigma attached to being single and no pressure to get involved with someone.&quot; The rise of the herbivorous man has met with mixed reactions. Traditionalist employers complain that they lack the work ethic of older generations, while commentators blame their sexual abstinence and relative thrift for the low birthrate and the weak economy. Some women, too, say they prefer their men rougher around the edges. A popular revival in interest in Japanese history has made unlikely pin-ups of feudal warlords from the distant past. Sakurai doesn&apos;t take the criticisms seriously. &quot;It&apos;s too bad about the birthrate, but that&apos;s also a sign that the women are enjoying more freedom than before. It&apos;s as if social stigmas attached to both sexes have been lifted.&quot; The herbivores&apos; appearance in the Japanese social firmament is not without its benefits. &quot;They really care about their families,&quot; says Ushikubo. &quot;They don&apos;t believe that the state will be able to do its bit for their parents or themselves after they retire.&quot; As he approaches his 30s, Sakurai reluctantly accepts that his grass-eating days may be nearing an end. &quot;My younger brother just got married, and I can&apos;t see myself being single in my 40s,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;m in my comfort zone right now.

Using a plane specially designed for &quot;long haul&quot; flights, Takuo Toda narrowly failed to match his lifetime best of 27.9 seconds, a Guinness world record set in Hiroshima earlier, but achieved with a plane that was held together with cellophane tape. Today&apos;s flight, inside a Japan Airlines hangar near Haneda airport in Tokyo, was the longest by an unadulterated model. &quot;I felt a lot of pressure,&quot; Toda told the Associated Press after his feat. &quot;Everything is a factor \u2011 the moisture in the air, the temperature, the crowd.&quot; The record was all the more satisfying for having been achieved with a plane that stayed true to the traditions of origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. He folded his 10cm aircraft by hand from a single sheet of paper and did not use scissors or glue. Toda, who is president of the Japan origami aeroplane association, said the secret to a successful launch was to avoid a flat trajectory and get the plane as high in the air as possible to give it time to circle slowly towards terra firma. &quot;It&apos;s really a sport,&quot; he said. &quot;The throwing technique is very delicate.&quot; Toda has established himself as the world&apos;s foremost folder of paper planes, an obsession that now has him setting his sights on the final frontier. Last year he and fellow enthusiast Shinji Suzuki, an aeronautical engineer and professor at Tokyo University, announced plans to have about 100 of their paper planes launched by a Japanese astronaut on board the international space station, 250 miles above Earth. The 30cm planes, made from heat-resistant paper treated with silicon, survived temperatures of 250C and wind speeds of mach 7 \u2011 seven times the speed of sound \u2011 during testing. But the attempt was postponed after the pair acknowledged it would be all but impossible to track them during their week-long journey to Earth, assuming any of them survived the searing descent. Toda, who received funding for the project from Jaxa, Japan&apos;s space agency, is determined not to give up and hopes to get backing from China or Russia for another attempt. Before then, he may again try to achieve the origami plane equivalent of Roger Bannister&apos;s sub-four-minute mile: keeping his plane aloft for a full half a minute. &quot;I will get the 30-second record,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s just a matter of time.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["For Ernest Singer, president of Mill\u00e9simes, a wine merchant based in Tokyo, it represented a crucial step towards realising a long-held dream of unleashing fine Japanese wine on the world&apos;s drinkers.", "&quot;Like any other wine-producing country, Japan has some great wines and, frankly, some awful ones,&quot; says Kunio Naito, managing director of Cave de Relax, a wine seller in Tokyo whose 1,600-strong collection includes 200 labels from Japan."], "tags": ["Japan", "Wine", "Food & drink", "Food and drink", "Food & drink industry", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Wine holidays"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-29T15:23:46Z", "title": "Japanese wine forces grape snobs to think again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/29/japan-winemaking-industry", "article": "Less than a decade ago, the mere mention of Japan would elicit puzzled looks, if not snorts of derision, from the global wine cognoscenti. The country that gave the world premium sake and award-winning malt whiskies has been infamous for producing the kind of plonk that gives wine a bad name \u2011 often blends of cheap imports and even grape juice. But wine snobs are being forced to think again with the recent arrival in the US and Europe of labels from Japan made from 100% domestically grown grapes. Though it lacks the heritage of the great winemaking countries of Europe, Japan is hoping to emulate New Zealand and quickly prove its enological credentials. That effort is centred on Yamanashi prefecture, where grape growing began 1,000 years ago, eventually spawning a modest wine industry in the second half of the 19th century. The central region, where 90 wineries operate in the shadow of Mount Fuji, is now producing drinkable wines from chardonnay and other European grapes. But it is the Koshu grape, an indigenous variety that found its way to Japan via central Asia and China more than a millennium ago, to which connoisseurs have turned for inspiration. Yamanashi&apos;s fortunes received a boost in 2004, when researchers found that the Koshu grape is more than 90% vitis vinifera, part of the same European vine genus that gave us sauvignon blanc. For Ernest Singer, president of Mill\u00e9simes, a wine merchant based in Tokyo, it represented a crucial step towards realising a long-held dream of unleashing fine Japanese wine on the world&apos;s drinkers. After an encouraging foray into the US market in 2005, Singer, whose firm owns several vineyards, turned the light-purple Koshu grapes into a wine that met strict EU regulations. Amid a global boom in interest in Japanese food, Koshu is being touted as the perfect accompaniment to sushi&apos;s subtle flavours and delicate textures. &quot;Japan has the potential to be a major winegrowing region,&quot; says Singer. &quot;It makes sense that Japan should have a viable wine export industry, when you consider that there are hundreds of Japanese restaurants in New York alone.&quot; His company&apos;s Shizen 2006, Cuv\u00e9e Denis Dubourdieu, has won considerable critical acclaim since it appeared on the menu at Umu, a Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant in London, in February last year. Mill\u00e9simes has shipped 480 bottles to England, as well as 5,800 to perhaps the toughest market of all, France, since early 2008. The dry, fruity wine, containing just 10% alcohol, was clearly to the liking of the legendary American critic Robert Parker, who described it as &quot;crisp and pleasant and clearly meant to be a wine to guzzle with sushi or sashimi&quot;. Just as Japanese distillers learned how to make decent single malt by dispatching researchers to the Scottish Highlands, its winemakers are tapping into the expertise of their more accomplished foreign counterparts. &quot;By sending researchers to places like France and the US, we have managed to produce dry varieties that have received great reviews,&quot; says Hirotoshi Naito, of industry support division of the Yamanashi prefectural government. &quot;We can&apos;t force people to drink our wine; all we can do is tell them that Japan is serious about winemaking, and that the best labels come from Yamanashi.&quot; Yamanashi&apos;s marketing campaign will head to London in the middle of next month for a Koshu wine-tasting event that organisers hope will add to the list of exports to the EU, which currently comprises only Mill\u00e9simes&apos; Koshu vintage and Cuv\u00e9e Magrez-Aruga Koshu Isehara 2007, from Yamanashi&apos;s Katsunuma Jozo winery. Japan&apos;s first commercial wineries appeared in the Meiji era (1868-1912) as part of the county&apos;s attempts to westernise its agricultural base; now it has more than 200 wineries are in a dozen regions, from Hokkaido in the far north to Miyazaki in the south. &quot;Like any other wine-producing country, Japan has some great wines and, frankly, some awful ones,&quot; says Kunio Naito, managing director of Cave de Relax, a wine seller in Tokyo whose 1,600-strong collection includes 200 labels from Japan. &quot;I can see a spurt in demand from Japanese restaurants in major cities, but you have to remember that in terms of exports, we are starting from scratch.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Opposing plans to publish a history of military intelligence in the second world war, she observed: &quot;I was taught a very good rule by my two Masters at Law, both of whom are now judges: never admit anything unless you have to; and then only for specific reasons and within defined limits.&quot; As for the &quot;karate ladies&quot;, the cabinet secretary, Sir John Hunt, rejected the Japanese proposal for an all-female protection squad at the Tokyo summit, saying that Thatcher was going as &quot;prime minister, and not as a woman per se&quot;."], "tags": ["National Archives", "Margaret Thatcher", "Politics", "Politics past", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-30T00:05:27Z", "title": "Papers released under 30 year rule reveal full force of Thatcher's fury", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/30-year-rule-thatcher-papers-released", "article": "The arrival of Margaret Thatcher, the Grantham grocer&apos;s daughter, as Britain&apos;s first female prime minister sent shockwaves not only through Whitehall and Westminster but across the world \u2013 even if the Japanese did think she needed a crack squad of &quot;karate ladies&quot; to protect her at her first summit. Today, the cabinet papers from Thatcher&apos;s earliest days in office are finally released under the 30-year rule. The 1979 files provide a fascinating insight into the way she took a grip, first of her ministers, then the country with a pugnacious style that is revealed in hostile handwritten remarks in the margins of previously secret documents. The Downing Street files show that within a month of taking office Thatcher told Geoffrey Howe, her chancellor, that the two Treasury papers on public spending cuts he put forward for their first budget were &quot;not nearly tough enough&quot; and that his proposal to double VAT to 15% would simply stoke inflation. A paper on pay policy by the employment secretary, Jim Prior, was so &quot;thoroughly deficient in content&quot; that she ordered it not to be circulated to the cabinet. Again and again her furious handwritten notes in the margins of the files reveal her impatience at the cautious approach of Whitehall and some of the &quot;wets&quot; in her own cabinet. &quot;This will not do&quot; makes regular appearances, as does &quot;too small&quot; whenever public spending cuts are being discussed. She just as often responded with her blue felt-tip pen with the single word &quot;no&quot;, heavily underlined. Her early struggles to reduce an \u00a38bn public spending borrowing requirement through spending cuts and increases in indirect taxes while cutting the basic rate of income tax to 30p are an object lesson for any incoming prime minister next year faced with a deficit of \u00a3176bn. The files show that at her first meeting with the Soviet premier, Alexey Kosygin, the woman they had dubbed the &quot;iron lady&quot; lectured him on the plight of the hundreds of thousands of boat people risking their lives fleeing communist Vietnam after he suggested that they were all drug-takers or criminals. &quot;The prime minister told Mr Kosygin that the refugees who were being picked up by British ships were \u2026 hardworking people, not drug addicts, and a high proportion of them were children.&quot; But the Downing Street papers also disclose a shocking degree of personal racism in her own response to the Vietnamese boat people, initially resisting an informal UN request that Britain take 10,000 refugees on the grounds that there would be riots in the streets if they were given council housing ahead of &quot;white citizens&quot;. She made clear to her cabinet colleagues that she had &quot;less objection to refugees such as Rhodesians, Poles and Hungarians, since they could more easily be assimilated into British society&quot;. Mrs Thatcher even bizarrely proposed to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, that they jointly buy an Indonesian island to resettle all the boat people. This forerunner of Oliver Letwin&apos;s 2003 idea for an &quot;asylum island&quot; to take all of Britain&apos;s asylum seekers was only blocked when Singapore complained that it would set up a rival entrepreneurial city. The files disclose that Thatcher&apos;s first months in power reveal a torrent of pungent political aphorisms that were to sustain her in power for the next 13 years. Vetoing Lord Carrington&apos;s suggestion that Foreign Office negotiators should meet Robert Mugabe before the Rhodesia/Zimbabwe settlement, the prime minister scribbled in the margin of one letter: &quot;No \u2013 Please do not meet leaders of the &apos;Patriotic Front&apos;. I have never [underlined] done business with terrorists until they become prime ministers. MT&quot; An enthusiast for nuclear power, Thatcher admitted in a dispatch about Pakistan&apos;s ambitions: &quot;There was little one could do if a country was determined to obtain nuclear weaponry.&quot; A letter from July 1978, while she was still leader of the opposition, reveals Thatcher&apos;s legally inspired reluctance to concede that mistakes had ever been made. Opposing plans to publish a history of military intelligence in the second world war, she observed: &quot;I was taught a very good rule by my two Masters at Law, both of whom are now judges: never admit anything unless you have to; and then only for specific reasons and within defined limits.&quot; As for the &quot;karate ladies&quot;, the cabinet secretary, Sir John Hunt, rejected the Japanese proposal for an all-female protection squad at the Tokyo summit, saying that Thatcher was going as &quot;prime minister, and not as a woman per se&quot;.

The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, and other cabinet ministers were this evening holding crisis talks to discuss JAL&apos;s options ahead of an official decision on the airline&apos;s future late next month. Maehara told reporters that no decision had been made on whether JAL should be exposed to court-led bankruptcy, and promised state backing for its restructuring efforts, possibly though bridge loans. JAL shares closed down 24% at \u00a567 (46p), having plunged 32% at one stage, with investors taking flight amid media reports that liquidation was now under serious consideration. &quot;Investors were very nervous about the fate of JAL,&quot; said Masatoshi Sato, a market analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities. &quot;With recent reports saying the airline could face bankruptcy, investors were panicking that their JAL stock ownership could be worthless.&quot; Liquidation could leave JAL shareholders, whose shares were each worth \u00a5213 at the start of the year, with zero. Media reports quoted an official as saying that bankruptcy is the &quot;strongest possibility&quot; being considered by the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], a government-backed body formed in October to decide the airline&apos;s fate. The ETIC has up to \u00a51.6tn in state-guaranteed funding at its disposal and, according to reports, is still considering a private restructuring plan that would not involve the courts. No guarantee But bankruptcy became a realistic option last week after the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, said the government would no longer guarantee loans to JAL. Until now, banks have lent to the airline on the understanding that the loans are guaranteed by the state. Fujii&apos;s surprise announcement was a major blow to JAL, the beneficiary of four bailouts since 2001, as the government had been expected to provide up to \u00a5100bn in credit through the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ). Fujii said: &quot;This is a matter that should be worked out by private companies. The DBJ is wholly owned by the state but it has the status of a private bank so the government is not allowed to meddle in its business.&quot; JAL&apos;s three biggest creditors, Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsubishi, reportedly rejected liquidation during fractious talks with Maehara yesterday. It would saddle them with huge losses on their investments and risk grounding the airline&apos;s fleet if it is unable to find enough ready cash to buy fuel and parts from nervous suppliers. Bankruptcy could also complicate rival bids for a minority stake from Delta and American Airlines. The US airlines are hoping to use a partnership with JAL to expand their trans-Pacific services and gain a stronger foothold in the Asian market ahead of the expansion of Haneda airport in Tokyo next year. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper claimed earlier this month that JAL was leaning towards the $1bn (\u00a3630m) bid from Delta, the world&apos;s biggest airline, in a move that would end its Oneworld alliance with American, which has offered $1.1bn. A capital tie-up with either could herald a dramatic reshaping of the global aviation industry, as it would give the buyer access to JAL&apos;s Chinese and other Asian routes through code-sharing agreements. Struggle JAL is heading for its fourth annual loss in five years as a result of the global slump in air travel, inefficiency and an unwieldy pension scheme. The ETIC is expected to ask JAL to cut 9,000 jobs and scrap 45 domestic and international routes in return for capital. The airline had already said it would suspend 50 domestic and international routes by March 2011, and cut 6,800 \u2013 14% of JAL&apos;s workforce \u2013 by March the following year. The airline could struggle, however, to secure the two-thirds approval it needs from employees to cut retirement payouts and make a sizeable dent in its \u00a5330bn pension shortfall. Last year it lost \u00a563.2bn but, in a move indicative of its current turmoil, has withdrawn a forecast of similar losses for the year to March 2010. Given the airline&apos;s liabilities, which totalled \u00a51.5tn at the end of September, its bankruptcy would be the sixth biggest in Japanese corporate history."}, {"sentences": ["See the Tokyo Game Show teaser here."], "tags": ["Technology", "Games", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "Nintendo", "Wii", "PC", "Games consoles"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-31T08:37:34Z", "title": "The 50 most intriguing games of 2010: part one", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/dec/30/games-gameculture", "article": "With 2009 seemingly being written off by many videogame pundits as a &apos;so-so&apos; 12 months - all eyes must now turn to 2010.

Or will it be another production line of largely lacklustre sequels, enlivened by the odd moment of explosive genius? Time will tell - but if you don&apos;t have enough of that, Gamesblog is here to help. Over the last day of this year and the first of next, we&apos;ll be listing 50 promising titles due out in 2010, covering the obvious &apos;tent pole&apos; releases as well as some lesser-known treats hovering in the background.  With Greg and Jack away, these are all my choices, so this is an entirely subjective list, certain to boast several glaring omissions - but, of course, that&apos;s what the comments section is for... These are all retail releases, by the way - I&apos;ll be dealing with downloadable titles early in the New Year.  Part two is tomorrow...Again (Nintendo, Nintendo DS)This supernatural murder mystery probably won&apos;t be on many &apos;most anticipated&apos; lists, but anyone who&apos;s played developer Cing&apos;s other DS titles - Hotel Dusk and Trace Memory - will surely be ripping open their detective notebooks in anticipation. The action follows an FBI agent who can re-live past events - surely a useful trick when you&apos;re investigating a decades-old unsolved murder spree... The case opens in the UK in March. See the Tokyo Game Show teaser here. Alan Wake (Microsoft, Xbox 360)The psychological thriller for which the phrase &apos;long-awaited&apos; was invented is due in the second quarter of the year. Finnish studio, Remedy Entertainment (previously responsible for the Max Payne series), is promising a riveting mission-based adventure following the eponymous suspense fiction writer as he tracks his missing wife. Elements of Silent Hill, Lost, the X-Files and Stephen King&apos;s The Dark Half are all detectable, and we can apparently expect a TV season-style roll-out of subsequent titles. Aliens vs Predator (Sega, PC, PS3, X360)Eleven years after the release of Rebellion&apos;s excellent PC shooter of the same name, the Oxford-based company is back with more horror FPS action. This time the narrative plays out on the planet BG-386 where colonists have discovered an ancient pyramid teeming with... well, you can probably guess. Players are able to attempt the solo campaign as a marine, alien or predator, plus there are multiplayer options ahoy. APB (EA, PC)An immense open-world MMO, pitching two groups - the criminals and the enforcers - against each other for control of a vast city. Players are able to create absolutely unique avatars before choosing a side and diving into 100-player battles. The real-time branching mission structure and high degree of customisation (you can modify everything from vehicles to sound effects) mark this out as an incredible technical achievement, but it&apos;s the enthralling street fights that&apos;ll have gamers addicted. Think World of Warcraft re-imagined as a Michael Mann urban thriller for the YouTube generation. Alpha Protocol (Sega, PC, PS3, X360)The fact that this modern day espionage thriller has been ricocheting around the Sega release schedule like a molten squash ball might not fill you with confidence, but developer Obsidian Entertainment has solid credentials (Knights of the Old Republic II, Neverwinter Nights 2) and the set up, which sees highly customisable secret agent Michael Thorton traveling the globe extinguishing threats to national security, is promising. Now safely scheduled for a Spring 2010 launch, let&apos;s give it the benefit of the doubt. Army of Two: The 40th Day (EA, PS3, PSP, X360)The original divided critics and gamers alike with its formative co-operative shooting action. Due out on January 15, the follow-up sees &apos;private military contractors&apos;, Salem and Rios, blasting their way through Shanghai. The multiplayer element has supposedly been totally overhauled, featuring four new modes including &apos;extraction&apos; which pits groups of pals against waves of enemy fighters.  Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (EA, PC, PS3, X360)The first game was a delightful mix of sandbox environments, squad-based shooting and destructible scenery. The sequel, due out on March 5, ups the ante on all of those (apparently you&apos;ll be able to bring down whole buildings as your enemies cower inside), as well as adding a weapon customisation system resulting in 200 different firearms, and a bunch of new vehicles including the UH-60 transport helicopter, which can transport your whole unit into the heart of the battle. This is going to be FUN. Bayonetta (Sega, PS3, Xbox 360)Hitting the highstreet on January 8, the latest hyper-kinetic brawler from Hideki Kamiya (the genius behind Viewtiful Joe and Devil May Cry) is a breathless Gothic masterpiece, sporting the most important female lead character since Lara Croft and a combat mechanic so intuitive and enjoyable you&apos;ll instantly re-discover your love of Japanese hack-&apos;n&apos;-slash adventures. Perfect scores from Edge and influential Japanese videogame mag, Famitsu, have added to the pre-release frenzy. Bioshock 2 (2K Games, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)Set for a global release on February 9, this hotly anticipated sequel, set ten years after the original undersea adventure, has a hell of a lot to live up to. Placing the player into the heavyweight boots of the the original Big Daddy prototype is an interesting place to start, and the plot, revolving around a new controller of the doomed Rapture kingdom, promises some typically intriguing twists.      Blazblue: Calamity Trigger (pQube, PS3, Xbox 360)Best known for its hardcore fighting game series Guilty Gear, Arc System Works is back with another cultish 2D pummeler, this time set in a distant post-apocalyptic future. The combat system looks to be one of the most complex game mechanics conceived in this genre for many years, producing a beat-&apos;em-up of genuine depth. Released last summer in Japan and the US, it garnered enough praise to ensure a UK release (March 5) courtesy of lesser known publisher, pQube. Blur (Activision, PC, PS3, X360)On paper, Bizarre Creations&apos; urban racer, complete with superstrength power-ups, pick-up-and-play controls and 50 licensed vehicles doesn&apos;t sound that awe-inspiring. But this is the company behind Project Gotham and Metropolis Street Racer; these guys tweak their driving engines to the absolute limit and playtest til their eyes pop out, so we can expect a smooth, thrilling mix of Burnout and Mario Kart - and who wouldn&apos;t want to give that a whirl? There&apos;s also a clever social networking interface allowing you to build friendships and rivalries with other drivers around the world. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (Konami, PS3, Xbox 360)This cooperative project between Madrid&apos;s Mercury Steam and Kojima Productions is a big re-invention of the Gothic platforming adventure series, revolving around new hero Gabriel seeking to save his wife&apos;s soul - and the planet - from the evil Lords of Shadow. Fans fear that this is a mere hack-&apos;n&apos;-slasher and that Mercury Steam hardly has a glowing back catalogue (er... Clive Barker&apos;s Jericho, American McGee Presents: Scrapland...), but Kojima wouldn&apos;t put his name to any old franchise reboot would he? Crackdown 2 (Microsoft, Xbox 360)David Jones&apos; chaotic open-world shooter returns, this time in the hands of Dundee studio Ruffian Games. Pacific City has been overrun by mutant freaks and the Agency is back to restore order. The single-player campaign should be vast and absorbing, while the multiplayer component seeks to exhume the spirit of Timesplitters with its exuberant OTT violence, offbeat modes and comic book visuals. Crysis 2 (EA, PC, PS3, X360)Crytek has revealed next to nothing about the second title in its trilogy of sci-fi first-person shooters, save that it&apos;ll be using the cutting edge CryEngine 3 technology, and it&apos;s the developer&apos;s first console title. Originally earmarked for a 2011 release on the next generation of console platforms, things have thankfully been brought forward. Allegedly. Dante&apos;s Inferno (EA, PS3, PSP, Xbox 360)Arriving on a flaming chariot next month, EA&apos;s God of War-beater (my words, not theirs) has taken Dante&apos;s allegorical masterpiece and converted it into a sword-swirling horror adventure. With a narrative penned by Will Rokos, responsible for the Oscar Winning script to Monster&apos;s Ball (and man, would that make a bizarre videogame), it is hoped this will be more than just a medieval hack-&apos;em-up with a convenient &apos;nine circles of hell&apos; level structure. Darksiders: Wrath of War (THQ, PS3, Xbox 360)While Bayonetta is getting a lot of the attention, it won&apos;t be the only potential must-buy released on January 8. This enthralling action RPG from THQ&apos;s Vigil Games studio puts you into the cloak and clomping blood-stained boots of War, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, as he explores a post-Armageddon Earth. The game has rightly attracted a Metacritic score of 91 and may be an incredibly early contender for &apos;unexpected gem of 2010&apos;. Dead to Rights: Retribution (Namco Bandai, PS3, Xbox 360)Leamington-based developer Volatile Games has been working on this reboot of Namco&apos;s cop adventure for a couple of years now, and with the company&apos;s high-end BlitzTech engine running the show, expect state-of-the-art 3D visuals. As for the plot, vice-cop Jack Slate and his AI dog, Shadow, must bring down a criminal empire currently dragging the dysfunctional Grant City into the slime. Prepare for lots of guns, unarmed combat and dog bites.      Disney Epic Mickey (Disney, Wii)In an unexpected creative twist, Deus Ex creator Warren Spector (now heading his own Junction Point studio) is conjuring a dark platforming adventure around the eponymous rodent, chucking him into a Cartoon Wasteland ruled over by the sorcerer named Yen Sid. Players can alter the environment by spreading paint or destructive thinner around using the Wii Remote, and must make individual choices about whether to help other &apos;toons or carve their own way through the world. Officially announced in October and slated for an autumn 2010 release, this could be Mickey&apos;s most groundbreaking appearance since Steamboat Willie. Fable III (Microsoft, Xbox 360)Apparently due in &apos;late 2010&apos;, the next instalment in Lionhead&apos;s fantasy adventure series is set fifty years after the second title and challenges you to claim the whole kingdom of Albion as its ruler. Inspired by the story arcs of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Queen Elizabeth I it&apos;s all about revolution and the nature of monarchy. In other words, will you be a nice king or a naughty king? Or a bit of both? Final Fantasy XIII (Square Enix, PS3, X360)Shifting over one million copies within 24 hours on its Japanese release, the latest mega opus in the Final Fantasy series is a typically expansive mythological romp, this time with the floating world of Cocoon at its cavernous centre. A refreshed battle system allows multiple simultaneous attacks to be slotted in on each turn, while the new summon system lets characters combine their skills with those of their Eidolons to immensely destructive effect. Hardcore fans are concerned about the game&apos;s allegedly linear design, but FF XIII oozes atmosphere from every pixel. It&apos;s here on March 9th so adventurers can make their own minds up. Ghost Trick (Capcom, Nintendo DS)From the creator of the beloved Ace Attorney series comes another quirky mystery adventure, this time starring a ghost named Sissel who must use his supernatural powers to protect the innocent living while investigating the circumstances of his own death. Apparently, his key ability is to manipulate objects in the material world, which he uses to prevent the deaths of other characters - a sort of phantasmagorical logic puzzle, wrapped up in an adventure game. The visuals are lovely too. God of War III (Sony, PS3)The final instalment in the mightily successful mythological adventure sees Kratos returning just once more to wreak revenge on the gods and destroy Olympus. Boasts a massively overhauled graphics engine, new weapons, new combat mechanics and rideable giant creatures... Surely one of the key PS3 releases so far? Gran Turismo 5 (Sony, PS3)Oh, you know the drill: the world&apos;s finest race tracks, 1000 of the most beautiful cars, online racing, night racing, aesthetic and mechanical damage, bleeding edge physics and visuals... And it&apos;s definitely, definitely arriving in March. No really.  Halo: Reach (Microsoft, Xbox 360)Autumn will see the latest addition to the Halo mega-franchise, this time a prequel to the original title, apparently set at the fag end of the human-covenant war (specifically, the cataclysmic Battle of Reach). It&apos;s an FPS, of course, and the trailer hints that the game follows a squad of six Spartan supersoldiers, so a team co-op component is likely. Heavy Rain (Sony, PS3)From French studio Quantic Dream, previously responsible for groundbreaking adventure titles Omikron: the Nomad Soul and Fahrenheit this narrative-focused psychological thriller follows a group of disparate, damaged people as they hunt down a serial murderer known as the Origami Killer. With a dense, branching story structure and some intriguing control mechanics Heavy Rain is certainly going to be unlike any other title released in 2010 - make of that what you will...Part two tomorrow!"}, {"sentences": ["Sadly, our dotage is more likely to resemble that of the couple in Tokyo Story, repeatedly given the brush-off by adult children who see them as a nuisance, or of poor old Umberto D, unable to pay his rent.", "Otherwise, Hollywood treats old people much as the kids treat their parents in Tokyo Story \u2013 it would rather not deal with them."], "tags": ["Film", "Older people", "Meryl Streep", "Dustin Hoffman", "Film industry", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-31T22:30:02Z", "title": "Anne Billson: Where are the older film leads in Hollywood?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/31/older-leads-film-meryl-streep", "article": "In a perfect world, we would all hit our 60s like Meryl Streep in It&apos;s Complicated \u2013 having affairs, baking croissants and adding extensions to our lovely Santa Barbara homes. Sadly, our dotage is more likely to resemble that of the couple in Tokyo Story, repeatedly given the brush-off by adult children who see them as a nuisance, or of poor old Umberto D, unable to pay his rent. Statisticians are predicting that, soon, a quarter of the UK population will be more than 60 years old, but we&apos;re unlikely ever to see a similar proportion of senior citizens in significant movie roles. In 2009 I watched roughly 320 films. Other than the aforementioned Streep, only three could be said to feature oldish leading characters: Hirokazu Koreeda&apos;s Still Walking, 71-year-old Dustin Hoffman getting it on with 49-year-old Emma Thompson in Last Chance Harvey (funny how no one noticed that particular age disparity), and Brad Pitt ageing backwards in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which I probably shouldn&apos;t count any more than I&apos;d count Twilight&apos;s Edward Cullen as a 100-year-old. In 2009, alas, the most memorable appearance by an actor of pensionable age was by 87-year-old Betty White, whose &quot;Native American&quot; dance in The Proposal was both patronising and cringe-making. Otherwise, Hollywood treats old people much as the kids treat their parents in Tokyo Story \u2013 it would rather not deal with them. Oldies, like small children, tend to be disposable plot devices (which usually means they propel the story forward by dying) or they&apos;re wheeled on as bless-their-cotton-socks phenomena whose every move and utterance, however witless, deserves a pat on the head. We&apos;re supposed to find it cute when they booze and chain-smoke, like 63-year-old Susan Sarandon in The Lovely Bones. Old people&apos;s aim in life, on those rare occasions when they&apos;re granted one, seems to be to rediscover their sex drive and behave like frisky teenagers (see Cocoon), presumably because its the only thing younger film-makers can conceive of older people wanting. But do old people want to see old people on screen? I ask this as someone who is galloping towards senescence at alarming speed, and already thinking of making a living will, which stipulates that when I&apos;m stuck in a nursing home without the power of speech, my wheelchair will not parked in front of endless reruns of Driving Miss Daisy. I&apos;d rather go gently into that good night watching Goodfellas and The Thing. The answer, surely, is that age doesn&apos;t matter if the story and characters are good enough. The Straight Story, starring 79-year-old Richard Farnsworth, was a rare high-profile film, which acknowledged that you&apos;re never too old to go on a road trip, and the critical and commercial success of Up, with its curmudgeonly widowed protagonist, indicates golden agers aren&apos;t necessarily box-office anathema for filmgoers of all\u00a0ages. Meanwhile, Christopher Plummer (just turned 80) isn&apos;t showing any signs of slowing down, with recent voice roles in Up and 9, and a barnstorming turn as Tolstoy in The Last Station. On the documentary front, Buena Vista Social Club and Ballets Russes, packed with lively octogenarians and nonagenarians, suggest the secret to mental and physical vigour isn&apos;t so much a swimming pool filled with alien pods as\u00a0a lifetime of creative activity. But I&apos;d like to see more genre films with protagonists who are less twinkly old codgers than vicious old fogies. There&apos;s already a flourishing thriller subgenre about tough guys with Alzheimer&apos;s, the most recent being Johnnie To&apos;s Vengeance, starring 66-year-old popster Johnny Hallyday as a French chef who keeps forgetting he&apos;s in Hong Kong to find the guys who murdered his\u00a0grandchildren. One of my own long-gestating dreams is a hard-boiled heist movie, a variation on Reservoir Dogs in which a bunch of OAPs are driven by pension scams and the callousness of offspring to plot an armed robbery, the catch being that each of them suffers from an age-related ailment. One character would be in a wheelchair, another would have bladder control problems, while another would be recovering from a stroke. This would not be played for laughs, believe me. It would be deadly serious."}, {"sentences": ["The rerelease of Ozu&apos;s 1953 classic \u00adTokyo Story is the centrepiece of a major \u00adretrospective at London&apos;s BFI Southbank, and the already towering reputation of this film and its director continues only to grow.", "In 2003, Hou Hsiao-hsien created an Ozu homage in his film Caf\u00e9 Lumiere, and last year \u00adGerman author and film-maker Doris \u00adD\u00f6rrie paid a direct tribute to Tokyo Story with her film Cherry Blossoms.", "An elderly couple attempt to visit their grownup children in \u00adTokyo, only to find that they are too busy to find any time for them."], "tags": ["Drama", "World cinema", "Film", "Tokyo Story"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-31T23:55:00Z", "title": "Tokyo Story | Film review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/31/tokyo-story-film-review", "article": "The rerelease of Ozu&apos;s 1953 classic \u00adTokyo Story is the centrepiece of a major \u00adretrospective at London&apos;s BFI Southbank, and the already towering reputation of this film and its director continues only to grow.
