Feeling delicate? It&apos;s okay - just sit down with a glass of orange juice and lemonade and gently peruse this second selection of promising games grappled from the 2010 release schedule (you can see part one here). I&apos;ve also included ten titles that sort of haven&apos;t actually been confirmed for this year, but might turn up anyway... And don&apos;t forget to correct/criticise my glaring omissions in the comments section! Agent (Rockstar, PS3)Oops, missed this out of yesterday&apos;s list, which was a huge oversight as Rockstar North&apos;s seventies conspiracy adventure may well be one of the key new IPs of the year (if it does indeed make it this year). We know absolutely nothing except that the development team has been influenced by the likes of The Conversation, Parallax View and All the President&apos;s Men, and that Take-Two CEO Ben Feder reckons it will be &quot;genre-defining&quot;. Lost in Shadow (Hudson, Wii)This idiosyncratic 2D-style platformer piqued the interest of many a jaded game journo at this year&apos;s E3. Players control a shadow boy who must navigate a Gothic tower by leaping between the shadows cast by scenic objects. On each screen, you&apos;re also able to control a fairy who re-directs light sources, thereby creating new paths and platforms. Vague comparisons are being made with Ico, so naturally there&apos;s a palpable sense of excitement around it. Here&apos;s a trailer. MAG (Sony, PS3)It&apos;s 2025 and private armies are engaging in a covert war to control the planet. Zipper Interactive&apos;s ambitious online shooter promises huge battles involving 256 players - but it&apos;s not a total free-for-all as sides are divided into squads, platoons and companies, all with commanding officers and mini-objectives. Combatants also earn experience points as they fight and apparently the leveling up system is one of the most exhaustive available. Could be PS3&apos;s multiplayer showcase for the year. Mass Effect 2 (EA, PC, Xbox 360)Commander Shepard is back on another suicidal space mission, filled with rounded-characters, narrative twists and exotic alien sex (well the odd interspecies snog, anyway). In December, Bioware co-founder Dr. Ray Muzyka told journalists that this could be the best game that his company has ever made - and he&apos;s one of those rare industry spokespeople who isn&apos;t prone to ridiculous over-statement. January 29 is the launch date. You might want to stick that in your diary. Medal of Honor (EA, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)In December, EA officially announced its reboot of the massively successful but recently over-shadowed WWII shooter series. However, this time (no doubt in a nod to Modern Warfare) the action takes place in the modern day - Afghanistan to be exact - with players controlling a Tier 1 Operator: a spec-ops soldier who takes on the missions no-one else can handle. Which is ironic, as the task of usurping Call of Duty at the head of the military FPS table would seem to be a similarly challenging. EA Los Angeles and EA DICE are working on the project together, though - a sign that the publisher is taking this battle very seriously indeed.       Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (Konami, PSP)Set in 1974, at the end of the cold war, Peace Walker is the direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and features a new story penned by series creator Hideo Kojima. It&apos;s typical MGS fare with stealth, gadgets and mad plans for world domination. The exciting addition is a co-operative multiplayer mode (or &apos;CO-operative OPerationS&apos; as Konami would have it) in which participants can do stuff like create decoys while their pals are sneaking about. To say this is the mainstream bright spot on the PSP release schedule is something of an understatement. In my opinion. It&apos;s out on May 28. Metroid: Other M (Nintendo, Wii)Certain to claim prizes for the least exciting subtitle of the year, Other M was briefly showcased at E3 earlier this year, with Nintendo of America chief Reggie Fils-Aime suggesting that we can expect a more traditional Metroid experience from this combined 2D and 3D adventure. Set between between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion, it&apos;s being co-developed with Team Ninja, the chaps behind the awesome Ninja Gaiden. Wii owners looking for more meaty gaming experiences in 2010 should put this straight on their pre-order list. Modnation Racers (Sony, PS3)Given the same &apos;Play, Create and Share&apos; branding as LittleBigPlanet, this kart racer from Vancouver studio United Front Games allows players to customise every element of the experience from the characters and cars to the tracks themselves; creations can then be shared with the community and rated by other users. The look, inspired by urban vinyl art and the designer toy craze, has the edgy kawaii feel of LBP, while the handling and power-ups have drawn favourable comparisons with Mario Kart. It&apos;s due on the starting grid in spring 2010...No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle (Rising Star/Ubisoft, Wii)Anime-obsessed killer Travis Touchdown once again finds himself at the bottom of the international assassins&apos; league table and must wage war on his rivals to reclaim the top spot. The original hyper-stylised action fest earned multiple awards and its wonderfully weird and talented creator, Grasshopper Manufacture, is unlikely to fumble the ball this time round. Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar, PS3, Xbox 360)The Old West is dying, the Mexican civil war is brewing and one ex-outlaw named John Marston has a few loose ends to tie up amid the chaos. Rockstar San Diego&apos;s open-world Western is drumming up plenty of excitement, not least for its absolutely beautiful visuals. GTA meets The Wild Bunch? Yee-harr!      Split/Second (Disney, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)Built around a futuristic reality TV narrative, this turbo-charged racer features a &apos;powerplay&apos; dynamic which lets you set up scenic traps and obstacles for rival drivers: the higher your powerplay meter, the more extravagant and destructive your set-piece becomes. Voted Best Racing Game at the E3 Game Critics Awards last summer, it&apos;s an interesting hybrid, combining the feisty arcade-style urban driving action of Need for Speed et al, with the environmental destruction of a modern shooter.Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty (Activision Blizzard, Mac, PC)Blizzard returns to the epic space war between the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg races in this keenly anticipated sequel. It&apos;s the same intricately balanced real-time battle strategy gameplay we all remember, but now with slick 3D visuals, lots of new units and of course, myriad multiplayer modes. The developer&apos;s Battle.net matchmaking system is also being totally overhauled for the release, so expect seamless online integration. Even better news - this is apparently only the first part in a mammoth Starcraft II trilogy... Star Wars: The Old Republic (LucasArts, PC)Having already triumphed in the Star Wars universe with its much-loved Knights of the Old Republic, Bioware is returning with a hugely ambitious MMO, set thousands of years before the George Lucas movies. Expect a richly realised world (just check out the encyclopedic website) with a strong narrative element as players forge their own path between the Old Republic and the evil Sith Empire. Almost certain to be the game of the year for Jedi fanatics. Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Nintendo, Wii)The arrival of Yoshi as a rideable charcater is surely NOT the main addition to Nintendo&apos;s sequel - it&apos;s just that we&apos;ve not heard much else, and interest is fervid after the heartening brilliance of the original 3D platformer. It also seems that several classic enemies and gameplay elements will be returning from Mario&apos;s previous adventures... Super Street Fighter IV (Capcom, PS3, Xbox 360)Offering eight extra characters, an enhanced Ultra Combo system, extended online play (with Team Battle and Endless Battle modes), rebalanced gameplay and the return of the SF II car and barrel bonus stages, Super Street Fighter IV is more than just an add-on pack - which is why it&apos;s being delivered as a budget priced retail release rather than DLC. Among the fresh fighters are old faves T. Hawk, DeeJay, Guy, Cody and Adon, plus there&apos;s a brand new female fighter - Juri - the first in SF history to use Tae Kwon Do. Bet that&apos;s got you excited. Unconfirmed/possible/rumoured 2010 releases...      The Agency (Sony, PC, PS3)Sony Online Entertainment&apos;s promising MMO thrusts gamers into the murky world of modern day espionage. Like APB it&apos;s effectively a multiplayer shooter taking place in a persistent online world - players can drop in and start taking out other superspies and mercenaries at any point, and there are co-operative options, too. We&apos;re promised a bounty of weapons, gadgets and exotic locations, but what still remains top secret is the release date. 2010 is being apprehensively whispered, but considering the teething troubles that Home went through, we&apos;ll believe it when we spy it. Battlefield 3 (EA, PC)While Battlefield: Bad Company and Battlefield 1943 have introduced console gamers to the delights of DICE&apos;s multiplayer-centric military shooter, Battlefield 3 is the next major leap forward for the series on its home platform, the PC. Little has been confirmed about the game, apart from that it&apos;s in development. We want more intel! Dead Space 2 (EA, PC, PS3, X360)Announced in December this sequel to 2008&apos;s survival horror shooter will see everyman hero Isaac Clarke taking the fight to the Necromorphs as their infection spreads out across the galaxy. Expect new weapons of messy destruction and some big plot twists - though with no firm release date on the event horizon, you may need to wait til 2011... Far Cry 3 (Ubisoft, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)Narrative designer Patrick Redding confirmed at August&apos;s Game Convention that a new Far Cry title was in the &apos;preliminary stages&apos; of development and would probably retain the African setting of its predecessor (more here). As &apos;preliminary stages&apos; now effectively means &apos;the first year and a bit&apos; in development parlance, 2010 might be a bit optimistic... Gears of War 3 (Microsoft, Xbox 360)We know it&apos;s in development, but on what platforms? Epic Games president Mike Capps seemed to hint at the Tokyo Game Show that it might be one for the next generation of consoles, but swiftly denied this later. Meanwhile, series designer Cliff Bleszinski has implied that it may contain RPG elements. But with no official announcements Q4 2010 is looking rather fanciful. L.A. Noire (Rockstar, PS3, Xbox 360)As the title subtly suggests, this is a Film Noir-style open-world thriller, seeking to recreate the Los Angeles of the &apos;40s and &apos;50s. It&apos;s being developed by Team Bondi, a studio headed by Brendan McNamara, the creator of Sony&apos;s gangsta shooter, The Getaway, and centres on a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders. That&apos;s about all we know, despite first hearing about the game in 2006. Rockstar has promised to reveal more soon, but the release date has already proved more slippy and elusive than an underworld crime boss. The Last Guardian (Sony, PS3)The much-anticipated follow up to Ico and Shadow of the Colossus is another mystical take on the third-person action adventure. You control a small boy who befriends a giant feathered creature and apparently must stealthily rescue it from armed guards, before using its abilities to thwart unnamed enemies. It&apos;s all very vague, but of course, the game looks beautiful and contains the elements of sensitivity and companionship that we expect from designer, Fumito Ueda. Given Team Ico&apos;s perfectionist approach 2010 is a probably a longshot. Mirror&apos;s Edge 2 (EA, TBC)Back in June, EA bigwig Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that developer DICE had a small team working on this sequel to one of the most controversial releases of 2008. If the chaps can tame the original&apos;s quirky controls it&apos;s sure to generate the sort of unguarded excitement critics couldn&apos;t bring themselves to apply first time around. Resistance 3 (Sony, PS3)Not officially announced yet, but October saw an interesting teaser - a billboard on the set of forthcoming disaster movie Battle: Los Angeles. With such a prominent piece of product placement, the latest chapter in Insomniac Games&apos; alien invasion FPS series is likely to launch alongside the film, which isn&apos;t due until 2011. But you never know. WarioWare D.I.Y (Nintendo, DS)http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/uorj/index.htmlReleased in Japan in April, but still without an official UK launch date (though the US will get it in March), the latest title in Nintendo&apos;s frantic minigame series allows players to create their own micro-challenges, designing the graphics and sound effects before sharing their questionable masterpieces with other DS users. There&apos;s a brief excerpt from the E3 presentation here. And a few I wrote but didn&apos;t have space for in the Top 50... Just Cause 2 (Square Enix, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)The original sandbox-style shooter, set on a Caribbean island under the rule of a corrupt dictator, pulled in mixed reviews, but this sequel looks to be much improved by Swedish developer Avalanche Studios. Once again stepping into the shoes of deep cover CIA operative Rico Rodriguez, you must now take down a military regime on the island of Panau, using an array of weapons, over 100 vehicles and a vast selection of gadgets. The key USP is a grapple and parachute system that lets you tag a ride on passing aircraft - and the ability to take on missions in any order, from whatever direction you fancy, is extremely zeitgeist-friendly. You can grapple with it on March 26. Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days (Square Enix, PC, PS3, X360)Okay, the first title was a bit of a mess - but it was a mess with a decent premise and some fun moments. The sequel, billed as a &apos;raw and brutal crime shooter&apos; set in the Shanghai underworld, looks to iron out its predecessor&apos;s troublesome control issues and graphical wrinkles, intriguingly opting for a visual style that references gritty documentary films and user-generated content. So lots of grainy, degraded footage of people falling off skateboards? I suspect not. Splatterhouse (Namco Bandai, PS3, X360)Namco&apos;s cult 1988 gorefest was a fast-&apos;n&apos;-nasty sidescrolling homage to slasher flicks like Friday 13th. The remake takes the original&apos;s plot (student hunts for girlfriend in monster-filled mansion) and adds a fresh arsenal of makeshift weapons, new acrobatic abilities, a wider set of locations and, of course, luscious 3D visuals. The development process has been troubled - original studio BottleRocket Entertainment was taken off the project some way in, only to be replaced by an internal team - but you can&apos;t go that wrong with a game that allows you to rip creatures in half while wearing a skull mask. Splinter Cell: Conviction (Ubisoft, PC, Xbox 360)Originally slated for a winter 2007 release, the latest covert-ops adventure from Ubisoft is finally slipping into shops on February 26. This time, Sam Fisher finds he&apos;s been betrayed by the Third Echelon agency and must defeat a major terrorist threat alone, while investigating the suspicious death of his daughter. Two new gameplay features &apos;Mark and Execute&apos; and &apos;Last Known Position&apos; promise to bring some fresh tactical elements to shoot-out set-pieces, while a separate co-op campaign provides a prequel to the single-player missions. It&apos;ll certainly be interesting to see how Ubisoft&apos;s old hero fares in a post-Assassin&apos;s Creed world..."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Story (U) (Yasujiro Ozu, 1953, Jap) Chishu Ryu, Chieko Higashiyama, Setsuko Hara.", "135 mins A frequent contender for the greatest movie ever made, Ozu&apos;s delicate but devastating masterpiece unearths deep, universal emotions around generational rifts and parent-child relationships, as an elderly couple travel to postwar Tokyo to visit their grown-up children, only to find they&apos;re all too busy."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-02T00:06:08Z", "title": "This week's new cinema previews", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/02/new-cinema-reviews-the-guide", "article": "Spread (18) (David Mackenzie, 2009, US) Ashton Kutcher, Anne Heche, Margarita Levieva. 97 mins Rising Scottish director Mackenzie (Young Adam, Hallam Foe) goes stateside, and like many before him, focuses on the soulless superficiality of the Los Angeles lifestyle. Some might say Kutcher playing an ambitious himbo who targets older women was hardly a stretch, but he proves he can actually act here, as he demonstrates his calculated seduction technique by hooking up with Anne Heche and installing himself in her luxurious apartment. But then he meets his match (Levieva), and might just be falling in love, which is where the story starts to come apart a little, ultimately being neither sufficiently deep nor superficial. Still, it&apos;s a stylish, contemporary satire with a few surprises up its sleeve \u2013 or should that be down its pants? Did You Hear About The Morgans? (PG)(Marc Lawrence, 2009, US) Sarah Jessica Parker, Hugh Grant, Sam Elliott. 104 mins Even if you&apos;ve heard nothing about the Morgans, you&apos;ll know pretty much everything that happens to Grant and Parker&apos;s divorcing Manhattan couple here. They&apos;re city folk marooned together in deepest cowboy country as part of a spurious witness-protection programe. Will they rekindle their passion and re-enact wearisome sketches from other fish-out-of-water movies? Do Grant-bothering bears stumble out of the woods? I&apos;m Gonna Explode (15) (Gerardo Naranjo, 2008, Mex) Juan Pablo de Santiago, Maria Deschamps, Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho. 104 mins Not so much taking a leaf out of Godard&apos;s book as cribbing huge passages from it, this youthful Mexican movie at least pours some energy into what could have been an overfamiliar lovers-on-the-run tale. Having faked a kidnapping, rebellious teens without a cause Rom\u00e1n and Maru actually camp out on the roof of Rom\u00e1n&apos;s father&apos;s mansion and create their own private fantasy world \u2013 for a time at least. Restlessly shot and paced, it&apos;s appropriately chaotic and attention deficient, and destined to end in tears. Post Grad (12A) (Vicky Jenson, 2009, US) Alexis Bledel, Zach Gilford, Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch, Carol Burnett. 89 mins The travails of a perky Californian graduate failing to get a job and forced to return to the bosom of her &quot;eccentric&quot; (ie perfectly nice) family \u2013 this is hardly a pressing must-see, but it&apos;s at least a screwball romance that doesn&apos;t rely on gimmicks. Pity it&apos;s so determined to manufacture a happy ending \u2013 it loses all credibility. Tokyo Story (U) (Yasujiro Ozu, 1953, Jap) Chishu Ryu, Chieko Higashiyama, Setsuko Hara. 135 mins A frequent contender for the greatest movie ever made, Ozu&apos;s delicate but devastating masterpiece unearths deep, universal emotions around generational rifts and parent-child relationships, as an elderly couple travel to postwar Tokyo to visit their grown-up children, only to find they&apos;re all too busy.

I liked the island so much I wrote the original Rough Guide to Ibiza, a wonderful, intoxicating and exhausting project that must rank as about as much fun as you can have on planet Earth in the name of a job. But times have changed and my love for the White Isle has faded as bling has replaced boho and the club scene has become increasingly predictable. It has also become insanely expensive: entrance to Pacha cost \u20ac64 (\u00a357) on my last trip, and a beer was \u20ac10. I have been increasingly drawn to Indonesia, first to Bali and later to the tiny tropical island of Gili Trawangan, whose zeitgeist is right here, right now. Just as Ibiza&apos;s halcyon days were in the early 60s (when the first wave of beatniks arrived) and the late 80s (when acid house exploded), this tiny island off the north-west of larger Lombok is shaking off its reputation as a backpacker hangout and starting to register with a hip crowd from Asia and Europe. The scene is quite raw, unpretentious and hedonistic, with stylish bars, vibrant nightlife, a hip hotel or two and very decent diving. Designers from Hong Kong and fashionistas from Tokyo mix with travellers from the UK, scuba nuts and Indonesian creative types. A veritable speck in the tropics \u2013 the island is just a couple of miles long and a mile across \u2013 Trawangan is an hour or so by fast boat from Bali. (It&apos;s also 1,500 miles from the earthquake-hit Padang area of Sumatra and was completely unaffected by the devastating quake there three months ago.) All the desert island clich\u00e9s are present and correct: dazzling white-sand beaches fringed by coconut palms, turquoise waters and a coral reef. It&apos;s still possible to live the tropical dream \u2013 snorkelling, feasting on fresh seafood, then lounging or dancing under the stars \u2013 for a fistful of Indonesian rupiah. But if your budget is bigger and your comfort zone narrower, there are some superb new accommodation options. Seriously stylish thatched-roofed cabins (most built in local &quot;rice barn&quot; style) are replacing creaky old A-frame huts. Expect polished timber floors, hand-carved beds with gorgeous linen, and open-air bamboo-walled bathrooms. Those at Dream Village (around \u20ac50 a night) have front decks facing the island&apos;s best sandy beach. Of course, there are plenty of idyllic islands in south-east Asia with decent hotels and a lively bar or two. Gili Trawangan&apos;s trump card is that there is no traffic: no cars, motorbikes or motorised transport at all. Not one moped. Nada. This is not accidental; locals have opted for relatively sustainable development, determined to avoid the mistakes that have turned southern Bali&apos;s paddy fields into a traffic hell. The only way to get around is aboard a cidamo \u2013 a kind of horse-and-cart &quot;taxi&quot; \u2013 on foot, or by bicycle. You can walk around the entire shoreline in a couple of hours along a delightful path that meanders between coconut palms. Trawangan may be increasingly prosperous but the atmosphere remains bohemian, with a sandy high street where magic mushrooms (&quot;Take you to bloody heaven and back \u2013 no transport necessary&quot;) are on sale alongside hand-made jewellery and sarongs. The main drag has rickety timber warung (canteens) rustling up nasi goreng (Indonesian fried rice) juxtaposed with sleek bars such as the \u00fcber-stylish British-owned Horizontal, with its decadent cocktail list and modern menu. At night these beachfront bars play lounge music and chilled electronic tunes next to the waves, while later the action gravitates to one of the designated party venues \u2013 Friday nights at Rudy&apos;s are a blast, the dancefloor bouncing to pumping house and trance. There are no entry fees to these low-key raves, which are packed with an unlikely mix of living-the-dream travellers, Asian clubbers and long-haired Trawangan beach boys. Until a year or two ago, a party night in Trawangan meant an excess of industrial-style repetitive beats courtesy of a local DJ of dubious repute. Times have changed, and now DJs over from Bali often spin the discs, with the odd superstar turntablist dropping by \u2013 Timo Maas played here in 2009. Globally renowned DJs are prepared to play the Gilis for free, revelling in the joy of playing to a relaxed crowd on a dream beach. During the day, most people gravitate to the coral reef that fringes Trawangan and its two neighbouring islands. Trawangan&apos;s marine environment is on the road to recovery after years of overfishing (and the effects of El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-8, when soaring water temperatures bleached the coral). Four years ago the islands&apos; six scuba diving schools cut a deal with locals to safeguard the reef. Fishermen would be paid not to fish in the area, and it was hoped that marine life would recolonise the coral. The effects are remarkable. Not only have the top predators (metre-long white and black-tip reef sharks) returned in numbers but smaller species (including ghostly looking pipefish and several types of sea horse) are prolific, too. Scuba-nuts can be fairly sure of spotting turtles, and vast schools of lumbering bumphead parrotfish cruise by on full-moon evenings, gobbling up coral spawn. The sea is usually so clear that it&apos;s possible to pick out individual grains of sand as you snorkel offshore. In tandem with the fishing embargo, a reef regeneration project called Biorock ensures that stray or loose living corals are collected and transplanted onto frames beneath the sea. Electrodes supplied with low-voltage currents cause electrolytic reactions, accelerating coral growth and ultimately creating an artificial reef. These Biorock installations are just off the main beach, at a depth of about eight metres, and make a great snorkelling experience, with clown fish darting in and out of the coral and purple-and-yellow nudibranch sea slugs clinging to the embryonic reef. The fishing moratorium has been a great success but it has created a cultural conundrum. Trawangan was uninhabited 50 years ago; the first settlers were Bugis fishing people from the island of Sulawesi. Their descendants&apos; way of life is now very much tied to tourism rather than fishing. Virtually all locals are Muslim, and it&apos;s good to respect sensibilities. Bikinis on the beach are fine (though topless sunbathing is a no-no) but it&apos;s best to wrap a sarong round your waist for strolling around. Alcohol is widely available and though most locals fast during Ramadan, and parties are suspended for the month, visitors are free to consume food and drink (including alcohol). Party head or not, the island remains a delightful place to kick back for a week or so, spending days horizontal in a hammock, or suspended over a coral reef, snorkel in mouth. And if Trawangan sounds a tad too developed, consider one of the other two Gili islands: Meno is totally tranquil, with a population of just 300 or so, while Air has a little more going on, with a strip of beach restaurants, though no nightlife. EssentialsQatar Airways (0870 389 8090; qatarairways.com/uk) has flights to Bali from \u00a3564. From Bali several companies offer fast boat connections (US$110-$130 return) direct to Gili Trawangan.

The reception is made to feel like a drawing room, with just one person on the desk, and along with my room key I was handed a ticket for a complimentary Bacardi cocktail and a VIP pass to the Shanghai nightclub in the basement. Stylish and slightly eccentric, Le Monde offers three choices of bar \u2013 Milan, close to the entrance; the grander Vienna; and Paris, a cocktail bar on the first floor. Milan was buzzing with an early-evening crowd of Edinburgh&apos;s elite. Be sure to make a note of your room number, because you won&apos;t find it on your key and the Bacardi might go to your head. THE ROOMS The great Georgian high ceilings and careful styling make for the sort of bedrooms you really want to hang out in. There are 18 to choose from, each named after a city and decorated accordingly. I had a peek in a few, and particularly liked the bright turquoise walls in Cairo, and the mock Louis XIV furnishings in Paris \u2013 which is a favourite for courting couples and, bizarrely, hen nights. (Apparently the girls pile in and take full advantage of the in-room hair straighteners before heading downstairs to the club). This is definitely a special-occasion hotel, and we were celebrating our engagement in Tokyo, one of its junior suites. It&apos;s a dark, moody room, with black the prevailing colour. Its huge bathroom has a sunken tub \u2013 although I gave up on my second attempt to run a bath as the water was coming out yellow and the battery had run down in the remote control for the bathroom telly. Obviously nobody has had \u00a3195 to stump up for this room for some time. THE FOOD I loved it: it was healthy, aromatic and reasonably priced. As it was a Sunday night, we dined in Vienna. (We could also have eaten in Milan, but the more intimate Paris brasserie is open only on Friday and Saturday nights). Vienna serves bistro-type food (not just sauerkraut and sausage, I&apos;m glad to say) along with an innovative international tapas menu. The latter are keenly priced \u2013 &quot;any three for \u00a35&quot; \u2013 so you could have the very unlikely combination of Stornaway black pudding and chorizo, Thai green curry and mini haggis parcels. We shared a steamed cod from the main menu (\u00a311.95), which came with lemongrass butter and a very green salad of peas, sugar snaps, dill, chervil, chives, coriander and capers.

Ironically, it was this prevailing mood of doom and gloom left over from 2008 that helped give equity markets a boost. The year started with an overall feeling that things could be set to get worse, and this was factored into share prices and valuations. Then when macro-economic factors improved, share prices started to climb. Investors who pulled out of the market in droves during 2008 also started to return after realising the poor interest rates they were earning on their cash on deposit looked set to continue for the long-term. However, 2010 may well be a different and altogether more difficult story. Much of the recovery in 2009 has been down to quantitive easing and with less government money around to prop up the economy, combined with more unemployment and continuing difficulties in the retail sector in particular, it will be much harder to make successful investment choices in the new year. Here, Cash reviews the winners and losers of 2009 and asks the experts for their recommendations for 2010. Winners Two funds from Close Asset Management \u2013 Close Special Situations and Close Beacon \u2013 were runaway winners, gaining 239.5% and 181.3% respectively during 2009. But, as with many of the others in the top 10, last year&apos;s spectacular performances are partly recovery from a poor 2008. Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown said last year&apos;s league tables are largely a reversal of 2008&apos;s: &quot;The top performers in 2008 were defensive like Newton, Invesco Perpetual and Aberdeen.&quot; In 2009, however, it was the higher risk ones who did well. The key to good performance in 2009 was commodities or Latin America: many of the leaders had a heavy weighting in mining, gold and other resource stocks \u2013 at Close Beacon, for example, these sectors are more than a quarter of the fund \u2013 or a big holding in Brazil, one of the year&apos;s best-performing markets. Losers Those managers who stuck with more defensive type stocks largely missed out on the year&apos;s bull market. That includes many of the income funds which are investors&apos; favourites. Neil Woodford, one of the most respected UK fund managers with an excellent long-term record, came in 1,030th out of 1,321 with his Invesco Perpetual Income fund, with an 8.7% return. This reflected his dislike of commodities and financials. Healthcare and utilities account for more than third of his fund. Tony Nutt, manager of Jupiter Income, did only slightly better. But these funds have not been written off by advisers, who are more concerned with their long-term track record. Justin Modray, who runs Candidmoney.com, points out that Woodford has had periods of underperformance before and bounced back: &quot;Despite lagging peers this year Woodford will probably, as usual, end up having the last laugh.&quot; Japan proved to be an even worse bet than defensive stocks. Investment funds specialising in the country once again propped up the bottom of the performance tables, accounting for all 10 of the worst-performing funds in the last year \u2013 and, indeed, virtually all the bottom 50 \u2013 as the Tokyo stock market passed the 20th anniversary of the market&apos;s peak. The average Japanese fund fell 2.9% in 2009, a vintage year for equities virtually everywhere else, and has lost 36% over the last decade. The worst-performing \u2013 Legal &amp; General Japanese \u2013 was down 12.4%, according to figures from trustnet.com. It is hard to find anyone with a good word to say about the Japanese market: every time the Nikkei shows some signs of recovery, the rise has been followed by a further lurch downwards and the market remains only a little above its lowest point in two decades. New year The experts agree that predicting the winners for 2010 is harder than ever given the uncertainty over everything from economic recovery to the duration of the government support packages which are in place across the world. Tim Cockerill, head of research at Rowan, plumps for funds which have been consistent performers and particularly likes M&amp;G Recovery, saying the financial crisis has provided &quot;plenty of opportunities&quot; for manager Tom Debell&apos;s approach. &quot;He invests in companies that are in difficulty, but which he believes will recover. He holds them through the critical to recovery to healthy stages and then sells them, making room for new investments on the critical list.&quot; He also picks Gartmore European Select Opportunities \u2013 an unpopular region at the moment but, says Cockerill: &quot;Europe has some quality global companies \u2013 it may not set the world alight but steady and consistent is going to be important next year to get good and as predictable a return as possible.&quot; Brian Dennehy, managing director of Dennehy Weller, highlights Jupiter India and Newton Asian Income. On the former, he says: &quot;The main driver over the [next] decade will be the demographic dividend, unique in the world. It can be expressed simply: India is home to 25% of all those in the world aged under 25.&quot; And, while British companies have been cutting their dividends, he points out that Asian companies are embracing the dividend culture \u2013 and their rapidly growing profits means they can keep increasing their payouts. Modray warns that the outlook for 2010 is &quot;very uncertain. Future returns will depend more heavily on economic fundamentals, which are all rather depressing in most Western markets. Emerging markets and commodities still offer some appeal, but high potential volatility means investors should really view them as a long-term play.&quot; He recommends Woodford&apos;s Invesco Perpetual High Income because his &quot;defensive stance should bode well over the next couple of years&quot; and Aberdeen Emerging Markets. &quot;Run by a large, experienced management team at Aberdeen who tend to be fairly conservative, a positive factor when investing in high risk markets. The portfolio is well spread across global emerging markets with Brazil and India currently the two largest holdings and around 80% of the fund invested in large companies.&quot; But for those who are worried that the stock market rally has already gone too far, Modray adds: &quot;Putting your money in a high interest savings account doesn&apos;t seem a bad idea right now if you can&apos;t stomach risk.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["About 200 luxury watches worth an estimated 300 million yen (\u00a32m) were stolen in an audacious raid on a jewellery shop in Tokyo&apos;s upmarket Ginza district at the height of the new year sales.", "&quot;Whoever did this bored a hole into a concrete wall \u2013 the noise must have been quite loud,&quot; said Shinya Watanabe, a spokesman for the Tokyo metropolitan police.", "Yesterday was the start of Tokyo&apos;s new year sale season, with thousands of bargain-hunters flocking to department stores and shops offering large discounts on designer brands.", "It is located in the heart of the Ginza, Tokyo&apos;s busiest high-class shopping district, which takes its name from the silver coin mint that occupied this tract of land from 1612 to 1800."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-03T00:06:08Z", "title": "Hole-in-the-wall thieves escape with watches worth \u00a32m", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/03/tokyo-hole-in-wall-theft", "article": "About 200 luxury watches worth an estimated 300 million yen (\u00a32m) were stolen in an audacious raid on a jewellery shop in Tokyo&apos;s upmarket Ginza district at the height of the new year sales.

Though police were unclear as to exactly when the theft occurred, a security guard monitoring the Tenshodo store on Friday afternoon did not see anything unusual.

Amazingly, he seems to be becoming more optimistic about his situation. With a Twitter account and a mobile phone, he has set up a global network to support his campaign to return to China after having been denied entry eight times by the authorities. &quot;I&apos;m the most wretched lucky man in the world,&quot; he tweeted. Feng created a whole new way of life, following in the footsteps not only of real historical figures such as Gandhi and Martin Luthur King, but also fictional characters like Tom Hanks in The Terminal and Neo in The Matrix. He has gained thousands of supporters from across the world. The old-fashioned Chinese government still can&apos;t understand how a microblogging site can provide such power. It doesn&apos;t seem to have realised that the world is moving into a new age, in which everyone is connected \u2013 and in which you won&apos;t be able to use sovereignty to claim your border anymore. That&apos;s the trend in the coming decade. You have the capability to see anyone in the world, or be seen by others if your words really have value. This triggers my reflection on nationality, once a most important part of our social identity. I was told by my balance sheet that I have spent more than 6,000 US dollars in the past five years to apply for visas from China to the US. Over the same period I made more than 5,000 friends from all over the world via the internet. Sometimes, when I&apos;m in an internet cafe, the only thing to remind me that I&apos;m still in China is that I have to turn on a proxy to access the thousands of blocked websites. But even then, I&apos;m just a few clicks away from the status of non-nationality again. In this way, the country&apos;s border has been disrupted and won&apos;t be easily restored. Technology matters, but the more important thing is whether people will be more open to sharing. I call it &quot;sharism&quot;. The new spirit can help one person to make his or her thoughts known and plug into global social networks. Without doubt, the media world will be changed because of such paradigm shift \u2013 as will sovereignty. Those who believe in a top-down approach will still try hard to maintain a hierarchy so that they can keep their authority. But I&apos;m sure they will learn many lessons as they begin to face the reality of losing their power. A purely top-down structure can destroy itself, whether we&apos;re talking about a country or a small organisation. It&apos;s sad for some in the short term, but best for all human beings as we evolve towards the vision of a global brain. I get the feeling that Feng Zhenghu is not fighting for himself, and not even to return to his home country. Instead, he is campaigning for the freedom of identity. After declining refugee status from the UN, he is actually a digital nomad now.

JAL has been dogged by rumours that it could file for bankruptcy, causing its shares last week to plunge by more than a quarter. The national carrier is heading for its fourth annual loss in five years as a result of the slump in air travel, inefficiency and an unwieldy pension scheme. If it does file for bankruptcy it would be one of the largest failures in Japan&apos;s history. The airline has been seeking a bail-out from the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp of Japan (ETIC), which is expected to make a decision on whether to support the airline this month. The ETIC, a state-backed fund established to inject capital into and buy the debt of struggling but viable firms, has told JAL&apos;s main creditors it favours a bankruptcy proceeding as part of its rescue package. The ETIC is expected to ask JAL to cut 9,000 jobs and scrap 45 domestic and international routes in return for capital. The government in Tokyo asked the Development Bank of Japan to double its existing 100bn yen (\u00a3665m) commitment facility to JAL today after ministers \u2013 including Seiji Maehara, transport minister, and Naoto Kan, deputy prime minister \u2013 met for crisis talks to discuss how Tokyo could further support the troubled carrier. JAL has already used up about 55bn yen (\u00a3365m) of the facility. The increased credit line is aimed at allaying fears among JAL&apos;s suppliers and creditors about the airline&apos;s financial stability. In an interview published today, JAL&apos;s president, Haruka Nishimatsu, said he was against a bankruptcy proceeding under a state restructuring plan and had no plans to completely withdraw the carrier from overseas flights as several Japanese cabinet ministers have demanded. &quot;The image [of bankruptcy] would affect us and we would lose customers,&quot; Nishimatsu said. &quot;If we lose recognition from customers, restructuring would be difficult and this will trouble the ETIC too. I don&apos;t understand why they want a court-sponsored rehabilitation. I myself believe we can [restructure sufficiently] without such a method so I would like [the ETIC] to understand that.&quot; JAL&apos;s main private bank creditors are also believed to be opposed to a court-sponsored rehabilitation, which would impose more onerous terms on them than a settlement agreed out of court. Nishimatsu also said he would prefer a link-up with US carrier Delta Air Lines and its Sky Team alliance as the carrier&apos;s overseas partner to its current ties with American Airlines and the oneworld alliance. JAL has said it will make a decision on which overseas partner it will choose by early January. Both US airlines have made rival offers of financial aid, keen to gain a greater foothold in Japan and access to JAL&apos;s network to the rest of Asia. Despite being burdened by unprofitable international routes, Nishimatsu ruled out a complete withdrawal from overseas flights, saying Asian routes offered business opportunities.

But takings of \u00a35.94m on its third weekend go far beyond expectations. For comparison, third-weekend takings on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \u2013 by some distance, 2009&apos;s biggest UK box office hit \u2013 were \u00a32.92m. After 17 days on release, Avatar has taken a nifty \u00a332.82m, but it&apos;s the film&apos;s earnings potential, rather than sums grossed so far, that have got the industry excited. The 17-day figure is hardly record-breaking, but much more significant is that Avatar has hardly dipped from its opening weekend of \u00a36.67m; until it starts showing declines, it&apos;s impossible to project a final figure. And if Bafta and Oscar nominations follow, it will help Avatar reach that broad demographic that almost never visits the cinema \u2013 the Titanic/Mamma Mia! audience. This weekend Avatar took \u00a34.9m from the 300 UK cinemas with 3D screens (about 120 of those venues have more than one 3D screen), \u00a3713,000 from 418 2D cinemas, and \u00a3282,000 from nine Imax sites. To make comparisons easier, site averages are as follows: \u00a331,353 in Imax 3D; \u00a316,340 in regular 3D; and \u00a31,705 in 2D. It&apos;s fair to say that consumers have expressed a preference. The runners-upWhen one movie feasts at the box office, rival titles may experience a famine. But that&apos;s not the case right now, with Sherlock Holmes and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel both in rude health. Guy Ritchie&apos;s Victorian-era buddy flick opened on Boxing Day, grossing \u00a33.08m in two days. In the seven days since then, the film has added another \u00a38.94m, for a nine-day total of \u00a312.02m. That&apos;s very much in line with totals after two weekends for 2009 summer blockbusters X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Star Trek, and ahead of Terminator: Salvation and Angels and Demons at the same stage of release. Sherlock Holmes is already close to the lifetime total of Ritchie&apos;s previous biggest hit, Snatch. Backers 20th Century Fox opted for an unconventional release for The Squeakquel, rolling into cinemas on a Monday (21 December). The film has taken \u00a312.59m in 13 days of release, compared to \u00a33.65m in its first 10 days for the original Alvin and the Chipmunks. The Squeakquel has faced negligible competition for the family audience, unless you count St Trinian&apos;s 2: The Legend of Fritton&apos;s Gold. Fox&apos;s dating of Avatar on 17 December had the felicitous benefit of encouraging Disney to release its A Christmas Carol unseasonally early (on 6 November): the Dickens animation was positioned to grab the box office from 3D screens well in advance of Cameron&apos;s juggernaut. But with A Christmas Carol already a weary veteran by mid-December, the holiday family audience was there for the taking, and Alvin cleaned up. Still, no complaints from Disney: A Christmas Carol has just passed \u00a320m. The also-ransThere can&apos;t have been many smiles at the UK distributor of Nowhere Boy when the opening weekend numbers arrived: \u00a3148,000 from 172 screens over the 26-27 December period. That&apos;s a two-day rather than a three-day figure since cinemas are closed on Christmas Day, but, even so, it was hardly a propitious start. Matters have now improved, with a 59% increase this weekend, and a nine-day total of \u00a3749,000 for the teen John Lennon tale. But given that Ian Curtis biopic Control grossed \u00a3596,000 in 10 days from a compact 82 screens back in 2007, it&apos;s reasonable to wonder whether Icon&apos;s aggressively wide release of its film, expensive TV ads and all, is a tad optimistic.  Nine, which is benefiting from an even more aggressive marketing campaign, isn&apos;t faring so well, either. The Rob Marshall musical managed \u00a3269,000 on the Dec 26-27 weekend from 123 screens, and following its expansion to 384 cinemas has now grossed \u00a31.65m. Comparisons with Marshall&apos;s previous musical Chicago are tricky, since the two films expanded from platform debuts at different rates, but this much we know: Chicago grossed \u00a31.98m on its first weekend of wide release, from 276 screens; Nine grossed \u00a3780,000 from its first full weekend, from 384.  The Bollywood hitOnly one Bollywood film cracked \u00a31m in 2009 \u2013 Love Aaj Kal, starring Saif Ali Khan. However 3 Idiots has already taken \u00a31.12m after just 10 days of release. The Aamir Khan comedy is the best UK result for a Bollywood release since Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, starring Shahrukh Khan, grossed \u00a31.5m in December 2008. The losersWith holdover titles Avatar, Sherlock Holmes and The Squeakquel dominating the charts, it was thin pickings for new releases, especially raunchy Ashton Kutcher drama Spread and Alexis Bledel comedy Post Grad. The latter managed a screen average of just \u00a3357, but we can&apos;t imagine its distributor Twentieth Century Fox had time to be depressed, given the \u00a345m it has grossed so far with Avatar and Alvin. Hugh Grant/Sarah Jessica Parker romcom Did You Hear About the Morgans? fared better, with a not-disgraceful \u00a31.16m from 399 cinemas. The futureWhile 2009 represents the UK&apos;s best ever year for cinema box office, 2010 has begun in even sturdier style, with the market an impressive 25% ahead of the equivalent weekend from last year, when Yes Man, Bedtime Stories, Madagascar 2, Australia, Twilight and The Spirit all managed grosses of \u00a31m-plus. This weekend, Meryl Streep comedy It&apos;s Complicated should connect with the one audience that isn&apos;t being effectively targeted by current hits \u2013 older females \u2013 while less-predictable outcomes await Ethan Hawke vampire flick Daybreakers, rock biopic Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll and Viggo Mortensen post-apocalypse drama The Road.

Asked by a fan about John&apos;s &quot;quirks&quot;, Ono spent almost 150 words talking about the way he took his tea: &quot;John was very particular about how to make English Breakfast tea. He told me that you are supposed to put the tea bag in first and the hot water over it, so the tea would not get cold. I thought it was logical, and followed it for quite a few years. When I made a mistake and put the tea bag in after the hot water, he would recognise it. In early 1980, he told me that that was not how you were suppose to make tea at all! Mimi over the phone, [had] just told him that the tea bag was to be put in after the hot water was in. We had a laugh.

Ono also announced yesterday that she will pledge approximately \u00a334,000 toward the survivors of tropical storm Ketsana, which hit the Philippines in September.

He and a dozen friends are lured to Kukizaki park by a new interest in keeping fit, their exertions punctuated by peals of laughter that echo across the deserted children&apos;s playground nearby. There are no dumbbells or treadmills at the park in Tsukuba, a university town north of Tokyo, just a few pieces of equipment specially designed to strengthen muscles and improve posture and balance. If those sound like modest goals, it is because most of these amateur athletes are in their 70s. They are part of a growing band of Japanese retirees who are taking over public parks that were once the preserve of toddlers and their mothers. The boom in workout classes and exercise equipment for &quot;silver&quot; athletes is being fuelled by Japan&apos;s skewed demographics. More than a fifth of the country&apos;s 127 million people are aged over 65 \u2013 including 40,000 centenarians \u2013 while the declining birthrate means 40% of Japanese will be above retirement age by the middle of the century. In suburban playgrounds that once reverberated to the sound of children at play, you are as likely to find a group of septuagenarians doing pushups, stretching, and feeling their way across knobbly reflexology mats. Faced with the longest life expectancy in the world, a ballooning public debt and a soaring welfare bill, Japan is hoping that regular, if gentle, exercise will keep more over-65s out of retirement homes and hospitals. &quot;We built these exercise areas to promote fitness among senior citizens and, we hope, bring down healthcare costs,&quot; says Hiroko Asano, of Tsukuba council&apos;s senior services division. &quot;We show beginners how to use the equipment, and then leave them to it. The idea is that they can come any time, alone or with friends, and make it part of their routine.&quot; Tsukuba&apos;s two special fitness parks, which opened last month at a cost of 3m yen (\u00a320,000) each, are already proving popular with the town&apos;s older residents. &quot;It&apos;s a lot more fun to work out with friends,&quot; says Hosoe, a 74-year-old former civil servant. &quot;It&apos;s not just about wanting to stay fit into old age, but about having a laugh and helping each other out.&quot; Nationwide, the number of pieces of workout equipment for the elderly has tripled since the late 1990s to well over 15,000, according to the government. While the proportion of children under 13 who make daily visits to neighbourhood playgrounds fell from 50% in 1971 to 34% in 2007, the number of elderly people using them has doubled. The parks also perform a crucial social service in a country where an increasing number of people live alone. By 2025 more than a fifth of households will comprise an elderly person living alone or an elderly couple, according to the national institute of population and social security research in Tokyo. &quot;The reason is the trend towards marrying late or not at all, and the fact that many elderly people will live alone rather than with their children after their spouse dies,&quot; the institute&apos;s Hachiro Nishioka said. Few of the people who work out at Kukizaki or any of Japan&apos;s dozens of other renovated parks harbour ambitions to emulate 74-year-old Tsutomu Tosaka, Japan&apos;s &quot;masters&apos; bodybuilding&quot; champion. &quot;This isn&apos;t a cardiovascular workout,&quot; says Masato Saijo, director of a physical fitness association that has installed equipment in several parks where swings and climbing frames have fallen into disrepair. &quot;The idea is to work on important muscles that are at risk of atrophying in old age. After we teach them how to use the equipment they&apos;re on their own. It teaches them to be more independent. &quot;Japanese society tends to view old people as precious objects who need to be kept indoors and spoiled. But the best way to stay healthy and active is to spend more time outside. We are animals after all.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Yet we memorialise Hiroshima but not Tokyo, where 100,000 were killed in March 1945."], "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Nuclear weapons", "Controversies", "US news", "Renewable energy", "Counter-terrorism policy", "US foreign policy", "Foreign policy", "Food safety", "Agriculture", "Energy", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Science"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-07T20:00:00Z", "title": "The proliferation of nuclear panic is politics at its most ghoulish | Simon Jenkins", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/07/nuclear-power-weapons-radiation-defence", "article": "Some books are written to be read, others to be put in a cannon and blasted at the seat of power. Two such blasts have just crossed my desk, from academics on either side of the Atlantic. Both are on the same subject, the consequence of the irrational fear of radiation. The first book, Radiation and Reason, is by an Oxford professor of physics, Wade Allison. It narrates the history and nature of nuclear radiation, culminating in an attack on the obsessive safety levels governing nuclear energy. These overstate the true risk, in Allison&apos;s view, by up to 500 times, thus rendering nuclear prohibitively expensive and endangering the combat of global warming. The second is Atomic Obsession by John Mueller, professor of political science at Ohio State University. Mueller describes the toxic fear associated with radiation from nuclear weapons. It distorts the balance of international relations and senselessly makes enemies of friends. The books jointly undermine conventional wisdom on the two greatest political challenges of the day, in the fields of energy and defence. As such, they are sensational. Radiation, says Allison, is nothing like as dangerous as the anti-nuclear lobby and its paranoid regulators claim. The permitted radiation level in the waste storage hall at Sellafield is so low (1 mSv per hour) as to be negligible, a figure achieved at vast cost in construction and inspection. This compares with the 100 mSv threshold for even remote cancer risk and 5,500 for radiation sickness. According to Allison, someone would have to live for a million hours in Sellafield to absorb the same radiation as is administered in a hospital radiotherapy suite. Higher doses are permitted in food processing and even in medicinal resorts, with supposed beneficial or at least harmless effects. Only yesterday research suggested that mobile phone radiation may relieve Alzheimer&apos;s. Allison analyses successive studies into the only serious nuclear accident since Hiroshima, the Chernobyl fire, which killed no more than 60 people, all in close contact with the fire. Other than some thyroid cancers caused chiefly by a failure to distribute iodine tablets, long-term cancers in survivors were below the regional average. The truth is that low-dose radiation effects wear off quickly. In some parts of India and Brazil people live happily with ambient radiation of 200-300 mSv. Yet the mere word, Chernobyl, induces such terror in regulators as to lead to the unnecessary sterilisation of thousands of acres (with now thriving wildlife) and the continued slaughter of Cumbrian sheep, despite the risk to lamb-eaters being negligible. The trouble is that nobody makes money by downplaying risk. Nuclear inspectors need work, and contractors can claim astronomical safety costs, assuming that governments will pay. The losers are the public and life on earth. Meanwhile, over in Ohio, Mueller describes the same terror infecting reaction to nuclear weapons. He points out that nuclear bombs are extremely hard to make, let alone deploy, and their destructive power and radiological aftermath are grossly overstated. The devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was largely the result of the buildings bombed being made of wood. Numbers killed were similar to those dying in conventional bomb attacks at the time. Yet we memorialise Hiroshima but not Tokyo, where 100,000 were killed in March 1945. Subsequent diseases from exposure to low-level radiation were harder to detect. Modern nuclear weapons are obviously more powerful, but again their blast areas would remain limited and their likely contamination, says Mueller, much exaggerated. I used to believe that, for all their horror, atom bombs brought an end to the war in Japan \u2013 which other bombs had failed to do. After that war, they stabilised the nervous confrontation between east and west, deterring Soviets and Americans from going jointly berserk at such flashpoints as Berlin, Hungary or Cuba. Deterrence sort of worked. History may be moot on those points, but what is surely clear is that nuclear weapons are now virtually useless. Like Allison, Mueller goes beyond the two iconic incidents of Hiroshima and Chernobyl to show how special interests have hijacked the nuclear mystique to exploit public fear. The risk of anyone exploding a nuclear weapon, even in politically charged regions such as the Middle East, is infinitesimally small. Whoever did so would be too mad to be deterred by an enemy possessing nuclear weapons, any more than Ho Chi Minh&apos;s Vietnam, Argentina&apos;s Galtieri or Iraq&apos;s Saddam Hussein were deterred by America and Britain. Nor, says Mueller, would the consequence of even a serious bomb attack be as horrible as is claimed. Cities recover with remarkable alacrity, as even Hiroshima did from contamination. The second world war and many American bombing campaigns since have shown that human settlements are resilient to aerial bombardment. As for the much-vaunted risk of a terrorist getting a nuclear weapon \u2013 the &quot;1%\u00a0chance&quot; that kept poor Dick Cheney awake at night \u2013 Mueller points out that the chance must be not one in a hundred but one in millions. Cheney would have done better worrying about the proliferation of AK47s. Even were a &quot;dirty&quot; bomb somehow to be assembled and deployed, its radiological contamination is exaggerated by defence contractors and lobbyists frantic for contracts. The billions of dollars being devoted to countering &quot;cataclysmic&quot; terrorism, in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Yemen, and to confronting such proto-nuclear states as Iran or North Korea, is not just disproportionate to the risk. The money would be better spent on other ways of reducing terrorism. In a futile pursuit of nuclear non-proliferation, America and Britain are combing the world accusing states of threatening somehow to destroy their civilisations when the risk of this happening is near meaningless. As Mueller notes, it is not only ghoulish science and ghoulish journalism that sells, ghoulish politics does too. He has nothing against negotiating nuclear non-proliferation, but pleads &quot;to avoid policies that can lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people under the obsessive sway of worst-case scenario fantasies&quot;, as is the case in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is these fantasies that line the streets of Wootton Bassett each week. It is a monumental irony that rightwing politicians who rearm against the tiny risk to humanity from nuclear weapons are often the same as deny the risk to humanity from global warming. Both are risks. Both may be improbable, but the risk from radiation is minimal and containable, while the worst-case scenario from global warming is truly cataclysmic. Nor is such hypocrisy confined to the right. Many of those who claim global warming as the &quot;greatest threat to the planet&quot; tend also to be those who oppose nuclear energy as &quot;too risky&quot;, or even too expensive. This is all a massive failure of science to pierce the carapace of public ignorance. As Allison and Mueller argue, nothing is as potent as the politics of fear, and there is no fear as blind as that which comes from a bomb and a death ray. So what is science doing? The world is in the grip of a prejudice from which nothing seems able to free it.

The Ady Gil,a 24-metre (78ft) catamaran belonging to the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group, sank two days after it was battered by the fleet&apos;s security ship, the Shonan Maru No 2, in the most violent confrontation between whalers and activists for six years. The boat lost a large section of its bow in the collision, and one of its six crew sustained minor injuries. The whaling ship was not damaged. Each side has blamed the other for the collision, although video footage (below) appears to support Sea Shepherd&apos;s claims that the Ady Gil was struck deliberately.            The partially submerged boat was being towed by another Sea Shepherd ship, the Bob Barker, to a French research base 185 miles (300km) to the south when its tow rope snapped early this morning. Reports said the boat sank about 180 miles north of Commonwealth Bay, off the coast of Antarctica. Sea Shepherd said it had removed environmental hazards from the boat and there was no risk of an oil slick. &quot;We spent the greater part of yesterday transferring all of the fuel, oil and batteries and any other contaminates,&quot; Peter Hammarstedt, the Bob Barker&apos;s first officer, told the Associated Press. &quot;We did the best we could with the situation we were given. The most responsible thing would have been if the illegal whaling vessel hadn&apos;t deliberately split the boat into two pieces.&quot; Sea Shepherd reported the last known position of the Ady Gil to Australian authorities, warning them that it could pose a navigation hazard for three hours after the sinking. The group&apos;s founder, Paul Watson, said the group would continue to pursue the Japanese fleet through freezing Antarctic waters while it attempted to catch 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales by the end of February. &quot;We&apos;re not going to restrain ourselves from protecting these whales and we&apos;re not going to restrain ourselves from upholding international conservation law,&quot; he told Australian radio. A loophole in the 1986 ban on commercial whaling permits Japan to conduct &quot;lethal research&quot; into whales and sell their meat on the open market. Australia and New Zealand, where the Ady Gil is registered, have launched investigations into the incident and appealed to both sides to avoid further confrontation in some of the world&apos;s most inhospitable seas. Australia, a vocal opponent of whaling, today said it was using diplomatic channels to try to end to Japan&apos;s &quot;scientific&quot; whale hunts, which take place in Antarctic waters claimed by Australia but not recognised as such by Tokyo. &quot;We want to see substantial progress on these negotiations, including a commitment on the part of whaling nations, irrespective of so-called scientific whaling,&quot; the environment minister, Peter Garrett, told reporters. Garrett said that if insufficient progress had been made by the time the International Whaling Commission met in June, the prime minister, Kevin Rudd, had made it &quot;very clear that legal action is firmly in front of us&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Now from Tokyo comes the latest \u2013 and greatest \u2013 choir of them all."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-08T14:29:07Z", "title": "All together now: 'Don't clip your nails next to me at work'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/08/complaints-choirs", "article": "     In Finnish, there is an expression, Valituskuoro (&quot;complaints choir&quot;), which is used to describe situations where a lot of people complain simultaneously.

After weeks of mounting confusion over its future, it now appears that JAL will file for bankruptcy protection under Japan&apos;s corporate rehabilitation law, a process similar to Chapter 11 in the US. In what would be the sixth-biggest bankruptcy in Japanese history, the state-backed turnaround group responsible for engineering JAL&apos;s revival would inject \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in new capital, provided the airline filed for bankruptcy and its financial backers agreed to waive \u00a5350bn in debts.

According to Kyodo News, the ETIC will also guarantee more than \u00a5470bn to cover fuel and other commercial transactions after JAL goes into administration. The body reportedly wants JAL to reject rival offers of fresh investment from Delta and American Airlines, as it believes a new capital alliance could complicate the restructuring plans. Delta, the world&apos;s biggest airline, has offered $1bn (\u00a3620m) to entice JAL to the Sky Team alliance.

The US airlines are keen to exploit JAL&apos;s huge Asian network and strengthen their presence in Japan ahead of the expansion of Haneda airport in Tokyo in October. &quot;Delta continues to be in discussion with JAL about forming a long-term strategic partnership,&quot; a Delta spokeswoman told Reuters. &quot;Details of those discussions are confidential.&quot; The government is expected to announce its final decision this week, with bankruptcy procedures to follow a week later.

The turnaround will be spearheaded by a new chief executive; Kazuo Inamori, the 77-year-old founder of the electronics component maker Kyocera, will take over from Haruka Nishimatsu. While investors dumped shares that could soon be worth nothing, US airlines continued to vie for a stake in JAL&apos;s network of domestic and Asian routes, despite reports that ETIC is ruling out investments from foreign airlines because they could complicate bankruptcy proceedings.

So do David and George. They all have pretty much the same notions \u2013 and it is called exporting your way out of trouble. The logic is simple: consumers and businesses spent the best part of a decade borrowing and spending, and cannot be relied upon to spend Britain&apos;s way out of recession. Instead, the rest of the world will have to do it, by buying \u00adBritish exports \u2013 which are now cheaper since the pound&apos;s effective devaluation. Simple, right? Problem is, Angela over there in Berlin has the same idea. As for the Chinese, they have been at this game for a long time now. And Yukio Hatoyama, the new boy in Tokyo, seems to have cottoned on too, going by his \u00adgovernment&apos;s calls for the yen to weaken (and so help exporters). Which brings up to a big question: if everyone is so keen to sell their wares to everyone else, then who is actually going to buy it? That is obviously putting the issue too starkly. Even so, for a country to follow a strategy of export-led recovery requires others to consume. In the global downturn that followed the Asian crisis at the end of the 90s, stricken exporters had a clear consumer of last resort: America. Then the dotcom bubble of business spending came to a head, and rates were slashed to encourage households to spend more. They did, with the results that we know about now. But if business and consumers in both America and Britain have now maxed out their credit cards then it is not clear who the consumers will be. And yet most big industrial economies (and quite a few economies that want to be industrial, such as the fast-growing giant of China) are pinning their hopes on exporting out of trouble. So how will that work? Badly, by first sight. Take a look at the car-scrappage scheme brought in by Alistair Darling just over a year ago. A \u00a32,000 bung to those who traded in their old cars for new, this was meant to be a boost to the UK car industry. Yet two notable winners were Hyundai and Kia \u2013 neither major manufacturers in the UK. As a small, open economy, British schemes to boost consumer demand are always going to help domestic retailers as well as foreign manufacturers. As German chancellor, Angela Merkel is in charge of a rich country that exports more than it imports; a perfect candidate to act as a consumer of last resort. But bear in mind her words from an interview last year: &quot;The German economy is very reliant on exports, and this is not something you can change in two years. It is not something we even want to change.&quot; With attitudes like that, the global battle for export markets is not likely to end well."}, {"sentences": ["It is a &quot;family movie&quot; in the classic Japanese style, and a variant \u2013 \u00adoffered in an intelligent, if \u00adinterestingly humble spirit of homage \u2013 to Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story."], "tags": ["Drama", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture", "Yasujiro Ozu"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-14T22:10:00Z", "title": "Still Walking | Film review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/14/still-walking-review", "article": "A major retrospective for Yasujiro Ozu at London&apos;s BFI Southbank \u00adprovides \u00adexactly the right context for \u00adappreciating this moving new film, \u00adHirokazu Kore-eda&apos;s Still Walking, which I first saw at the San Sebastian film festival in 2008, and which definitely grows with a second viewing. It is a &quot;family movie&quot; in the classic Japanese style, and a variant \u2013 \u00adoffered in an intelligent, if \u00adinterestingly humble spirit of homage \u2013 to Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story. It is as if Kore-eda is the wayward elder son making a bow to the great patriarch. Yoshio Harada plays a retired doctor, an imperious, querulous old man, who lives by the seaside with his elderly wife: his two grownup, married children are coming for a visit. There is a daughter, who is close to the mother, and shares with her an exasperation with the cantankerous father and his ways; she&apos;s continually urging her parents to come and live with her and her hearty, amiable husband. The son is Ryo (Hiroshi Abe) who has just married a widow, Yukari (Yui Natsukawa), and become a stepfather to her young boy \u2013 the father disapproves of the marriage as being somehow second best. There is a spectre at this feast. The oldest son, Junpei, was killed as a boy saving the life of a schoolfriend from drowning, and this boy has grown up to be a tiresome chump and a loser. From an obscure spirit of masochism, of strained politeness and also a strange need to punish this man for living while their beloved son has died, they insist on inviting him to tea, excruciatingly, every year, in the presence of their \u00adchildren \u2013 and of course he cannot refuse. Ryo is angry at being made to feel second best, silently seething at all the fond anecdotes about how great Junpei was, and conceals from his father the fact of his own humiliation \u2013 that he is actually out of work at the \u00admoment. The old man is of course angry and \u00addepressed, and has remained in this condition for decades. Strangely, it is Ryo&apos;s little stepson who the old man reaches out to, calling \u00adhimself the \u00a0 boy&apos;s &quot;grandpa&quot;. Unlike family dramas as conceived of in British or American drama, there are no crockery-smashing rows. \u00adResentments and anger are contained within the conventions of politeness and respect. But this, I think, reflects the truth about the quiet, undramatic real lives of all families anywhere, and this, I think, is incidentally why Ozu is so \u00adpassionately loved all over the world, despite his \u00adproducers&apos; initial fears that his work would not travel because it is too \u00adJapanese. With great dramatic strength and deliberation, Kore-eda is extending and developing this tradition. Of \u00a0course, the notion of the &quot;better&quot; son dying is becoming a bit of a cliche in Hollywood, with the much-spoofed Walk the Line, but this is a higher order of storytelling, and this gentle, lovely film is impossible to watch without a lump in the \u00adthroat. \u2022 The Ozu season continues at the BFI Southbank and selected venues until 28 February "}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I am in Tokyo and it is 5:15 p.m. over here.", "I have two choices: hit the town for a big night out in Tokyo, or stay at my desk and watch the car crash that will be England&apos;s second-day bowling performance via your OBO report."], "tags": ["England in South Africa 2009-2010", "South Africa cricket team", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Over by over reports"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-15T00:01:00Z", "title": "South Africa v England - day two as it happened | Andy Bull and Rob Smyth", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/15/south-africa-england-fourth-test-live", "article": " Preamble. Morning. Now, Friday might not be the best day to ask a group of Englishman to put in a productive shift at work, but that&apos;s what England need to do today. Not that much to ask, is it? Do your job. They don&apos;t have to reinvent the wheel, or make the ball sing Hold On by Wilson Phillips. They just need to make it talk occasionally \u2013 although the conditions should do that for them \u2013 and bowl properly. Not that much to ask, is it? And if they do, they have a real chance of restricting South Africa to a manageable first-innings lead of under 100 on a pitch that already has some ominous indentations.  South Africa resume on 29 for nought, a deficit of 151. England talk till they are blue in the phizog about areas \u2013 in Lawrence Booth&apos;s outstanding newish book, the usually articulate Stuart Broad even says &quot;areas is the way forward&quot; \u2013 and now is the time to show that this isn&apos;t just meaningless business-speak horse pucky. England don&apos;t need to strive too hard for wickets; they just need to bowl properly, with discipline and desire. They don&apos;t need to be exceptional, just very good. And they need to give us everything they have, and what is left after that, too. In terms of this match and series, it&apos;s now or never. James Anderson, Attack Leader, needs to actually lead the attack; Ryan Sidebottom has to bowl straighter and actually enjoy what is probably going to be his final Test; and someone needs to convince Stuart Broad that the top of off stump is singing Dude Looks Like A Lady at him and should be punished occasionally. Simple.  Oh dear. It&apos;s a lovely, sunny day in Johannesburg. Ian Botham, who knows a little bit about swing bowling, reckons it will still swing, if not as much as yesterday. Mike Atherton, who knows a little bit about batting in Johannesburg, reckons it&apos;s a much better day for batting.  Cheery pre-play email, from Ranil Dissanayake  &quot;Like many, I&apos;m against Sidebottom&apos;s inclusion. I&apos;ve always said that he is a horrifically over-rated bowler who was flattered by one or two good series. His bowling in Sri Lanka demonstrated what kind of player he is: selfish. He went two yards outside off to protect his figures when it became apparent that Mahela Jayawardene regards him as nothing better than a club bowler, and he hasn&apos;t changed his line since then. Onions on the other hand doesn&apos;t hide. He bowls at the stumps, fast, with a bit of swing. As Dale Steyn said yesterday, that&apos;s exactly what you want on a track with nip. Strauss and Flower have dropped a brick here.&quot; It is looking that way, although I don&apos;t think we should be too harsh. Given Flower and Strauss&apos;s almost obsessive desire for consistency, you have to think there were very good reasons for the decision. I think you&apos;re a bit harsh on Sidebottom&apos;s performance in Sri Lanka. The Sidebottom of 2007-08 is a better bowler than Onions, I think.  Remember him? Fred will be out for another six months, after a further operation on his knee. Mike Atherton doesn&apos;t think he will play for England again. But if Flintoff plays all the ODIs in the summer, could we safely rule out an Ashes return? I&apos;m not sure we could.  13th over: South Africa 30-0 (Smith 13, Prince 15) England are going to open with Stuart Broad, which is a slight surprise. He starts with an awkward lifter that Smith drops not far short of Cook at short leg. There was some very encouraging bounce for Broad in that over, and a little shape back into the left-handers too. That&apos;s a fine start. &quot;Got any more vintage cuts of Peruvian 60s girl group pop dumb awesomeness you&apos;d like to share?&quot; asks Philip Podolsky. &quot;So addictive is the one you unmindfully twitted away that it seriously threatens to undercut the current nasty bout of my Emil Gilels obssession.&quot; Er, no. But it is a fantastic song.  14th over: South Africa 31-0 (Smith 14, Prince 15) Ryan Sidebottom, on his 32nd birthday, starts at the other end. That&apos;s a real snub for James Anderson, who has taken more wickets than any other quick bowler in this series, and Beefy in the Sky commentary box is in a hot one about that. &quot;It&apos;s just illogical, I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he says. It&apos;s hard to disagree. It&apos;s a reasonable over from Sidebottom, with decent carry and a little outswing, but he doesn&apos;t make Prince play enough. That was his problem yesterday. &quot;Can I get some doom and gloom in early please?&quot; announces Guy Hornsby. &quot;I&apos;m off on holiday at lunch (well, it&apos;s Centre Parcs, so not sure that qualifies really) but I&apos;ll be glued to OBO to watch South Africa coast away from our meagre total. We need wickets early today here or it&apos;ll be about as much fun as an insurance seminar. In Telford. Cometh the hour, cometh Stuart Broad. He&apos;s the man on whom our hopes will be pinned today, and he needs to pitch it up.&quot;  15th over: South Africa 36-0 (Smith 15, Prince 19) This is nice from Broad. He&apos;s really pounding in and troubling Prince with some inswing. The third ball brings a strangled shout for LBW; it was going down leg and over the top, but Prince was not comfortable and he just jabs down on the next delivery as it homes in on his front pad. Broad then slips one wider and fuller, but Prince is onto it and drives handsomely through mid-off for the first boundary of the day. &quot;Exclamation marks are yesterday&apos;s news when it comes to irritating, superfluous punctuation,&quot; says A Person. &quot;Part of my job involves editing &apos;irreverent&apos; Q&amp;As from corporate types for a business rag. I now spend half of my time deleting smiley faces from the end of humdrum answers from dull adults who should know better. I yearn for the halycon days where the humble exclamation mark was the chosen device to draw attention to their wit. Please don&apos;t publish my name as it will get me the sack.&quot;  16th over: South Africa 36-0 (Smith 15, Prince 19) There&apos;s real controversy here. Smith has survived a referral for caught behind, having been given not out originally, but there was a huge noise that could only have been bat on ball. This is a shambles. Smith tried to cut a filthy long hop from Sidebottom that was miles away from his body, and England went up for caught behind straight away. There was a noise - a noise that could not have been anything else - but, astonishingly, Daryl Harper, the third umpire, is getting a different feed from ours, and on that feed there was no noise. Or at least that&apos;s what Harper said to the on-field umpire, yet Sky have just shown the other feed and the noise was painfully obvious. To clarify, the third umpire can give a batsman out on noise. Daryl Harper was vindicated yesterday over the Cook dismissal but he has a lot of explaining to do here.  WICKET! South Africa 36-1 (Prince c Swann b Broad 19) Broad is rewarded for an outstanding start to the day. That was a very good off-cutter to Prince, who fenced outside off and edged Swann at second slip, and he took a smart catch. Very, very good bowling from Stuart Broad, but England will be aggrieved that they did not get the much bigger wicket of Graeme Smith just before that.  17th over: South Africa 38-1 (Smith 15, Amla 2) There is now a suggestion that Daryl Harper received a lower quality of sound than the viewers, and so could not pick up the noise of Smith&apos;s bat on ball. That is beyond ridiculous. That really does beggar belief. This isn&apos;t a bloody Sunday game at Gore Court in Sittingbourne, with everyone seeing two different balls because they&apos;re still slaughtered from the night before. It&apos;s a Test match, a hugely important one, and they can&apos;t get the most basic technology sorted. That is absurd.  18th over: South Africa 47-1 (Smith 15, Amla 10) Amla works consecutive deliveries from Sidebottom off his hip for four. As Nasser Hussain points out on Sky, if you are going to bowl that line, you need a man catching. In other news, Sky have just shown Nasser Hussain&apos;s trousers, with a huge hole in the business area that was sustained while he bent over to inspect the pitch. So he&apos;s now wearing shirt, tie and England tracksuit bottoms. I&apos;d love to get Hadley Freeman&apos;s take on that. The look, that is, not his trousers splitting. It&apos;s already going down a storm in Hoxton. &quot;I was bending over and Allan Donald starting laughing at me,&quot; said Hussain, &quot;so I knew there was an issue. Too many curries in Durban.&quot;  19th over: South Africa 53-1 (Smith 22, Amla 10) Smith inside-edges Broad onto the pad but the ball drops safely. He is then beaten by a real snorter that takes off outside off stump. From the next ball, Smith tries to work to leg and gets a leading edge wide of gully for four. Broad has been splendid this morning. You know he&apos;s bowling well when he has that really emphatic, proud, showy follow through. This morning he has ended up somewhere near the batsmen&apos;s nose. &quot;Aah, the wonders of global time difference,&quot; says Aman Anand. &quot;I am in Tokyo and it is 5:15 p.m. over here. I have two choices: hit the town for a big night out in Tokyo, or stay at my desk and watch the car crash that will be England&apos;s second-day bowling performance via your OBO report. I must be a masochist of some sort, as I think I am going to choose the latter.&quot; You could always do both: follow the first session and then head out safe in the knowledge that South Africa are 901 for one.  20th over: South Africa 53-1 (Smith 22, Amla 10) England now have a leg slip for Amla, with the horse galloping around the freshly mown fields and sniffing ambitiously in the direction of the nearest filly. Sidebottom will be pleased he has a right-hander to play with, though, and beats Amla with a nice delivery that zipped across him. It&apos;s a maiden, and Sidebottom&apos;s best over of the morning. In other news, the local radio people reckon there will be a thunderstorm of biblical proportions by around midday our time. Is it cowardly to pray for rain? It kind of is. I don&apos;t want England to win this series on the cheap.  21st over: South Africa 54-1 (Smith 23, Amla 10) Another very good over from Broad. Sky have just shown the pitch maps for both bowlers this morning, and Broad has been fuller than Sidebottom. That&apos;s credit to him but not to Sidebottom; maybe he has bowled a &quot;safe&quot; length, to go back to Ranil Dissanayake&apos;s email.  22nd over: South Africa 56-1 (Smith 23, Amla 11) Anderson replaces Sidebottom. His first ball beats Smith and, on the second bounce, thwacks into Matt Prior&apos;s knee. He hops around in all sorts of pain, which gives Bumble a fit of the giggles. It&apos;s a so-so first over from Anderson, still perhaps a fraction too short. I&apos;m still reeling from that referral fiasco. In other news, you can keep track of the weather in Johannesburg by praying in this direction.  23rd over: South Africa 58-1 (Smith 24, Amla 11) Amla tries to leave a short ball from Broad that rams into his chest. Right between the moobs, not that he has any. This is Broad&apos;s sixth over, and of course England have a problem in that they would they only have three seamers to South Africa&apos;s five. The consequence of that is that Amla and Smith are happy to take no risks and see off what has been a fine spell from Broad. &quot;Regarding work email formats, I would like to postulate that nothing good has ever followed a bulletpoint. Ever,&quot; says Poppy McNee. &quot;I am home with girl-flu and filled with Beefy-esque unease about the absence of attack leader.&quot; Girl-flu? Does that have any defining characteristics, like man-flu? And if there is girl-flu and man-flu, who suffers from dear old, plain old flu? What next: girl hangover head and boy hangover head? Girl chlamy- [that&apos;ll do - imaginary ed].  24th over: South Africa 66-1 (Smith 32, Amla 11) Anderson has a strangled shout for LBW against Smith; it was far too high, and Anderson has to increase his length because there is appreciable swing and Smith is not comfortable. That said, when Anderson digs in a bouncer Smith jumps out of his bunker and pulls it emphatically for four. The next ball, slanted across him, is edged low through the slips for four more. Smith played it reasonably well in the end, softening his hands, but that&apos;s the length for Anderson to bowl. &quot;I&apos;m here and still muttering darkly about that nick,&quot; says Lynn Bashforth. &quot;SABC have been stars this series haven&apos;t they? Too mean to stump up (yes, I knxow) for Snicko or Hotspot, and now too incompetent to ensure that the third umpire gets the sound feed. And let&apos;s face it, with Daryl Harper in that seat, it was never going to go well anyway. Shambles.&quot; SABC provided the feed for Daryl Harper. I would have said that earlier had I, y&apos;know, been doing my job properly.  25th over: South Africa 67-1 (Smith 32, Amla 12) Bumble now suggests that the Smith farce may have been the consequence of nothing more complicated than a sound engineer failing to turn the sound up. For heaven&apos;s sake. Anyway, Sidebottom replaces Broad, who bowled a supreme spell of 6-0-16-1. Nothing happens. This is drifting away from England, who could really do with a fourth seamer. And, no, not Luke Wright before you say it.  26th over: South Africa 68-1 (Smith 32, Amla 13) A really good over from Anderson, the highlight of which was a hard-handed inside-edge from Smith that flew in the air past short leg. He has it going both ways at will just now, and his length is getting almost imperceptibly fuller. &quot;Would a rain-affected draw make for a cheap series win?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Not in my book. Once you get in front in a series, rather like a match, you gain a lot of advantages, rain being one of them. Of course, you have to get in front first, which isn&apos;t easy, but it helps if you can play eight Tests against Aus and SA and only lose one.&quot; I take your point, but England have been outplayed in three of the four Tests. So, yes, that&apos;s a cheap series win to me. Almost as cheap as the series draw in 2003, in fact.  27th over: South Africa 70-1 (Smith 33, Amla 14) Sidebottom finally brings out the hard-man act, shaping to throw back at Amla. That&apos;s probably born of frustration with his own performance as much as anything, because he is being played with as much comfort as could be expected in these circumstances. His figures (12-4-27-0) are fine, but have a Mullallyish deceptiveness. &quot;Turns out that, according to Aggers, SABC didn&apos;t give Harper the sound of that nick,&quot; says Andy Bradshaw. &quot;Conspiracy theories ahoy.&quot; I presumed it was just basic human incompetence, such is my faith of the consistent ineptitude of this race. Surely it couldn&apos;t be something sinister? Either way, it&apos;s hard to get your head round such a dispiriting fiasco.  28th over: South Africa 74-1 (Smith 37, Amla 14) The risk with pitching it up is that you will occasionally go for boundaries, and Smith crunches a full inswinger from Anderson through midwicket for four. But that&apos;s a risk that England must take, and Anderson looks really good now. They desperately need to get Smith out, however. &quot;Is it cowardly to pray for rain?&quot; says Martin Sinclair. &quot;I&apos;m wearing my T-shirt with pride Rob. I see nothing wrong with rain ending play early, say in about 12 minutes, and carrying on for about three and a half days so we scrape the spawniest 1-0 series win ever.&quot; I love patriotism.  29th over: South Africa 79-1 (Smith 41, Amla 15) Sidebottom continues to home in on the middle of the bat, and Smith works him off the pads for four. He has that look in his eyes, and if England don&apos;t get him soon they can kiss this goodbye. We&apos;ve had a few emails slagging off poor old Daryl Harper, but it sounds like he is entirely blameless here. &quot;Girl-&apos;flu is better known as bird &apos;flu and can be caught from eggs,&quot; fnars Niall Taylor. &quot;Has Poppy McNee been exposed to any recently?&quot; Oh dear.  30th over: South Africa 87-1 (Smith 41, Amla 23) Anderson invites Amla to drive, and so he does, deliciously through the covers for four. That was gloriously timed. The next ball is a booming inswinger but Amla square-drives it magisterially to the fence to bring up the fifty partnership. &quot;The glory of human failure continues even with technology coming out of our ears,&quot; says Alex James anddon&apos;tyoudaremakeablurjoke. &quot;The pain of bad decisions is so, so much easier to take when we all accept there is just one man with one set of eyes who will get it right 80-90 percent of the time, with the remaining mistakes that simple and fun element of sport known as luck/bad luck, and not a life threatening injustice. Remember those days? Now we are the point when bad decisions are getting too much focus. This is sport folks. Pre-tech decision making did not mean that mistakes defined our memories of series. Now we are close to that point and we are sounding like babies whose dummy has been snatched away.&quot; But my dummy has been snatched away.  31st over: South Africa 89-1 (Smith 43, Amla 23) It&apos;s time for the first spin of the match, with Swann replacing Sidebottom. In an unusual development, he doesn&apos;t take a wicket in his first over, although Smith made a fearful hash of the fifth delivery. He came down the track, tried to whip to leg, and got a leading edge wide of mid-off. There was a really encouraging amount of turn for Swann, particularly from the final delivery, which spat past the outside edge. Fine over. &quot;I would have written before, but I&apos;m absolutely furious with the way that Darryl Hall has acted this series,&quot; says James Debens, conveniently ignoring such trivial details as a man&apos;s surname for the sake of a defiantly average gag. &quot;Oates would have left the tent by now just to escape the man(eater).&quot;  32nd over: South Africa 102-1 (Smith 51, Amla 28) Broad replaces Anderson, and his first over goes 13. Amla takes a very dodgy single to mid-off from the first ball. He would have just been home had Collingwood&apos;s throw hit the stumps and, to compound England&apos;s misery, the ball went for four overthrows. Collingwood was surely right to go for the run-out though. Smith then crunches a full inswinger through midwicket for an emphatic, soul-crushing boundary. He is doing it again, and an economical work off the pads for four more brings to a very fine fifty. Yes he should have been given out, but he has judged the innings splendidly. &quot;Jesus you must be having fun this morning,&quot; says Evan Maloney. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like being paid to narrate your own execution. Actually, nobody makes losing look more fun than the OBO. Even I... well I didn&apos;t enjoy losing the Ashes in 2005, but you lot certainly made losing more entertaining than it otherwise would have been. That could be your slogan: &apos;Guardian OBO - where losing is more entertaining than it usually is.&apos;&quot;  33rd over: South Africa 106-1 (Smith 52, Amla 31) There is still an hour to lunch in this extended morning session, and I&apos;m not sure where England go from here really. Swann is clearly going to have a long spell, because this is turning significantly: Smith gropes at another gorgeous, flighted delivery that rips past the outside edge. England then appeal for a stumping against Amla, thinking he had overbalanced after missing a delivery that turned down the leg side, but it is not referred to Daryl Harper. A good job, as they&apos;ve probably turned his TV off and blindfolded anyway. He wasn&apos;t out anyway. &quot;Isn&apos;t anyone going to blame the onfield umpires for missing this booming thunderclap of a snick in the first place?&quot; says Richard Marsden.  34th over: South Africa 107-1 (Smith 52, Amla 31) Amla flaps a wider length delivery from Broad not far short of cover, a stroke reminiscent of Michael Clarke&apos;s dismissal in the first innings at the Oval. Nothing else happens. Over by over, South Africa are moving into a position from which England cannot win this game. &quot;Do we need a fourth seamer?&quot; demands Gary Naylor. &quot;If the best three English sealers can&apos;t prise out the top order, can we assume the fourth best would? The problem with playing five bowlers is that most of the time, one of them only takes one wicket in an innings, and that&apos;s not much of a return. The four bowlers selected have a job to do and should do it. Unlike a batsman that has no chance to amend for bad luck or getting a good one early, the bowler has plenty of chances to bowl.&quot; Surely the whole point is that you don&apos;t know which bowler will be superfluous because of the vagaries of form and conditions? That was the beauty of 2005: Hoggard did bugger all for three Tests and was hugely influential in the fourth and fifth, while Giles was often ineffective but had two vital Friday-afternoon spells. I still think four bowlers is the lesser of two evils for this particular England squad, but on days like today they could do with a fourth seamer. Or, with respect to Sidebottom, a third.  35th over: South Africa 115-1 (Smith 60, Amla 31) Smith and Swann had a wonderful battle in the last Test, and they&apos;re at it again. After being beaten emphatically in each of Swann&apos;s first two overs, Smith responds by pumping a full delivery down the ground for four and then lashing a cover drive to the fence. Outstanding batting. &quot;If it was that obvious,&quot; says Jeremy Stevens, &quot;Smith should have walked.&quot; Well funnily enough Smith looked really unimpressed with the appeal. But even if he knew he hit it, he was never going to walk. Hardly anybody walks anymore. Clearly that&apos;s not ideal, but what can you do? Buy The Spirit of Cricket by Rob Smyth, published by Elliott &amp; Thompson in May 2010, you say? Yeah, why not?  36th over: South Africa 120-1 (Smith 64, Amla 32) Broad strays onto the pads and Smith tickles him fine for four. What a magnificent specimen of masculinity this man is and, as has been said before, what a master he is when it comes to scoring the important runs. Broad goes around the wicket as a consequence of that boundary. I&apos;ve just seen the Australia score. That&apos;s going to be a fun Ashes series next winter, isn&apos;t it?  37th over: South Africa 124-1 (Smith 67, Amla 33) Smith, who will not just allow Swann to bowl and get in a rhythm, whaps a couple through midwicket and then another behind square on the leg side. South Africa are only 56 behind now and they have a long batting line-up. But not as long as this amazing line-up for another must-win Test 12 years ago. Klusener at No10!  38th over: South Africa 128-1 (Smith 71, Amla 33) Smith is looking imperious now and cuts Broad, who has been less impressive in this second spell, crisply for four. That forces Broad back over the wicket, and Smith leaves one on length that doesn&apos;t miss off stump by all that much. &quot;Would it be remiss of me to ask if Darryl Hannah could be forgiven for missing the nick?&quot; snortles James Prout. &quot;Must be difficult enough having a giant fin in place of legs without having to worry about being a bleeding sound technician for SABC as well!&quot; I could have forgiven the content of the email, just about, but you had to ram it in with a bloody exclamation mark, didn&apos;t you.  39th over: South Africa 130-1 (Smith 71, Amla 35) Swann toys with Amla, mixing his length up outside off stump. There is a gap at extra-cover, inviting Amla to drive in the hope that he will repeat his dismissal in the second innings of the second Test; instead he tries to go over the leg side and only just clears the man running back from midwicket. He was pretty fortunate there. &quot;You&apos;re fed up?&quot; exhales Matt Turland. &quot;I&apos;m well and truly fed up. In a job I hate, sitting next to a complete tool who won&apos;t speak to me because I said he was wrong. A flatmate who is not speaking to me because I said he was wrong (yes... it is the same person). And I have to read about the destruction of the England cricket team by Smiffy and pals. Life is crap. I blame Sidebottom for everything.&quot; What, even this?  40th over: South Africa 131-1 (Smith 72, Amla 35) I think this is quite a smart move: Paul Collingwood is coming on for Stuart Broad. He should move the ball around here. Smith tries to impose himself by charging down the wicket, but the ball jags back to hit the top of the thigh. One from the over. &quot;Might I suggest, as an impartial onlooker (I belong to a rare species: the Scottish cricket fan), that SA actually deserve draw this series?&quot; says Ross Smith. &quot;Or would that be blasphemous?&quot; On the contrary, they have been the better side and deserve at least a draw. But that doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re not allowed to be slightly disappointed, as with the anti-climactic nature of the match as the fact that England are going to lose.  41st over: South Africa 135-1 (Smith 76, Amla 35) Smith charges down the track at Swann and dumps him over midwicket for four. He is starting to dominate Swann. This is just brilliant batting, because there are significant risks in such an approach but always his main concern is the team rather than his own innings. &quot;It&apos;s very noble of the ECB to give Ryan Sidebottom a testimonial,&quot; says Rich Gee, &quot;but surely it should have been played against a New Zealand XI.&quot;  42nd over: South Africa 135-1 (Smith 76, Amla 35) Classy commentary from Shaun Pollock and Nasser Hussain, discussing whether Prior should be up to the stumps for Amla, who is batting out of his crease against Collingwood. Nasser makes the point that, on a pitch with pace and bounce, any edges will be seriously hard to take if you are standing up to the stumps. Pollock says they should risk it anyway and back the keeper&apos;s handling skills. Sky are very good at this, explaining things that might be second nature to them but aren&apos;t necessarily to the viewers. It&apos;s admirably inclusive stuff. Talking of Sky, here&apos;s their executive producer Paul King: &quot;We will try and explain the Smith review sound issue as best we can at the start of lunch.&quot;  43rd over: South Africa 141-1 (Smith 81, Amla 36) Smith pulls out a hideous-looking slog-sweep against Swann, and the ball rumbles away through midwicket for four. It was a calculated shot and, even though it looked ugly, it&apos;s another example of his desire to dominate Swann. Gee he&apos;s been good this morning. &quot;Sorry Rob, I&apos;m not buying the idea that Daryl Harper is blameless in all of this,&quot; says Benedict Rumbold. &quot;When someone refers a feathered edge to the third umpire, surely his first question should be &apos;Where&apos;s the audio?&apos; If he asks for it, I don&apos;t see how SABC could deny it to him. The most likely scenario is that they didn&apos;t provide it (probably through oversight rather than conspiracy) and Harper didn&apos;t think to ask for it. Ridiculous. Anyway, I assume all audio evidence is now off limits for the rest of the match, to make it a fair game?&quot; It&apos;s hard to say with absolute certainty that Harper was at fault, because we don&apos;t know what he saw and heard. What we can say is that the outcome was unacceptable and made a complete mockery of this Test and the referral system, even if it almost certainly had no impact upon the outcome.  44th over: South Africa 146-1 (Smith 81, Amla 41) Amla pushes a short one from Collingwood through the covers for two and then snicks a decent lifter wide of the solitary slip for three. Does anyone know what Collingwood&apos;s nickname is? It sounds like Prior is saying &quot;Bowling Weaves&quot; or some such. It&apos;s bugging me. That and the fact England are being hammered. &quot;Here&apos;s the plan,&quot; announces Jonathan Martin. &quot;I&apos;ll be honest Rob, I think we&apos;d all (you, me, them, everybody) be happier if we just wrapped this up now? Close it down, pretend it&apos;s not happening and sneak off down the pub. We won a glorious three-Test series against SA this winter didn&apos;t we. Lovely stuff.&quot;  45th over: South Africa 156-1 (Smith 81, Amla 51) With ten minutes to go until lunch, James Anderson replaces Graeme Swann, who bowled much better than figures of 7-0-30-0 suggest. Amla reaches to drive the first ball and edges it low through the vacant fourth-slip area area for four. Then he plays one of those rubber-wristed whips behind square on the leg side for a couple. And to complete a miserable over, a misfield from Cook in the covers turns nought into four and brings Amla to an impressively serene half-century from 75 balls. &quot;There is nothing worse than being in the first session of the 2nd day and knowing that more than likely you are going to lose this Test &quot;but the process may last 15-20 hours. &quot; says Aman Anand, who has obviously never had piles. &quot;It is like being stabbed in the eye for a similar period of time\u2026 does any other sport provide so much agony over the course of one match? And does our continual observance of the game make us worse than crystal-meth addicts?!&quot; The exclamation mark. You had to include the bloody exclamation mark.  46th over: South Africa 159-1 (Smith 83, Amla 52) So how can England save this? Their only hope is that we only get around 60 overs per day because of the weather, and then the time/runs equation comes into play in the third innings. It is not entirely inconcei- oh I can&apos;t lie to you. &quot;OK Rob, enough is enough,&quot; says Bernard Hughes. &quot;If I ever meet Daryl Harper I shall have to let him know what I think of him, probably a good hard stare and then maybe walk away shaking my head. And tutting. You&apos;ve got to let these people know where they stand.&quot; I would even go so far as to exhale menacingly in his direction from 15 yards away.  47th over: South Africa 160-1 (Smith 84, Amla 52) That&apos;s lunch. South Africa trail by just 20 runs, and it&apos;s been emphatically their session. Smith should have been dismissed earlier in the day - and we will hear more about that incident - but since then he has given another formidable demonstration of his granite will. The walls are closing in on England, and it&apos;s very hard to see how they can get out of this. On that cheery note, I&apos;ll hand over to Andy Bull. Thanks for your emails.  LUNCH  Afternoon then everyone. This is fun, isn&apos;t it?  I thought I&apos;d pop on to start typing a little earlier than usual so I could bring you a little coverage of Sky&apos;s lunchtime chat. Supposedly they will be explaining just what the hell happened with that Smith dismissal.  &quot;There&apos;s no point in making excuses,&quot; chirrups Gavin Facey, &quot;it may have been a bad decision (one which I haven&apos;t seen yet) but England have been due a hammering for some time now and have been outplayed in 2 of the 3 previous tests in the series. If Smith was given out then someone else like Kallis would only have gone on to make a massive score (and still probably will), either way we were in for a stuffing since the very first ball of the test. If offered 1-1 at the start of the series I would have taken it, so let&apos;s accept defeat and just look forward to a thrilling series against Bangladesh...&quot;  Well here are the replays of the dismissal that wasn&apos;t. Firstly, how Hill didn&apos;t give it out first time around I&apos;m not sure. Goldenhair Gower explains that there are three companies broadcasting footage of the match, each with their own sound engineer, whose job it is to co-ordinate the stump microphone with the footage. The sound engineer who works SABC, who are providing the feed for the third umpire, cocked up. Neither the third umpire, nor the SABC commentators, heard the noise. Supposedly the ICC are investigating why this human error occured now. If they had only read my Spin column from a month or so ago they&apos;d already know the answer: donut theory.  Botham seems to have some kind of personal grudge against the SABC sound engineer who is an old acquaintance (nemesis perhaps?) of his. Seems the sound from the stump mic is faded down most of the time so that we&apos;re spared the swearing and cursing of the players in the middle, and on this occasion the chap failed to turn the volume up again when the replay started.  Well, the time has come the walrus said to talk of other things, of shoes and ships and sealing-wax, of cabbages and kings. Not to mention the weather forecast and England&apos;s chances of somehow saving this game. How can they do it? Benedict Rumbold has a theory: &quot;Very disappointed with all this pessimism. I thought we&apos;d really turned a corner. England&apos;s way out is simple: score at least as many runs in our second innings as South Africa do in their first innings and then bowl them out for less than 180. The old Australian method, nice and easy.&quot;  You can&apos;t keep a good optimist down. Here&apos;s Alex James: &quot;A counter-theory for Gavin&apos;s England&apos;s inevitable &quot;stuffing&quot; theory and all the other pessimists:it&apos;s called England&apos;s 2nd innings. Come on, is KP and Strauss producing the tons they are overdue and a heroic England 400+ in their 2nd knock unimaginable? Yes, England will concede a 200+ 1st innings deficit, but a big England 2nd innigs makes the draw and a series victory a reality.&quot;  I can&apos;t see us getting through this session with our collective will to live intact unless we find a riff, and quick.  Reasons to be cheerful, part 2.  Reasons to be cheerful, part 3, (thanks to James Prout for that).  &quot;If we&apos;ve learnt anything about this England side it&apos;s that they&apos;re very difficult to beat,&quot; says Jonathan Sexton, rightly enough. &quot;What are the chances of SA spending far too long getting a lead of 300 and, with the help of the inclement Durban weather, we end up batting out four sessions for a draw?&quot; Well, the draw is currently being listed at odds of 11-4 by the bookies... and the England win is a generous 20-1.  Anyone for a slice  of Vic Marks&apos; lunchtime report?  48th over: South Africa 166-1 (Smith 85, Amla 52) So Stuart Broad will open the attack after lunch, bowling to Smith. He hammers down a pair of short balls to start, the second of which is fended away behind square for a single. Despite that, Broad likes the plan, and whistles down two more bouncers at Amla, the second of these disappearing over the top of the batsman and the &apos;keeper and running away for five wides. D&apos;oh. Alex Harris, I don&apos;t care if that song is called I Wish It Would Rain, there is no way, absolutely no way at all, that I am posting a link to a Phil Collins video.  49th over: South Africa 166-1 (Smith 85, Amla 52) And at the other end, it&apos;s James Anderson. Smith clips a drive to mid-off, and another to mid-on. Smith can&apos;t get the ball away, picking out fielders or patting the ball back down the pitch to the bowler. It&apos;s a maiden over.  50th over: South Africa 166-1 (Smith 85, Amla 52) Broad bangs Amla on the bottom hand with a vicious short ball. He then switches around the wicket. Another maiden. &quot;Conspiracy theory 101&quot; is the subject line of Michael Hunt&apos;s email, &quot;Your picture clearly shows an umpire attempting to hide a newly-received wodge of cash in his left hand. So that&apos;s that cleared up.&quot;  51st over: South Africa 171-1 (Smith 86, Amla 56) &quot;Just a quick comment on Jonathan Sexton&apos;s comment,&quot; writes Josias Visagie, &quot;Good luck with banking on the &apos;inclement Durban weather&apos; to save a draw. Seeing as the test is played in Johannesburg.&quot; A good point that, and well made. Smith drops a single out to square leg, and Amla then chops a cut shot into his own boot, coming within a whisker of playing on. He squeezes the next ball through to third man off the outside edge. Does anyone else suspect that it is going to be a very long time before the England management decides to put the England team up in a luxury hotel as a jaunt mid-way through the tour again?  52nd over: South Africa 174-1 (Smith 88, Amla 57) Smith turns a run away to leg, an action every bit as familiar and predictable as the ticking of the minute hand on the clock. Amla is flapping here, he plays but misses an uppercut, and then loops the ball up off the leading edge. It would have been an easy catch for a man at mid-on. Had there been anyone there. &quot;I think the picture looks more like the England captain giving the umpire the ol&apos; stinkeye for a sub par Tommy Cooper impression,&quot; muses Paul Billington, &quot;The hand gestures are half-baked and he doesn&apos;t even have a fez.&quot;  53rd over: South Africa 176-1 (Smith 90, Amla 57) Anderson catches Smith on his left hand with a ball that shot up off a divot. Smith, masochist that he is, has a big chuckle about it. That&apos;s a lovely shot, Smith straight-driving down the ground for two runs. Sky are running an eye over the rankings, largely because Smith&apos;s form in the series so far has pushed him up to No3 in the world. Astonishingly, England&apos;s highest placed batsman is Andrew Strauss, at a lowly 16. Everyone else is 20 or higher.  54th over: South Africa 180-1 (Smith 93, Amla 57) &quot;I have to agree that England should never have been put up in a luxury hotel,&quot; says Andrew Chappell, &quot;Can you imagine Capello allowing such frivolity after a mere one win and two draws by an under-par England side?&quot; No, being footballers I expect they&apos;d be staying in a seven-star throughout anyway. Smith claps a long hop around the corner for two runs, and, as he taps the next ball away for a single to a similar place, the scores are levelled.  Vic Marks has been busy this morning and no mistake. He&apos;s just sent in a blog on this morning&apos;s comntroversy, which has been dubbed by at least one man in this office as &apos;silentsnickohmygoditsanothergatestorygate&apos;. Anyway, go and grumble about it all over there if you&apos;re in the mood.  55th over: South Africa 191-1 (Smith 99, Amla 62) Smith squeezes four through the slips, and tucks two to mid-wicket. A single to mid-on takes him to 99. &quot;I&apos;m feeling massively flungover (a composite of hangover and flu),&quot; writes, umm, James Anderson, &quot;I have lots of work to do and the cricket is not easing my pain. Wickets please, Mr Bull.&quot; Surely that&apos;s your job Jimmy? And while I&apos;ve got your attention, can you please not bowl any more long hops to Hashim Amla? &apos;Cause he&apos;s only going to spank you for four through the leg side. Which is exactly what he has just done.  56th over: South Africa 196-1 (Smith 104, Amla 62) The first bowling change of the session brings Ryan Sidebottom into the attack. Strauss brings his fielders in close to try and deny Smith the single that will raise his 20th Test century. Much good it does him: Smith threads four through third man, takes off his helmet and waves his bat at the adoring crowd. How does that old quote about Keyser Soze go? &apos;He showed these men of will what will reallty was&apos;? &quot;I see you&apos;ve hastily changed your typo,&quot; says Neil Cole, the fifteenth person to point out that I just called Vic Marks &apos;busty&apos; rather than &apos;busy&apos;. &quot;A great piece of fielding at Freudian slip.&quot;  57th over: South Africa 201-1 (Smith 104, Amla 63) It&apos;s Graeme Swann&apos;s turn to suffer now. Amla pats two runs out to cover, and he and Smith the swap singles out to the leg-side.  WICKET! Smith 105 c Strauss b Sidebottom (58th over: South Africa 203-2)  Don&apos;t call it a comeback. Smith edges straight to first slip, where Strauss clings on to a catch that flew straight into his gut. Oh look: it&apos;s Jacques Kallis. What a treat for England fans.  59th over: South Africa 204-2 (Amla 67, Kallis 1) &quot;I have been laughing my head off at the OBO all morning,&quot; says llse Smalberger, &quot;Which has made for a few akward moments this morning seeing as I am helping at my husband&apos;s oncology practice (at reception) and the atmosphere in the waiting room isn&apos;t exactly conducive to laughing. Anyway, I think you are being way too hard on the England cricket players and not hard enough on us South Africans. Fair enough, Smith is in good form, as is Kallis, Morkel and Steyn. The rest ... Duminy and Prince have yet to do anything worth getting excited about, Boucher will soon be a grandfather and we don&apos;t have anyone to replace him and AB de Villiers is really a bit &apos;knit one, slip one&apos; at the moment. So you see, we all have problems.&quot; Just goes to show how wrong Spitting Image were, doesn&apos;t it?  60th over: South Africa 208-2 (Amla 71, Kallis 2) Amla pulls three runs out to deep mid-wicket. Here comes the rain again, pitter-pattering down across the ground. The umpires are frowning at each other, and yes, they&apos;re going off. On come the covers, and off go the players. Rain stopped play.  The weather has really closed in. It looks absolutely filthy, heavy grey cloud and buckets of rain. In fact, it&apos;s so bad that the Sky feed is cracking up and cutting out. There is not going to be any play for a long while yet, if at all.  In fact the pitch is already flooding. Thunder is rumbling out overhead. It&apos;s all a looking a little apocalyptic.  I suppose Nick Pettigrew is referring back to something Smyth was riffing on earlier today, either way I like this little vignette of a story: &quot;There is at least one good example of the use of an exclamation mark. Victor Hugo sent a telegram to his publisher asking how Les Miserables was selling and to save money, simply sent &apos;?&apos;. The reply he got back was: &apos;!&apos;.&quot;  Well, I&apos;m going to go and do some quality mooching, but I&apos;ll pop back in here every now and then to keep you posted. Keep sending me emails if you&apos;d like to force me to carry on working through the afternoon. In the meantime, James Prout would like to ask whether this is premature? The answer, I suspect, is yes.  Hello everyone. Very little chance of any more play today, I&apos;m afraid. Sky have cut away from the ground now and are showing some old highlights of a fifty-over game between England and Australia.  One other interesting twist in today&apos;s big story is this: Test Match Special, along with several other sources, are now stating that the referral fiasco was explicitly umpire Harper&apos;s fault. Apparently he did not realise that he had a volume control switch in his booth, and had failed to turn up the noise when he was confronted with silent footage. Quite simply: d&apos;oh, and double d&apos;oh.  Hello everyone, this just in: there will be a pitch inspection at 2.45pm BST, at which point I guess the umpires will decide if this is off or on for the rest of the day. I&apos;m going to hand over to Rob Smyth now, so he&apos;ll be able to fill you in on all that. Cheerio.  2.21pm Hello. I&apos;ve just been listening to Mazzy Star to lift the spirits. I wonder what&apos;s on Daryl Harper&apos;s iPod. Poor fellow. While we wait for the inspection, I&apos;m going to watch Murder, She Wrote on BBC1. This is gold: Old putz in flat cap and oversized glasses like the ones they wear in Hoxton these days: &quot;Jessica Fletcher you are the most rememberingest woman I have ever met.&quot; JF: &quot;So-and-so [a little kid] is acting very strangely at the moment.&quot; Old putz: &quot;It&apos;s called puberty Jessica.&quot; The Wire? No thanks.  2.25pm The little kid, Kevin, is looking pretty jittery under the severe pressure of a few gentle questions from Jessica Fletcher. I&apos;ve no idea who is dead or why, but I reckon this little maverick had something to do with it. Obviously he didn&apos;t kill them - what kind of message would that send - but he knows something. I can smell it.JF: &quot;Is your mother okay? Perhaps I should call her and ask.&quot; Kevin [instantly]: &quot;We don&apos;t have a phone!&quot; There&apos;s blood on that rascal&apos;s hand; nowt surer.  2.28pm I bloody love Murder, She Wrote. The comma is the clincher. Jessica has knocked on Kevin&apos;s door. &quot;Mom!&quot; screams Kevin, thinking it was her. Then he says to Jessica &quot;she&apos;s sleeping&quot;! That little white lie isn&apos;t going to get past Jessica Fletcher, Kevin. Wise up, sunshine. So now he tells her that his mum has been away for three days.  JF: &quot;You have to tell the sheriff.&quot; Kevin: &quot;If I tell the sheriff, I may never see my mother again!&quot; Homicide: Life On The Street? No thanks.  2.31pm &quot;That Murder She Wrote quote isn&apos;t authenic is it?&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;That series was made in the days before puberty was invented. I should know, I was supposed to be doing the puberty thing in that era.&quot; It was a direct quote, honestly. I wouldn&apos;t lie. Lying is bad. I know this because Kevin lied and was promptly rumbled. SUBLIMINAL TELEVISION AT ITS BEST.  2.32pm Who do you think did it? In fact, does anyone even know who&apos;s been killed? That&apos;d be quite useful.  2.33pm Mrs Frantzen in the sheriff&apos;s office has just accused Missy Marlet of rendering services in exchange for cash. Should this really be on before the watershed?  2.34pm Kevin and Mrs Fletcher have found a car in the woods. Jack is in it, and he&apos;s dead! I have no idea who Jack is at this point, but that&apos;s not relevant. He&apos;s dead! JF: &quot;Sheriff, do you know what caused the accident?&quot; Old putz: &quot;Oh it was no accident Jess. He had the back of his head caved in.&quot;  2.38pm The sheriff reckons Kevin&apos;s mum did it! Jessica Fletcher is unconvinced. &quot;It was Kevin and his mum&apos;s lecherous landlord who was murdered,&quot; says Robert Hoare. &quot;He definitely deserved it. Please don&apos;t ask how I know this.&quot;  2.40pm In a desperately disappointing development, I have had to turn back to the cricket. The weather is reasonable and it would appear we will get some more play sometime after 3pm. &quot;Worried about Mrs Fletcher,&quot; says Anthony Wesselbaum. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want the old bag coming round my house for dinner bumping someone off, framing me and writing a book in the process.&quot;  2.42pm &quot;Is this the Murder, She Wrote episode with the shoe factory?&quot; asks Jim Carpenter. &quot;I think it&apos;s her suspect boss who&apos;s responsible for the slaying. Digital TV is a wonderful thing \u2013 there are 3 episodes a day on Alibi.&quot; This may be so, but watching them isn&apos;t compulsory, you realise? There&apos;s a whole world out there: NCIS on FX, Ballykissangel on ITV3, The Charge At Feather River on TCM.  2.45pm Here come the umpires. Beefy is out on the field and reckons the bowlers&apos; run-ups are still a little bit too wet to be playable. &quot;JF is the world&apos;s biggest serial killer,&quot; says Andy Bradshaw. &quot;She&apos;s the devil incarnate. And don&apos;t get me started on that butcher Marple.&quot;  2.47pm &quot;Daryl Harper did it,&quot; announces Joanne Beasley. &quot;He&apos;ll get blamed for us losing the match so we may as well lump it all in together. It&apos;ll save on the court costs.&quot;  2.49pm The umpires are still inspecting the run-ups. The consensus is that we will get play today, but maybe not just yet. &quot;What&apos;s on Daryl Harper&apos;s iPod?&quot; says Richard Marsden. &quot;Pump Up The Volume, obviously.&quot;  2.51pm The umpires are wandering off the field to have a chat with Graeme Smith and Andrew Strauss. &quot;In case you&apos;re interested, and frankly I can&apos;t see why you wouldn&apos;t be, the dead man Jack is Jack Franzen, the flirtatious scrooge of a landlord that I mentioned earlier,&quot; says the Guardian&apos;s Murder, She Wrote correspondent (what a job that would be), Robert Hoare. &quot;Kevin ends up staying with Jessica until his mum reappears. She, however, is arrested for Jack&apos;s murder and it&apos;s up to Jessica and Jack to prove it was one of the other suspects. These include other tenants such as his mum&apos;s employer; moccasin factory boss Owen Brownwell, and merry widow Gloria Franzen. Who could it have been?&quot; IT&apos;S KEVIN. WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT LITTLE RASCAL KEVIN.  2.55pm The umpires are going to inspect again at 3.10pm with a view to restarting at 3.30pm. Should that happen, we could have a maximum of 90 minutes&apos; play. &quot;Harper&apos;s iPod,&quot; says Andy Bradshaw. &quot;Surely Enjoy the Silence by Depeche Mode would be more appropriate.&quot;  2.59pm We&apos;ve missed the ending of Murder,,,,,, She Wrote! God darn. Robert Hoare, please put me out of my not inconsiderable misery.  3.02pm &quot;Between your two posts at 2:34 and 2:38, I count three exclamation marks. Tsk tsk,&quot; says Darren Kilfara. &quot;Personally, I think the best use of exclamation marks occurs by experts evaluating the moves in a chess match\u2013 &quot;!&quot; for a good move, &quot;!!&quot; for a superb move, the rare &quot;!?&quot; for a good-but-risky move, and the even rarer &quot;?!&quot; for a questionable-and-risky move, along with &quot;?&quot; for a dodgy move and &quot;??&quot; for a hopeless one. Maybe the OBO writers could start using this notation to rate each over or wicket taken? I&apos;ll volunteer &quot;Pietersen c Boucher b Steyn 0 ??&quot;, for example, for use in the forthcoming second innings.&quot;  3.08pm While we wait, Sky are revisiting the wonderful 2003 series between these sides to a soundtrack of David Holmes&apos; Don&apos;t Die Just Yet. Who says cricket isn&apos;t cool?  3.15pm Play will indeed restart at 3.30pm. I&apos;m off for a wander. See you then.  3.25pm There will be 14.5 overs, weather permitting. It&apos;s an odd session in the sense that the team who want the game to progress, South Africa, are the team who would ordinarily have nothing to gain from such an awkward mini-session on a sweaty pitch, whereas the team who want to be off the field, England, would normally crave an opportunity like this.  60th over: South Africa 209-2 (Amla 72, Kallis 2) What England would give for Gus Fraser now. He&apos;d run amok. Instead it&apos;s Sidebottom to bowl the final three deliveries of his 16th over. The second ball swings into Amla, who punches it into the covers for a single. &quot;I&apos;m assuming Knock On Wood isn&apos;t on Harper&apos;s iPod,&quot; says Ian Griffiths. &quot;Sorry.&quot;  61st over: South Africa 209-2 (Amla 72, Kallis 2) Broad will start at the dismally named Golf Course End. He bowled splendidly this morning, chiefly through pitching that red thing up; after a &apos;Hello Hashim!&apos; bouncer first up, he does the same here, but the line isn&apos;t straight enough and Amla is able to leave five of the six deliveries. Make. Them. Play. &quot;Murder, She Wrote - the result,&quot; says Robert Hoare. &quot;It was the moccasin factory boss Owen Brownwell that did I tells ya. He&apos;d had enough of Jack&apos;s dastardly demands for money so decided to cave his head in with Kevin&apos;s mum&apos;s shovel. The natural course of action for any up-and-coming moccasin factory boss. I&apos;m definitely adding Guardian&apos;s Murder, She Wrote correspondent to my CV; that redundancy period at the start of the year is really starting to pay off.&quot; I really do have a jones for that comma in Murder, She Wrote. It&apos;s ridiculous.  62nd over: South Africa 212-2 (Amla 72, Kallis 5) Sidebottom will continue, so Anderson is snubbed for the second time in the day. That is a real surprise, and I give it approximately 0.00001231234123 seconds before Beefy goes off on a lively one in the Sky box. I have to agree with him. Sidebottom&apos;s second ball squares Kallis up a touch, and a low edge goes down to third man for three. There is discernible inswing to the right-handers for Sidebottom, but it&apos;s relatively harmless stuff.  63rd over: South Africa 214-2 (Amla 72, Kallis 7) Kallis, aiming to leave a wide delivery from Broad, inadvertently pings it off the face of the bat and through the diving Anderson at gully. Was that a chance? I think it was, but I&apos;d like to see a second replay. It wasn&apos;t a great over from Broad, to be honest: too wide again. Unless that&apos;s a deliberate ploy and England are just happy to bowl as economically as possible. If that is the tactic, it&apos;s a dubious one at best. &quot;We&apos;ve got a bit of a riff going on Tw*tter at the moment \u2013 do you have a film obsession to confess?&quot; says Lytnn Bashforth. &quot;I saw The Matrix nine times at the cinema, Andy Bradshaw watched Starship Troopers eight times. We had to fill the lonely time somehow, waiting for the mauling to resume in Johannesburg.&quot; I may have watched Amelie about 12 times at the cinema. Modern man is me. I may also have woken up to the gentle thunderclaps of the menu on the DVD of Donnie Darko about 472 times, having apparently put it on when stumbling in at all hours. Lord.  Bad light stops play. 63.2 overs: South Africa 215-2 (Amla 73, Kallis 7) Kallis does well to jab down on a curving yorker from Sidebottom, and that&apos;s almost certainly the final ball of the day because the umpires have taken the players off for bad light. It wasn&apos;t the batsmen&apos;s decision; the umpires took a reading when the players went off yesterday and must remain consistent with that.  Play has not officially been called off but that will surely be it for the day. South Africa are in complete control, leading by 35 runs with eight wickets remaining, but the weather will be of real concern to them. We have only had 111.1 overs in two days so far, and if that rate continues this match will take a deal of winning.  3.52pm &quot;Can you find an old episode of &apos;Howards Way&apos; and talk us through that now they are off again please?&quot; says Alex Walsh. I would love to set up a website MBMing and reviewing old television. The Dawson&apos;s Creek ReUp would be a particular favourite of the masses.  3.55pm That is indeed the close of play.

But that&apos;s the route being taken by the Red Riding trilogy, the film adaptations of three of David Peace&apos;s four northern noir crime novels that aired on Channel 4 last year \u2013 they&apos;re now set to enjoy a theatrical release in the US, kicking off next month in New York. It&apos;s certainly an intriguing meeting of cultures; what even the most anglophile American audience will make of stories so steeped in the murkiest stuff of late 20th-century British history remains to be seen.  There again, it&apos;s never been a fruitful pastime predicting which British movies might find favour in the States. Those with long memories will recall the unlikely box-office success of curios such as pot-growing farce Saving Grace and Mike Hodges&apos;s elegant Croupier, films that drew large US crowds with a far lower initial profile than Red Riding. More recently there was The Bank Job, the knockabout 70s heist romp written by TV veterans Clement and La Frenais that attracted large numbers of Americans to a story involving Princess Margaret and a denouement at Paddington station (and which, together with the now-cancelled US version of Life on Mars may have helped nudge the door open for Peace&apos;s altogether more hellish vision of the same era). Meanwhile, Bronson, of all things \u2013 the would-be-Brechtian portrait of &quot;Britain&apos;s most violent prisoner&quot; \u2013 mopped up all manner of critical acclaim when it crossed the Atlantic late last year. So the tea leaves can&apos;t be trusted, but crime is universal. Which may be why in the US, the last thing on anyone&apos;s mind about Red Riding looks to be its nationality. Rather, the marketing suggests a highbrow genre piece seasoned with a touch of horror, complete with a poster that could have seen service as an Omen sequel, and buzz in the trade press framing the films not as insights into the brutalised soul of the north of England but spiritual heirs to The Silence of the Lambs, boiled down to their narrative bare bones as tales about bogeymen and missing kids.  No one is suggesting there&apos;s a grand conspiracy at work here to strip British films of their Britishness (sad as it was to see Salon remark this week that the magnificent Fish Tank will likely prove &quot;too implacably British&quot; to grab an American audience). Culturally though, it&apos;s an interesting process to observe \u2013 because for me, the genius of Red Riding never lay in its plot. Taut as the novels&apos; storytelling is, what made the work hum on the page and occasionally on screen was the raw, near-palpable evocation of Yorkshire, Peter Sutcliffe, police culture, insatiable property development, the alien but eerily familiar England of the 70s and early 80s. The themes of misogyny and moral rot came through so clearly because of the mass of fine-grained details of time and place \u2013 whereas the films risk being dressed up as mere generic crime yarns. All of which goes double for the studio remake currently working its way down the pipeline. Now in my dotage I try to remember there are better things to be outraged by than dodgy sounding remakes, but this does seem an especially rum proposition \u2013 directed by the declining Ridley Scott and, odder still, relocated to Pennsylvania. That, on the face of it, is the kind of idea solely designed to set off a conniption. But then, who knows, maybe Scott will abruptly rediscover his mojo, by some miracle connecting with the spirit of the original novels not just as a Hollywood fixture, but a son, however long ago, of South Shields and West Hartlepool.  And after all, despite its thick Leeds accent, the original Red Riding quartet was in fact itself an exotic hybrid, created across borders and time zones. Peace uncannily conjured up 70s Yorkshire \u2013 but through novels that took as their stylistic inspiration James Ellroy&apos;s staccato portraits of postwar Los Angeles, pieced together not in dingy flats in Beeston but Peace&apos;s home at the time in Tokyo, all that hypnotically authentic context created after the fact and thousands of miles away. So perhaps it&apos;s not so strange to find Peace&apos;s version of noir now making its way back over the ocean. Like a lot of what we think of as definitively British, beneath the surface it&apos;s a little more complex than that."}, {"sentences": ["It is still some way from the Michelin group&apos;s new darling, Tokyo, which only acquired its first guide in 2007 but now boasts 197 starred dining places in the city alone, overtaking Paris."], "tags": ["The Michelin Guide", "Life and style", "Food & drink", "Gordon Ramsay", "Restaurants", "Chefs", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-15T19:15:00Z", "title": "Michelin Guide 2010: Star falls from Gordon Ramsay's at Claridge's", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/15/michelin-guide-claridges-star-dropped", "article": "Gordon Ramsay&apos;s restaurant empire received a fresh blow tonight after his opulent outpost at the London hotel Claridge&apos;s lost its single Michelin star in the 2010 UK edition of the dining guide.     Gordon Ramsay. Photograph: Channel 4/PR    The Art Deco dining room, where evening set menus cost between \u00a380 and \u00a3150 a person, is the latest debit from Ramsay&apos;s collection of stars, now down to five from a peak of eight. He will be relieved that his flagship eponymous restaurant in Chelsea retained its coveted three-star status, one of only four in the UK. Also fortunately for the 43-year-old superchef, who has been accused of spreading his talents too thinly with 24 establishments in four continents along with a busy international TV career, any embarrassment will be shared by Michelin, which for the second year was forced to rush-release its list after a leak. In 2009 the information appeared on the internet five days before the planned launch. This time online book retailer Amazon was blamed after an edition of the 2010 guide was accidentally shipped out to a chef ahead of next Thursday&apos;s publication date. &quot;We hadn&apos;t had a problem for at least a decade before that,&quot; said the editor of the UK guide, Derek Bulmer. &quot;The book was ordered by a restaurant who turned out to be one of the recipients of a new star. They phoned up for confirmation and to ask if they could start telling everyone.&quot; The culprit outed himself as Paul Kitching, whose Edinburgh restaurant 21212 boasts a new single star. His partner, Katie, ordered the guide in advance to learn their fate. Kitching&apos;s establishment is among a record 140 to receive one or more stars in the guide, which covers the UK and the Republic of Ireland, three higher than last year. It is still some way from the Michelin group&apos;s new darling, Tokyo, which only acquired its first guide in 2007 but now boasts 197 starred dining places in the city alone, overtaking Paris. There was one new three-starred restaurant, Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester, another top-end hotel restaurant run by a culinary superstar. The French chef, who runs a more modest empire, opened the London establishment in 2007 to mixed reviews, but moved up to two stars last year and has now advanced further. Apart from Ramsay, the other three-star awards are held by Michel Roux&apos;s Waterside Inn and Heston Blumenthal&apos;s Fat Duck, both in Bray in Berkshire. &quot;We were pleasantly surprised that we were able to find so many starred restaurants right in the middle of a recession,&quot; said Bulmer. &quot;We feared there might be a lot more closures than there were. A lot of chefs have been very imaginative.&quot; Only six of the 18 one-star newcomers are in London. There were also three extra starred gastropubs, a near-50% rise on the seven in 2009. &quot;We&apos;re moving towards that sort of flexible, informal dining, which people seem to want at the moment,&quot; said Bulmer. Will he call it a day? The big story of the new Michelin star results is not winners but losers. The removal of the only star from Gordon Ramsay at Claridge&apos;s is not simply yet another knock to the big man&apos;s reputation, after months of them. It presents an acute business challenge, and given the finances have been none too rosy either recently \u2013 the last available accounts show a loss of \u00a34.3m \u2013 that was certainly something he didn&apos;t need. It could of course have been worse. He could have lost a star from the flagship restaurant in Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea, London, which holds three. That really would have tarnished the brand. On a good night at at the restaurant at Claridge&apos;s they can push 150 covers or more through. And that&apos;s how you make real money, especially at \u00a375 a head including coffee. The question is who will be willing to part with a minimum of \u00a3250 for two including drinks, for an experience Michelin has now declared is in decline? So what will Ramsay and his father-in-law, who runs the business, decide to do? Calling it a day at what could turn into a money pit may well be the most logical move. And that&apos;s what the Michelin stars are really all about: business.

In the movies, dysfunctional families are all too alike, while in real life happy families have to work hard at strategies that provide them with a satisfying modus vivendi. In Hirokazu Kore-Eda&apos;s impressive Still Walking, a middle-class Japanese family come together for a characteristic bout of mutual irritation and destabilisation at the home of a constantly bickering father and mother, a retired general practitioner and his wife who live on a steep hill near the sea. It&apos;s a hot summer&apos;s day, the 15th anniversary of the death of their beloved younger son, Junpei. In addition to the older son, a daughter and grandchildren, they&apos;ve invited out of sheer perversity the 25-year-old, dim-witted, overweight lad whom Junpei died saving from drowning, and they subject him to insults and humiliation. The older son, currently between jobs, is mocked by his self-centred father while his patient, loving wife and her young son by an earlier marriage are patronised by the querulous, bitchy mother. The sister, who has plans to move back into the parental home, gets on everyone&apos;s nerves, as does her posturing husband and noisy children. Out of filial piety alone, the older son suffers the verbal slings and arrows his parents propel in his direction, and he takes his family along to visit Junpei&apos;s grave where his mother proceeds to throw away the flowers left by an earlier mourner. The film is delicately observed in the subdued fashion of Ozu but reverses the situation of Ozu&apos;s masterly Tokyo Story, where a thoughtful, loving elderly couple is callously treated by ungrateful children, with only a dutiful daughter-in-law to act in a kindly, welcoming fashion. The director of this quasi-autobiographical picture suggests (as does his apparent stand-in, the older brother, in a coda set a decade or so hence) that family life is to be nourished and cherished.

As the Japanese transport minister, Seiji Maehara, prepared to put the airline in the hands of a state-backed turnaround body, it suffered the indignity of seeing shares reach a record low of four yen (2.6 pence). JAL, which has received three government bailouts in the past decade, has seen the value of its shares fall by 90% since the beginning of the month. With a market value of $150m (\u00a391m) \u2013 less than the price of a Boeing 747 jet \u2013 the airline is now trailing the likes of Croatia Airlines and Jazeera Airways. JAL shares could soon be worth nothing if, as expected, they are de-listed from the Tokyo stock exchange. Despite filing for what would be Japan&apos;s sixth-biggest ever bankruptcy, the airline is expected to stay in business while it attempts to rid itself of debts of $16bn and repair its battered reputation. &quot;The government wants to continue to support JAL to ensure its continued stable and safe operations,&quot; Maehara told reporters. In exchange for financial backing from the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation (Etic), JAL will reportedly be asked to cut 15,600 jobs \u2013 one-third of its workforce \u2013 by March 2013 and cut unprofitable routes. The airline is expecting operating losses of 265bn yen (\u00a31.8bn) for the year to the end of March, having amassed losses of 51bn yen last year. Its long-term future will be dependent on efforts to emerge as a leaner business, probably with additional support through new partnerships with overseas carriers that could transform the airline business in the Asia-Pacific market.

It will begin its recovery by filing for court protection \u2013 a move akin to Chapter 11 in the US \u2013 which would pave the way for a 300bn yen injection of fresh capital from Etic. The body indicated that it would draw on government-backed funding to open a line of credit that would enable JAL to buy fuel and parts to keep its planes in the air. JAL&apos;s main creditors, which include three Japanese megabanks, have reportedly agreed to waive debts of 350bn yen. The airline is also likely to offload unprofitable side businesses to give itself a fighting chance of recovery amid falling passenger numbers, rising fuel prices and high restructuring costs. Its first obvious break with the past will be the expected appointment of Kazuo Inamori, the founder of the electrical components maker Kyocera, as the chief executive in place of Haruka Nishimatsu. A very different airline is expected to emerge under the stewardship of the 77-year-old Inamori, a successful entrepreneur but an airline industry novice. Under the restructuring plan, JAL could retire 53 of its largest jets and replace them with smaller aircraft suited to domestic and regional flights. The airline will also have to decide on rival offers of investment from two US airlines keen to gain a bigger foothold in Asia. American Airlines and its partners, including British Airways, say they are willing to invest $1.4bn to keep JAL as part of their Oneworld Alliance.

Here too, we discovered that compatibility will be added to LittleBigPlanet and that Capcom has Resident Evil 5: Alternative Edition on the way. Later, Little known Portuguese developer announced support within its forthcoming title Under Siege.  More recently, there has been little detailed chat about possible Arc titles. Of course the likes of EA, Sega and Ubisoft have all said they have dev kits and are working on projects, but as with Natal, there&apos;s little real information. So yes, spring always looked a little ambitious. So now we have Arc going straight up against Natal - two quite different philosophies about the future of game control virtually head-to-head.

Yet his long career straddled many genres, including landscapes and cityscapes, plant portraits and architecture, corporate and advertising work, and a host of related activities involving film direction and production, teaching and writing, and lots of travel, mainly in the US, the far east and across Europe. Stock was born in the Bronx, New York, to an English mother and a Swiss father. His father died when he was 16, and within a year, the boy had dropped out of school and enlisted in the war effort. On being discharged from the army, Stock became apprenticed, like other Magnum photographers before him, to Gjon Mili, before joining the world-famous agency in 1951. From then on, his work cornered a market, winning first prize in the Life photo competition in 1959 (with a photo-essay on Europeans displaced since the war, Homeless in New York) and finally receiving the Advertising Photographers of America prize in 1991. From the time of his shot of the moody Dean in 1955, hunched into his outsized overcoat against the Manhattan rain, crossing a desolate Times Square apparently with only a cigarette for company, Stock was launched on his first specialism. He patented his film star series, bringing out his first book, Portrait of a Young Man, James Dean (1956), and continued to publish almost annually until 2005, when he reprised his first work with James Dean: Fifty Years Ago. Stock&apos;s image of Hepburn gazing out of a car window with a rueful half-smile brought out the star&apos;s youthful look, without pose or affectation. Her &quot;attitude of childlike discovery in an adult world&quot; captivated Stock, and suited his approach. Stock&apos;s love of jazz played less to the new teenage generation in unfocused revolt and more to the classic imagery of smoky dives and smooching couples, gathered around a piano or bandstand. Close-ups taken onstage, or in a crowded dressing room, show Earl Hines at the keyboard, his head thrown back and in full throat, or Armstrong on a reclining chair beside a rail of neatly buttoned suits, barelegged in a spotted robe, eyes closed under a white bandana, cigarette in hand and a wide smile on his face. A New Orleans street scene shows Kid &quot;Punch&quot; Miller, trumpet under one arm, framed between the balcony supports of a traditional French townhouse as he walks home from work. Stock&apos;s informal portraits were included in Jazz Street (published, with a text by Nat Hentoff, in 1960) and in 1962 helped Stock to win first prize in the International Photography competition in Poland. As the hippy movement came to prominence, Stock produced a series on the counterculture and on motorcycle gangs. The different forms of self-styled tribes were meticulously documented for magazines including Stern, Life and Paris Match and in books such as The\u00a0Happy Year (1963) and California Trip (1970). According to the broadcaster Claire O&apos;Neill, the image of the dancing hippy at Venice Beach, from 1968, &quot;was taken at a rock festival when a girl jumped in front of Stick&apos;s camera onstage. It was a fleeting, accidental moment, and yet the photo itself is timeless. Perhaps it&apos;s because Stock was both curious about and accepting of his (counter) culture that, when it comes to articulate images, his are some of the most eloquent. If there is one thing to be learned from Stock, it has nothing to do with composition or lighting or f-stops. It&apos;s about being adventurous and observant and, heaven forbid, maybe even a bit rebellious.&quot; The same year, Stock took a leave of\u00a0absence from Magnum and set up the film company Visual Objectives Inc, for which he shot several documentaries, including Efforts to Provoke, Quest and\u00a0British Youth. From 1969 to 1970, he\u00a0served as vice-president of Magnum&apos;s film and new media division, while he continued to produce and direct for cinema and television. Working partly out of the south of France, and travelling regularly to Italy, Stock became increasingly interested in the environment. A book and/or exhibition followed almost annually and in 1977, he held his first major retrospective at New York&apos;s International Centre of Photography. Other large shows were held at the Whitney gallery in New York; the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Art Moderne in Paris; Frankfurt&apos;s Schirm Kunsthalle; the Art Institute of\u00a0Chicago; the Sony gallery in Tokyo; and\u00a0London&apos;s HackelBury gallery. During the 1980s and 90s, Stock added detailed flower abstracts to his portfolio, alongside modern urban architecture. He was now working regularly in colour as well as black and white and developed a particular interest in St Francis of Assisi, the subject of three of his books. He was in increasing demand as a workshop leader, teaching in Scandinavia and Japan as well as across the US. In his essay for Contemporary Photographers (1982), Ralph Pomeroy summarised Stock&apos;s legacy: &quot;Stock&apos;s choice of subject, his attitude of observance, the &apos;colour&apos; of his interests, reveal him as truly of his time, not in the sense of being &apos;with it&apos;, which has to do with the ephemeral and fashion, but in the sense of attunement to the temper of American modern experience.&quot; Stock is survived by his wife, the author Susan Richards, and two sons and a daughter. \u2022 Dennis Stock, photographer, born 24 July 1928; died 11 January 2010"}, {"sentences": ["When Setsuko Hara \u2013 his signature siren \u2013 utters the words &quot;Isn&apos;t life disappointing?&quot; towards the end of Tokyo Story, the impact is dizzying.", "This week&apos;s Late Autumn (a reworking of Late Spring, which he made a decade earlier) is the second Ozu rerelease of the month, after Tokyo Story, both part of the BFI&apos;s retrospective."], "tags": ["Yasujiro Ozu", "Eric Rohmer", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-23T00:05:05Z", "title": "As Yasujiro Ozu reaches Late Autumn he's become master of slow cinema", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/23/yosujiro-ozu-john-patterson", "article": "Last week we lost Eric Rohmer, the chattiest and least stylistically demonstrative (allegedly) of the French new wavers, and a conversation ensued all week about whether or not watching his films really was, as Gene Hackman&apos;s character Harry Moseby said in Night Moves, &quot;kinda like watching paint dry&quot;. We could have much the same conversation about Yasujiro Ozu, I suppose, if we wanted to stay stupid for another whole week, but let&apos;s not. Let&apos;s leave behind a vocabulary in which words like slow, contemplative, austere and mild are used pejoratively, and welcome the chance to enter Ozu&apos;s radiantly calm universe. It&apos;s a quiet back room in the House Of Cinema, where life unfolds at a measured pace, parcelled out in simple, static shots of talkative families at mealtimes and other social rituals, where the same stories are told over and over again (he remade several of his early silent classics with sound and in colour). Major events \u2013 deaths, marriages \u2013 are often pushed offscreen or elided completely in Ozu&apos;s films, where crumbs of drama and emotional upset feel like banquets once they are served. When Setsuko Hara \u2013 his signature siren \u2013 utters the words &quot;Isn&apos;t life disappointing?&quot; towards the end of Tokyo Story, the impact is dizzying. Ozu seems to be in the air right now. This week&apos;s Late Autumn (a reworking of Late Spring, which he made a decade earlier) is the second Ozu rerelease of the month, after Tokyo Story, both part of the BFI&apos;s retrospective. Meanwhile, Hirokazu Kore-eda&apos;s current release, Still Walking, is one of few films to successfully emulate the master. Ozu is even clumsily namechecked in the new Michael Cera comedy, Youth In Revolt, itself the antithesis of an Ozu movie. Ozu&apos;s career ran in reverse, somehow. Other film-makers start simple then arm themselves with all the techniques and stylistic influences they can acquire. In the 20th century, film-makers encountered sound, colour, location filming and widescreen camerawork and widened out their movies accordingly. Ozu instead pared back, resisting sound until 1935, eight years into his career, and deploring CinemaScope when it arrived in 1953. Early on, his camera moved more, and dissolves, screen-wipes and other transitional gimmicks were more prevalent. But experience made him foreswear everything that was not Ozu. Every outside influence was jettisoned in search of a purity of expression that, in the end, left no obstacle, nothing, between the viewer and the characters, their words and their faces. Nothingness was big with Ozu: nothing, or little, of his own drunken bachelor life surfaces in his movies. But his world feels that much fuller thanks to the clarity with which he depicts it.

Contrary to what we stated Saoirse Ronan was never a student at Kilkenny College. We accept that Kilkenny College guards the interests of its pupils and regret any implication to the contrary.   Saoirse Ronan turned 15 last April and runs on a different clock from the rest of us. She says she&apos;s glad she didn&apos;t start acting young, because it might have screwed her up and burnt her out. It&apos;s not as if she began acting at, say, three or something. She waited \u00aduntil she was eight, which was more sensible, because when you reach &quot;our age&quot; (she includes me in this) you at least know what you&apos;re doing, and in any case, things didn&apos;t start getting weird until a few years ago, with the Oscar nomination. &quot;So I&apos;m glad I&apos;m only really starting now,&quot; she says firmly. &quot;Because it means I\u00a0can be seen as an actor as opposed to a child \u00adactor.&quot; With\u00a0that, she wriggles forward on the couch and begins eating her spaghetti bolognese lunch. Ronan has a roiling Irish accent, gangly adolescent limbs and long, shampoo-ad hair that falls across her face. From time to time, mid-mouthful, she will refer to friends \u2013 Susan, Keira, \u00adVanessa \u2013 and it takes a moment to realise that she means Sarandon, Knightley and Redgrave, all of whom she\u00a0has worked with and grown close to. She was knee-high to a grasshopper when she landed a role in an Irish soap (The Clinic), and this led to her breakthrough performance as \u00admeddling Briony Tallis in Atonement, which in turn carried her to within touching distance of an Academy Award. Away from the cameras, she likes to sit around, watch the telly, maybe eat a bag of crisps. There is a river at the bottom of her \u00adgarden where she swims in \u00adsummer, and a family dog, \u00adSassie, with\u00a0which she plays all the time. \u00adSometimes she hangs out with her mates; sometimes she plays basketball. &quot;You know,&quot; she\u00a0says, &quot;normal things.&quot; In her latest film, as luck would have\u00a0it, she plays a girl similarly torn between the real world and a gaudy paradise. The Lovely Bones is based on the 2002 bestseller by Alice Sebold and spot\u00adlights 14-year-old Susie Salmon, a kid in 1970s Pennsylvania who is killed by the local pervert, then looks down on her\u00a0family from limbo. &quot;Susie&apos;s in the In-Between,&quot; explains her soulful little brother, and what an In-Between it is. The film is directed by Peter \u00adJackson, of Lord Of The Rings fame, who goes to town on the blue-screen effects and frames Susie&apos;s afterlife as a schoolgirl fantasy, flushed and florid; a land of blooming rose \u00adpetals and sunflower fields; cascading waterfalls and \u00adgiant turntables that you ride like a carousel. For good measure, Jackson also crops up for a Hitchcockian cameo as\u00a0a\u00a0hirsute customer in the local camera store. &quot;I\u00a0think Pete wants to be an actor,&quot; Ronan says. &quot;He wants to be famous!&quot; But she&apos;s only teasing. Ronan was so good in Atonement, arguably the best thing in it, because she gave us the sort of child rarely seen in films. Her Briony Tallis was neither a bad seed nor a clamouring cutey-pie. Instead, she was pensive, watchful and complicated; wise beyond her years, though crucially not quite wise enough to read the nuances of adult sexuality. Some viewers found her unsympathetic, which annoyed the actor, who insists she is an innocent who waded out of her depth. &quot;People say Briony&apos;s a bitch, and she&apos;s not. She&apos;s not vindictive or spiteful. It&apos;s just that she doesn&apos;t express her \u00ademotions; she just sits and observes everything, whereas Susie is much more out there. She&apos;s more your typical teenager, running about in the world, disgusted when she sees her parents kissing.&quot; On balance, Ronan is probably more like Susie than Briony. &quot;It\u00a0wouldn&apos;t be healthy if I were like Briony.&quot; Ronan&apos;s background proves quite the mish-mash. I&apos;ve read that she was born in New York to an actor father who carried her, as a babe in arms, to the set of The Devil&apos;s Own, where she met Brad Pitt. The bald biography makes her sound like a dyed-in-the-wool showbiz brat. But in conver\u00adsation there is something rough-edged about her; an unschooled, irrepressible quality that doesn&apos;t go with the script. Besides, she was born in the Bronx, not the Upper East Side, and moved to County Carlow when she was three. Inevitably, her memories of those early years are sketchy. &quot;Unimportant things. I remember my dad&apos;s friend showing me a little spider in a box that shook its legs, and me getting scared. That, and going to Toys R Us. My mam used to drive me to this huge Toys R Us store outside town. Not to buy anything, but just as an outing, to look at things.&quot; She has no memory of meeting Brad Pitt. Ronan explains that her parents, Paul and \u00adMonica, had moved to New York because things were bad at home in Ireland. He worked in \u00adconstruction and then as a barman, she as a nanny. I tell her this all sounds like some 19th-century novel about immigrants coming to \u00adAmerica. &quot;I know!&quot; she says, and maps out the opening lines. &quot;He was a barman and she was a\u00a0nanny! And times were tough!&quot; Anyway, she continues, what happened was that her dad was tending bar when he met an old Irish actor called Chris O&apos;Neill (&quot;He&apos;s not here any more&quot;) who convinced him to audition for some stage roles, and one thing led to another until the bar&apos;s owner said, &quot;You&apos;ve got to decide. Do you want to be a barman or do you want the acting shit?&quot; Paul Ronan replied, &quot;The acting shit.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t come from a family that has money,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe that&apos;s why this stuff doesn&apos;t bother me. They had to struggle for a long time, and then this happened and things are \u00adbetter.&quot; She gestures vaguely at the hotel room, but I\u00a0think she is referring to the broader picture; the\u00a0&quot;acting shit&quot;. The TV gigs, movie roles and Oscar nomination that brought her to Hollywood, even though she knew she wasn&apos;t going to win. She was just too young; it wasn&apos;t her time. From the outside, Ronan&apos;s life looks to me \u00adalmost as \u00adunreal as Susie Salmon&apos;s afterlife. But, she insists, it doesn&apos;t feel that way to her. Of course it has its oddball aspects. She is not keen on press conferences and premieres, especially the first one in Venice, for Atonement, when \u00adeveryone was screaming for Knightley and she feared they might get lynched. Neither is she \u00adespecially \u00adcomfortable being recognised in the street, which happens a lot in Ireland. &quot;I find that hard to deal with, though I don&apos;t have it as bad as the Twilight people or the Harry Potter kids. But it is weird, \u00adespecially after doing a film like this one. If I\u00a0\u00adnotice that a guy is looking at me \u2013 a man \u2013 I\u00a0think, &apos;Is this a really weird guy staring at me, or\u00a0does he just recognise me from a film?&apos; &quot; She is home-schooled. &quot;The reason was teachers giving me a hard time. Teachers and students.&quot; She pulls a face. &quot;Some of the students were, you know, mean. But I only stayed a while. It wasn&apos;t really working out. You know, the school is a good school and the people who go there are good people. But when your schoolmates \u00adrecognise you before they&apos;ve met you, and the teachers do, too, it can make things very awkward and \u00addifficult.&quot; She shrugs it off. &quot;It&apos;s a shame.&quot; I suspect she&apos;ll be OK, if only because she is too likable not to find a world that suits her. In any case, she is not prepared to give up on formal \u00adeducation yet. Her mum left school at 15 (&quot;Trouble with the nuns&quot;) and her dad didn&apos;t last much longer. Their daughter, by contrast, has\u00a0plans to study film at NYU. &quot;\u00adCollege is different from school. Isn&apos;t it?&quot; I assure her that it is, or at least it was for me. &quot;That&apos;s right. People are there because they want to be, and you can choose what you want to study. So it&apos;s very different.&quot; In the meantime, there are busy months ahead. Ronan recently \u00adcompleted work on The Way Back, a\u00a0war drama by Peter Weir, and is due to shoot a new movie in the spring that she would love to tell me about but can&apos;t, even though she is clearly itching to, because it isn&apos;t finalised. On top of that, there&apos;s the long round of promotion for The Lovely Bones, which will take her to Tokyo and then America; a necessary part of the Oscar campaign. Ideally, of course, she&apos;d like a bit more time at home, to watch TV, read her book (The Diary Of Anne Frank) or hang with friends. Plus, Sassie is getting to be an old dog \u2013 he&apos;s pushing 12 \u2013 and time is precious. Our own time, it transpires, is almost up. I\u00a0\u00adconfess I have a silly question to end on and she groans because she thinks she knows what it is. &quot;Do you have a boyfriend?&quot; she flutes in a coy \u00adfalsetto. &quot;Do you have a boyfriend? Ah God, don&apos;t\u00a0ask me that. It&apos;s so annoying when people ask me that.&quot; No, that wasn&apos;t it. Never ask a 15-year-old whether they have a boyfriend or girlfriend; it&apos;s mortifying for all concerned. Instead, my dumb question is about the pronunciation of her name, Saoirse, and all the garbled variations she must have heard. Oh right, she says, a little deflated. Well, she has been called Cerise and Sor-cha, and Seraki, too. &quot;You actually say it \u00ad&apos;Sairsha&apos;,&quot; she adds helpfully. &quot;But you can also say it \u00adSersha, or Seersha \u2013 both are OK.&quot; She rolls her eyes heaven\u00adward. &quot;But, yeah, it happens all the time. They even spelled it\u00a0wrong on the Golden Globes poster for \u00adAtonement. On the Golden Globes poster they got\u00a0it wrong! \u00adSarise\u00a0Ronan, they called me.&quot; Next time, I think, they&apos;ll get it right. \u2022 The Lovely Bones is released on 19 February. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 January 2010 following a legal complaint."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo&apos;s enviable record on public safety appears to arise out of a peculiar synergy between historic traits in Japanese civilisation and a weird tolerance for informal policing by organised crime syndicates."], "tags": ["Society", "Books", "Culture", "World news", "Dubai", "Business", "Financial crisis"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-24T00:05:25Z", "title": "The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande and What Works by Hamish McRae | Book review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/24/checklist-manifesto-atul-gawande-mcrae", "article": "Skyscrapers do not generally keel over. Perhaps that isn&apos;t surprising. If we hadn&apos;t found a way to make tall buildings stay up by now, we probably would have stopped trying. But, given how complex the process of erecting mountains of glass and steel must be, it is astonishing they don&apos;t go wrong more often. Kingdoms are proverbially lost for want of a nail. How many nails go astray on the average building site? Not as many as you&apos;d think, says Atul Gawande in The Checklist Manifesto. And the reason, he says, is box-ticking. Gawande is a surgeon. His interest in skyscraper sturdiness is Hippocratic. He wants to know how other trades involving life-and-death judgments avoid fatal error. As well as high-rise building sites, he has a good rummage around aeroplane cockpits. Flying is complex \u2013 so many things to go wrong in the hands of human beings, with all their well-\u00addocumented fallibility. It&apos;s a wonder planes even get in the air. But the system works, says Gawande, because of checklists. This is not a paean to bureaucracy. Gawande recognises that checklists are a tough sell. As an American, he isn&apos;t familiar with Britain&apos;s particular vilification of health and safety regulations, but the concept is universal. We live in an age where form-filling, clipboard-wielding rule enforcement is assumed to be the enemy of effectiveness. But that is the product of box-ticking gone bad, apparently. Gawande&apos;s thesis is that the right kind of checklist liberates rather than stifles professional intuition. A \u00adconcise precis of what might go wrong, and what to do if it does, galvanises groups of professionals into tighter teams. Plus, rehearsing the basics out loud is a kind of inoculation against the complacency of the expert. The book describes Gawande&apos;s search for an ideal list that will achieve those things in any operating theatre, anywhere in the world. He devises one and tries it in his own practice. Lives are saved. It is mostly in the description of medical procedures that the prose in The Checklist Manifesto gets airborne. Real-life surgical drama is Gawande&apos;s first passion and the subject of his two previous, highly successful books. He has an instinctive sense of how much jargon the lay reader will tolerate \u2013 how to maintain the balance between accessibility and precision. He manages to be vivid without being gruesome. But that narrative gift doesn&apos;t transfer automatically to accounts of in-flight safety checks and structural engineering near-misses. Gawande&apos;s style is always clear, with the crispy lilt that is a trademark of the New Yorker, where he is also a staff writer. But there&apos;s no escaping the fact that this is a book about, well, checklists. Hemingway would struggle to make it gripping. Gawande does well to pull off engaging. His best point is made almost as an afterthought. The penultimate chapter examines the story of the US Airways plane that hit a flock of geese over New York and successfully landed on the Hudson river with no serious casualties last year. Ecstatic media craved an account of exceptional individual heroism. But while the crew obviously displayed enormous courage, it was the checklist safety systems that really deserved the glory. So many professions, Gawande notes, have romantic fantasies about themselves: the doctor/lawyer/cop/teacher as intuitive, maverick loner. These images are reinforced by a pop-cultural fetish for the guy who gets results but doesn&apos;t always do things by the book. Yet most of the time, the true test of character in a crisis is how well you stick to procedure, not how readily you abandon it. The surprising banality of success is a prominent theme also in What Works by Hamish McRae, chief economics commentator of the Independent. McRae has scoured the globe for examples of systems and projects that do things well and analysed them free of any discernible theoretical or ideological prejudice. Each case study is lean and precisely crafted, as you would expect from a veteran journalist. McRae covers subjects from Australian sports training to Zurich drug rehabilitation like a commando: get in, get the story, get out, debrief, on to the next mission. This simple storytelling disguises years of painstaking investigation. Each dram of good business or policy practice is clearly the result of a long distillation process. Unfortunately, the passage of time shows in some of the case-study choices. Between McRae&apos;s decision to embark on the project and its completion, the global economy went bust. That needn&apos;t necessarily change the criteria for what counts as a successful enterprise. But it does raise the bar for an author trying to convince readers that, for example, the financial services industry in the City of London is a shining example of &quot;what works&quot;. Likewise, the Dubai property investment market or the Irish &quot;Celtic tiger&quot; economy \u2013 now caged in austerity. In each of these cases, McRae has the same defence. Their weaknesses were exposed by the credit crunch, but a considered analysis must take into account the distance travelled over many years and the long-term prognosis. With that perspective in mind, McRae still confidently calls the City, Dubai and Ireland&apos;s economy success stories. And perhaps he is right. But to make a virtue of that counterintuitive position, he needs to argue it a little more emphatically. Instead, he weaves it in as an apologetic caveat. Yes, it looks bad right now, but\u2026 A second problem is that McRae&apos;s examples of success are so diverse that he struggles to extrapolate universal lessons without lapsing into platitude (&quot;Progress never follows a straight line&quot;; &quot;Pessimism paralyses&quot;). And many of the stories he tells are so embedded in unique cultural circumstances that there really is nothing to extrapolate. Tokyo&apos;s enviable record on public safety appears to arise out of a peculiar synergy between historic traits in Japanese civilisation and a weird tolerance for informal policing by organised crime syndicates. Likewise, the lesson for any city authority wanting to copy Copenhagen&apos;s smooth traffic management system might be summarised as simply &quot;be Copenhagen&quot;; not much use if you are, say, London. Still, McRae deserves credit for writing a can-do anthology in defeatist times. So does Atul Gawande. If there is a hybrid lesson from the two books, it is probably that the secret to success in any endeavour lies in luck, combined with systematic avoidance of stupidity."}, {"sentences": ["The deal has allowed it to beef up its offices in London and New York, add a second columnist in Hong Kong and Washington and another in Moscow and to seek columnists for Dubai, Mumbai, Tokyo and Frankfurt."], "tags": ["Thomson Reuters", "Financial Times", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Reuters"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-25T00:05:09Z", "title": "Chris Tryhorn interviews Hugo Dixon, the founder of Breakingviews", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/25/hugo-dixon-breakingviews-interview", "article": "How can you make the internet pay?

So what tips does Dixon have for those who would follow suit? &quot;You have got to have distinctive, value-added content and in an era of budget cuts that gets harder and harder,&quot; he says. &quot;The temptation if you&apos;ve got to cut costs by 5% is just to salami slice and everyone works a bit harder and quality just deteriorates a little bit more. What you end up with when you finally decide to put it behind a paywall is something that&apos;s not good enough to persuade people to pay for. &quot;Media groups have got to focus much more clearly on what is their unique selling point \u2013 keep the investment there, possibly increase the investment there, and everything else, which may be necessary as part of a package, because a newspaper is a package, they don&apos;t have to produce themselves, they can buy that in.&quot; He says Murdoch should never be underestimated but he will have a tough time succeeding with a paywall in the UK given the free alternatives. Too young A trim figure with an air of donnish abstraction about him, and a cerebral manner, Dixon looks slightly out of place in the corridors of Reuters&apos; glitzy Canary Wharf HQ. He and his US editor, Rob Cox, are the only survivors of Breakingviews&apos; early days as a dotcom startup. With the bet finally paying off, Dixon can afford to dispense advice. But he is not, on the surface, given to self-doubt and former colleagues say he was not always emollient with those without such a high IQ. One of his reasons for leaving the FT in 1999 was that he did not expect to succeed Richard Lambert as editor. But not because he wasn&apos;t up to the job: &quot;It wasn&apos;t going to happen because I was too young. Then I thought there would probably be another 10-year gap. As it was, there wasn&apos;t. But it was clear to me when I left the FT there was going to be changeover in a couple of years so that would mean there would be another 12 years or so before the slot came up.&quot; Dixon had reason to expect that his effortlessly smooth progress would continue, having glided from King&apos;s Scholar at Eton and a first in PPE at Balliol College, Oxford, to the FT, by way of a first job at the Economist. Aged 24, he was seconded to work for the then SDP leader Bob Maclennan to write the manifesto for the party&apos;s merger with the Liberals. He remains proud of it: &quot;You could have said it was New Labour quite a few years before New Labour existed.&quot; However, when Liberal MPs read about its proposals in this paper, they barricaded their leader David Steel into his Commons office and told him he would be turfed out if he backed the controversial document \u2013 copies of which had already been left for lobby hacks waiting at a press conference. Dixon has friends in high places, including Boris Johnson, whom he first met at prep school, where the future mayor of London was mistaken for a girl thanks to his untrimmed blond locks. Dixon recruited Boris&apos;s brother Jo to the FT. Jo has Dixon&apos;s old job heading up the Lex column and was last month selected as a Conservative parliamentary candidate. Then there&apos;s Roland Rudd, supremo of the City PR firm Finsbury and an early investor in Breakingviews, who picked up \u00a31.5m from the sale to Reuters. One former ally less pleased by the deal was Jonathan Ford, Breakingviews&apos; co-founder and another ex-FT staffer. Having left the site in 2007 after the two men fell out, he was signed up the following year to run Reuters&apos; fledgling commentary operation, a rival to Breakingviews. Reuters&apos; decision to buy Dixon&apos;s business effectively put Ford out of a job, and unsurprisingly he left. But Ford \u2013 who declined to comment for this piece \u2013 last week returned to the FT as chief leader writer. Dixon would not comment on his relationship with his former colleague, saying only: &quot;Jonathan is a very smart journalist and he played a very important role in creating Breakingviews.&quot; The idea behind Breakingviews is simple: to provide around 20 bite-sized pieces of insight a day, each no more than 350 words long and delivered as quickly as possible to an audience of specialists hyperactively checking their BlackBerries. &quot;Most of our readers have got lots of money, it&apos;s time that they don&apos;t have,&quot; says Dixon, who has patented a one-page method explaining how to write these pithy doses of wisdom \u2013 &quot;like the secret formula of Coca-Cola&quot;. Clearly the appeal rests on more than a magic formula. The 30-strong team of columnists, include experienced hands such as Neil Collins, the former City editor of the Daily Telegraph and Peter Thal Larsen, formerly the banking editor of the FT. &quot;Recently I think we have been quite influential in the global debate on banking regulation,&quot; Dixon says. &quot;We may from time to time influence a share price on the day, one way or another, but it&apos;s more these bigger strategic things where we have an impact.&quot; He thinks Breakingviews has had a good war over the past two and a half years covering the dramas of the credit crunch and the ensuing financial crisis: &quot;I think media was in general a bit weak. The media tends to magnify the booms and magnify the busts, generally speaking. If you allow me to blow my own trumpet, one of the reasons why we actually fared quite well during the crisis is because during the bubble, we had been sounding the alarm. We were pretty vocal but we didn&apos;t have a gigantic megaphone through which to blast our opinions.&quot; Early deal  The Reuters deal has given them a bigger megaphone, expanding their readership from around 15,000 users who shared about 600 corporate subscriptions to the far larger customer base of Reuters&apos; premium data products such as 3000 Xtra. The deal has allowed it to beef up its offices in London and New York, add a second columnist in Hong Kong and Washington and another in Moscow and to seek columnists for Dubai, Mumbai, Tokyo and Frankfurt. It also has people in Paris and Madrid and syndicates columns to 15 newspapers including the Telegraph, the New York Times and Le Monde. The idea for Breakingviews came to Dixon during a trip to Seattle to interview Bill Gates, taking his lead from Microsoft&apos;s online magazine Slate. A deal with the Wall Street Journal Europe helped to get the brand out there, with later tie-ups with the Sunday Business, the Evening Standard and the Sunday Telegraph. The business expanded into the US in 2004, its development drawing on a significant pool of investors, including City names such as Roy Gardner, the former chief executive of Centrica, and the former Standard Chartered chairman Lord Davies, now a trade minister. Dixon says it simply didn&apos;t occur to him during the planning stages to suggest doing anything under the aegis of the FT. Instead he quit the paper after 13 years, dismaying Lambert \u2013 &quot;I was one of the very few people at the FT who&apos;s ever been given the black bin bag treatment&quot; \u2013 though he wasn&apos;t actually marched out. It also scuppered plans to get the FT to endorse his book, later published as the Penguin, rather than Lex, Guide to Finance. He credits his old paper for helping Breakingviews in its early days by offering less competition than it might have. He says he was fond of Lambert&apos;s successor, Andrew Gowers, but says he abandoned the FT&apos;s traditional focus on financial professionals and let the paper get &quot;too tough&quot; on business in the aftermath of the dotcom crash: &quot;The fact that the FT took its eye off its core constituency, in the early part of the decade, was a huge boon for us. We were just focusing on that. We had a single-minded focus. &quot;In many ways, they&apos;ve clearly tried to copy us,&quot; says Dixon. &quot;Almost everything we do, they try to copy us. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&quot; For Dixon, the Breakingviews experience should be a thing of pleasure \u2013 financial insight can be turned into a form of amusement: &quot;Another of our value propositions is &apos;enjoyable&apos; \u2026 We said that just because it&apos;s a work product, it doesn&apos;t mean it has to be hard work to read us.&quot; CV Age 46 Education Eton College; Balliol College, Oxford Career 1985 intern, The Economist, the Economist Financial Report 1986 junior banking correspondent, Financial Times 1987 chief policy adviser to SDP leader Robert Maclennan 1988 telecoms and electronics correspondent, Financial Times 1993 leader writer 1994 Lex writer, then editor 1999 co-founder, Breakingviews 2009 global editor, Reuters Breakingviews"}, {"sentences": ["It is recalling cars to fix sticking accelerator pedals, a move that has sent its shares tumbling in Tokyo and added to woes sparked by the global economic downturn."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Job losses", "Global recession", "Business", "UK news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-28T11:35:54Z", "title": "Toyota to axe 750 British jobs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/28/toyota-job-losses-safety-recall", "article": "Toyota aims to axe up to 750 jobs at its main UK factory, workers have been told. The news comes as the carmaker scrambles to recall millions of vehicles around the world. Employees at the company&apos;s Burnaston plant near Derby have been told it will not have enough work for about 750 workers from August. At the same time the world&apos;s biggest carmaker is fighting to save its reputation as the home of some of the world&apos;s safest vehicles. It is recalling cars to fix sticking accelerator pedals, a move that has sent its shares tumbling in Tokyo and added to woes sparked by the global economic downturn. In a statement today, Toyota Manufacturing UK said it wanted to improve production efficiency and that it had already told workers last year that it would streamline operations at Burnaston, which currently employs more than 3,500 people, from August. &quot;During a meeting with our employee representatives on Monday we confirmed that we will have a headcount surplus of around 750 members from August onwards. The key point of Monday&apos;s discussion was how to manage this situation in order to ensure we have a sustainable business for the long term,&quot; it said. Local newspaper the Derby Telegraph quoted one worker as saying morale was &quot;lower than low&quot; at the plant. For Toyota&apos;s global business, any hopes of an emergence from the deep recession that hit car production have now been dashed by the growing safety headaches. The Japanese company has been forced to suspend sales of some of its models and recall cars in the US, action that may now be followed with similar action in Europe. Japanese media reports put the total number of vehicles that could be recalled for accelerator problems at 8m \u2013 almost the same number as it sold globally last year. According to guidance for customers on the carmaker&apos;s website, &quot;in rare instances, there is a possibility that certain accelerator pedal mechanisms may mechanically stick in a partially depressed position or return slowly to the idle position&quot;. But it says it is confident that all models that contain the potentially sticking pedals have been identified. In a further dent to its business, Toyota last night offered to modify more than 1 million cars where there was a danger of floor mats trapping the accelerator pedal, a problem that had already prompted recalls last autumn."}, {"sentences": ["His own experience and his subsequent interviews led him to conclude that the bombing had been ordered more to enhance the careers of senior officers than for any military imperative, and he later wrote about the ethics of bombing in the context of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Tokyo and Dresden, as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0Iraq."], "tags": ["History", "Education", "Human rights", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-29T15:32:51Z", "title": "Howard Zinn obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/29/howard-zinn-obituary", "article": "Howard Zinn, who has died of a heart attack aged 87, was a much-loved and much-vituperated icon of\u00a0the American left. He\u00a0was an activist and historian, and later a dramatist, but always a\u00a0courageous and articulate campaigner for his vision of a just and peaceful America. As a white teacher at the black Spelman College for women in Atlanta, Georgia, he was a mentor to and later the historian of the Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee (SNCC), the radical student wing of the civil rights movement. In 1963 he was dismissed from Spelman for advocating a less &quot;ladylike&quot; concept of women&apos;s education, and moved to Boston University, where he taught political science for 24 years. In 1980 he published A People&apos;s History of the United States, an account that stressed injustices and oppression and resurrected forgotten voices, which has sold more than 1m copies. Zinn always said he was not a\u00a0pacifist, because he thought it was too absolute a position. But he was a passionate and highly articulate critic of the wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. As\u00a0a\u00a0bombardier during the second world war, he was involved in\u00a0the first\u00a0use\u00a0of napalm as a weapon, and\u00a0could never quite forgive himself for what he regarded as a crime against German soldiers, as well as French civilians. Zinn&apos;s parents were Jewish immigrants to the US, with very limited education, who settled in Brooklyn, New York, and worked in factories. His father came from Austria-Hungary and his mother from Irkutsk in Siberia. There were no books in the house when\u00a0he was growing up, until his father bought him a 25-cent edition of\u00a0the works of Dickens, an offer from an\u00a0evening newspaper. Zinn worked in a shipyard after high school and was involved in demonstrations against fascism in the 1930s. He joined the US Army Air Force and during the war, flew from bases in England over France, Germany and his father&apos;s native Hungary. The napalm incident, involving petroleum jelly that causes terrible burns, was over Royan in western France. After the war, he went back to interview victims of the bombing, and later wrote about it in two books. His own experience and his subsequent interviews led him to conclude that the bombing had been ordered more to enhance the careers of senior officers than for any military imperative, and he later wrote about the ethics of bombing in the context of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Tokyo and Dresden, as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0Iraq. Under the GI Bill, Zinn studied history at New York University. He then went to Columbia, where he earned an MA in 1952 with a thesis about a famous coalminers&apos; strike in Colorado, then obtained his PhD with a dissertation about the career in Congress of Fiorello LaGuardia, the reforming mayor of\u00a0New York. He studied at Columbia under Henry Steele Commager and Richard Hofstadter. From Hofstadter he learned, as he said later, that American liberals were not as liberal as the word implied, and that the two threads that ran through all American history were nationalism and capitalism. Zinn went to Spelman in 1956. Among his students were Maria Wright Edelman, the campaigner for children&apos;s rights, and the future novelist Alice Walker, author of The Color Purple. He soon became involved with the SNCC and Martin Luther King&apos;s civil rights campaign. In 1964 he published SNCC: The New Abolitionists. The book ends with a statement of his creed. What made SNCC a threat to the establishment, he wrote, was &quot;its rejection of authority; its fearlessness in the face of overwhelming power; its indifference to respectability&quot;. Its radicalism, he went on, &quot;is not an ideology but a mood. Moods are harder to define. They are also harder to imprison.&quot; Zinn became involved in a conflict with the authorities at Spelman over his insistence that its students should not be trained to be ladies, but should be actively involved in politics. Although he theoretically had tenure, he was fired. At Boston University his course on civil liberties was immensely popular. He was soon involved in the campaign against the Vietnam war. When Daniel Ellsberg, a previously gung-ho John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson administration official, came out against the war, he gave one copy of the Pentagon Papers (officially titled United States-Vietnam Relations, 1945\u20131967: A Study Prepared by the Department of Defense, the government&apos;s secret history of the war) to Zinn and his wife, Roslyn. Zinn and Noam Chomsky edited what became known as the Mike Gravel edition, published in Boston in 1971-72 by the Beacon Press. While the war was still raging, Zinn travelled to Hanoi with the Rev Daniel Berrigan \u2013 one of the two Berrigan brothers, priests jailed for their anti-war activities \u2013 and successfully negotiated the release of three captured US airmen. For decades, he poured out articles attacking war and government secrecy. His energy and generosity extended to\u00a0writing introductions to more than 30\u00a0books by other writers. When President Ronald Reagan bombed Tripoli in 1986, Zinn wrote: &quot;There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people for a purpose which is unattainable.&quot; He denounced the invasion of Iraq and also criticised President Barack Obama&apos;s intensification of the war in Afghanistan. He was sharply attacked in Israel and by many of his fellow American Jews for saying that war was morally the equivalent of terrorism. Not surprisingly, he drew fierce criticism from conservatives. And although his People&apos;s History was hugely popular among students, as well as the general public, even liberal historians were critical of its relentless castigation of\u00a0the\u00a0darker side of American history. In\u00a0the New York Times, for example, Eric Foner called it &quot;a deeply pessimistic vision of the American experience&quot; and pointed out that &quot;blacks, Indians, women and labourers appear either as rebels or as victims. Less dramatic but more typical lives \u2013 people struggling to survive with dignity in difficult circumstances \u2013 receive little attention.&quot; Michael Kammen, himself a historian of\u00a0American radicalism, said the book was not a success. What few could deny was the tenacity of Zinn&apos;s commitment to his core belief \u2013 that people should stand up for their rights and their vision of\u00a0the\u00a0good society. &quot;Where progress has been made,&quot; he wrote near the end of his life, &quot;wherever any kind of injustice has been overturned, it&apos;s been because people acted as citizens, and not as politicians. They didn&apos;t just moan. They\u00a0worked, they acted, they organised, they rioted if necessary to\u00a0bring their situation to the attention of people in power. And that&apos;s what we have to do today.&quot; Roslyn died in 2008. Zinn is survived by a daughter and a son. George Binette writes: By the time I reached Boston University in September 1978 as an undergraduate, Howard Zinn had already lectured there for 14 years and become a local legend. The mere mention of his name polarised opinion among students and staff alike. At first I found his lectures disorganised, bordering on the chaotic. But\u00a0I soon came to appreciate that through subtly weaving considerable erudition with personal reminiscence, he was challenging the received and often cherished assumptions about US history among young people. In person Zinn frequently projected a Zen-like calm. He seemed to possess exceptional patience, both for naive admirers and stridently reactionary critics, though he never concealed a\u00a0zealous passion against injustice. And in contrast to many left-leaning academics, he combined his classroom stance with practical action. As an officer of the Boston lecturers&apos; union, Zinn was one of the leaders of a spring 1979 strike against the college administration. After the lecturers had suspended their action, low-paid administrative and clerical workers mounted their own strike. Along with four other lecturers, Zinn refused to cross their picket lines, thus risking suspension. But he continued to teach, inviting students to join him on a college lawn. He struggled to be heard over the traffic din on Commonwealth Avenue, but ultimately delivered an inspiring talk that placed the administrative workers&apos; fight\u00a0in the context of the American labour movement&apos;s often bloody history. \u2022 Howard Zinn, historian and activist, born 24 August 1922; died 27 January 2010"}, {"sentences": ["But in Tokyo there were fears that the problems at Toyota and Honda were damaging not just their image of efficiency and reliability but that of Japan itself."], "tags": ["Honda", "Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Road transport", "UK news", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2010-01-29T19:15:34Z", "title": "Honda recalls 650,000 Jazz cars worldwide", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/29/honda-jazz-toyota-recall", "article": "Road safety authorities in Britain were under attack for alleged complacency today after Honda joined Toyota in recalling potentially dangerous cars. The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) criticised government officials after Honda asked owners of 650,000 of its Jazz models worldwide \u2013 including more than 170,000 in Britain \u2013 to take their cars back to dealers over potential electrical faults. The sense of crisis surrounding the car industry intensified when lawmakers in the US announced an investigation into Toyota&apos;s faulty accelerator pedals, amid speculation that 19 deaths may have been caused by equipment failures over the past decade. Toyota has recalled 3.5m vehicles in the US. Honda&apos;s move follows safety scares and the death of a toddler in South Africa in a car fire. However, a spokeswoman for Honda UK stressed it had taken the recall decision without being asked to by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa), which handles such issues for the Department of Transport in this country. Tim Shallcross, head of technical advice at the IAM, said: &quot;[Vosa] should be identifying where there are problems and calling on manufacturers to sort them out. Instead, the action is coming from Honda itself. There have been other occasions \u2026where we only seemed to see action after a long delay or pressure from consumer [television] programmes.&quot; Vosa was unable to comment but said it was fully aware of the situation in the US and had arranged a meeting with Toyota. &quot;In the UK, motoring manufacturers comply with the code of practice on vehicle safety defects. And Honda is no exception in complying with that code, by informing Vosa of the intention to recall 172,000 Honda Jazz vehicles,&quot; it said. &quot;Likewise Toyota are meeting with Vosa officials on Monday, when they will have the precise details of the number of vehicles likely to be affected in the UK. Toyota have kept Vosa informed throughout this matter.&quot; In Washington, the House of Representatives oversight and government reform committee has scheduled a hearing next week entitled Toyota Gas Pedals: Is the Public at Risk? amid growing concern. Toyota is considering whether to recall 1.8m cars in Europe in addition to those recalled in the US. Shares in Toyota fell 2% today, bringing the combined loss of value to 17% over the past week since the problems began to unfold. Honda also saw its shares fall on the New York stock exchange. In an email sent to staff, Toyota said it had now worked out how to fix the problem with the sticking accelerator pedals.

But so widespread is tourist anxiety about eating in Japan (every westerner I\u00a0meet seems to fret about how to hold chopsticks) that you could be forgiven for taking it seriously \u2013 at least until it adds, &quot;Because some menu items are illegal, you\u00a0will only discover them when you ask&quot;, \u00adbefore flashing up images of giant pandas and other \u00adprotected species. Japanese cuisine is \u00adsurrounded by myths and clich\u00e9s, and as a sushi-obsessive, I travelled to \u00adTokyo imagining they ate little else. But having enrolled on a sushi- and \u00adtempura-making course at\u00a0the spectacular Peninsular hotel, that idea was quickly dismissed. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t make sushi at home unless my children pester me about it,&quot; says the teacher, Mr Kojima, a sushi chef of 18 years&apos; \u00adexperience. &quot;And if I do, we just eat hand-rolls,&quot; he says, expertly massaging the perfect nigiri (rice\u00a0topped with fish) into shape as he speaks. My turn follows, and it&apos;s all a\u00a0bit Generation Game, with my pathetic nigiri wobbling unsurely on the plate next to his. The Japanese diet is undergoing enormous shifts in taste. Seafood and rice consumption are decreasing, while bread- and meat-eating are on\u00a0the up, meaning that the overall diet is less healthy. But as a visitor you can still find fantastic food all over the country, be it in the bento boxes at the train station or the high-end restaurants of\u00a0Kyoto and Osaka, which have recently become the subject of a Michelin guide for the first time. In Tokyo, it is a rite of passage for tourists to get up early and experience the theatre of tuna-\u00adselling at the busy Tsukiji fish market. Amid the glassy-eyed mullet and industrial-sized mussels, you can witness big fish and big money changing hands. (Kojima told me that top restaurants charge as much as \u00a55,000, or \u00a334, for one piece of top-quality tuna, and only this month a tuna was sold at auction for \u00a516.28m, or \u00a3109,000.) Osaka has always been the commercial capital of Japan, but has earned a reputation as a mecca for gourmet food. It has been called &quot;kuidaore&quot; \u2013 liter\u00adally, &quot;bring ruin upon oneself by \u00adextravagance in food&quot;. From the takoyaki (octopus balls) you buy in the street to the Japanese take on French haute cuisine at Les Saisons, this is a must-stop for anyone wanting a richer understanding of \u00adJapanese food. &quot;Osaka people will try \u00adeverything,&quot; says Yumiko, our guide. &quot;Tokyo \u00adpeople are more cautious.&quot; Osaka was the first place, for instance, to get permission to cook blowfish \u2013 that much maligned ingredient of the Japanese diet that has a fearsome reputation for occasionally causing respiratory arrest and death to the eater. &quot;Everyone&apos;s interested in blowfish,&quot; sighs Yumiko when I\u00a0ask about it. &quot;I ate blowfish four days ago,&quot; she says matter-of-factly. &quot;Poison didn&apos;t kill me.&quot; Not a natural risk-taker, I opt instead to lunch at\u00a0Udonsuki, a 200-year-old restaurant with a \u00adtraditional interior of tatami mats and low tables, where I soon find myself ceremoniously plunging a live shrimp into a boiling vat of noodle soup. Elsewhere, we snacked on box sushi (a distinctive &quot;pressed&quot;, denser version that you find in Osaka) and sampled every strain of noodle Japan can offer, from soba to udon to ramen. In one restaurant, we were offered adult-sized paper bibs, which I\u00a0took as carte blanche to eat as messily as I liked. We travel from Osaka to Kyoto, Japan&apos;s historic city, on the bullet train, which is as efficient and futuristic as advertised (the average delay last year was six seconds). Because Kyoto is near the Sea of Japan, it has always had access to ingre\u00addients and a reputation for great food. It is here that we experienced a traditional multi-course meal at Kanamean Nishitomiya, a two Michelin-starred ryokan (traditional Japanese inn), with seasonal dishes presented more like works of art than something to eat. The carved and hollowed orange halves, showcasing slices of\u00a0duck, Japanese radish and fruits, were so \u00adbeautiful that it felt \u00adalmost rude to eat them. Yet\u00a0somehow I managed. At another ryokan, dish after dish is delivered by an \u00adadmirably patient mama-san (hostess), who tries very hard to explain what it is we are being fed: a stuffed lobster, meltingly good sashimi, a\u00a0sort of fish stew with some unidentified potato substance \u2013 the list goes on. We try everything, partly on the grounds of curiosity and partly not to cause offence. Two hours, 10 dishes and one very exhausted mama-san later, we are delivered two of the biggest oysters you could wish to set your eyes on. My heart sinks.

Coconut Moon was shut, having conceded defeat to Typhoon Lupit. The locals had been praying for rain and they&apos;d got it. Lupit, the first typhoon of the year, arrived in Okinawa about two hours after we did. But while typhoons have scant regard for tourists, our driver had it sussed. &quot;You want awamori [a rice-based spirit]? Dancing?&quot; After three days of lashing rain and cancelled flights and ferries our bedraggled crowd was up for anything. And that&apos;s how we ended up in Nakayuki (Little Break), an inconspicuous bar in the village of Onna, taking turns on a traditional three-stringed guitar, eating dragon fruit, necking guava juice laced with awamori and &quot;pushing the happiness&quot; until 3am. Sharing the love with locals has never been so much fun. Welcome to Japan&apos;s sub-tropical alter ego. An island archipelago flung 1,000km across the Pacific, Okinawa is Japan, but not as we know it. Even the Japanese regard Okinawa as exotically foreign, and until its annexation to mainland Japan as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879, it was exactly that. The Ryukyu Kingdom was for centuries a self-governing tributary state to China, before being invaded by the mainland Satsuma clan at the start of the 17th century. The capital Naha, midway down the island chain on the main island, is closer to the tip of the Philippines than it is to Tokyo and on a clear day, from the southernmost island, Yonaguni, it&apos;s possible to see Taiwan, 111km away. If you&apos;re looking for quintessential Japan you won&apos;t find it here, but Okinawa&apos;s bizarre mish-mash of influences makes an interesting ride. Among its biggest draws are the people. A happy, welcoming if endearingly bonkers lot, the dark-skinned Okinawans are an origin-defying blend of South Pacific-meets-North Asia, with a dash of the Inuit for good measure. The rare fusion of influences also permeates music, culture and dialect. Traditional music in Okinawa has overtones of gamelan from Indonesia. Its stir-fries are comfortingly familiar. Chinese &quot;lucky&quot; cats litter the streets, and Japan&apos;s clean architectural lines are hijacked by curlicued eves that infiltrate the roofs of temples, castles and traditional houses. Where mainland Japan is conservative, Okinawa is carefree and progressive. Tokyo&apos;s &quot;salaryman&quot; suits are replaced by kariyushi wear (the local version of the Hawaiian shirt). These days Okinawa is regarded as a quirky, relatively hip outpost of Japan. Cult-obsessed Japanese teenagers follow its underground music scene, and the annual Peaceful Love Festival draws fans from across Asia. Inspired in part by the popular Japanese soap Churasan, set on one of its sun-drenched islands, six million other Japanese tourists come to fling a Hello Kitty beach towel across one of its hundreds of snow-white beaches, or to snorkel, dive and kayak around coral-fringed islands. A trip to one of these islands (around 50 out of 160 are populated) is rewarded with a rare glimpse into a sunny rural idyll. The shallow channel separating Iriomote and Yufujima is crossed by buffalo cart. Ishigaki and its offshoot islands are home to a rare breed of beef cattle, ranked up there with Kobe. On Kuroshima there are more cows than people. Miyakojima claims to have the best sea salt in the world \u2013 with 18 minerals, it&apos;s listed in the Guinness Book of Records. Whales migrate to the stunning Kerama Islands, 30km west of Naha, while croissant-shaped Minna, looped by snow-white sand, is a two-mile kayak paddle or a 15-minute ferry ride away. Other islands, like far-flung Miyako, explored by 30,000 divers a year, are best reached via a short flight. Okinawan cuisine is among the healthiest in the world, but a shaving of familiar pink stuff may find its way into your stir-fry. US forces, who fought in the Battle of Okinawa of 1945, linger on in controversially spacious bases scattered across the islands and in their sole culinary legacy \u2013 Spam. For all that Okinawa has borrowed from its neighbours, it has given the world a whole lot more \u2013 not least a model for longevity, and one of its most popular forms of martial art. This, after all, is the birthplace of Mr Miyagi, of Karate Kid fame. In Naha I paid a visit to Bunbukan-dojo, one of the numerous dojo (karate gyms) open to tourists. In the front yard I found the pint-sized, grey-bearded sensei Nakamoto Masahiro \u2013 a 10th-level black belt master, author of numerous books and one of the most revered karate sensei in the\u00a0world \u2013 up a ladder, plucking bananas. There is only so much fruit one can consume in the name of politeness \u2013 even in Japan. Five bananas down the line, I was saved by the rain. Mr Nakamoto&apos;s protege ushered me into the drill hall, where he proceeded to demonstrate &quot;the alphabet of karate moves&quot;. My favourite, the knife chop, would go down a treat on the mean streets of Tooting. Now and then Mr Nakamoto would tilt an elbow, or tweak a finger end, but the best was yet to come with the 71-year-old&apos;s demonstration of kobudo, a quick-fire, terrifyingly impressive martial art that uses weapons. In a small, one-room museum above the dojo that he has dedicated to the preservation of kobudo, Mr Nakamoto expounded on the ancient art. During the Ryukyu era, weapons were banned which gave birth to karate, which means &quot;empty hands&quot;. The ancient combative art of kobudo is regarded as the precursor to karate and uses everyday implements such as hoes, oars and the tonfa \u2013 the wooden millstone handle that is the ancestor of the western truncheon. Next time you come under attack on a farm, try the horseshoe technique \u2013 doof, right between the eyes. On second thoughts, maybe not. Martial arts, climate, diet, and spirituality are all thought to contribute towards Okinawa&apos;s freakish longevity statistics. Locals enjoy the highest life expectancy on the planet, and is home to a remarkable number of centenarians. It pays to be adventurous with the area&apos;s largely plant-based diet. Within 48 hours I had eaten pig&apos;s face (it&apos;s everything but the squeak here), had a raw fish blow-torched at my table, wolfed down kilos of silky-smooth tofu (I hate tofu), licked 15 types of salt and grown addicted to a certain salty ice-cream. An ubiquitous purple tuber called imo goes down a treat in doughnut form, but the best place to sample Okinawa&apos;s bitter, bioflavonoid-rich vegetables is at a small restaurant called Emi no Mise in the village of Ogimi, known for obvious reasons as the &quot;centenarian village&quot;. I didn&apos;t question the 15-dish seasonal longevity menu. I just ate it: pond herring stewed with salt, seaweed tofu (reddish seaweed, carrot and skin of pig&apos;s face), handama (a slimy, iron-packed green-and-purple vegetable) and chilled shikuwasa noodle, made with stringy, crunchy seaweed, aloe vera and the juice of shikuwasa (a sort of citrus fruit). Washed down with locally grown hibiscus tea, it was not bad for a tenner. The morning after the awamori love sharing, Lupit was gone, leaving blue sky, a replenished water table and some foul hangovers in its wake. I didn&apos;t snorkel, dive, hike or sea kayak around any of Okinawa&apos;s other 159 islands, but I did get an eyeful of them on the flight back to Tokyo. The chances of coming home disappointed are, I reckon, pretty slim."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;The United States fully intends to meet every one of our obligations [regarding Taiwan&apos;s self-defence] and we will continue to do so into the future,&quot; he said at a meeting in Tokyo."], "tags": ["China", "Taiwan", "Arms trade", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-01T12:08:46Z", "title": "Chinese media accuses US of 'cold war thinking' over Taiwan arms deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/01/chinese-us-taiwan-arms-deal", "article": "Chinese state media have lambasted the US arms deal with Taiwan, turning up the pressure over the $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) agreement. Beijing&apos;s reaction to the package \u2013 which includes Black Hawk helicopters, Patriot missiles and mine-hunter ships \u2013 was described by one official newspaper as its toughest in three decades of sales. It comes as the bilateral relationship faces other strains over issues including climate change, Tibet, censorship and trade. A commentary in the official Communist party newspaper the People&apos;s Daily accused Washington of &quot;rude and unreasonable cold war thinking&quot;. &quot;The United States is still drawing lines based on ideology and coming up with a million ways to stymie China&apos;s development and progress,&quot; the paper&apos;s overseas edition said. China Daily, an official English language paper, said in an editorial: &quot;China&apos;s response, no matter how vehement, is justified. No country worthy of respect can sit idle while its national security is endangered and core interests damaged.&quot; Taiwan has been under self-rule since the end of the civil war in 1949. But Beijing still asserts sovereignty over the island and has said it is willing to use military force if Taipei seeks formal independence. Although the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, Congress passed a law in the same year obliging the US government to help Taiwan defend itself. The latest deal does not include some weapons that Taipei has long sought, such as F16 fighter jets. Cross-straits relations have improved markedly since Ma Ying-jeou became president of Taipei in 2008 and so far Beijing has focused its ire on the US. China has threatened to impose &quot;corresponding sanctions&quot; on American companies involved in the deal despite its long-standing reluctance to use such measures in international disputes. Such a move might affect companies like Boeing, but US firms do not sell arms to Beijing. Washington could take a case to the World Trade Organisation if China sought to restrict imports of other goods. The greatest concern for the US may be the Chinese foreign ministry&apos;s warning that co-operation on international and regional issues &quot;will inevitably be affected&quot;. Many analysts have taken that as a warning that China will push back against new sanctions on its ally Iran, which it was already reluctant to support, and will be less co-operative over tackling North Korea. The ministry has already cancelled talks between senior Chinese and US officials on strategic security, arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. &quot;The greatest casualty of a downturn in US-China relations would be international peace and security, especially if it negatively affects co-operation within the United Nations. This is in the interests of neither the US nor China,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the north-east Asia project director of the International Crisis Group. China&apos;s reaction appears to be an attempt to head off what it sees as a tougher approach by the US, as well as a reflection of its increased self-confidence. The deal comes shortly after Hillary Clinton criticised China&apos;s internet censorship \u2013 a noticeable change in tone from earlier comments on human rights \u2013 and just before Barack Obama&apos;s expected meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. &quot;So shortly after [Obama] came to China and made his joint statement [with president Hu Jintao], he turned his face,&quot; said Shi Yinhong, director of the centre for American studies at Renmin University. &quot;It is so easy to sacrifice the relationship with China because of concerns about the domestic situation. That is not statesmanlike.&quot; He said that so far Beijing had mixed hard words with limited actions. But he added: &quot;China has of course much more self-confidence. I think some Europeans and Americans have not adapted to change and see China as small and weak ... It&apos;s a huge, independent country and doesn&apos;t want to be dictated to by anyone.&quot; Professor Jin Canrong, professor of international studies at Renmin University, said: &quot;After the financial crisis China&apos;s international standing has been promoted ... It holds more cards to deal with the US.&quot; Jin acknowledged that some in the US felt &quot;anger or disappointment&quot; towards China. But he added: &quot;People in China think it has tried to co-operate with the US but has its own interests and principles and opinions on issues. If the US decides to build unrealistic expectations that&apos;s not the fault of China.&quot; Wallace Gregson, the US assistant secretary of defence for the Asia-Pacific region, said Washington aimed to maintain good relations with China but would not abandon Taiwan. &quot;The United States fully intends to meet every one of our obligations [regarding Taiwan&apos;s self-defence] and we will continue to do so into the future,&quot; he said at a meeting in Tokyo.

Feng Zhenghu, an academic who has been highly critical of China&apos;s human rights record, said he had decided to abandon his protest in the immigration area of Narita airport after a weekend visit from Chinese embassy officials. Feng, 55, said he had been denied re-entry to China eight times since June while attempting to return home from a trip to see his sister in Japan. After the most recent refusal, at Shanghai&apos;s Pudong airport on 4 November, he was forced on to a flight back to Narita, where he took up residence on a bench opposite the immigration desks. Airport officials have been powerless to move him, since he has a valid passport and visa to visit Japan. Today, the 90th day of his protest, he said he would talk to the press tomorrow before leaving the airport on Wednesday to spend a few days with his sister, who lives near Tokyo. The details of the agreement with Chinese officials remain unclear, but Feng said he was confident that &quot;this time will be different&quot;, after a third meeting with diplomats at the weekend. &quot;I am looking forward to getting home and seeing my 90-year-old mother,&quot; he told the Guardian by mobile phone. &quot;I also have to look for a new job.&quot; He said he hoped to be back in his hometown, Shanghai, before the Chinese new year on 14 February. Feng has become a minor celebrity in Japan since his protest began in early November. After living off tap water for the first few days, he has since survived on drinks and snacks from some of the thousands of returning travellers who passed him every day. His updates on his plight, posted on his blog and Twitter, generated an outpouring of support from people all over the world. On Saturday he wrote of yet another act of kindness by a passerby. &quot;6:30 was still in &apos;bed&apos;, a female staff member I know came with a Singaporean flight attendant to say hello to me. The flight attendant gave me a package of four cakes,&quot; said a Twitter posting translated from Chinese by the US-based China Digital Times. Though he is often likened to Tom Hanks&apos;s character in the 2004 film The Terminal, Feng is not stateless: instead, he decided to stay put at Narita in protest at his treatment by the Chinese government. &quot;As a Chinese citizen, I have the right to return home,&quot; he said. Amnesty International describes Feng as a prominent human rights activist. In 2001 he was sentenced to three years in prison for &quot;illegal business activity&quot;, the human rights organisation said.

The lack of cash will alarm the likes of Richard Caring, the restaurant tycoon, Ann Gloag, the founder of Stagecoach and Ray O&apos;Rourke, the construction boss, who all handed Levene cash to invest in City share offerings. They were told the news by Louise Brittain, a leading insolvency practitioner at Deloitte. Referred to as &quot;Beano&quot; because of his extravagant lifestyle, Levene is a well known City figure whose empire crumbled last autumn under a shower of legal actions from angry investors. Thought to be missing, Levene sought sanctuary in the Priory to treat what he described as a gambling addiction that saw him lose \u00a370m. The Guardian has learnt that while Levene&apos;s business operations were based in Panama, he had accounts in Monaco and Switzerland. Levene received substantial funds from a Gibraltar law firm called Hassan. Money from Hassan appears to have been invested in shares via spread bets and other investment portfolios. A source at Hassan stated that the firm placed three clients with Levene on the basis of obtaining access to initial public offerings that clients would otherwise not have access to. Hassan stated it has not recovered all the cash owed to clients. Levene, 45, is now also facing a possible legal action from a spread-betting firm. This is on top of a claim by IG Index that Levene lost \u00a3720,000 betting on a single Twenty20 cricket match in 2008. The spread-bet firm believes Levene used shares in Delek, a former Aim-listed property company, as collateral for his gambling with the company. But there is a question mark about whether he actually owned the shares. A senior source linked to Delek said that to his knowledge, Levene was never on the company share register and that the firm had no dealings with him. Levene, however, had control of Delek shares through an arrangement with Israeli investor Igal Ahouvi, a well known figure in London real estate circles. Ahouvi successfully took legal action against Levene in 2008 after the North Londoner failed to hand over the Israeli&apos;s shares and dividends in Delek. Levene, who was a vice chairman of Nicola Horlick&apos;s investment vehicle Bramdean Asset Management and a former director at Leyton Orient football club, is the subject of an ongoing Serious Fraud Office investigation. Before being tracked down to the Priory last year, Levene failed to appear at critical court hearings to defend himself, prompting the courts to freeze assets and demand he surrender all passports. A court order noted he opened bank accounts in Northern Cyprus. His lavish lifestyle was well known. Parties were extravagant, holidays were spent staying in luxury suites where he ostentatiously hired super yachts. Confessing to his gambling addiction, Levene vowed to repay his investors who count among the elite of British business. He voluntarily submitted to questioning from the SFO. He began his career as a tea boy with Phillips &amp; Drew, later joining Tullett &amp; Tokyo where he cemented his reputation as a brash, outspoken intimidating broker on the London Stock Exchange floor. In a civil case in June, Levene was ordered to pay Ann Gloag, Scotland&apos;s richest woman, and her brother Brian Souter, the chief executive of Stagecoach, almost \u00a318m. The pair won a high court judgment ordering Levene to return the money, which was given to make investments that never materialised. So far the pair have received no cash. It is understood they are frustrated at the slow pace of the SFO investigation and efforts to recover cash. Repeated efforts to contact Levene were unsuccessful."}, {"sentences": ["The problem for the 150kg grand champion is that his latest high-profile bout took place not in the ring but outside a Tokyo club after a night of heavy drinking."], "tags": ["Japan", "Sport", "World news", "Sumo wrestling", "Wrestling"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-02T14:30:11Z", "title": "Sumo wrestling champion could be banned after nightclub attack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/02/asashoryu-sumo-wrestling-nightclub-attack", "article": "For Asashoryu, one of the finest sumo wrestlers of all time, it was always going to be a one-sided affair. The problem for the 150kg grand champion is that his latest high-profile bout took place not in the ring but outside a Tokyo club after a night of heavy drinking. As police decide whether to question Asashoryu over the incident, which left his victim with a broken nose, a split lip and facial bruising, sumo&apos;s elders appear to be running out of patience with the enfant terrible of Japan&apos;s troubled national sport. If the police decide to press charges against Asashoryu, the Japan Sumo Association will come under intense pressure to ban him or risk further damage to the sport&apos;s already tarnished reputation. According to the weekly magazine Friday, the scuffle took place in the early hours of 16 January, when the wrestler should have been preparing for his bout later the same day. He went on to win the tournament, the 25th title of his career. While reports said the victim, a friend who managed the club, was given a large sum in return for not filing a police complaint, the severity of the attack could yet lead to a prosecution. Asashoryu, 29, whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj, has been at the centre of controversy since he reached the sport&apos;s pinnacle in 2003. He is regularly accused of lacking the dignity befitting a grand champion and of belittling the traditions of a sport thought to have originated 2,000 years\u00a0ago. In 2003 he pulled the topknot of a fellow Mongolian wrestler during a bout and continued to scuffle with his opponent in the communal bath. Four years later he became the first grand champion to be suspended after he was filmed playing in a charity football match, dressed in a Wayne Rooney replica England shirt, despite pulling out of a goodwill sumo tournament claiming he was injured. His suspension triggered a nervous breakdown, from which he recovered by taking refuge at a luxury spa resort in his native Mongolia. Asashoryu may have met his nemesis in the form of Takanohana, a hugely popular former wrestler who has vowed to clean up the sport he dominated in the 1990s. The 37-year-old stable master, who was yesterday voted on to the board of the ultra-conservative sumo association, wants to introduce fairer pay for sumo hairdressers, judges and announcers, cut the inflated bonuses paid to board members and open up the sport&apos;s finances. He has also set his sights on Asashoryu. &quot;It&apos;s important that we get to the truth,&quot; he said of the nightclub fight. &quot;We need to launch a proper investigation. A sumo wrestler should not feel the wind at his back, but walk tall with his head held high.&quot; The association is expected to announce its decision on Thursday. The sports minister called for an investigation into Asashoryu&apos;s most recent outburst. &quot;The association must be responsible for Japan&apos;s national sport,&quot; Tatsuo Kawabata said. &quot;This must be dealt with appropriately. If the reports are true, it is deplorable.&quot; The controversy surrounding one of sumo&apos;s finest exponents will do little for attempts to widen the sport&apos;s appeal amid declining audiences and lack of interest among Japanese boys. Sumo has been at the centre of persistent \u2013 but unproven \u2013 match-fixing claims, and in 2008 three Russian wrestlers tested positive for marijuana use. A year earlier, a 17-year-old trainee died after being beaten by fellow wrestlers on the orders of their stable master. The dearth of talented Japanese wrestlers has paved the way for an influx of foreigners. Sumo has not had a homegrown grand champion for more than three years; of the four top wrestlers, three are Mongolian and one is Bulgarian."}, {"sentences": ["If the Tokyo-based journalists who hopped onto bullet trains this morning to attend a hastily called news conference hundreds of miles away in Nagoya were expecting a public show of contrition, they \u2013 as well as customers and investors \u2013 were to be disappointed."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-02T20:40:03Z", "title": "Toyota's Japanese bosses slammed for sluggish response to safety problems", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/02/toyota-slow-response-recall-crisis", "article": "Toyota may have earned points for acknowledging that the sheer scale of its second major vehicle recall in five months could leave a deep dent in sales this year, but the Japanese carmaker is winning few plaudits for its handling of the crisis.

Instead, the unenviable task of explaining the details of the recall fell to Toyota&apos;s executive in charge of quality and control, Shinichi Sasaki. He at least acknowledged the perception that the firm had been slow to respond to the accelerator pedal problem that prompted the recall of 4.45m cars around the world. &quot;The size of the problem we have caused our customers is unprecedented,&quot; Sasaki, the only executive in attendance, told about 100 reporters. But there was no deep bow of apology, and not even a hint of the waterworks that have helped countless Japanese executives weather crises and scandals. If Sasaki&apos;s concern was genuine, his timing of was questionable. Having announced the latest recall on 21 January, it took Toyota until Monday to send an executive in front of the cameras to apologise and respond to a flurry of hitherto unanswered questions. Even that appearance took place thousands of miles away in the US, where Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, insisted the firm had &quot;not lost our edge on quality.&quot; But on this side of the Pacific, Toyota&apos;s questionable \u2013 some would say arrogant \u2013 PR performance risks sparking a global consumer backlash. Industry watchers say much of the anxiety, and extra costs that could run into billions of dollars, could have been avoided had Toyoda, the grandson of Toyota&apos;s founder, immediately gone public with words of reassurance. Instead, he has limited his comments to an apology while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, and only when pressed by Japanese TV reporters. Analysts warned that the company&apos;s handling of the crisis could have harsher repercussions than the recall itself, particularly in the vitally important US market. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen Toyota like this,&quot; said Koji Endo, director at Advanced Research Japan. &quot;Until recently, they had a culture of reacting swiftly to problems. But the impression I get now is that [its PR operation] is not functioning very properly.&quot; While an apology does not necessarily equal accountability, Japan has grown accustomed in lean economic times to the unsettling sight of middle-aged executives, eyes down, delivering apologies through streams of tears. Only last month similar corporate theatrics were on display when Haruka Nishimatsu and other outgoing directors at Japan Airlines [JAL] bowed in unison after the firm filed for bankruptcy. In Japan a mea culpa, delivered with feeling, can go a long way towards placating investors and loyal, but demanding, consumers. Wayward celebrities have saved careers and convicted criminals secured leniency by doing as much. As Toyota stalls in the face of consumer disquiet, mounting legal actions in the US and a gaping hole in its sales forecast, the government urged the firm to ensure that the recall does not ruin the name of another Japanese icon so soon after the JAL fiasco. The firm must &quot;limit the damage&quot; from the recall, the industry minister, Masayuki Naoshima, told reporters. Last October, Toyoda apologised for the fatal US crash that led to the first safety recall, and for the firm&apos;s lack of preparedness for the global economic crisis. His company, he said, was &quot;grasping for salvation.&quot; It is an appeal many believe he would do well to repeat in the coming days."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;The trust in Japanese quality, in Toyota, has been shaken,&quot; said Toshiro Yoshinaga, an analyst at Aizawa Securities in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Japan", "Motoring", "Road transport", "Technology", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-02T21:09:53Z", "title": "Faulty pedals and millions of cars recalled: Toyota's reputation accelerates into trouble", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/02/faulty-cars-recalled-toyota-reputation", "article": "Toyota was under pressure today over the accelerator fault that is forcing it to recall 2m cars across Europe as the RAC described the problem as &quot;incredibly dangerous&quot; and urged concerned owners to have their vehicles checked immediately.

Yesterday British owners of the eight affected models, which include the Aygo, Yaris, Corolla and Avensis, told how their cars sped beyond their control, and voiced frustration that Toyota dealerships were so slow to deal with the problem. Catherine Block, 28, told the Guardian how her Aygo careered down a sliproad towards some roadworks on the A2 when her accelerator stuck before she took it to a Toyota dealer last October. &quot;It was only luck that I wasn&apos;t injured or killed, because I eventually figured out for myself how to unjam the pedal while driving,&quot; she said. Another driver described how the throttle stuck at 60mph on a dual carriageway and it took him two and a half miles to slow down enough to drive on to a verge, where the car eventually stalled. &quot;Toyota needs to look at how this problem came about and why it wasn&apos;t picked up at the start in post-production checks,&quot; said a spokeswoman for RoSPA. &quot;Was it identified as early as it could have been?&quot; An RAC spokesman said: &quot;I hope they have done this [product recall] as quickly as they possibly could.&quot; He issued advice to owners. &quot;If your accelerator gets stuck down, it is a very frightening thing to happen at any speed. If your car is feeling slightly different from normal and there is a change in the behaviour of your accelerator, get it checked out straight away.&quot; Toyota also came under criticism in Japan yesterday when the president of the company, Akio Toyoda, decided not to attend a hastily called press conference. In his place was the executive vice-president in charge of quality control, Shinichi Sasaki, who described the issue as unprecedented in scale and said the company was &quot;extremely worried&quot; about its future sales. Senior management has come under criticism for failing to make a speedy public apology for the recall, which affects more than 8m cars around the world. &quot;The trust in Japanese quality, in Toyota, has been shaken,&quot; said Toshiro Yoshinaga, an analyst at Aizawa Securities in Tokyo. Toyota said it had received 26 reports from across Europe of the accelerator pedal sticking and not bouncing back into position properly. A spokesman said yesterday the company had begun fitting new cars with a different accelerator last August, but did not initiate a recall until it become apparent that the pedal could become completely stuck down and had to be pulled back up. Toyota is facing at least 10 lawsuits in north America, where owners have accused it of not acting quickly enough to fix the faulty pedals. Toyota in the UK said it had no evidence that anyone has been injured due to a stuck pedal, but the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had confirmed that five people had died as a result of trapped floor mats, a related problem which also makes the pedal stick. Toyota said this was not a problem in the UK, but British Toyota drivers have claimed it has caused their accelerator pedals to stick. &quot;Clearly there is an awful lot of distress caused as a result of this,&quot; said David Crouch, a spokesman at the company&apos;s UK headquarters in Epsom. &quot;As soon as we started the recall, we opened up a dialogue with Toyota owners, and we have sent out information every day.&quot; Crouch said Toyota could not have discovered the problem in post-\u00adproduction testing because it was the result of a combination of moisture and wear causing friction in the accelerator mechanism, which happened over time and\u00a0in particular atmospheric con\u00additions. He said every owner affected would be contacted. A remedy, in the form of a precision-cut steel reinforced bar, would be installed on their cars. &quot;We would like to reassure customers that the potential issue identified with the accelerator pedal only occurs in very rare circumstances,&quot; said Michael Valvo, Toyota&apos;s PR manager. &quot;Our recall action is a precautionary measure.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Wild supported and guided young musicians for nearly 50 years, giving masterclasses all over the world, joining the faculties of a number of American institutions at various times, and teaching classes at the conservatories in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-03T18:18:51Z", "title": "Earl Wild obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/03/earl-wild-obituary", "article": "Earl Wild, who has died aged 94, was one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century. With the extraordinary catholicity of his repertoire, his role as a pianist-composer and his charismatic stage presence, Wild came closer than most to\u00a0being the complete virtuoso. It is hard to name another pianist who has been as\u00a0successful in the works of such a diverse range of composers, from Dieterich Buxtehude, Bach and Mozart through to Paul Hindemith, Walter Piston, Aaron Copland, Gian Carlo Menotti and Paul Creston. His gregarious, omnivorous engagement with the piano&apos;s literature, a palpable delight in his own athleticism \u2013 Wild had one of the supreme piano mechanisms \u2013 and the apparent ease with which he dismissed all technical difficulties were rivalled by few of his peers, while the consistently beautiful sound he conjured from the instrument provided a role model for many of them. It is a view that will not be shared by those who judge the merits of a\u00a0pianist on the relentless repetition of\u00a0a small number of works by central-European composers of the 18th and 19th centuries. It was his espousal of\u00a0the music of George Gershwin (the composer most associated with Wild in his early career) that led, unfairly, to the &quot;lightweight&quot; tag from some critics and a quite unjustified reputation for glibness and superficiality. Wild, it is true, occasionally amused himself with the kitsch and trivial (his tongue-in-cheek reminiscences on Walt Disney&apos;s Snow White, for example) but only those who view the piano solely as an instrument of serious intent could take offence. Perhaps he did not dig as deep as others into Schumann and Chopin, but he was unquestionably one of the greatest interpreters of Liszt and Rachmaninov (Wild&apos;s 1965 recordings of the latter&apos;s works for piano and orchestra remain among the best available), while his revival of many forgotten virtuoso works by the likes of Mily Balakirev, Leopold Godowsky, Henri Herz, Nikolai Medtner and Sigismond Thalberg has added immeasurably to our knowledge and appreciation of the piano. His recordings of Ignacy Jan Paderewski&apos;s Piano Concerto and Xaver Scharwenka&apos;s once-popular B flat minor Concerto are classics of their kind. Few could match him in the despatch of dazzling transcriptions and end-of-recital morceaux, played with a quiet hand and\u00a0light heart. Wild rounded off his celebratory 85th birthday recital in Carnegie Hall, New York, with Eugen d&apos;Albert&apos;s finger-crunching Scherzo. It was the playing of a man half his age. His 90th birthday recital at the same venue showed that his playing had lost little of its youthful colour and vigour. He gave his final recital in February 2008 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, when he was awarded the president&apos;s merit award by the National Academy of\u00a0Recording Arts and Sciences. He remained a relatively unfamiliar figure in the UK, where a classical pianist with a name like a 1950s rock star was viewed with suspicion. In his native America, he was regarded as something of a national treasure, justly hailed as one of the greatest home-grown talents the country has produced. He remains the only pianist to be invited to play at the White House before six consecutive presidents (beginning with Herbert Hoover). Wild was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his father worked in the steel industry. His mother was a hat designer. With immense hands, absolute pitch and an uncanny facility as a sight-reader and improviser, from his earliest years he was certain that the piano was to be his life. His pianistic genealogy was distinguished. At 11, he was accepted as a pupil of Selmar Janson, himself a\u00a0pupil of Scharwenka and d&apos;Albert (who had studied with Liszt). Later he took lessons with the great Dutch pianist Egon Petri (a pupil of Ferruccio Busoni), Paul Doguereau (a pupil of Paderewski and Ravel) and Helene Barere, wife of the Russian virtuoso Simon Barere. At 14, Wild was playing the piano and celesta in the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under Otto Klemperer. Times were hard as he began his career during the Depression, but in 1937 he became a staff pianist with NBC and two years later, he became the first pianist to give a live solo recital on US television. (Remarkably, in March 1997, he also became the first pianist to give a live solo recital on the internet.) In 1942 Wild was the first American-born musician to be invited by Arturo Toscanini to appear with him (in Gershwin&apos;s Rhapsody in Blue), making him the youngest soloist ever engaged by the NBC Symphony. The broadcast performance brought national fame overnight and led to Wild being typecast as a Gershwin specialist. He later composed a Grand Fantasy on Porgy and Bess and Seven Virtuoso Etudes based on Gershwin songs. After serving in the US navy band during the second world war (he played the flute), Wild took a job as staff pianist, conductor and composer with NBC&apos;s rival ABC network. He\u00a0retained the post until 1968. Between 1952 and 1956, he worked with the comedian Sid Caesar on the hit TV show Caesar&apos;s Hour. During his affiliation with both networks, he continued to perform concert engagements all over the world. In 1962, ABC commissioned him to compose an Easter oratorio, the first time a television network had subsidised a major musical work. Revelations, based on the visions of St John the Divine, was conducted by Wild with such success that it was restaged and rebroadcast two years later. Another choral work, The Turquoise Horse, based on a native north American poem, was premiered in 1976. His Variations on a Theme of Stephen Foster for Piano and Orchestra (&quot;Doo-Dah&quot; Variations) was given its world premiere in 1992. Wild was the soloist and claimed thereby to be the first virtuoso pianist-composer to perform his own piano concerto since Rachmaninov. In 2000 he premiered his Piano Sonata, its final toccata marked to be played &quot;\u00e0 la Ricky Martin&quot;. Wild supported and guided young musicians for nearly 50 years, giving masterclasses all over the world, joining the faculties of a number of American institutions at various times, and teaching classes at the conservatories in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. He made his first recording in 1939 for RCA (accompanying the oboist Robert Bloom in a set of Handel sonatas) and subsequently recorded for 20 labels, including his own, Ivory Classics. His discography includes more than 35 concertos, 26 chamber works and more than 700 solo works. In 1997, his disc of transcriptions, Earl Wild \u2013 The Romantic Master, brought him a Grammy award. For nearly 40 years he shared his life with Michael Rolland Davis, also his manager and record producer, who survives him. A witty, waspish man with a fund of outrageous jokes and scurrilous anecdotes, Wild was enjoyable company and held strong opinions on his fellow pianists and musicians. &quot;I always play music that I\u00a0like,&quot; he said. &quot;If you don&apos;t play music that you like, it sounds like it. It&apos;s easy to learn something and then play it. But if you don&apos;t love it, what have you got?&quot; His memoirs, due to be published later this year, promise revealing insights into that music and on those with whom he worked, a list that comprises almost a who&apos;s who of American musical life in the 20th century. \u2022 Earl Wild, pianist, composer, editor and\u00a0teacher, born 26\u00a0November 1915; died\u00a023 January 2010"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Since the Prius is among Toyota&apos;s top-selling vehicles, its quality troubles could certainly hurt hybrid sales and Toyota&apos;s overall earnings.&quot; Inadequate Safety fears over eight other Toyota models, and anger over the firm&apos;s inadequate response sent its shares down by 3.5% to their lowest level in 10 months in early trading in Tokyo today."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Japan", "Business", "World news", "US news", "Consumer affairs", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-04T10:08:00Z", "title": "Toyota takes $2bn hit from global safety recall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/04/toyota-safety-recall-profits", "article": "Toyota will suffer $2bn (\u00a31.26bn) in extra costs as a result of a global safety recall affecting millions of cars, and faces a bruising few months ahead as it attempts to address safety concerns that could result in civil action by authorities in the US. In the only glimmer of good news at the end of a disastrous week, the world&apos;s biggest carmaker raised its annual forecast to an \u00a580bn profit (\u00a3550m), a dramatic reversal from its previous estimates of a \u00a5200bn loss. Last year the company suffered a \u00a5436bn loss as it fell victim to a global slump in demand sparked by the recession. The firm said it had recorded a net profit of \u00a5153bn in the third quarter, a reversal from its \u00a5164bn loss a year earlier. It raised its global sales forecast to 7.18m vehicles from 7.03m vehicles for the full year. Toyota officials said the projected $2bn cost of the recall includes an estimated \u00a570bn to \u00a580bn in lost sales. The cost of the recall has been taken into account in the company&apos;s new forecasts. The quarterly results do not reflect the dent in Toyota sales expected to follow the recall of millions of cars with potentially lethal acceleration faults. The firm said it had not factored in the potential costs of a new defect reported in its Prius hybrid model that could result in yet another recall. Toyota&apos;s battle to repair its battered reputation suffered another setback after it admitted it was looking into around 180 complaints about brake problems in its flagship green hybrid. It has already recalled more than 8m other vehicles worldwide to repair defective accelerator pedals and floor mats. The most recent recall, of 4.45m vehicles, includes 2.3m in the US and 180,000 in the UK. Today the Japanese government urged the carmaker to look into 77 reported cases of braking problems among new Prius models sold in Japan. Yesterday US authorities said they were investigating 100 similar complaints, with Prius owners reporting momentary loss of braking ability at low speeds on bumpy roads. Two of the incidents ended in crashes that resulted in injuries. Confusion The US transport secretary, Ray LaHood, said he planned to call Toyota&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda, this week to discuss the crisis. &quot;This is serious,&quot; he said in Washington. &quot;After I talk with him, they&apos;ll get it. We&apos;re going to keep the pressure on. &quot;We will continue our investigation into all aspects of these vehicles, including the electronics. We&apos;re going to hold Toyota&apos;s feet to the fire.&quot; Yesterday LaHood created confusion when he urged US Toyota owners not to drive their cars, advice he later called a &quot;misstatement&quot; before advising them to take their vehicles to a Toyota dealer. US authorities are also considering imposing civil penalties on Toyota if it determines that the firm&apos;s response to the glitch was inadequate. Japan&apos;s transport minister, Masayuki Naoshima, said he believed an immediate Prius recall was unnecessary. &quot;It is still not clear whether [the faulty brakes] will lead to safety problems,&quot; he told reporters. Toyota&apos;s executive in charge of quality control, Shinichi Sasaki, however, refused to rule out a Prius recall. Such a move could prove disastrous for Toyota; the Prius is the world&apos;s best-selling hybrid car, held up by Toyota as a shining example of cutting-edge green technology with global sales of 1.6m since its launch in 1997. &quot;The latest Prius troubles have really damaged Toyota&apos;s brand. Uncertainty over the Prius trouble will only prompt more consumers to dump Toyota,&quot; said Ryoichi Saito, a car industry analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities. &quot;Since the Prius is among Toyota&apos;s top-selling vehicles, its quality troubles could certainly hurt hybrid sales and Toyota&apos;s overall earnings.&quot; Inadequate Safety fears over eight other Toyota models, and anger over the firm&apos;s inadequate response sent its shares down by 3.5% to their lowest level in 10 months in early trading in Tokyo today. The firm has lost 22%, or $30bn, of its market value since the latest recall was announced on 21 January. Sasaki said the government had asked the firm to look into faulty brakes on the Prius petrol-electric last August. &quot;Our dealers have received a lot more complaints, but we are pursuing the root cause and we will be considering what measures we will take for our customers,&quot; he said on Japanese TV last night. News that the company had already started carrying out emergency fixes for Japanese Prius owners fuelled suspicions that the firm may have attempted to keep the latest glitch under wraps. Analysts were encouraged by today&apos;s financial results but said sales could yet suffer from the impact of the safety recalls. &quot;My first impression of the results is very good,&quot; said Kazutaka Oshima at Rakuten Investment Management. &quot;But we are more concerned about how a series of recalls will affect the company&apos;s earnings from the January-March quarter onwards. &quot;The problem with its Prius is also very worrying. We are not certain about how Toyota&apos;s damaged reputation will affect its earnings in the future. There are simply too many uncertainties surrounding Toyota at the moment. The best thing to do now is not to hold Toyota shares.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Anger over what many observers feel is the firm&apos;s inadequate response sent its shares down by 3.5% to their lowest level in 10 months in early trading in Tokyo today."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Motoring", "UK news", "Road safety"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-04T22:53:07Z", "title": "Toyota recall: 250 UK cases reported, 20 stuck pedals found, and one accident injury claimed", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/04/toyota-recall-accelerator-fault", "article": "The owners of 250 Toyotas have reported they have a potentially lethal fault which causes the accelerator pedal to stick down, the company&apos;s UK arm said today, as the government announced the withdrawal of a fleet of Avensis cars used by ministers because of safety fears. Senior Toyota executives told the Guardian that it had so far confirmed 20 UK cases of the fault, and its mechanics were investigating hundreds more reported by owners in the past week following the announcement of a product recall affecting more than 180,000 vehicles. The figures suggest the scale of the problem \u2013 affecting seven Toyota models, including Yaris, Corolla and Avensis \u2013 could be far greater than thought. Toyota said that until this winter there had only been &quot;a couple&quot; of confirmed cases in the UK and 26 across Europe. Drivers have complained of cars careering out of control at 65mph while overtaking, and negotiating roundabouts so fast that it felt like their car was on two wheels. A mechanical fault, caused by a combination of wear and cold and wet weather, Toyota believes, means that the accelerator pedal sometimes sticks down. Around 10,000 Toyota owners have so far contacted a hotline to air concerns. The first UK claim of a crash was made today by a solicitor for an unnamed driver in the Midlands. He is said to have received head injuries when his Toyota hit a wall at 30mph last September. &quot;We understand the accelerator became stuck and he suffered injuries as a consequence,&quot; said Ciaran McCabe at the Moore Blatch personal injury practice. &quot;My client is receiving medical rehabilitation.&quot; Toyota said today it had received no reports of accidents with the fault in the UK, and urged owners of the affected models to continue to drive their cars unless there was any noticeable problem with the accelerator pedal \u2013 in which case they should contact their dealer immediately. The company is dealing with reports using a traffic light system; any customer whose accelerator has become stuck is a &quot;red&quot; case, anyone who has noticed more minor symptoms, such as a chattering pedal or stiffness in returning, is &quot;amber&quot;. Customers in these categories are urged to seek immediate advice from a mechanic at one of Toyota&apos;s 206 approved service centres. However, they as yet cannot fix the problem as the components are being made in Japan and will arrive by Wednesday next week. The company said workshops would extend opening hours in an effort to modify every car within eight weeks, and letters to more than 180,000 owners will be posted tomorrow orFriday to inform them their vehicle is among those covered by the recall, explain warning signs, and provide advice on what do if the accelerator pedal gets stuck. The Department for Transport said the secretary of state, Lord Adonis, was monitoring the situation, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the government car service had taken off the road 10 Toyotas used by junior ministers and replaced them while they await repair. Toyota&apos;s commercial director, Jon Williams, today issued an apology. &quot;We&apos;re truly sorry for letting our customers down. Nothing is more important to us than our customers&apos; safety and satisfaction \u2026 we are redoubling our efforts to ensure that this can never happen again.&quot; In Japan Toyota revealed that the cost of the fault affecting 8.1m cars in America and Europe could rise as high as \u00a31.3bn. Repairs will cost $1.1bn and lost sales as much as $880m, it warned, potentially plunging it into the red for the year. Its reputation also suffered another setback after it admitted it was looking into 180 complaints of brake problems in the Prius, its flagship green hybrid. The problems have emerged in the US and Japan and it is not yet clear if there will be a recall. Toyota in the UK said models were not affected. Anger over what many observers feel is the firm&apos;s inadequate response sent its shares down by 3.5% to their lowest level in 10 months in early trading in Tokyo today. Although the first cases in Britain were recorded by Toyota in late 2008, Williams denied it had been too slow to respond. &quot;We have taken all the information we have had throughout Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;We had 26 reports across the European Union out of 1.8m cars [with the affected part] and we have analysed those reports. That is our commitment to quality.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Like any world-class capital, Tokyo has its fair share of major galleries.", "From venerable buildings that have survived earthquakes and bombings to the boutique art houses where every inch of wall is a potential display space, Tokyo is a haven for art lovers in search of something a little different.", "It&apos;s now a rabbit warren for Tokyo&apos;s art scene, hosting everything from established galleries and antique dealers to first-time solo displays and design firms.", "Inside EF Gallery, Tokyo    Gallery Serikawa is currently showing works by the Japanese artist Kiyoto Maruyama, appropriately enough because he is one of the last surviving painters of so-called &quot;hot spring pictures&quot;, large-scale landscape paintings often found on the walls of Japan&apos;s public baths.", "Bordering one of Tokyo&apos;s most famous cemeteries, it&apos;s an elegant building with high ceilings and windows, flooded with natural light.", "A practising psychiatrist most of the week, Takahashi reserves Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons for his hobby, and has amassed more than 1,000 works since 1997, shuttling them between different temporary spaces across Tokyo.", "Takahashi tells me that he started buying work by contemporary Japanese artists such as Makoto Aida after hanging out at Ota Fine Arts, one of the most highly-respected private galleries in Tokyo.", "&quot;I spend it all on the art.&quot; Perhaps he should follow the example of Tokyo&apos;s younger gallerists, who several years ago set up shop well off the beaten track, in the industrial Kiyosumi district to the east of the city.", "This nameless group \u2013 made up of gallerists and art dealers who made their name in the mid-1990s \u2013 brought their businesses under one roof in 2005 to create one of the largest gallery spaces in Tokyo.", "The clean walls and bright lighting make for a flexible exhibition space \u2013 one of the largest in Tokyo \u2013 and there&apos;s a wonderful variety of work here, but the lack of visitors does nothing to improve the atmosphere."], "tags": ["Art", "Painting", "Sculpture", "Installation", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture", "Tokyo holidays", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-05T07:01:00Z", "title": "Galleries galore: a tour of Tokyo's teeming art scene", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/05/galleries-tokyo-art-scene", "article": "Like any world-class capital, Tokyo has its fair share of major galleries. The largest national and private collections, such as the National Museum of Modern Art or the Mori Art Museum, are up there with the best. But plenty of smaller Japanese gallerists, collectors and artists also manage to find a foothold here. From venerable buildings that have survived earthquakes and bombings to the boutique art houses where every inch of wall is a potential display space, Tokyo is a haven for art lovers in search of something a little different. So why not take an improvised tour of the city&apos;s lesser-known galleries, to find out what makes them tick? And how do they manage to survive in a crowded city where space is the most precious commodity of all? I start my tour, perhaps surprisingly, slap-bang in the middle of the city&apos;s main shopping area, the Ginza district. But the sober, brown-brick structure I&apos;m standing in front of couldn&apos;t be more different from the neon-clad consumer paradise just a stone&apos;s throw away. This is the Okuno building, constructed in 1932, one of the first sets of flats in the city to have mod cons such as a lift and telephones. It&apos;s now a rabbit warren for Tokyo&apos;s art scene, hosting everything from established galleries and antique dealers to first-time solo displays and design firms. No fewer than 20 galleries are based here \u2013 many in what were once small bedrooms, and even, in one case, a former communal bathroom in the basement. This last is occupied by Gallery Serikawa, a cosy space whose ancient plumbing betrays its origins.     Inside EF Gallery, Tokyo    Gallery Serikawa is currently showing works by the Japanese artist Kiyoto Maruyama, appropriately enough because he is one of the last surviving painters of so-called &quot;hot spring pictures&quot;, large-scale landscape paintings often found on the walls of Japan&apos;s public baths. These tranquil, generic nature scenes are designed to put the mind at rest as the body soaks in the hot spring. Upstairs, though, things are far less serene. In room 511, high up in the building, I locate the tiny gallery A Piece of Space, displaying a sculpture by the Swiss artist Susanna Niederer \u2013 an elegant, dusted-bronze windchime with five bell-shaped chimes suspended from the ceiling. Elsewhere, lacquerware artist Tamaki exhibits decorative boxes and trays imprinted with gold leaf. A few steps down the corridor, I find the Y&apos;s Arts gallery, covered wall-to-wall in British and European antiques. Next stop is yet another public bath enjoying a second lease of life as an art gallery: Scai the Bathhouse. Bordering one of Tokyo&apos;s most famous cemeteries, it&apos;s an elegant building with high ceilings and windows, flooded with natural light. The gallery specialises in Japanese and international contemporary artists; Anish Kapoor and Louise Bourgeois have shown here. I find myself hooked by a subversive animation by the Korean multimedia artist and sculptor Jeon Joonho, his first solo show in Japan. The 13-minute piece, entitled Welcome, shows the serene landscape depicted on a North Korean 50 won note being disturbed by a flotilla of helicopters, one of which crashes, turning the olive-green fields into a raging bushfire. As in a previous piece of political satire by Jeon \u2013 an animation of a US $20 note, during which a workman gradually paints over the windows of the White House \u2013 the artist seems to be attacking the symbols of statehood as well as satirising the fallout from military intervention. Next, I wander over to the Takahashi Collection, art bought by possibly Japan&apos;s most important private collectors, which has popped up at a variety of temporary spaces over the last few years, and is currently appearing in Hibiya, a faintly nondescript business district close to the imperial palace. A practising psychiatrist most of the week, Takahashi reserves Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons for his hobby, and has amassed more than 1,000 works since 1997, shuttling them between different temporary spaces across Tokyo. The current space \u2013 open since April 2009 \u2013 will only be available until this December.  Takahashi tells me that he started buying work by contemporary Japanese artists such as Makoto Aida after hanging out at Ota Fine Arts, one of the most highly-respected private galleries in Tokyo. At that time, the work of Yayoi Kusama \u2013 a Japanese artist known for her multi-coloured, polka-dot designs \u2013 was a particular favourite. Takahashi concentrates on younger artists now, he says, but denies that he has ambitions to become the Japanese Charles Saatchi. &quot;I don&apos;t have enough money to build a gallery,&quot; he smiles. &quot;I spend it all on the art.&quot; Perhaps he should follow the example of Tokyo&apos;s younger gallerists, who several years ago set up shop well off the beaten track, in the industrial Kiyosumi district to the east of the city. This nameless group \u2013 made up of gallerists and art dealers who made their name in the mid-1990s \u2013 brought their businesses under one roof in 2005 to create one of the largest gallery spaces in Tokyo. ShugoArts is here, one of the key forces behind the gallerists&apos; collective, as is the groundbreaking Taka Ishii gallery. But the real heavyweight is the Tomio Koyama Gallery, which introduced the world to Takashi Murakami, probably the best-known Japanese artist working today. But getting there isn&apos;t as easy as it sounds, as I discover. You take the metro to a rundown industrial area surrounded by warehouses; the galleries themselves \u2013 I have to ask directions \u2013 lie down a quiet road, opposite a cement factory. Once inside the building, improvised paper signs sticky-taped to the walls lead you to an industrial elevator. It feels rather like trespassing on criminal gang territory. And when I get inside, the galleries are largely deserted. The clean walls and bright lighting make for a flexible exhibition space \u2013 one of the largest in Tokyo \u2013 and there&apos;s a wonderful variety of work here, but the lack of visitors does nothing to improve the atmosphere. Tomio Koyama&apos;s current show is devoted to painter Atsushi Fukui and has the English title I See in You. Fukui has British connections, from an ongoing artistic collaboration with the musician David Sylvian, formerly of the 1970s rock group Japan. Fukui&apos;s mystical nature scenes, reminiscent of fairytales, hang alongside framed cartoon pages.     Design Festa's riotous exterior    Impressive though Tomio Koyama is, however, when it comes to one-off galleries or bizarre spaces, few can compete with Design Festa in the trendy Harajuku district. Once a drab block of flats, four stories high, it is now a riot of pink scaffolding and garish murals. Every inch has been painted and decorated \u2013 and practically every inch can be rented out as well. It hosts the freshest art in the capital and attracts a young, international crowd. As I walk through, I find more than enough to catch the eye on the colourful walls: in one corner a manic cartoon, in another hundreds of painted cat designs. In another, a huge human face sculpted from concrete. Inside the gallery, students \u2013 who, drawn by the cheap rates, make up more than half of the artists exhibiting here \u2013 show off their latest creations: everything from video installations to cutesy knitware and keyrings, from portrait photography to manga-inspired sketches. I can&apos;t say that I love everything on display, but it&apos;s exciting nonetheless. Design Festa is in fact two buildings merged to form one art complex, complete with restaurant and cafe.

The Guardian has established that: \u2022 Government officials said Toyota did not tell them about the problem until prompted. \u2022 Toyota decided the fault was not a safety issue when it received the first reports over a year ago. \u2022 A senior executive in charge of product quality drove a Toyota with a faulty accelerator to a meeting with government safety officials after the company had announced a recall. The revelations came as the company&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda, finally apologised to customers for a recall that could affect 8.1m vehicles worldwide. He confirmed the company is investigating a further problem with the brakes on Prius cars in Japan and North America which could lead to a recall of another 270,000 cars. &quot;We are facing a crisis,&quot; he said in a statement in Tokyo. &quot;I offer my apologies for the worries. Many customers are wondering whether their cars are OK.&quot; In Britain, where more than 180,000 vehicles have been recalled, it emerged the government demanded information from Toyota at the beginning of January after government safety officials were alerted to the scale of the risk by their US counterparts. Toyota knew about the problem from the winter of 2008/09, but only provided detailed information to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa), which registers recalls on faulty cars, on 22 January this year, according to the government. Toyota executives have also admitted that they treated 26 cases across Europe in the winter of 2008/09 as &quot;a quality issue&quot;. Only when the problem recurred this winter did they treat it as a safety issue. In the meantime drivers of models left on the road reported their cars speeding dangerously out of control. One driver reported that his Avensis accelerator became stuck last August while overtaking at 65mph. But in perhaps the most astonishing twist, Neal Standen, Toyota&apos;s general manager of product quality, admitted he drove his company Avensis with a stiff accelerator to a meeting on Monday with government officials to formally register the recall, despite Toyota&apos;s own advice that customers experiencing any accelerator pedal problems should &quot;drive to the nearest safe location, shut off the engine and contact a Toyota centre for assistance&quot;. He said he had driven the car with the stiff pedal fault for six months and had not yet taken it for repair. He said: &quot;I choose to drive that car every day.&quot; A spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: &quot;Somebody in his position should have known better. He should have stopped driving the car and had it checked immediately. If this is a company car we would hope the employer would provide a replacement.&quot; Toyota denied it has put customers&apos; lives at risk and insisted it had responded as quickly as possible to the problem. &quot;There were so few cases and no accidents [last winter], we didn&apos;t think it was a safety issue,&quot; a spokeswoman said. &quot;We now have a larger number of cases and we are now treating it as a safety issue. That is how we value our customers.&quot; The company also defended its decision not to inform the authorities about the problem last winter. &quot;During this winter period, we started to see the cases increase,&quot; said Steve Settle, Toyota&apos;s director of after-sales. &quot;We lodged 20 reports from November to January and compared to the previous year that was a significant difference.&quot; The RAC, which represents motorists in the UK, said the revelations about Toyota&apos;s handling of the situation were &quot;worrying&quot; and called for a review of how car safety recalls are handled. &quot;Motorists would hope that governments are not forced to request information about these problems,&quot; said its spokesman, Adrian Tink. &quot;From a motorists&apos; perspective, these are worrying concerns.&quot; A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: &quot;We expect them to come and tell Vosa about problems when they see a pattern emerging about an issue with design and construction. They need to see it as a pattern. At that point we expect them to tell us about it.&quot; The US government has also had to push Toyota to act on the problem. &quot;While Toyota is taking responsible action now, it unfortunately took an enormous effort to get to this point,&quot; Ray LaHood, the US trasportation secretary said this week. &quot;We have been pushing Toyota to take measures to protect consumers.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The other, a bland, blond cashier in a Tokyo convenience store with acting ambitions, fantasises that he&apos;s Kitano and begins to take over his life."], "tags": ["Drama", "Comedy", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-07T00:05:07Z", "title": "Takeshis' | Film review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/07/takeshis-takeshi-kitano-review", "article": "In this five-year-old, uncharacteristi\u00adcally self-indulgent piece, writer-director Takeshi Kitano (aka Beat Takeshi), Japan&apos;s favourite screen tough guy, talk-show host, wit and singer, plays two characters.

But unlike most girls, she records and posts her performances on YouTube. The results have made her an \u00adinternet phenomenon in Japan, home of the anime cartoon characters she imitates. More than eight million people have watched Rebecca performing as Beckii Cruel, dancing to bouncy J-pop (Japanese pop music) and anime theme songs in the attic of her home on the Isle of Man. Her success has led publishing giant Tokuma Japan to sign up Beckii, teaming her with 18-year-old French college student &quot;Sara Cruel&quot;, from Lyon, and a 16-year-old student from Portsmouth known as &quot;Gemma Cruel&quot;. The trio \u2013 Beckii Cruel and the Cruel Angels \u2013 release their debut album in Japan on Wednesday, when it is expected to reach the top of the charts. Beckii&apos;s looks have created a sensation in Japan, where she has become a &quot;moe idol&quot;, a female worshipped for her small face, large eyes and slender limbs, similar to those found in anime characters \u2013 the Japanese animation-style heavily influenced by manga comic books. Anime has a huge following in Japan across all sections of society. Taro Aso, a former prime minister, is a self-confessed anime obsessive, reading up to 20 comic books a week. &quot;The perceived virtual existence and borderless nature surrounding Beckii are a catalyst for stirring fantasies,&quot; said Toshiyuki Inoue, an IT journalist, summing up the popularity of moe artists. Kaori Sakurai, a freelance writer, said that the otaku \u2013 anime geeks who worship teenagers like Beckii \u2013 will often avoid pretty girls in real life, fearing that they would simply dismiss them. But they have been won over by Beckii, who appears as just another fan like them. Beckii&apos;s popularity in Japan rocketed after her YouTube videos were picked up by popular Japanese website Niko Niko Douga. Her Japanese DVD debut, This is Beckii Cruel: Too Cute to be Real, was released last November and debuted at number eight in Japan&apos;s DVD charts. Beckii, who already features in Japanese TV commercials for chewing gum, performed live for the first time at Akihabara, home of otaku culture in Tokyo, last October. The daughter of a policeman and a former dance instructor, Beckii first became interested in Japanese cartoons and comics three years ago when she picked up a translated copy of Fruits Basket, a Japanese girls&apos; manga created by Natsuki Takaya. Since then, she has been voraciously reading manga and watching anime, while also studying Japanese. Beckii&apos;s idea to film herself in &quot;cosplay&quot; \u2013 derived from costume play \u2013 followed and an internet star was born. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese teenagers indulge in &quot;cosplay&quot;, with conventions regularly held around the country. Tokyo Dome, home of the Yomiuri Giants baseball team, is a regular weekend hangout for teenagers dressed as their favourite anime or manga characters. At a recent press conference in Japan alongside her father, Derek, Beckii said she was aware that her age and the nature of her videos would attract some unwanted attention. &quot;I&apos;m well aware of the dangers of the internet; my school back home on the Isle of Man is good at educating us on that,&quot; she said. Beckii has had her own webpage since she was four \u2013 her older brother, Ryan had his at six. Ten years on from setting it up with her father, who says he has educated his daughter on the dangers of the internet, she now has the second most subscribed website among Japanese musicians. The expectation surrounding the release of her album this week suggests her incredible rise to fame shows no signs of slowing down."}, {"sentences": ["It is now the biggest carmaker in the world, with subsidiaries in most countries that are unable to handle the fault independent of the headquarters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Business", "Motoring", "Technology", "Japan", "US news", "World news", "UK news", "Robert Webb"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-07T00:10:01Z", "title": "How did Toyota veer so far off course?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/07/toyota-veer-off-course", "article": "When Catherine Block took her Toyota Aygo to her local dealer after a terrifying drive between Folkestone and Canterbury, she told mechanics: &quot;It was a good job my brakes worked. Otherwise I would be dead.&quot; They laughed, she recalls. &quot;They probably thought I was being melodramatic.&quot; This was hardly the case: during the 35-minute drive, she was able to drive up a steep hill at full pelt without pressing on the pedal once because the accelerator had stuck fast. Block, a 28-year-old student, had already taken her car into the Toyota dealership at least three times last autumn because of the sticky accelerator. On her first visit, mechanics said the problem was caused by the floor mat, then they wondered if the specialist radio equipment she had installed was the cause. Eventually, at the beginning of December, the mechanics replaced the pedal and the problem seems to have been solved. The dealership said hers was an isolated case. It has since emerged that Toyota had known about customers complaining about such &quot;sticky&quot; accelerator pedals in the UK since late 2008. Toyota admits that 26 of the cases it encountered in Europe had been reported as &quot;customer satisfaction issues&quot; at the time. The company now admits that between November and January \u2013 the fault appears to surface during cold weather\u2013 20 more vehicles were affected in the UK alone. Car companies are obliged to alert the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa), which registers recalls on faulty cars, of any safety issue that may merit a recall. Toyota UK only went public following pressure from British government safety officials who were alerted by their US counterparts handling a deluge of complaints about stuck accelerators. The carmaker gave detailed information to Vosa on 22 January, leading to the recall of 180,000 cars in the UK last week. Toyota&apos;s failure to tell its dealers about the fault is what angers Block most. &quot;The dealer did not have all the information available. This was a one-off as far as I was concerned.&quot; Since the fault is partly caused by wear and tear, as well as cold weather, she cannot be certain that the accelerator will not stick again. Toyota&apos;s public relations efforts, which accompanied its first public announcement in the UK about the faults late last month, have hardly re\u00adassured her. &quot;I&apos;m left in the dark \u2013 no one has bothered to contact me to check that the repair has worked. When I did ring the Toyota helpline, they said ring your dealer, who told me: &apos;It sounds like you know more about it than we do.&apos;\u2009&quot; When it finally came, Akio Toyoda&apos;s apology fell some way short of the dramatic mea culpa some had demanded from the Toyota president. &quot;I apologise from the bottom of my heart for all the concern that we have given to so many customers,&quot; he said, having emerged to address a global safety recall that threatens to inflict almost irreparable damage to his firm&apos;s brand. But there were no tears, no lingering semi-prostration or pleas for forgiveness. The only bows of the evening were made in greeting, not contrition. Toyoda&apos;s performance was a case study in the subtle difference between an apology and an admission of culpability. Still, his appearance on Friday came as a surprise. The 53-year-old, who was made president last June as the firm looked to its founding family to revive flagging sales, had for two weeks resisted calls to speak publicly about the biggest crisis in Toyota&apos;s 73-year history. All the media had managed to cajole out of him before Friday was a rushed apology on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. Appalled consumers, particularly in the US, made it clear that it was not the bold statement of reassurance that they were seeking. By this weekend events had turned the pressure into an irresistible force: a $2bn global recall of more than 8m cars affected by a faulty accelerator; threats of civil action and new lawsuits in the US; and now, another potential recall of the car that was supposed to define Toyota&apos;s future. While Toyoda&apos;s comments did little to reassure car owners, it underlined the extent of the public relations nightmare the company has created for itself. Much was written last week about the Japanese aversion to shame that informs the haphazard way executives publicly address safety concerns, from HIV-infected blood products for haemophiliacs to lethal kerosene heaters and tainted food and drink. Toyota&apos;s inept PR performance has done little to dispel the notion that it behaved in precisely the way we have come to expect of the most powerful members of corporate Japan. To be fair, Toyota is partly a victim of circumstance. Having found itself plunged into the cultural quicksand of crisis management in a globalised economy, it had little idea of where to turn for help. Yet that has done nothing to dispel the perception that in its pursuit of profit Toyota has lost sight of the principles on which it built its success: quality, reliability and, yes, safety. It is easy to forget, amid the current crisis, that before the bottom fell out of the global auto market Toyota was \u00adcelebrating record profits on its way to ending General Motors&apos; 77-year reign as the world&apos;s biggest carmaker. Its headquarters in the eponymously renamed city once known as Koromo are at the heart of an operation that now employs 300,000 people around the world, making and selling cars in 150 countries. Toyota simply had so far to fall, and in such a short time, that it has been in a state of denial, although that does not excuse the public relations shipwreck of the past fortnight, say industry watchers. At home Toyota has fared rather better at playing down the crisis. The consensus in Japan appears to view the recall as a blip rather than an incubator for a long-term crisis. Some news channels relegated Toyoda to the second item behind the retirement of a scandal-hit sumo wrestler. But in America the woes of Toyota have been met with a mixture of shock and schadenfreude. In a country that has an intimate cultural relationship with cars, the huge Japanese automaker has long been seen as an interloper, even though it makes many of its cars in America and Americans have shown no reservations about buying them. Perhaps that might have explained the first reaction of the US secretary of transportation, Ray LaHood, who confirmed early last week that the US government was considering imposing fines of more than $16m on the giant car firm. &quot;We&apos;re not finished with Toyota. We&apos;re going to keep the pressure on,&quot; he said. He then followed that up with a statement at a hearing in Congress in the middle of the week by telling lawmakers that he had simple advice to any Toyota owners: &quot;If anybody owns one of these vehicles, stop driving it and take it to a Toyota dealer.&quot; Not surprisingly, those comments triggered a rush among the owners of Toyota&apos;s 2.3m recalled cars, who flooded dealerships with panicked phone calls. Toyota&apos;s stock price also slumped dramatically. However, Shinichi Sasaki, who is in charge of Toyota&apos;s quality control, said it would have become &quot;even harder to win back the trust of customers, and the damage to the Toyota brand would have been greater&quot; had the US government not applied such pressure to recall the faulty cars. &quot;It was hard, but in hindsight I am grateful to Mr LaHood.&quot; Some have speculated that Toyota&apos;s problems could provide a much-needed boost to US automakers. In California the state legislature even passed a rule adopting a &quot;Buy American&quot; policy for future government vehicles in its fleet. The subject has quickly become a topic\u00a0for comedians. Jon Stewart of The Daily Show on television did an impression last week of the likely reaction of bosses at the Big Three, Chrysler, General Motors and Ford, to the Toyota recall news. &quot;Boys, we&apos;re back in the game! All we had to do was have the leading competition become a deathtrap,&quot; he quipped. But beneath the sound and fury and the wisecracks, the massive vehicle recall has had a sobering impact upon American consumers. Despite its foreign ownership, Toyota operates many car-making plants in America that have been praised for creating thousands of jobs, especially in the south, where it has been credited with reviving the fortunes of several struggling cities and towns. Any threat to Toyota will threaten those jobs. Toyota brands have also become a staple part of the American consumer landscape. The biggest risk for Toyota lies in how it is handling the crisis. If it were proved that executives had actively tried to cover up the problem, the consequences could be huge. Eighteen months ago the former chairman of truck-maker Mitsubishi was found guilty of professional negligence and received a two-year jail sentence after a truck made by the company crashed because of a defect, killing its driver. There is no evidence of any wrong\u00addoing by anyone at Toyota. But the class actions which are already starting to stack up on behalf of aggrieved owners will no doubt challenge those running the company about what they knew about the fault and when, and what they did about it. Toyota aficionados have been quick to defend the company, accusing the media of whipping up a frenzy and exaggerating the danger of the fault. Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association, said: &quot;To some extent there is a sense of a positive backlash in support of Toyota. Toyota has a fight to get its reputation back. But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s insurmountable. &quot;People are overstating the long-term effect. It will have a short-term effect on sales.&quot; Paul Newton, automotive analyst from IHS Global Insight, said the company had been far too slow to respond to the problem in the UK, as it had in most countries where it operates. &quot;PR-wise Toyota has handled the issue dreadfully. They have been somewhat in denial,&quot; he said. &quot;People are now looking at the company and asking what else is it hiding. Unless a customer has a wider knowledge of a problem, it&apos;s up to the manufacturer to hold their hands up and say they have an issue.&quot; Toyota UK has also been giving conflicting information, and appears to be reacting to events. On Monday, Toyota said that it would take at least three weeks to obtain from the licensing agency, the DVLA, the names and addresses of the owners of the models it intended to recall in the UK. Clearly this would have prolonged the anxiety of worried owners not knowing if their car had a potentially life-threatening fault. By Friday, as the furore mounted, Toyota had said it could get the details within two days and would write to those affected this week. The attempt at speedy, decisive management of the whole affair is not helped by Toyota&apos;s huge and unwieldy size. It is now the biggest carmaker in the world, with subsidiaries in most countries that are unable to handle the fault independent of the headquarters in Tokyo. King said: &quot;Toyota being such a large globalised organisation will have slowed decision-making and communication. If it was up to Toyota UK, they probably would have acted more quickly. &quot;The first rule of crisis management is to identify and isolate the problem and be open about it. Last week Toyota executives were on the radio in the UK, but maybe they should have been doing that at the beginning.&quot; The company president, Toyoda, has announced that he would lead a new division that will draw on outside expert help to improve quality control, an admission of powerlessness unthinkable only months ago. He promised that the &quot;frequency of communications with authorities around the world will be improved&quot;. A simple step, and long overdue. For millions of motorists who expected much more from Toyota, it is at least a start. But Japan&apos;s sense of immunity will almost certainly be short-lived, with new reports of potentially serious brake problems on new models of the Prius, Toyota&apos;s flagship hybrid. A Prius recall could affect more than 300,000 cars worldwide, about half of them in Japan. Dragging the name of the Prius through the mud could prove an ignominy too far for Toyota; the petrol-electric vehicle is the best-selling hybrid in the world, held up by its makers as the ultimate in fuel-efficient technology."}, {"sentences": ["Toyota&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda, and its executive in charge of quality control, Shinichi Sasaki, were due to give details of the latest recall in Tokyo this afternoon."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Business", "Japan", "Automotive industry", "US news", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-09T07:29:45Z", "title": "Toyota Prius among recall of hybrid cars in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/09/toyota-recalls-prius-over-brakes", "article": "Toyota is to recall more than 220,000 hybrid cars in Japan, including its Prius model, it confirmed today, while media reports claimed the recall could spread to more than 400,000 hybrids around the world. The move comes amid complaints in Japan and the US over a brake defect that can cause temporary brake failure at low speeds, particularly on bumpy or slippery surfaces. The world&apos;s biggest carmaker is already faces criticism over the recent recall of more than 8m cars worldwide affected by potentially dangerous acceleration problems. Reports today said 223,000 hybrid cars in Japan would be recalled, while an internal document obtained by Reuters said the recall would be extended to 436,000 cars worldwide. A global recall could affect almost 7,000 owners of the third-generation Prius in the UK. Toyota announced the Japanese recall across four hybrid models \u2013 the 2010 Prius model, the Prius PHV, the SAI and the Lexus HS250h. But Reuters said the report, which has not been made public, showed the firm would recall a further 213,000 cars outside Japan, including 150,000 in the US. Toyota&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda, and its executive in charge of quality control, Shinichi Sasaki, were due to give details of the latest recall in Tokyo this afternoon. The carmaker is battling to save its reputation, particularly in the key US market, where it faces lawsuits linked to accidents, an investigation by highway authorities and mounting criticism of its handling of the crisis by the Obama administration.

The recall of the latest version of the Prius in Japan is expected to be followed by similar measures in the US and Europe. The model is sold in about 60 countries, with sales totalling just over 300,000 since the first models were rolled out last spring. Toyota said it had fixed the software glitch responsible for the braking problem in the Prius models that went on sale since last month, but had yet to do repair models sold before then. Analysts accused the firm, which waited a week to discuss the brake defect after the first complaints were reported in the media, of being in a state of denial. &quot;Listening to management now, I think they still think there isn&apos;t a real problem with the Prius,&quot; Christopher Richter, auto analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets, said before the Prius recall was announced. &quot;But at this point you don&apos;t resist, because right now any Toyota vehicle that is perceived to have a problem you just say, &apos;We fix it.&apos; That&apos;s how you win back trust.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I apologise for causing trouble and worries for many customers over the quality and safety of Toyota,&quot; its embattled president, Akio Toyoda, told reporters in Tokyo today, his second public apology in less than a week."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Japan", "Automotive industry", "Road transport", "Business", "World news", "US news", "Motoring", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-09T10:30:00Z", "title": "Toyota issues global recall of hybrid cars", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/09/toyota-hybrid-cars-global-recall", "article": "     Toyota is to recall almost half a million hybrid cars worldwide, including 8,500 of its Prius model in the UK, in the latest blow to the carmaker&apos;s reputation following a string of safety scares. The recall will begin immediately in Japan and similar measures are being prepared overseas, the firm said today. Toyota GB announced that the recall will apply to 8,500 owners of the third-generation Prius in the UK. It will send individual letters to all those owners explaining details of the recalls, which will involve a 40-minute software update to the car&apos;s braking system. Today&apos;s announcement follows about 200 complaints in Japan and the US over a software glitch in its best-selling Prius petrol-electric hybrid that can cause temporary brake failure at low speeds on bumpy or icy roads. &quot;I apologise for causing trouble and worries for many customers over the quality and safety of Toyota,&quot; its embattled president, Akio Toyoda, told reporters in Tokyo today, his second public apology in less than a week. &quot;We sincerely acknowledge safety concerns from our customers. We have decided to recall as we regard safety for our customers as our foremost priority. We will redouble our commitment to quality as a lifeline of our company. We will do everything in our power to regain the confidence of our customers.&quot; Toyota GB pointed out that so far there had been no reports of accidents linked to the problem in Europe. Toyota&apos;s Japanese headquarters informed the country&apos;s transport ministry of the recall of 223,000 hybrid cars in Japan across four models: about 200,000 of the 2010 Prius model and much smaller numbers of the Prius plug-in hybrid, the SAI and the Lexus HS250h. It said it would take remedial measures concerning a further 213,000 hybrid cars outside Japan, including the US and Europe, taking the total number of vehicles affected to around 437,000. The new Prius is sold in about 60 countries, with sales totalling more than 300,000 vehicles since the first models were rolled out last spring. Toyota, the world&apos;s biggest carmaker, is already faces criticism following the recent recall of more than 8m cars worldwide affected by potentially dangerous acceleration problems. The Prius, the world&apos;s most popular hybrid, was Japan&apos;s top-selling car last year and hailed as the ultimate in green auto technology. But mounting fears over its safety could unravel Toyota&apos;s attempts to dominate the growing market in fuel-efficient vehicles. In the US Toyota is battling to save its reputation in the face of lawsuits linked to accidents, an investigation by highway authorities and mounting criticism of its handling of the crisis by the Obama administration. The brake defect has been responsible for four crashes in which two people were injured, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has launched an investigation. There have been no reports of similar accidents in the UK. The recall of the Prius represents a worst-case scenario for Toyota now that safety doubts surrounding its cars have spread to its hitherto fiercely loyal customers in Japan. &quot;Toyota has been, beyond any doubts, the top player in hybrid car segment, and the fact that Prius and other hybrid models will be part of this massive recall significantly dents its image,&quot; said Suh Sung-moon, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities in Seoul. Toyoda, the grandson of the company&apos;s founder, promised to work closely with US regulators following criticism that the company had only recalled cars with faulty accelerators under pressure from the US government. &quot;I have spoken with US transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, and given him my personal assurance that lines of communications with safety agencies and regulators will be kept open, that we will communicate more frequently and that we will be more vigilant in responding to those officials on all matters,&quot; Toyoda wrote in today&apos;s Washington Post. He said the firm was working around the clock to fix the problem, but conceded that it needed to do more to regain the trust of American drivers. &quot;We are taking responsibility for our mistakes, learning from them and acting immediately to address the concerns of consumers and independent government regulators.&quot; Toyota said it had fixed the software glitch responsible for the braking problem in Prius models that went on sale from late last month, but had yet to repair models sold before then. The admission that it had started fixing the brake glitch about a week before it went public with the problem has prompted allegations of a cover-up. The firm will start informing Japan dealers immediately about the glitch, which takes about 40 minutes to repair. Industry watchers said Toyota&apos;s handling of the recalls had seriously damaged its brand image. &quot;Until the recent crisis, Toyota was the best performing and most valuable car brand in the world,&quot; said David Haigh, the chief executive of Brand Finance, a UK consultancy, adding that the Prius had &quot;put Toyota right at the leading edge of the green car movement&quot;. He added: &quot;Sadly, the inept way Akio Toyoda and his management team have handled the recent crisis has massively damaged the brand.&quot; The firm has been widely criticised for failing to deal more quickly with the defects. It took almost two weeks for Toyoda, who was made president last summer, to comment publicly after the accelerator recall was announced last month. The company is also anticipating a flurry of lawsuits in the US over the brake problem, in addition to those already filed in connection with &quot;sticky&quot; accelerators. Today it was reported that the owner of a 2010 Prius has sued Toyota in Los Angeles, claiming that the company had failed to fix the brake defect.

Anger at the world&apos;s largest carmaker&apos;s handling of mechanical and design faults grew as Toyota bosses said they are recalling 437,000 third-generation Prius cars because of brake faults, 8,500 in the UK. Owners of the Prius, a leader in the &quot;green&quot; motoring sector, said the brake fault occurred in vehicles up to six months ago and has caused cars to overshoot at roundabouts and junctions, an experience they describe as scary and dangerous. A software fault in the anti-lock braking system means the brakes lose power momentarily on rough or slippy surfaces. Toyota today lodged a &quot;non-safety&quot; recall with the Department for Transport&apos;s Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, and said there is no danger to drivers. From Thursday it is planning to start reprogramming computers of the affected cars to prevent the problem happening again. The latest recall means more than 8.5m Toyotas worldwide have been called back for servicing since the end of January. In a statement issued this morning, Toyota GB apologised to its Prius \u00adcustomers for the brake problem and insisted: &quot;The cars are safe to drive \u2026 At no time are drivers without brakes.&quot; But owners of affected third-\u00adgeneration Prius models, on sale since last August, accused Toyota GB of under\u00adplaying the danger. &quot;When I go over a road hump at 25mph the brakes cut out and it feels like you have hit a patch of ice,&quot; said David Meredith, a teacher from Tamworth in Staffordshire who has had the problem since last September. &quot;It happens all the time. But \u00adToyota have handled this really badly. When your car doesn&apos;t stop when it should do, it is surely a safety issue.&quot; &quot;They are bound to want to say that [it is not a safety issue], because this is their flagship car, but it definitely is,&quot; said a London banker who suffered a brake failure last October. &quot;If there was a car on the other lane when the brakes failed on my car, I would have crashed into it.&quot; The Prius recall is seen as striking at the heart of Toyota&apos;s brand values. &quot;The Prius is one of the world&apos;s most brilliant cars,&quot; said motoring critic Quentin Willson. &quot;It has done so much to educate people about low emissions cars. It is such a shame it has been besmirched.&quot; With an estimated $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) wiped off Toyota&apos;s market value by the crisis, Akio Toyoda, the company&apos;s president, made his second public appearance in Tokyo. He said Toyota &quot;will face up to the facts and correct the problem, putting customers&apos; safety and convenience first&quot;. But Toyota suffered another blow tonight as US safety officials said they are investigating about 80 complaints of steering difficulties from drivers of 2009 and 2010 Corollas. Many say their cars can wander when they drive on the highway, making it hard to stay in lane. In the UK, the chairwoman of the House of Commons transport select committee, Louise Ellman, accused Toyota of issuing &quot;sketchy&quot; statements and questioned how long the manufacturer knew about the \u00adPriius problems before it went public. &quot;There is a great deal of anxiety and some of it is justified,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not clear when Toyota became aware of these issues and how quickly they transmitted it to the public. I think their statements have been sketchy and they are now reacting to events,&quot; she said. &quot;They need to give more confidence to the public that they are being full in what they are saying.&quot; Toyota GB has said it knew about accelerator problems, which have caused its cars to speed up suddenly, from the end of 2008, but could not say when it received first reports of the Prius brake problem. State Farm, America&apos;s largest car insurer, today said it warned federal safety regulators about a rise of reports about the accelerator fault in late 2007. Toyota in America is set to come under more pressure when the company&apos;s US head, Yoshimi Inaba, appears before a congressional committee tomorrow.Japan&apos;s transport minister is due to meet with the US ambassador to Japan, John Roos, to discuss the problems. There was also anger at Toyota&apos;s refusal to admit a recall of the Prius was imminent in recent days. Ben Howard, a TV editor from London, ordered a Prius early last month, but after hearing about the problems he was assured by his Toyota dealer that &quot;there is no recall and that it doesn&apos;t affect your car&quot;. On \u00adMonday, \u00adhaving collected his new Prius, he learned that it would be recalled after all. &quot;I feel Toyota was more interested in getting us to take that car off the forecourt than waiting to investigate if there was an issue that would affect it a week later.&quot; Workers at Toyota&apos;s Burnaston plant in Derbyshire where the Avensis and Auris are manufactured, said tonight they are concerned that the crisis could hit jobs. Tom Sawyer, Unite&apos;s regional officer for Toyota&apos;s Burnaston and Deeside plants, said: &quot;What adds to the concern is that with the company coming out of recession this could hinder that recovery and this could have a consequence in terms of orders.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Its predecessor, the first book in the Tokyo trilogy, Tokyo Year Zero, drew on the true crimes of 1940s Tokyo serial killer Kodaira Yoshio."], "tags": ["David Peace", "James Ellroy", "Crime fiction", "Books", "Culture", "True crime"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-10T13:04:12Z", "title": "Writers should focus on true crime, says David Peace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/10/writers-true-crime-david-peace", "article": "The future of crime fiction lies not in inventing ever more colourful crimes but in focusing on real-life wrongdoing, according to novelist David Peace, author of the bestselling Red Riding quartet and The Damned United.

Sixteen of them drank, and 12 died.

To me the greatest mystery or crime writer of the last 25 years is James Ellroy.

The magazine wanted to do an \u00adIndian issue, dedicated to art and \u00adculture and the new generation of \u00adIndian writers writing in English: Arundhati Roy, Kiran Desai, Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Chandra. It was a dream assignment: we rented one of those big white Ambassador taxis, loaded the boot up with beer and just drove around. We met everyone from \u00advillagers to generals, and the \u00adpictures began to build up. Then we got a message from New York saying Mother Teresa had agreed to do a photograph. She had been very reluctant, but we were told she was going to be at one of her missions in New Delhi. We turned up with our letter, thinking it would be straightforward, but they simply wouldn&apos;t let us have access. They kept stalling. We ended up \u00adstaying there for two days: they were\u00a0all very polite, but she didn&apos;t want to do it. Then suddenly we got the word: she\u00a0had changed her mind. She said it\u00a0had to be really quick and non-\u00adinstrusive, so I edited my kit down.\u00a0At\u00a0the time I travelled with a\u00a0Pentax 6x7, a beautiful camera for a\u00a0portrait, but I thought forget that: we&apos;ll shoot on a Nikon N5, and I bolted\u00a0on an 85mm 1.4 lens.

And\u00a0that&apos;s what she did. I\u00a0was just a fly on the wall. If it had been me controlling her, it wouldn&apos;t have worked. I kept shooting away, for about 15 minutes, and at a certain moment I slowed everything down. Normally you&apos;d expose for a very sharp picture, but for some reason I dragged the \u00adshutter down, and got this slightly liquidy feel. The emotion was really something.

I&apos;ll be working on my admin from 9am, but I&apos;ll be painting during the night \u2013 I&apos;m lucky if I get more than four hours sleep. I live and work from my studio in north London. I&apos;ve been here for four years; it&apos;s an old printing press conversion with a glass roof. It&apos;s like a\u00a0loft apartment \u2013 except for the fact that I&apos;m on the ground floor. My fridge is usually empty. I never have breakfast but I do drink about 20 cups of tea or coffee a day. I end up eating one meal a day. I never exercise, but then again, when I&apos;m painting, I&apos;m on my feet all day. I&apos;ve just finished my time as artist-in-residence at the County Hall Gallery after two and a half years. It was tremendous to be given the artistic freedom to exhibit what I wanted to. Most of my paintings are allegorical and my inspiration is all personal. Painting is a private relationship between me and the canvas, and the only time I can do that uninterrupted is during the night. There have been times when the creative juices are flowing that I really can&apos;t stop \u2013 once I stayed awake all weekend and produced a dozen paintings. I worked in banking for Merrill Lynch for 20 years. I travelled extensively and worked long hours. That routine of working until late has really stuck with me. I don&apos;t miss office life though. The BlackBerry habit from Merrill&apos;s hasn&apos;t changed \u2013 I&apos;m still always checking my emails and often in front of the computer. I&apos;ll liaise with galleries, and I&apos;m a patron of several art societies and charities so there are always emails to go through. I&apos;m heading to Antarctica for five days to paint; I&apos;ll literally be painting nine foot canvases standing on the snow in sub-zero conditions. The aim is to explore the creative limitations of the environment, something really raw in a wild, strange landscape. It&apos;ll be light 24 hours round the clock, which I&apos;m not used to at all, so I&apos;ll be sleeping even less. The snow we had in London made me realise I don&apos;t have enough of the appropriate clothing at all \u2013 I&apos;ve been doing a few practice runs of painting in extreme cold in a huge heavy duty refrigerator. The application of paint while wearing gloves is yet to be determined, but I&apos;ve been exploring the use of anti-freeze paint. I&apos;m divorced, and my ex-wife and teenage children live outside of London. My daughter and son sometimes come down on the weekends, although it&apos;s less now that they have their studies. When they are here, I don&apos;t paint \u2013 I never paint in front of anybody. I&apos;m probably not an easy person to live with. When I paint, I usually put trance music on in the background. I used to live in Tokyo and DJed with Paul van Dyke and Nick Warren who were just starting out then. I still have the mixes. I love to watch cricket while I paint too \u2013 it&apos;s usually on in the background. Maybe my love for cricket is part of my Pakistani roots, although I&apos;ve been here for most of my life. I don&apos;t really have a five-day working week set up; I don&apos;t really have a concept of a weekend. But I do try and take Sundays lightly, which means no evening appointments with gallery owners \u2013 I&apos;ll see my children or my parents, relax and chill out. Nasser Azam (azam.com) will be\u00a0travelling to Antarctica to complete a series of performance paintings from 18-27 February.

One wants to stop a minute, admire it, before going in, only to find that the effect is even greater inside: cool Corinthian trench marble, dark stained oak, and light everywhere \u2013 a seven-story atrium lined with glass-enclosed walkways dragging the blue sky in like a long drink of fresh water. Christopher Bailey bounds into a boardroom so white, so immaculate it almost hurts; it&apos;s a relief when we repair to his office. More light here, on the top floor, an arrangement of white orchids and pussywillows, elegant dark wood chairs, a glass meeting table and, quietly, from his desk, music by &quot;One Night Only \u2013 it&apos;s a band I love&quot;. In an industry often caricatured for its affected enthusiasms Bailey is striking for his lack of affectation, for enthusiasms not only manage to sound sincere, but carry with them an unironic freshness. Which is not, for a second, to be confused with naivete or weakness. Outside, sirens wail. They are, of course, standard background noise in this highly policed quarter of London, but today, not far away, Alexander McQueen, has been discovered dead in his flat, aged just 40. In some ways, Bailey and McQueen couldn&apos;t have more different public profiles, Burberry being all understated luxe, elegantly shot through with a certain thoughtful deshabille; McQueen gothic, provocative, an artist for the art&apos;s sake, but they are two of a very small handful of British designers \u2013 often, like Vivienne Westwood, highly self-conscious in their Britishness \u2013 who have truly made it on the global fashion stage. &quot;It&apos;s a huge, huge loss,&quot; says Bailey, later, when the news about McQueen breaks. They weren&apos;t close friends, but orbited in the same circles and what struck him, particularly, was that McQueen&apos;s character &quot;was just so warm. He was very gentle. And maybe that was contradictory to his work.&quot; Contradictory, too, to what might be expected of him. &quot;He was an extremely well-known designer and whenever I saw him his warmth and charm just broke down that barrier that sometimes comes with someone very well known \u2013 he always gave you a very big smile and a hug.&quot; Although he will say that McQueen &quot;built his brand on a very strong point of view, which is something to admire and respect \u2013 it&apos;s not easy to build a company and a brand with a very strong vision,&quot; Bailey is politely reluctant to make pronouncements about McQueen&apos;s place in the 20th century fashion firmament. &quot;People from the industry are talking about his talent, but the reality is the horrendous grief his family are going through \u2013 it&apos;s really a time to think about them.&quot; As for himself, &quot;It just makes you feel incredibly flat. He was young. Too young.&quot; Though seemingly obvious, these insights have a particular charge coming from Bailey; few are as well-placed to know exactly what it takes to build a business with integrity in such a competitive, fickle industry \u2013 or how fundamental family, private life and love, are to grounding it. And he is young, too \u2013 27 when he started at Burberry; Bailey is only 38 now, and in that time the company has grown from being worth \u00a31bn to \u00a32.6bn (with a turnover \u00a31.2bn) and been transformed from an over-exposed heritage label into a much-lauded fashion house with an unmistakable identity. When we first talked I noted that last November, they posted a loss in profit of 19% \u2013 &quot;But our business is on fire!&quot; he protested. Even before the financial storm hit they meant to concentrate on core business, he says, to relabel the Burberry lifestyle collection as Burberry Brit, a more casual line than Burberry London or the catwalk collection Burberry Prorsum. At the same time they were expanding, opening a standalone store in New York (and in the process acquiring only the sixth building in Manhattan with a company name emblazoned across the top), opening another in Tokyo, building and refurbishing stores all around the world: they now have 127 dedicated stores, 255 concessions and 96 franchises spread over 185 countries. Last September Burberry became a FTSE 100 company. Everything is controlled from this building in Westminster (which they moved into last year and is, incidentally, also Bailey&apos;s work \u2013 every table, chair, blind, window and decorative fillip; from the insistence on recycling to absolute tidiness every night). The clothes and accessories are designed here, in long rooms full of drawings and fabric samples; they are fitted here, on Skype, if need be; they are photographed here, in a dedicated studio; they are shown to buyers here; there is a small, fake shop window here, where displays are organised and then replicated in every Burberry outlet in the world. And Bailey oversees every detail \u2013 every bit of more than 50 collections a year, every catwalk show (the next at London fashion week in ten days&apos; time will be streamed live in 3D to New York, Paris, Dubai, Tokyo and Los Angeles) every bag, every knit, every child-sized trenchcoat (their children&apos;s line is in fact their fastest-growing), every photo, from the Emma Watson ad campaigns that dominate the main spaces to every snap in his current project, Art of the Trench. The public may be invited to send in their pictures of friends and relatives wearing trenchcoats, but nothing goes up on the site unless Bailey says it can. It is a rather awesome degree of responsibility \u2013 how does he cope? He follows his heart, he says, having learned from experience that if you don&apos;t, &quot;you can&apos;t stand up for [the work]&quot;. And he has, too, what sounds like an enviable combination of whole-heartedness and ruthlessness. &quot;Whatever I&apos;m doing I give it 100%. I&apos;m [also] very good at putting things in boxes. As soon as I finish something I&apos;m able to close the lid and jump on to the next thing and when I have to, come back and open it again. But that&apos;s something that I learned, I didn&apos;t know I could do that. It&apos;s this job that taught me that.&quot; It sounds, at the same time, like he engages in a kind of magical thinking, to make it manageable. &quot;I never wanted a job like this \u2013 let&apos;s be honest with myself. It wasn&apos;t something that I ever dreamed about. I was always very happy as a number two&quot; \u2013 Donna Karan whisked him away to New York when she saw his Royal College of Art portfolio in 1993; three years later he went to work for Tom Ford, at Gucci \u2013 &quot;I was always very comfortable in that role.&quot; Did you not feel frustrated? &quot;Not even slightly.&quot; Really? &quot;there&apos;s always frustrations, particularly if you have a strong point of view. Which I did, and I do \u2013 but, I think having a strong point of view and learning to work as a team is also saying, there has to be a boss. Somebody has to give the final sign-off.&quot; How does it feel now that you&apos;re the boss? A pause. &quot;I guess I still don&apos;t feel like the boss, even though I have to kind of \u2026 I can&apos;t acknowledge that I&apos;m the boss.&quot; And he escapes into a eulogy for Angela Ahrendts, his CEO and &quot;partner in crime&quot;. Bailey is from Halifax, in Yorkshire, the younger son of a joiner and a window dresser for Marks and Spencer. &quot;People didn&apos;t really move away from Halifax \u2013 everyone knew each other.&quot; Unlike McQueen, for example, who started making dresses for his sisters while still a child, &quot;I didn&apos;t even know that fashion really existed \u2013 that sounds really naive, but it just wasn&apos;t in my vocabulary. I loved design, and I still do \u2013 I love furniture design, I love architecture, I love fabrics, I love text, I love proportions. Fashion was almost the way that I got into design. &quot;You know what?&quot; He leans forward, intent. &quot;This is really bad, and I&apos;m going to tell my parents not to buy the Guardian because I can&apos;t have them read this, I remember, SO vividly \u2013 it&apos;s terrible I&apos;m telling this story, but I&apos;m going to anyway \u2013 I don&apos;t remember how old I was, but young, 10 or something \u2026 we went to a furniture shop to buy a new sofa. My mum and my dad and my sister were gung-ho about these sofas, and I was just like \u2013 bloody hell, they&apos;re awful! But I couldn&apos;t understand WHY I didn&apos;t like them. It wasn&apos;t sophisticated in any way \u2013 but it was the first time I remember being conscious of having an opinion, or a taste.&quot; He makes a real point of saying how close he still is to his family, and that &quot;my best friend is still my best friend from school \u2013 she&apos;s a nurse \u2026 it&apos;s odd, my life, in many respects, because I find myself in these very, very different circles. I&apos;m a homebody at heart. And I&apos;m quite shy. People don&apos;t think of me as shy, but actually I am.&quot; He often spends weekends in Yorkshire; a recent profile in the New Yorker describes how on Sunday evenings, &quot;before heading back to London, he will drive up to the moors, park, and sit for a solitary 20 minutes, watching the rain or hail, or whatever else the day has wrought, beat upon the land&quot;. He has a house there, near to his parents; he bought it when his partner of eight years, Geert Cloet, who had been brand director at Miu Miu, was diagnosed with brain cancer; it meant Cloet could be near Bailey&apos;s family when Bailey himself had to be away working. Cloet died in 2005, aged 36. Bailey would rather not talk about that period, except to say that it was incredibly painful for a long time, and that he never thought he could be happy again. And now? &quot;I met someone,&quot; he says, simply. &quot;And I fell in love.&quot; He once said that it was Cloet who held him to the ideal that &quot;you have to do what you love, and if you don&apos;t, then change it \u2026 it was never about power or money or fame. Everything has always been about \u2013 is it challenging, exciting, stimulating? And fun. Because as soon as that stops, you have nothing.&quot; His challenge, at Burberry, is greater, in many ways than the detail of his days, though it&apos;s the detail that makes it work: to achieve an idea of great consistency while at the same time appealing to myriad individuals who might actually shell out the money for it and believe it&apos;s their choice, and theirs alone. For example? &quot;The trenchcoat is the perfect example. A trenchcoat is so democratic. You can have a guy who works in the city, who maybe has his pinstripe suit, and his red socks and tie \u2013 you know, very formal, very sartorial \u2013 then you can have some young cool girl running around London wearing the same trenchcoat. You can have somebody who lives in the countryside, who goes into town in her Range Rover in it. You have aristocracy, you have pop stars, you have men, women, children \u2013 it&apos;s this one thing, but it&apos;s the attitude of the different people wearing it.&quot; But a Burberry trench doesn&apos;t come at a democratic price, does it? &quot;It depends. How much everybody can spend is very different. You know? And there is not one thing that is right for everybody. And nor should it be \u2013 I feel very strongly about it \u2013 this nonsense that everything should be for everybody \u2013 it&apos;s not.&quot; So it&apos;s theoretically democratic but actually exclusive? &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s exclusive. I think it&apos;s \u2026 I prefer to say it is aspirations. It&apos;s saying that actually, I might love that, but today I can&apos;t afford it \u2013 that&apos;s OK, too. I find that word exclusive \u2013 it suddenly says &quot;you&apos;re not good enough for us \u2013 it&apos;s a different thing.&quot; Burberry&apos;s much-vaunted British appeal is a similarly tricky concept. Of course, as Bailey puts it, &quot;Britishness is not about a red bus, a red postbox, and a bobby \u2013 these are such cliched things. It&apos;s an attitude. For me, it&apos;s about this constant clashing of the very formal with the rebellious, the innovation. We&apos;re all on this little island \u2013 and you&apos;ve got these two opposing fields. You&apos;ve got the people who think very big, hypothetically \u2013 artists, designers, creatives \u2013 we have the most creative nation, I believe, in the world. But then we also have this incredibly moralistic, &apos;we have to uphold society&apos; [idea]. When those two worlds collide \u2013 for me, that&apos;s what Britishness is about. But you can&apos;t put that into a box. It&apos;s not tangible.&quot; The thing about Burberry, however, is that these collisions are narrated in a calculatedly indifferent, &quot;Oh this old thing, I just found it in an old trunk the other day&quot; language that bespeaks a very particular (upper- or upper-middle-class, well-connected) Britishness \u2013 it&apos;s no accident, I feel, that Watson&apos;s compadres in the current ad campaign are her brother, Alex; George Craig of One Night Only, Douglas Hurd&apos;s nephew Max, and Matt the son of David Gilmour, of Pink Floyd. Hence the disconcerted reactions when the Burberry check was forcibly democratised, appearing on football hooligans, and head to toe, on Daniella Westbrook, and the nervousness at Burberry HQ about any mention of it. Of course it was mostly, as Bailey points out, a gleeful and rather nasty press campaign, revelling in snobbery \u2013 but that too is Britishness, and in an inverse sort of way, why Burberry sells. To Bailey&apos;s credit, he appears, personally, to rise above such fraught contradictions; to be calmly at home in his different worlds, able to talk about brand protection with an idealism that one would be forgiven for thinking distinctly un-British. &quot;You have to respect a brand. Listen \u2013 there are 6,000 people in this company. It is not just about the product \u2013 it&apos;s SO much bigger than that. It&apos;s a culture, there&apos;s a heritage, it&apos;s livelihoods, it&apos;s longevity. I mean, we&apos;ve been around for over 153 years \u2013 it still blows my mind. It&apos;s been through wars, economic disasters, through glorious times, it&apos;s ridden these incredible waves. So you do have to protect it and respect it and be proud of it. I mean, that&apos;s what drives me up the wall in the UK. Come on, guys \u2013 it&apos;s British-made, this is a tough economic moment, let&apos;s be positive about this. Instead of seeing everything as crap, let&apos;s say, &apos;OK, let&apos;s figure it out&apos;.&quot; There&apos;s a slightly embarrassed pause about his vociferousness, and then he adds, unnecessarily but rather sweetly, &quot;I&apos;m an optimist.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 13 and 15 February 2010. The original said that the company moved to Westminster last month. This has been corrected. The original said that Christopher Bailey oversees more than 60 collections a year; this figure from Burberry was later amended by the company."}, {"sentences": ["The resonance of the lyrics pales a little, perhaps, when being slur-belted by, say, a pleasant Edinburgh accounts reviser (comfortable slacks, those grey BHS shoes that look like Cornish pasties, thin-lipped angry wife back at the Aga, regretting choices), or a Tokyo hedge-fund manager (Hugo Boss needledick greedsuit, pointy shoes made from a rare narwhal, thin angry wife in someone else&apos;s bed)."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Desert Island Discs"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-14T00:06:43Z", "title": "Killing me not so softly with your song | Euan Ferguson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/14/euan-ferguson-karaoke-my-way", "article": "And now, the end is near. Apt enough words for the six Filipino karaoke singers for whom they formed the first line of the last song they would ever sing. I was wholly captivated by the news on Thursday that there have been at least half a dozen murders in the Philippines in recent years triggered by people singing &quot;My Way&quot; so badly in the country&apos;s many karaoke bars. The local media has apparently dubbed the slayings (because that&apos;s what media do; they dub, after someone has, um, slayed) the &quot;&apos;My Way&quot; killings&quot;. Well, you know me, and you know yourselves, and we&apos;re not normally at home to Mr Gratuitous Violence, but I can at least begin to understand some of this, in the diametric opposite of the way I truly can never comprehend: the likes of scart leads; why I&apos;m always in the wrong; Formula 1; Yorkshire chippiness; Wednesday afternoons; continuing tolerance for scallops, Microsoft, Dubai, royalty or Alan Yentob; or why the producers of the film The NeverEnding Story (running time 102 minutes) were never done under the Trade Descriptions Act. But violence offered against perpetrators of bad music? Yes, I can begin to understand. According to the New York Times this week, many karaoke bars in the Philippines have removed &quot;My Way&quot; from their lists to avoid further violence, and I can see why. Partly, it&apos;s the song. The sainted Clive James, writing as TV critic for this paper an aeon or two ago \u2013 or, as anyone who currently wants to be offered some sudden karaoke-style violence might infuriatingly prefer to refer to it, &quot;back in the day&quot;, as if we were a nation of deathbed mafia dons, grizzled of chin and drizzled in sepia, rather a nation of, essentially, twits \u2013 Mr James once rightly pointed out, writing about Sid Vicious, that he was possibly the only person truly entitled to sing those lyrics. He had indeed done it his way, unto death. The resonance of the lyrics pales a little, perhaps, when being slur-belted by, say, a pleasant Edinburgh accounts reviser (comfortable slacks, those grey BHS shoes that look like Cornish pasties, thin-lipped angry wife back at the Aga, regretting choices), or a Tokyo hedge-fund manager (Hugo Boss needledick greedsuit, pointy shoes made from a rare narwhal, thin angry wife in someone else&apos;s bed). &quot;The record shows/I took the blows\u2026 I&apos;ve lived/A life that&apos;s full/I&apos;ve travelled each and every highway\u2026 But through it all/when there was doubt/I ate it up and spit it out/I faced it all/And I stood tall/And did it\u2026&quot; the way everybody else did it. So: the contrast between maverick dreams and bathetic reality can hurt, and can hurt the listener, and gothically -awful renderings can seriously hurt, to the extent that, as we see, at least six are now dead. And I can, almost, see why. But is it right? Can music justify murder? I am far less Nazi about it all, now. I used to bore friends in bars by getting them to list the CDs which, if they found them in a girl&apos;s flat, would result in the (courteous, thoughtful, but still early) ordering of a taxi. Then, of course, I met someone who possessed Simply Red and Dire Straits and liked to listen to Aled Jones on Radio 2 on a Sunday morning, but I had fallen in love, so blitzed my prejudices. And I was immensely impressed and heartened by David Mitchell&apos;s recent admission in the Observer that he owned only two (two, two, count them, two) CDs: Phil Collins and Susan Boyle. What guts. What self-confidence. What a dilemma, were you to be in the car with him on a long journey and the music playing: half of you fascinated by his humour and honour and life-affirming zesty intelligence, half of you trying to twitch the steering-wheel into oncoming traffic. Still. There are. Still. Some crimes against music. I like to think that there&apos;s a kind of parallel-world Dante&apos;s Desert Island Discs, wherein you had to listen to the eight songs that would, authentically, drive you to instant bloodied machete violence, were you to be stuck in a room close to the person forcing them at you and close to also, of course, a machete. Oddly, as much thought has gone into this as goes into the times I dream of the time I&apos;m on the real DID. It&apos;ll change, next week, but at the time of writing, and in no particular order, we would have to have: \u25a0 Mungo Jerry: &quot;In the Summertime&quot;. \u25a0 Eurythmics: &quot;Thorn in my Side&quot;.

Now think of these two lazy efforts. Hum the underline. Now hum the melody, the singy bit. They are both exactly the same. How damned difficult was that to write?) \u25a0 &quot;Summertime&quot;. Not wholly its fault but, still, yawn, the &quot;My Way&quot; of the jazz age, and anyone who thinks it (or anything else really) &quot;speaks personally&quot; to them quite deserves what&apos;s coming. \u25a0 The entire Lloyd Webber canon of vapidity. \u25a0 Cliff Richard: &quot;Bachelor Boy&quot;.

A few weeks ago, a giant bluefin tuna achieved a price of 16.3m yen \u2013 about \u00a3111,000 \u2013 at auction in Tokyo. The rich, buttery taste of the tuna&apos;s flesh made the 513lb fish irresistible for one group of restaurateurs. The bluefin&apos;s fillets ended up on hundreds of sushi platters across Tokyo within hours of the sale. But deals such as these may soon become a thing of the past. Scientists, politicians and wildlife groups are pressing for trade in the bluefin tuna to be restricted at the forthcoming meeting of Cites, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, in Doha, Qatar. In particular, they want the Atlantic bluefin, the species that is suffering most from overfishing, to be given appendix-1 status by Cites when it convenes next month. The proposal, put forward by Monaco, would end trade in the tuna between European fishing fleets and Japan, the world&apos;s main purchaser of the fish. Not surprisingly, Japan is expected to oppose the ban, the bluefin being a prime ingredient for sushi. &quot;Stocks of bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic have dropped by 82% since 1978, while those in the eastern Atlantic have dropped by 80%,&quot; said Heather Sohl, of the WWF. &quot;We are looking at a species that is going to be fished into extinction unless we take urgent measures to save it.&quot; The bluefin tuna can grow up to 14ft in length, weigh more than 1,000lb (450kg) and live for more than 30 years. It can swim at up to 40mph (65km/h), can dive to depths of half a mile and is one of the oceans&apos; great travellers, swimming from the tropics to the Arctic. However, it has become an increasingly popular target for trawler fleets from France, Spain and Italy, who have found a lucrative market in Japan. &quot;Moving the bluefin to appendix 1 of the convention would not ban the catching of them, but it would prevent European fishing fleets selling them to Japan,&quot; said Sohl. &quot;That would be hugely effective.&quot; Experts also warn that the banning of trade would not end the sale of tuna in restaurants and stores. Of the other species of tuna, including yellowfin, skipjack, bigeye and albacore, the skipjack is the only one not suffering from serious population decline linked to overfishing. The problem, add scientists, is that a ban on trade in the bluefin could lead to increased fishing of the other species. In addition, campaigners say the overfishing of tuna poses other risks. The collapse of bluefin numbers in the Mediterranean threatens to trigger disruptions throughout the food chain. Squid numbers could rise in the absence of their tuna predators, which could adversely affect the sardine population. It is estimated that about one million bluefins were caught last year, while the total population is thought to be about 3.75m. &quot;That greatly exceeds the power of the species to replace its numbers,&quot; said Sohl."}, {"sentences": ["Their interrogators likened them to members of Aum Supreme Truth, the doomsday cult that carried out the fatal gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995.", "&quot;They have taken a stand in the public interest,&quot; Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace&apos;s executive director, told reporters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Greenpeace", "Whaling", "Environment", "World news", "Activism", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-14T14:11:00Z", "title": "Anti-whaling activists face trial in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/14/sato-suzuki-trial-japan-whaling", "article": "Two Greenpeace activists who were arrested after attempting to expose embezzlement in Japan&apos;s whaling fleet will go on trial tomorrow in a case campaigners hope will spark a domestic backlash against the heavily-subsidised industry. Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki were detained in June 2008, two months after intercepting a consignment of whale meat they claimed had been stolen by a member of the crew on the Nisshin Maru, the Japanese Antarctic whaling fleet&apos;s mother ship. The activists \u2013 who claimed the meat was destined for the black market \u2013 face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of theft and trespass. They said the package, retrieved from a warehouse in Aomori, northern Japan, was marked &quot;cardboard&quot; but contained 23kg of salted whale meat worth around 350,000 yen (\u00a32,477). Greenpeace said it had evidence to prove that at least 23 of the ship&apos;s crew smuggled more than 90 boxes of salted whale, disguised as personal baggage, and accused them of defrauding the Japanese taxpayer with the approval of Kyodo Senpaku, which operates the whaling fleet. Kyodo Senpaku insisted the packages were a &quot;bonus&quot; for crew members who had spent several months in the inhospitable waters of the southern ocean. Prosecutors, who initially agreed to pursue the embezzlement claims, dropped the investigation on the day Sato and Suzuki were arrested in early-morning raids on their homes. According to Greenpeace,, Japanese taxpayers contribute an estimated 500m yen to the &quot;scientific&quot; whale hunts each year. Earlier this month, a UN human rights body condemned the detention of Sato and Suzuki and warned Japan that it had breached several articles of the UN declaration of human rights. During their 26 days in custody, 23 of which saw them held without charge, the suspects were denied access to lawyers, strapped to chairs and interrogated for up to 12 hours a day. Their interrogators likened them to members of Aum Supreme Truth, the doomsday cult that carried out the fatal gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995. Suzuki protested by going on hunger strike for nine days and refusing to talk to investigators for four more. &quot;They have taken a stand in the public interest,&quot; Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace&apos;s executive director, told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;It has come at a personal and professional cost. To be in detention day after day, tied down, with no lawyer, is a terrifying thing for anyone to endure. &quot;To have that happen to them when all they were trying to do was draw attention to the abuse of public funds is beyond scary. It is wrong.&quot; Naidoo urged the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to reopen the investigation into alleged embezzlement by the whaling crew and to ensure Sato and Suzuki were given a fair trial. &quot;The eyes of the world are on Japan,&quot; he added. Since the arrests, more than 250,000 people have signed a petition demanding justice for 32-year-old Sato and Suzuki, 42. Anti-whaling campaigners have accused the authorities of staging a politically motivated trial, designed to depict peaceful activists as &quot;terrorists&quot;, with the eventual aim of closing down Greenpeace&apos;s office in Japan. In an interview with the Guardian after he was released on bail, Suzuki remained unrepentant. &quot;Since my arrest, I have not lied once about what I did,&quot; he said. &quot;But the whalers have had to make up one story after another. Their lies will come back to haunt them.&quot; Two years ago, Greenpeace abandoned its pursuit of the whaling fleet to focus on building an anti-whaling coalition among the Japanese people.

GDP grew at 1.1% between September and December, which corresponds to a yearly rate of 4.6%, the government said. The growth proved enough to stave off a challenge from China, due largely to government measures to stimulate Japanese spending on fuel-efficient cars and &quot;green&quot; consumer goods. But the growth data was tempered by continued anxiety over falling consumer prices and weak demand. The GDP deflator, the broadest measure of prices, fell 3% from a year earlier, its biggest drop since records began in 1955. The government, meanwhile, faces the tricky task of reining in huge public debt and honouring spending commitments in its record \u00a592trn (\u00a3651bn) budget plans. In a sign of the impact of massive stimulus packages introduced last year, domestic demand helped boost GDP for the first time in seven quarters. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 60% of the economy, rose 0.7% from the previous quarter. The figures also pointed to growing confidence among firms, with corporate investment in plants and equipment rising by 1%, its first increase since the first quarter of 2008. The economy is showing signs of &quot;brightness&quot;, the finance minister, Naoto Kan, told reporters, adding that he believed the risk of a double-dip recession was receding. But he warned: &quot;Downside risks, such as unemployment and the situation of overseas economies, still exist. We can&apos;t be optimistic.&quot; Analysts predict that the impact of government stimulus measures will lessen in the coming months. &quot;Japan&apos;s economy is expected to slow down in the first half of 2010 as the effects of the stimulus measures taken by the previous government will peter out, but the economy will likely return to a recovery trend in the latter half of this year,&quot; said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. Few believe any new initiatives will come from a Bank of Japan policy meeting this week. The central bank has already reduced interest rates to near zero and pumped billions of yen into the banking system in an effort to lift the economy. Despite the robust performance of the last quarter, 2009 was a miserable year for the Japanese economy. GDP fell a record 5% as falling wages and rising job insecurity blunted domestic consumption. Japan&apos;s fledgling recovery since it emerged from recession in mid-2009 is largely down to demand in China and other parts of Asia, where government stimulus measures helped lift Japan&apos;s exports by 5% in the three months to December.

Then, in 1966, the government declared it a whites-only area and began a forced eviction, \u00adultimately driving out 60,000 black, mixed-race and Indian people. District Six became a symbol of the apartheid era \u2013 and of the struggle to defeat it. Many weapons were used in that struggle. One was the pen of Athol \u00adFugard, who savaged apartheid in dramas such as The Island and Sizwe Banzi is Dead. Fugard, once described by Time as &quot;the greatest active playwright in the English-speaking world&quot;, has now been given an unusual honour: a new theatre has been named after him \u2013 and it&apos;s situated in District Six. The Fugard is home to an all-black company, Isango Portobello. The inaugural season kicked off last week, in the presence of Fugard, with two Euro-African fusions already known to London audiences: the Olivier award-winning The Magic Flute (Impempe Yomlingo), and The Mysteries (Yiimimangaliso). But next month will see the world \u00adpremiere of a work by Fugard, The Train Driver, which he says &quot;may be the most important one I&apos;ve ever written&quot;. Fugard, now 77 and living in California, will direct the play himself. But now that apartheid is over, what does he have to say? &quot;In the old South Africa, I tried to tell stories about desperate \u00adfellow South Africans,&quot; he says. &quot;There are still enough of them around today to keep me busy. The euphoria of those early days of freedom has worn off. There are bitter disappointments now: the government&apos;s handling of the Zimbabwe crisis; the tragic death of hundreds of thousands of South Africans because of an unbelievably stupid policy on Aids; corruption in high places . . . &quot; Redeveloped from two warehouses and a church at a cost of 18m rand (\u00a31.5m), the theatre looks, from the front, like a cramped gothic-style church. But step into the foyer and it becomes airy and spacious \u2013 a vision of red bricks, steel supports and restored antique wood. This is the old church hall, which, with its high ceilings and stained glass windows, also makes for a magnificent rehearsal space. At the helm of the theatre is a \u00adYorkshireman. A decade ago, Mark Dornford-May, from Goole in the East Riding, was running Wilton&apos;s Music Hall in London. He came out to South Africa for an eight-week stint and never left. &quot;I love South Africa,&quot; the 54-year-old artistic \u00addirector explains. &quot;I love its \u00addemocracy, its lack of pomposity. It&apos;s a fantastic country, a brilliant place to work. There&apos;s none of that bloody \u00adnonsense you get in British theatre. You can be much more dangerous \u2013 and your \u00adimpact can be much greater than ever it could be in London.&quot; He describes Fugard as South Africa&apos;s greatest theatre practitioner. &quot;Athol was working with mixed-race groups in\u00a01958. The work that was achieved then, like The Island, is remarkable, and he&apos;s maintained a steady output of\u00a0extraordinary plays. For me, it&apos;s hugely important to be here. District Six is one of apartheid&apos;s biggest \u00admonuments. We feel that we&apos;re moving back into the area.&quot; Ten years ago, Dornford-May began building a theatre company drawn largely from the township of \u00adKhayelitsha, on the outskirts of Cape Town. The result was Isango Portobello, now a 35-strong group that has toured internationally to great acclaim with musical productions that mix English, Xhosa, Zulu and Afrikaans. How has being in the troupe changed their lives? &quot;On a simple level,&quot; says Dornford-May, &quot;people are buying cars. On a more complex level, most people who join the company have never travelled \u00adinternationally, stayed in a hotel or been to a restaurant. The fact they have now got passports and been to Paris, London and Tokyo gives them a different level of confidence and sense of dignity. They go to restaurants, whereas before they would have been hesitant and thought it wasn&apos;t for them.&quot; Every production will have a \u00addistinct South African context. One forthcoming show is a musical \u00adadaptation of Robert Tressell&apos;s novel The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. &quot;Robert Noonan \u2013 pen name Tressell \u2013 was a radical Irishman who came here and fought against the British in the Anglo-Boer war,&quot; says Dornford-May. &quot;Once you know that, you see that in the book there is a lot about South \u00adAfrica, about the exploitation of one class by another.&quot; As we sit talking in the stalls of the cavernous auditorium, the singer and actor Pauline Malefane enters, looking for somewhere to rehearse. Malefane, who grew up in Khayelitsha, was a memorable African Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute. She is also Dornford-May&apos;s wife. He says their interracial marriage and mixed race children are a sign of how far the &quot;rainbow nation&quot; has come since Mandela&apos;s release. &quot;Twenty years down the line, I think the changes are bloody remarkable,&quot; says Dornford-May. &quot;If we&apos;re building a theatre in the middle of Cape Town, the country cannot be on the edge of imploding. Whatever else the theatre is, it&apos;s a place for intellectual pursuits. I&apos;m convinced we&apos;re on the right track.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I think there was some misunderstanding about my plans,&quot; Toyoda told reporters in Tokyo, in his third media briefing in 12 days."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Japan", "Business", "Motoring", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-17T12:41:00Z", "title": "Toyota to fit brake-override system in all future models", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/17/toyota-brake-override-system-corolla", "article": "Toyota is to install a brake-override system in all its future models after the embattled carmaker vowed to improve quality \u00adcontrol amid the global recall of millions of defective vehicles. The recall crisis also threatened to broaden after the firm said it was looking into possible power-steering problems with the Corolla, the world&apos;s best-selling car, and that it was considering a recall. The Japanese company said the nature and cause of the problem was unclear, but it had received dozens of complaints from owners in the US relating to Corollas manufactured in the past 12 months. The cars have not been sold in the UK since 2007. &quot;If this is a defect, we will start recalls,&quot; said Shinichi Sasaki, who oversees quality at Toyota. &quot;We are in the process of investigating, but the number of complaints is less than 100.&quot; It is thought the problem was possibly owing to a switch from a hydraulic steering system to an electric one, he added. The override system announced today is one of several new measures aimed at reassuring Toyota owners in the wake of the global recall of 8.5m cars, including more than 187,000 in the UK, over acceleration and braking problems. The new mechanism will allow the brakes to kick in first when drivers inadvertently depress the brake pedal at the same time as the accelerator. The recall, which has now spread to 437,000 of its market-leading hybrid car, the Prius, has tarnished the company&apos;s once vaunted reputation for quality. Toyota took out full-page adverts in major Japanese newspapers today to apologise for the recall crisis. &quot;We apologise from the bottom of our hearts for the great inconvenience and worries that we have caused you all,&quot; the ads said. Toyota said it expected to complete 70% to 80% of its Prius repairs in Japan by the end of the month. The company&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda, who was appointed last summer after the carmaker suffered its first annual loss, has been broadly criticised for his handling of the recall, which has caused his firm at least $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) in extra costs. He acknowledged today for the first time that the firm had expanded too fast in its quest to increase profits and overtake General Motors as the world&apos;s biggest carmaker, a feat it achieved two years ago. &quot;The basic rule of the Toyota production system is to only build as many cars as there is demand for,&quot; he said. &quot;And we broke that rule.&quot; Toyoda also put an end to speculation over whether he would appear before a US congressional committee next Wednesday in an attempt to salvage his firm&apos;s reputation in its most important market. Instead, other executives, including Toyota&apos;s North America head, Yoshimi Inaba, will testify. &quot;I think there was some misunderstanding about my plans,&quot; Toyoda told reporters in Tokyo, in his third media briefing in 12 days. &quot;I have full confidence in the management of Toyota Motor North America, led by Mr Inaba, and I believe he is the best placed to testify. I am sure they are well equipped to well respond to the questions and concerns of congressmen.&quot; The firm said it would address safety concerns with the appointment of a chief quality officer, under Toyoda&apos;s direct control, in each of its sale regions. A new committee will take the company&apos;s quality-improvement activities &quot;on to a new and higher plane&quot;, Toyota said in a statement, adding that the first meeting would be on 30 March. The company said it had &quot;taken to heart&quot; customer feedback from around the world and remained committed to &quot;unwavering quality in products and services and to the spirit of &apos;customer first&apos;&quot;. The improvements came amid intensifying demands by US authorities for more information about Toyota&apos;s handling of the recalls and the announcement that two of its factories in America would close for at least 11 days to adjust to a slowdown in sales caused by the crisis. The US transport department has demanded that Toyota hand over documents related to the recalls so that it can establish how long the firm was aware of the acceleration problem before it started recalling defective vehicles. Toyoda denied his company had attempted to cover up the safety defects. &quot;We are not covering up anything, and we are not running away from anything,&quot; he said. Toyota&apos;s US unit said that it &quot;takes its responsibility to advance vehicle safety seriously and to alert government officials of any safety issue in a timely manner. &quot;We are reviewing the [US national highway traffic safety administration&apos;s] request and will co-operate to provide all the information they have requested.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;We understand that the current Australian government in its manifesto opposes whaling for research purposes,&quot; Okada told reporters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Australia news", "Japan", "World news", "Environment", "Whaling", "Activism", "Whales", "Asia Pacific", "Kevin Rudd", "Australian politics", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-19T14:21:03Z", "title": "Australia threatens legal action over Japanese whaling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/19/australia-japan-whaling-lawsuit-theat", "article": "Australia today warned Japan to end its &quot;scientific&quot; whale hunts in the Antarctic by November or face international legal action, in a move that threatens to sour relations between the Asia-Pacific allies. The Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, has threatened legal action before in an attempt to end the slaughter every winter of 1,000 whales in the Southern Ocean. His latest warning comes on the eve of an official visit by the Japanese foreign minister, Katsuya Okada, for talks that were supposed to focus on the countries&apos; increasing trade and military ties. Rudd said he would prefer to reduce Japan&apos;s whaling activities &quot;to zero&quot; through negotiation. &quot;But if that fails \u2013 and I&apos;m saying this very bluntly and very clearly \u2013 then we will initiate that court action before the commencement of the whaling season in November 2010,&quot; he told Network Seven TV. Rudd, who faces an election this year, added: &quot;That is a direct honouring of the commitment I gave to the Australian people. And that is the right way to handle it with a friend and partner, Japan, which is also a very significant, long-standing economic partner as well. &quot;That&apos;s the bottom line and we&apos;re very clear with the Japanese that&apos;s what we intend to do.&quot; Okada, who is to hold talks with his counterpart, Stephen Smith, over the weekend, suggested Rudd&apos;s move was little more than an attempt at early electioneering. &quot;We understand that the current Australian government in its manifesto opposes whaling for research purposes,&quot; Okada told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;With that in mind, we would like to have a calm and substantial discussion.&quot; Australia says it has collected enough video and photographic evidence to launch legal action against Japan at the international court of justice in The Hague or the international tribunal for the law of the sea in Hamburg. The Rudd administration is a vocal critic of Japan&apos;s annual hunts, which it says take place in international waters that include an Australian maritime rescue zone that Canberra regards as a whale sanctuary. Japan, however, does not recognise those claims, and says its right to conduct &quot;lethal research&quot; in the area is protected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Japan&apos;s whaling fleet has been involved in several skirmishes with activists during the current season. On Monday Pete Bethune, a member of the Sea Shepherd conservation group, jumped aboard the fleet&apos;s security vessel, the Shonan Maru No 2, to &quot;arrest&quot; the captain over the sinking of a protest boat last month. Bethune, the former skipper of the Ady Gil, which was ripped in half in a collision with the Shonan Maru No 2 in early January, is being detained aboard the ship and could face charges of trespass and assault when he arrives in Japan in about a month&apos;s time. Masayuki Komatsu, a former delegate to the IWC, said he was &quot;very confident&quot; that Japan would win any legal confrontation. But maritime law experts believe Australia has a strong case for arguing that Japan is abusing its right to conduct whaling for scientific research. Don Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, has said that either court would probably grant an immediate injunction ordering Japan to stop whaling, pending a negotiated settlement."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I went to see it in Tokyo once, dressed as Riff-Raff."], "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Guardian Careers", "Beer"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-20T00:00:02Z", "title": "The brewer: On the hop", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/feb/20/working-life-brewer", "article": "From the moment I first poke my head around Robert Wicks&apos;s office door, I can tell he has something to hide. &quot;You haven&apos;t brought a photographer, have you?&quot; he says, furtively raising a hand to his chin. I reassure him I&apos;m alone. He lowers his guard to reveal a grey-flecked beard \u2013 not the knotty kind one might associate with a stereotypical real ale drinker but a trim goatee, cultivated for his forthcoming turn as the comic jailer Frosch in a local production of the opera Die Fledermaus.\u00ad &quot;He&apos;s meant to be a drunk but I&apos;ve been asked to play it straight,&quot; says the brewer a little forlornly. Wicks is the founder and managing director of Westerham brewery in Kent, opened from scratch in a converted dairy barn in 2004. While it&apos;s a relatively new enterprise, it feels firmly linked to the proud beer-making heritage of the region, particularly the old Black Eagle brewery that existed down the road until 1965. Among the beer pump fronts tacked to his office door is one for Audit Ale, a former Black Eagle brew made to an original 1938 recipe and strength. &quot;But we only brew it for special occasions,&quot; he cautions, as though letting me in on a state secret. &quot;It&apos;s got a massive amount of hops in it.&quot; Then there is a new range of beers, each brewed with just one variety of Kentish hops. &quot;So you&apos;re talking about beer as you might do wine,&quot; he says. Without wanting to trivialise the comparison, I can&apos;t help thinking the juicy, green hops pictured on each pump front look like brussels\u00ad sprouts. &quot;Why does everyone say that?&quot; he sighs. It&apos;s hard not to be impressed by the green ethic at the heart of the brewery. Some 90% of Wicks&apos;s hops already come from Kent, all his barley is grown locally and, by next year, the water supply will come entirely from groundwater sourced from the nearby Greensand Ridge. &quot;We just want to bring everything back to local,&quot; he explains, beneath the din of pumps and refrigeration fans. &quot;Zero carbon impact.&quot; And local it certainly feels: a visit to Westerham means venturing out through the narrow Kent lanes beyond the M25, down a heavily potholed side road riddled with ice-encrusted puddles and past a field of indolent-looking sheep. Having trudged the last few yards to the brewery through a muddy building site in the freezing rain, I reckon just getting there is an achievement meriting liquid reward \u2013 but surely there&apos;ll be plenty of time for that. And I haven&apos;t factored in the surprisingly acrid whiff of a working brewery \u2013 more redolent of a dank cellar\u00ad than a lounge bar \u2013 which temporarily dampens my thirst. This is not the case in the small granary filled with malted barley where the scent is soporific, like plunging one&apos;s head into a giant pot of Horlicks. It&apos;s a wonder anyone manages to stay awake in here at all. &quot;It&apos;s all traditional old-fashioned floor maltings, they actually rake it by hand,&quot; Wicks explains, referring to the process by which barley is &quot;chitted&quot; or part-germinated\u00ad on a stone floor to encourage enzymes\u00ad that convert the starch into sugar. The grain is then roasted to produce pale, amber, crystal or chocolate malt for different\u00ad brews. &quot;The maltings we use was once owned by a multinational brewer, when they actually cared about what went into their product,&quot; he says a little bitterly. I follow him back into the main barn. A white pipe passes overhead from the malt store, leading into the top of a huge vat known in brewing parlance as a mash tun. The chambers and ductwork remind me a little of Willy Wonka&apos;s chocolate factory: I half-expect to see a real ale drinker sucked along a glass pipe and ejected into a nearby pond full of bitter. And curiously, although Wicks is a picture of businesslike sobriety with his short-cropped hair, check shirt and navy fleece, there is something Wonka-like about his boyish enthusiasm for the science of brewing and the life-enhancing effects of his produce. It is just as well because brewing beer, even on a relatively small scale such as Westerham&apos;s, is a complicated business requiring a great deal of chemical know-how. First, malted barley is mixed with hot water at 66C in the mash tun, allowing the enzymes to convert the starch to sugar. It is, apparently, all about getting a balance between\u00ad short-chain sugars that are easily converted into alcohol and longer-chain sugars that give mouth to the beer. Eventually, a viscous, sugary substance known as wort is skimmed off, filtered and boiled in a giant vessel called a &quot;copper&quot;. Then hops are added to form a kind of lumpy porridge, before\u00ad more water is sprayed on to rinse off some of the wort. This is done until about 2,000 litres, or 3,750 pints, of wort is gathered. It is then boiled with the hops to release bitterness and aroma, cooled again to about 20C and pumped into a brew fermenting tank, where the yeast is added. Here it will sit for a further two weeks before being transferred to casks \u2013 using a kind of supercharged petrol pump \u2013 and sent either to the bottling plant or directly to pub owners. Real ale \u2013 and its benefits \u2013 is a subject\u00ad close to Wicks&apos;s heart, and could even be good for it. &quot;We put a huge amount of hops in,&quot; he says proudly. &quot;One of the big brewers uses hop extracts that have none of the health-giving properties that hops have. Two to three units of alcohol per day, preferably\u00ad beer, will reduce your risk of heart disease.&quot; Wine, he points out, has been cleverly promoted as being healthy and he thinks brewers should push the point more. &quot;There&apos;s one website citing 142 references to the benefits of beer \u2026 cardiovascular disease, you name it. Hop is a herb closely related to cannabis. It contains alpha acids and other complex chemical compounds. Xanthohumol, for example, is one of the most potent anti-cancer agents.&quot; Wicks&apos;s passionate arguments for drinking real ale are not without good reason. With a general election looming, alcohol consumption has become a battleground for political parties keen to crack down on binge drinking and addiction. Remedies from price hikes to health warning-style labels on alcohol\u00ad bottles have been mooted. He is keen to stress the importance of moderation, but thinks a blanket approach to tackling alcohol abuse is misdirected, pointing out that less than half a percent of those being treated under Advice for Alcohol Problems&apos; programmes cite beer as their alcohol of abuse. &quot;There was a study showing that it was possible to buy 21 units of white cider, the maximum recommended weekly alcohol intake for an adult male, for under \u00a33 at a high street supermarket, paying about 15p per unit,&quot; he says. &quot;A bottle of my beer will have around two units of alcohol and will retail for around \u00a32. There&apos;s absolutely no comparison.&quot; The words and figures trip off his tongue slightly wearily, like someone long accustomed to defending his corner. For Wicks, Westerham brewery is the culmination of a lifelong passion, nurtured ever since fermenting his first batch of home brew at the age of eight. Dick Theakston, of the eponymous brewing family, was his godfather, which may go some way to explaining how he got hold of the kit at such a tender age. Perhaps scenting a career in brewing, he studied biochemistry at Oxford, where he was also a chorister, but was then sidetracked into a City job working for the stockbroker James Capel in Japan, America and London. But by the start of the noughties, problems of a bigger nature were becoming apparent to him. &quot;I could see the writing on the wall for the UK economy,&quot; he recalls, &quot;and I didn&apos;t like the way banking was becoming too involved in risk. So I applied for voluntary\u00ad redundancy and set this up.&quot; Wicks&apos;s guiding ethics of quality and local sustainability soon had Waitrose interested in stocking his beer, but even the big players must abide by the house rules. &quot;We will not sell to a supermarket unless the Ethical Company Organisation has accredited them,&quot; he insists, adding that his commitment to keeping his business local means Westerham beer can only be bought in stores within a 30-mile radius of the brewery, &quot;with the exception of one delivery to Dover, which is in Kent, after all&quot;. All this talk has whetted my palate for a drop of the brown stuff to send me on my way, but so far none has been forthcoming. As our time draws to a close, though, I wonder if the moment might finally be nigh. Sure enough, Wicks gets up and starts rummaging under the desk. &quot;There was something I wanted to give you before you go,&quot; he says. My eyes light up. A limited-edition souvenir bottle of Amber Ale for a cold winter&apos;s evening perhaps? Or a glass of the celebrated British Bulldog? He reaches out and hands me a business card. &quot;Call me anytime,&quot; he says. And with that he shakes my hand, hops across the muddy yard to his car and is off home for lunch before I can blink. CV Pay &quot;I don&apos;t pay myself a salary. I pay myself enough to get a stamp for national insurance and the rest is paid in dividends, so if the business doesn&apos;t make money, I don&apos;t get paid.&quot; Hours &quot;I&apos;m usually here by 7.30am and usually gone by 6pm. Then I manage the website from home \u2026 I&apos;m not putting in as many hours as before, but I regularly do 18 a day.&quot; Work-life balance &quot;As a policy we never work weekends, which is quite unusual. And I&apos;ve already booked myself nine weeks&apos; holiday for this year. We have a good team of people who are trained to know all the jobs in the brewery. That&apos;s the key.&quot; Best thing &quot;Having the flexibility to go home when I want to. And knowing I&apos;m the boss. I have control over my own destiny.&quot; Worst thing &quot;Not having a business partner to bounce ideas off. It can be lonely sometimes.&quot; Overtime For lunch, Robert usually has soup. &quot;I always go home. I only live seven minutes away. I used to bring sandwiches in but I got distracted.&quot; Robert&apos;s favourite film is The Rocky Horror Picture Show. &quot;I went to see it in Tokyo once, dressed as Riff-Raff. I&apos;ve styled my character of Frosch in Die Fledermaus slightly on him.&quot; To relax, Robert likes pheasant \u00adshooting, spending time with his family and, of course, singing. &quot;I&apos;m trying to fit the opera in to make sure the brewery doesn&apos;t completely dominate my life, but it is hard.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Eighteen months into that posting he married Patricia Fox, the daughter of one of the top brass in Tokyo, General Alonzo Fox, and was then appointed the general&apos;s aide-de-camp."], "tags": ["US news", "US politics", "US foreign policy", "Nato", "Falkland Islands", "Richard Nixon", "Watergate", "Americas"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-20T22:39:36Z", "title": "Alexander Haig obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/20/alexander-haig-obituary", "article": "The record books say that America has only ever had one unelected president in its history: congressman Gerald Ford. But General Alexander Haig, who has died aged 85, might well rate as a second. He never faced an electorate in his life, but he ran the White House almost in secret during the 15 months up to President Richard Nixon&apos;s resignation in August 1974 \u2013 taking over the impetus of a paralysed presidency in a manner that, however necessary under the circumstances, was barely constitutional. His second period at the highest levels of government came as secretary of state for the first year and a half of Ronald Reagan&apos;s presidency, from January 1981. Two themes preoccupied his brief tenure of the post: the ferocious bureaucratic battles that marked the Reagan administration and Haig&apos;s obdurate belief that communism was baying at the gates of the US. The Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Tip O&apos;Neill, said: &quot;Haig hadn&apos;t been secretary of state more than three weeks when he told me over breakfast that we ought to be cleaning out Nicaragua.&quot; Though he clearly did not understand it at the time, Haig&apos;s poorly hidden presidential ambitions were scuppered in those early days with his lamentable performance after the assassination attempt on Reagan in March 1981. Amid the inevitable confusion, the secretary of state burst into the White House press room to declare, when a reporter asked who was making the decisions: &quot;As of now, I&apos;m in control here in the White House.&quot; He later said that at the moment he was asked, he was technically right. But his apparent ignorance of the constitutional lines of power left an abiding impression of impetuousness and arrogance, all the greater for being caught on television. When he did run as a Republican hopeful for the White House in 1988, he rated just 3% in the opinion polls. While Haig&apos;s preoccupation with Central America had a greater long-term impact on America&apos;s internal and foreign politics, the greatest crisis he faced at the state department was the 1982 Falklands war, in which he tried unsuccessfully to act as mediator, flying to both London and Buenos Aires in the process. There was probably little chance of success, but his efforts were seriously undermined by undisguised support for the Argentinians from the US ambassador to the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick.     Though Haig flew to both London and Buenos Aires, his efforts to avert the Falklands war of 1982 proved fruitless. Photograph: Herbie Knott/Rex Features    In his memoirs, Haig commented: &quot;The war was caused by the original miscalculation on the part of the Argentinian military junta that a western democracy was too soft, too decadent to defend itself. This delusion on the part of undemocratic governments has been, and remains, the greatest danger to peace in this century.&quot; But his failure to avert the conflict, as he also conceded, &quot;ultimately cost me my job as secretary of state&quot;. His reign had been marked by ferocious battles, set out in loving detail in his memoirs, over bureaucratic turf with Reagan&apos;s kitchen cabinet. However, even Haig&apos;s well-honed skills were inadequate on this field, and he lost the fight in June 1982, when Reagan handed him a letter accepting his resignation. Since Haig had not actually offered it, he got to work on a draft. It was still not complete when he heard the president announce his departure on television. The pattern of Haig&apos;s life was set early. Born and brought up in Bala Cynwyd, one of the classier suburbs of Philadelphia, he was the middle child of a prosperous lawyer. But the family&apos;s comfortable life was shattered when his father died of cancer at the age of 38. Haig was then 10, and no more than average academically. He had gained a scholarship to a Roman Catholic preparatory school but did not do well. It was withdrawn after a couple of years and he transferred to a local high school. Though his mother was keen he should follow his father&apos;s calling, he was intent on a military career. Confirming his headteacher&apos;s view that &quot;Al is definitely not West Point material&quot;, his application to the US military academy failed. Then his uncle, who had been supporting Haig&apos;s mother and his siblings, intervened and in 1944 Haig scraped into the military college, situated to the north of New York, as an acknowledged political appointee. Under the stress of war, the four-year course for officers had been cut to three. The topics removed from the curriculum included English, social sciences and history, in all of which Haig later proved deficient. He graduated from West Point in 1947, finishing 214th out of 310. His classmates shrewdly assessed him as having &quot;strong convictions and even stronger ambitions&quot;. Haig opted for the cavalry and, after a year&apos;s training, was posted to the American occupation forces in Japan. Eighteen months into that posting he married Patricia Fox, the daughter of one of the top brass in Tokyo, General Alonzo Fox, and was then appointed the general&apos;s aide-de-camp. This brought the young lieutenant into the extraordinary military headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur, run more or less as an alternative court to Emperor Hirohito&apos;s. The experience of MacArthur&apos;s megalomania left an indelible impression on Haig. He commented later that: &quot;I was always interested in politics and started early in Japan, with a rather sophisticated view of how the military ran it.&quot; The outbreak of the Korean war also fixed his career-long belief that the communist enemy was always at the door. The initial North Korean assault in June 1950 was a disaster for US forces on the peninsula and brought home how ill-prepared MacArthur&apos;s command had become for its military role. Although Haig&apos;s unit was rushed to Korea and suffered heavy casualties, he did not go with it: instead, he was sent to accompany his father-in-law to Taiwan, on a liaison mission to Chiang Kai-shek. When he was eventually assigned to the battle zone, it was as a military assistant on the headquarters staff of an old friend of his father-in-law&apos;s, General Edward Almond. MacArthur&apos;s selection of Almond as commander of US troops preparing to land in force behind the enemy&apos;s rear was later described as &quot;an act of military nepotism&quot;. Haig&apos;s role in the highly successful Inchon landings remained obscure, but the ensuing campaign led to the first of many controversial episodes in his military advance. During the battle for Seoul, Haig was awarded a Bronze Star for bravery during a crossing of the Han River. The official citation referred to his outstanding heroism. However, the later official history of the crossing said there had been &quot;no enemy resistance&quot; and that the North Korean positions were &quot;lightly manned&quot;. Almond had recommended the decoration for his assistant and later awarded him two further Silver Stars for flying over enemy positions. Haig left Korea as a captain in 1951, suffering from hepatitis. In 1953 he was appointed to the staff of West Point as a disciplinary officer, remembered for his obsession with spit and polish, and was then assigned to a tank battalion with the American forces in Europe. He gained a routine promotion to major and, redeployed to the European Command headquarters in Germany, had his first experience of diplomacy. Congress had been grumbling about the cost of maintaining the US presence in Germany, and Haig took part in the 18-month negotiations to persuade the West Germans to shoulder more of the burden. This brought him another medal for &quot;remarkable foresight, ingenuity, and mature judgment&quot;. It also seemed to increase his taste for the administrative and political aspects of military life. In 1959 he enrolled on a military staff course and then went on to a further course at Georgetown University in Washington, where American diplomats trained. The thesis for his Georgetown master&apos;s degree showed how his ambitions were developing. It spoke of the need for a new breed of military professional occupying a prominent seat among presidential advisers. It also gave an early glimpse of his tormented prose, with incomprehensible references to &quot;interpretive vagaries&quot; and &quot;a permeating nexus&quot;. Armed with these new qualifications, Haig was assigned to a staff position at the Pentagon, where his father-in-law had become deputy to the assistant secretary for international affairs. Though Haig&apos;s own job was in military planning, his presence at the defence department, allied to his family connections, pitched him into the tangled world of Washington&apos;s cold-war politics. The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 erupted soon after his appointment, and he later claimed that it disillusioned him with the way the doctrine of flexible response was applied. &quot;You never applied one iota of force,&quot; he commented. &quot;I was against this. It provided an incentive to the other side to up the ante.&quot; The key moment in Haig&apos;s career came in 1963 when he was picked to act as military assistant to Joe Califano, a lawyer in the army secretary&apos;s office. The army secretary was Cyrus Vance, and this period established personal and political connections from which Haig benefited for the rest of his public life. He seemed to sense that it was time to make his mark. When Vance was promoted to become deputy to the defence secretary, Robert McNamara, Califano and Haig floated up with him. Though Haig still held a relatively low-level job, he acquired considerable access both to information and to Washington&apos;s movers and shakers. But the growing US involvement in the Vietnam war made it essential that any ambitious officer become directly involved in the fighting. In 1966 Haig was made operations planning officer for the First Infantry Division, stationed near Saigon and, in a war that saw 1,273,987 medals awarded to American troops, gained a Distinguished Flying Cross within a month of his arrival. Lightly wounded in the eye when a prisoner blew himself up, Haig was involved in a number of battles in which he gained two more DFCs and 17 Air Medals. Once again, there was a conflict between some of the citations and later official accounts of the incidents. However, by the time he returned to America with the rank of colonel, in 1967, he was firmly established as a Vietnam hero. He went back to West Point to revive his reputation as a military martinet until in 1969, with Nixon the incoming president, he was recruited by the national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, to the National Security Council, recommended, as Kissinger noted in his memoirs, by Califano and McNamara. Haig, Kissinger continued, &quot;soon became indispensable ... By the end of the year [1970] I had made him formally my deputy. Over the course of Nixon&apos;s first term he acted as my partner, strong in crises, decisive in judgment, skilful in bureaucratic infighting ... [But] I could not help noticing that Haig was implacable in squeezing to the sidelines potential competitors for my attention&quot;. Among the crises in which Haig played a leading role was America&apos;s covert effort to overthrow the regime of Salvador Allende in Chile (1970-73). Haig was also cementing his relationship with Nixon and was party to one of the early manifestations of the White House&apos;s growing paranoia. In response to a number of leaks, the phones of 17 officials and journalists were tapped by the FBI. Haig helped select the candidates and, apparently aware of the doubtful legality of the operation, ordered that there should be no written record. He was also closely involved in the aftermath of the massive leak in 1971 of the secret history of the Vietnam war, the Pentagon Papers, when the White House moved illegally against the man responsible, Daniel Ellsberg. This loyalty was rewarded by promotion to major-general in 1972 and, six months later, by appointment as vice-chief of staff of the army, raising him to full general and allowing him to leapfrog 240 more senior officers. He did not, however, remain long at the Pentagon. As the revelations of the Watergate scandal began to accumulate, after the burglary of the Democratic party headquarters in Washington on 17 June 1972, Nixon was forced to sack many of the senior staff involved. On 30 April 1973, it was the turn of the White House chief of staff, HR Haldeman. The search for a successor was urgent. With the president obsessed with the scandal, the process of government was almost at a standstill. Haldeman, who had become friendly with Haig during the skirmishing over the Pentagon Papers, recommended him as an interim chief of staff, a suggestion bitterly opposed by Haig&apos;s recent boss, Kissinger. However, Kissinger could not offer an alternative, and Haig&apos;s appointment was duly announced on 4 May, to what turned out to be the most significant job of his life. Since Haig never gave a substantive account of the 15 months he spent with Nixon, it is unclear if he arrived with a definite strategy in mind. The crisis threatened to pitch the three arms of government \u2013 the presidency, the Congress and the judiciary \u2013 into unprecedented conflict. In Haig&apos;s early weeks as chief of staff, he seemed to do little more than meet each development as it came along and fend it off as best he could. The Senate hearings on the Watergate allegations had begun within two weeks of his appointment, with damaging testimony from the former White House counsel John Dean highlighting the president&apos;s direct involvement. Two months later came Alexander Butterfield&apos;s revelation of Nixon&apos;s all-embracing tape-recording system. The president&apos;s refusal to hand over the tapes and his dismissal on 20 October 1973 of Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor who tried to force the issue, clearly signalled the beginning of the end for Nixon. The day after this action, 22 bills of impeachment were introduced into Congress. On 10 October, the ineffectual vice-president, Spiro Agnew, had resigned because of bribes he had taken while governor of Maryland, and was succeeded by Ford. From being an interim appointee, Haig moved more and more centre stage as chief of staff. Though it has not been clearly documented, there is strong evidence that he became functional president. Kissinger commented that &quot;by sheer willpower, dedication, and self-discipline, he held the government together&quot;. Leon Jaworski, who eventually mounted the dozens of Watergate prosecutions, had to work closely with Haig. He wrote that he was convinced that &quot;Haig, not Nixon, was making the executive department of government function,&quot; and quoted Haig as saying: &quot;I&apos;m not trying to save the president. I&apos;m trying to save the presidency.&quot; But Jaworski also thought Haig was intent on blocking the prosecutor&apos;s efforts to uncover the conspiracy. Haig briefly stayed on at the White House under Ford and was widely believed to have played a crucial role in the decision to pardon Nixon \u2013 a misjudgment that cost Ford the 1976 election. Then Ford appointed him supreme allied commander in Europe, the top military job in Nato, from which General Andrew Goodpaster was precipitately removed to create the vacancy. Haig&apos;s arrival in December 1974 was not popular: the Dutch foreign minister called it a public relations disaster. This feeling was compounded by Haig&apos;s casual revelation, before the West German government had been consulted, that an American brigade was to be stationed in the north of the country. He also got into hot water making political speeches against Eurocommunism and telling the Italians that communist participation in their government would be &quot;unacceptable&quot;. However, he gradually toned down his rhetoric to concentrate on narrower military issues, and his popularity in Europe increased. His term was extended for a further two years in the dying days of the Ford administration, and he then found himself coping with the vagaries of President Jimmy Carter&apos;s policy on the deployment of the neutron bomb in Europe. Haig threatened to resign when Carter changed his mind about deploying the weapon, but the dust gradually settled and he was given another two-year extension. He later said that his principal achievement during his term was to secure a commitment from the 14 member governments to increase their military spending by a regular 3% a year to counter the Soviet bloc arms build-up. But he was becoming highly unpopular in Washington and was excluded from much of the debate about the Salt II strategic arms limitation agreement.     President Richard Nixon with Haig, his chief of staff, in the Oval Office of the White House in May 1974. Photograph: Rex Features    In January 1979, he announced his resignation. In June there was an attempt on his life when a bomb exploded near his car as he was travelling to the Nato HQ in Belgium. No group ever claimed responsibility. There was an assumption that he would run for the presidency, but he disclaimed any ambition at the end of the year and took over as president of United Technologies, a defence contractor. A few months later he had a double heart by-pass operation. As part of the standard wheeling and dealing of the American military-industrial world, he maintained contact with politicians of both parties, including Richard Allen, national security adviser to Reagan. Partly through this connection he was asked to speak on foreign policy at the 1980 Republican convention and then began to be tipped as a likely secretary of state. With the election of Reagan, he was duly nominated, though the two men had only spent three hours together in their lives. After leaving the state department, Haig turned to business. From 1984 onwards, he put his experience to commercial use through the &quot;strategic advice&quot; offered by his firm Worldwide Associates, and as a commentator on Fox News. He became a director of various firms, including MGM, America Online and Compuserve. Haig&apos;s principal skill \u2013 learned early in life \u2013 lay in playing the system to the full. Otherwise he was not very bright and extremely vain. If his major service was to help his country through its worst constitutional crisis, it was offset by the long-term consequences of his ill-conceived interventions in Central America. He is survived by Patricia, a daughter and two sons. \u2022 Alexander Meigs Haig, soldier, politician and businessman, born 2 December 1924; died 20 February 2010"}, {"sentences": ["But I&apos;m signing off - we&apos;ll be blogging again tomorrow when Toyota&apos;s Tokyo-based global chief, Akio Toyoda, takes his turn before Congress.", "Such decisions are made in Tokyo.", "And a profile of Mr Toyoda by my colleague Justin McCurry in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Toyota", "US news", "Automotive industry", "World news", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-23T15:57:00Z", "title": "LIVE: Toyota's US boss grilled by Congress", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/23/toyota-boss-grilled-congress-live", "article": " 9.38pm: That&apos;s it. This panel&apos;s done. Members of Congress are off to vote, then there will be testimony later from the US transport secretary, Ray LaHood. But I&apos;m signing off - we&apos;ll be blogging again tomorrow when Toyota&apos;s Tokyo-based global chief, Akio Toyoda, takes his turn before Congress.  9.36pm: The committee is about to wrap up but Eliot Engel (D-New York) has one more question: &quot;I hope you can appreciate that we are very sceptical because it certainly seems if you look at the chain of events that there was an attempt to sweep everything under the rug.&quot; Engel wants to know what bombshells are going to come out that we don&apos;t yet know.Lentz says he hopes there aren&apos;t any more bombshells: &quot;I&apos;ve had enough bombshells for one year. let&apos;s get back to the good old days of 2009.&quot;  9.26pm: Jerry McNerney (D-California) is making an opportunistic pitch to persuade Toyota to keep open a threatened plant in Fremont, south of San Francisco:&quot;You&apos;re having a PR nightmare right now. It may benefit you a slight amount to close a plant like that but you&apos;re going to face a real backlash on the west coast. If you work with us to keep it open, it&apos;ll help you with your PR.&quot;Lentz blames the closure on the plant&apos;s co-owner, General Motors.  9.12pm: Darrell Issa, Republican congressman from California, is running a Twitter poll to ask for questions to put to Toyota&apos;s global president tomorrow. Some of the suggestions are somewhat dubious...&quot;why does Toyota lie in its advertising to suck away money from America and send it to Japan?&quot;&quot;what was your bonus each of the last five years and how does it compare to the value of the lives lost through your deceit?&quot;  8.52pm: It&apos;s not going at all well for Toyota&apos;s US chief, who&apos;s been forced to admit that he&apos;s a sales man, who doesn&apos;t make safety determinations. Such decisions are made in Tokyo. Betty Sutton (D-Ohio) wants to know &quot;why would Toyota send a sales person to answer questions about safety&quot;?Lentz replies that it wasn&apos;t his choice: &quot;I was invited by the committee to attend.&quot;  8.44pm: Lentz: &quot;I think we lost sight of the customer. I don&apos;t think it was a goal for us to grow faster, but we did. We had a lot of customers that loved our product, our loyalty rates were growing higher and higher....we outgrew our engineering resource. We had strategies to deal with that but the strategies didn&apos;t work.&quot;  8.33pm: Diana DeGette (D-Colorado) is off again about the fact that she owns three Toyota Camrys - so she&apos;s &quot;very, very concerned&quot; about getting this fix right. Funny how personal risk concentrates the mind of public officials.  8.24pm: Suddenly, Lentz is upset and it&apos;s all getting very personal: &quot;I can tell you, I lost a brother in an accident a week after his 30th birthday. That was 20-something years ago. There&apos;s not a day that goes by when I don&apos;t think of that. So I know what these families go through.&quot;His eyes tearing up, the Toyota man has to stop for a sip of water.  8.22pm: Rush wants a stronger apology: &quot;Don&apos;t you think you owe [your customers] a sincere apology for your company, your vehicles, your products causing them sincere pain? Can&apos;t you just apologise?Lentz obliges, saying his wife, sun, mother-in-law and father all drive recalled Toyota cars: &quot;I want to make sure my loved ones are safe as well.&quot;  8.15pm: Bobby Rush (D-Illinois) is most impressed by the diversity of Toyota&apos;s employees and dealers, who have packed the committee room wearing &quot;I am Toyota in America&quot; badges.Lentz is appreciative: &quot;Thank you, sir, they&apos;re hard working Americans.&quot;  8.13pm: Guardian&apos;s latest news story is here on Toyota&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda, who admits the company&apos;s runaway growth over the last decade has clouded its focus on safety. And a profile of Mr Toyoda by my colleague Justin McCurry in Tokyo.  8.05pm: Lentz is asked if he thinks the US government is biased because of public ownership of stakes in Toyota&apos;s rivals, General Motors and Chrysler. Lentz says he doesn&apos;t think so: &quot;I don&apos;t believe that&apos;s true. I think the government&apos;s acting fairly.&quot;  8.03pm: John Dingell, Democrat for the carmaking state of Michigan, is giving the Toyota man a very hard time with scattergun questioning.Dingell: &quot;Mr Lentz, what date did Toyota first hear about sudden unintended acceleration?&quot;I don&apos;t know the answer to that.Dingell: &quot;What date did you commence your first recall?&quot;If I didn&apos;t know the answer to the first, I don&apos;t know the answer to that either.Dingell: &quot;Please submit that to the record.&quot;  7.55pm: Somewhat ironically, a study published today ranks Toyota as the 7th most trusted brand in America - ahead of Pampers, but trailing FedEx and Amazon. The data, compiled by Millward Brown, was collected before the Japanese carmaker&apos;s little local difficulties began.  7.51pm: Still a lot of scepticism that sticky pedals is behind Toyota&apos;s acceleration problem, rather than electronics.Bart Stupak (D-Michigan): &quot;Do you have any evidence that sticky pedals can cause sudden unintended acceleration?&quot;Lentz: &quot;It depends on your definition of sudden.&quot;Lots of debate about whether high-speed incidents might have a different cause. Lentz says these are very, very rare anyway. Could be mechanical, human or &quot;some other type of error&quot;.  7.34pm: Waxman: Do you believe the recall (of the floormats and sticky pedals) will solve the problem of sudden unintended acceleration?Toyota boss: Not totally.Waxman: What do you need to do?Toyota boss: We need to continue to be vigilant and continue to investigate all of the complaints we get from consumers that we&apos;ve done a relatively poor job of in the past.  7.29pm: The committee don&apos;t look wholly impressed by Lentz&apos;s remarks. Henry Waxman understates that &quot;these past two months have not been very happy for your company&quot;. He&apos;s running a quick video - a CNBC interview with Lentz from some time ago when Lentz claimed an earlier fix had solved the problem.  7.22pm: Now it&apos;s time for Jim Lentz, the US boss of Toyota, who&apos;s reading his prepared testimony (available here) before taking questions.Admits that in recent months, Toyota hasn&apos;t lived up to its high standards: &quot;It&apos;s taken us too long to come to grips with rare but serious safety issues.&quot;And that the company&apos;s communication, both internally and with regulators, has been poor.He says dealers are staying open 24 hours a day to repair vehicles - and that 800,000 have been done so far.  7.08pm: 7-minute recess before the next panel.  7.04pm: I&apos;m back. Charles Gonzalez, a Democrat from Texas who has constituents working at a Toyota factory, is delivering a staunch defence of Toyota. He thinks it&apos;s entirely possible that unintended acceleration could simply be caused by a sticky pedal and dodgy floor mat. He&apos;s giving the panel&apos;s safety experts a rough time.  6.22pm: I&apos;m taking a quick break while I churn out a Toyota news story but will be back when Toyota&apos;s US boss, Jim Lentz, takes the stand.  6.05pm: Toyota&apos;s chairman, Akio Toyoda, has released written testimony prior to his Congressional grilling tomorrow. He concedes that his company has grown too rapidly in recent years and that Toyota was not always able to &quot;stop, think and make improvements&quot;. There&apos;s a strong tone of penitence. He says he&apos;ll make sure all his management team drive Toyotas (it seems rather surprising that they might not already) and he concludes with a personal pledge: &quot;My name is on every car.&quot;  5.51pm: Congressman Joe Barton is interested in the degree to which Toyota inspected the Smiths&apos; Lexus after their terrifying runaway accelerator incident. The answer is not very thoroughly. Barton makes another reference to &quot;God intervening&quot; to save Rhonda Smith when she was hurtling down the freeway at 100mph.  5.40pm: We&apos;re getting a long and rather detailed explanation of Toyota&apos;s electronic throttle control systems from David Gilbert, a professor of automotive technology at Southern Illinois university. Essentially, he&apos;s saying Toyota&apos;s system lacked fail-safe safeguards and that the problem is electronics, not floormats.  5.31pm: Even the safety expert&apos;s breaking down in tears now. Sean Kane, founder of Safety Research &amp; Strategies, says Toyota failed to recognise the severity of the danger with its acceleration pedals. It took a &quot;horrific crash&quot; in California last year, with a haunting recording of a 911 call, to concentrate minds. Kane, pin-striped and bespectacled, briefly struggled to hold it together.  5.24pm: Rhonda Smith&apos;s husband, Eddie, takes up the tale. He says the couple only received &quot;lip service&quot; from Toyota. The company kept perpetuating a &quot;complete fabrication&quot; - that the problem was down to a floormat. Toyota&apos;s initial fix - a massive mail-out of small orange warning stickers to place on floormats.  5.18pm: When Smith and her husband complained to Toyota, the company effectively called them &quot;liars&quot;, insisting that the car&apos;s brakes would always over-ride the accelerator if properly maintained. She was told she must have caused the problem by unintentionally leaning on the accelerator. Smith has composed herself and is providing a highly credible, detailed account: &quot;We&apos;ve never wavered from our belief that the problem was automatic, not wandering floormats.&quot;  5.14pm: Smith briefly pauses, tearful and with her voice breaking up. She&apos;d called her husband on her blackberry to say a final goodbye. But then, after 6 miles of acceleration, she recalls, &quot;God intervened&quot;, and her Toyota slowed down. When the car&apos;s speed dropped to 33mph, she was able to shut off the engine.  5.12pm: In a deep Tennessee accent, retired social worker Rhonda Smith describes her experience with &quot;SUA&quot; - sudden unintended acceleration in October 2006. She was just joining an interstate when she lost all control of acceleration of her Lexus. She thought it was the cruise control that had failed - but the car continued to accelerate. &quot;I put the car into all available gears, including neutral. I put it into reverse and it stayed in reverse as it sped down the interstate at 100mph&quot;.  5.08pm: Now, the first witnesses are up. They&apos;re Eddie and Rhonda Smith, who were Toyota owners with a runaway car, and two safety experts - Sean Kane, of Safety Research &amp; Strategies Inc, and David Gilbert, an expert at Southern Illinois University.  5.00pm: After an hour, we&apos;re still on opening statements by members of Congress, with not a murmur yet from witnesses. Right now it&apos;s the turn of Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat in a fetching red sweater, who is concerned about whether America&apos;s NHTSA highway safety regulator has sufficient resources.  4.49pm: There&apos;s a bit of competition going on to prove credentials as Toyota customers. Diana DeGette (D-Colorado) declares that she has three Toyotas. She&apos;s particularly alarmed by the Japanese marque&apos;s safety issues because her 16-year-old daughter will shortly get a driving licence and will be driving a 1994 Camry station wagon.  4.43pm: Edward Morley (D-Massachusetts) is sceptical about Toyota&apos;s insistence that its accelerator problems are down to easily fixed floor mats, rather than complex electronics: &quot;The question is whether the problem is how you put your boot on the gas or whether Toyota needs to reboot the electronics in its cars.&quot;  4.37pm: When motorists took the routine step of getting into their Toyota cars, they had &quot;no idea that their trusted vehicles had the potential to become, literally, killing machines&quot; observes Bobby Rush (D-Illinois), rather dramatically.  4.31pm: What Toyota and Tiger Woods have in common - they were both so successful for a decade that they floated over mere mortals. Now they&apos;ve messed up and are going through a public flogging to plead for redemption, writes Rick Newman in US News &amp; World Report.  4.27pm: Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, points out that the US government has an inherent conflict of interest in overseeing Toyota&apos;s safety problems because it pumped $64bn of public funds into Toyota&apos;s rivals - Chrysler and General Motors. He says Congress isn&apos;t just a &quot;disinterested panel of car owners and stock owners&quot; and asserts that this conflict is precisely why the government shouldn&apos;t bail out struggling companies in the first place.  4.20pm: Henry Waxman, an angry sounding Democrat from California, contributes to the general tone of techno-scepticism by observing that cars have become moving computers with dozens of microprocessors and millions of lines of code.  4.14pm: Next up is Joe Barton, a stern Republican from Texas, who was &quot;stunned&quot; to learn that steering and acceleration in modern cars aren&apos;t mechanically linked - but merely talk to each other through electronics. He&apos;s off on a long, rather sceptical, diatribe about 21st century automotive science.  4.11pm: To put Toyota&apos;s difficulties in real world context, the Detroit Free Press has a long description of a crash that kicked off the whole safety scare - a runaway Lexus that killed a family of five in California last year - complete with audio of a 911 call.  4.06pm: Stupak: Toyota&apos;s leadership has been &quot;ambiguous&quot; about whether the present recalls fully address technical problems. Roughly 70% of complaints about sudden acceleration come from owners not covered by the existing recalls.  4.03pm: Chairman Bart Stupak has &quot;gavelled us in&quot; and the hearing&apos;s begun.  3.59pm: Toyota&apos;s Jim Lentz has set a pre-emptive tone of remorse in his written evidence to the committee. He says that in recent months, Toyota has &quot;not lived up to the high standards our customers and the public have come to expect&quot;. It&apos;s taken too long, he admits, to get to grips with a &quot;rare but serious&quot; set of safety issues. The problem has been compounded by &quot;poor communications&quot; both within Toyota and with regulators and consumers. Damage limitation is in full swing - 150 Toyota dealers have gathered in Washington with badges reading &quot;I am Toyota in America&quot;. There&apos;s a real effort to remind both lawmakers and the watching public that Toyota isn&apos;t a mere fly-by-night foreign interloper - it&apos;s a company that employs 172,000 people in the US.  A key question is going to be whether technical problems are down to fundamental electronic faults or, as Toyota maintains, it&apos;s an easily solvable issue of floor mats and sticky pedals.  3.47pm: Up before the House energy and commerce committee today will be James Lentz, president and chief operating officer of Toyota&apos;s US sales operation, who will be expected to humbly apologise. The US transport secretary, Ray LaHood, will give evidence to explain the government&apos;s handling of the saga.  And just to give a little on-the-ground context, a Tennessee couple, Eddie and Rhonda Smith, will recount their terrifying experience from back in 2006 with a runaway Toyota Lexus. They&apos;ve accused Toyota of &quot;totally ignoring&quot; them when they reported a problem.     Akio Toyoda. Photograph: Kyodo/Reuters    It promises to be a tough and challenging afternoon for Toyota, which has already been hit with legal subpoenas that could lead to a criminal prosecution. And this is just the warm-up act - tomorrow Toyota&apos;s global president, Akio Toyoda, will be hauled over the coals by another congressional panel, the House committee on oversight and government reform.  That promises to be a true clash of culture, with hard-nosed, television-savvy congressmen pitted against a reticent Japanese captain of industry."}, {"sentences": ["All those public things on plinths, from Harlow New Town to Tokyo; all those British Council-sponsored exhibitions that \u00adforever circumnavigate the globe."], "tags": ["Henry Moore", "Sculpture", "Art", "Tate Britain", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-23T21:30:00Z", "title": "Henry Moore: Smooth operator", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/23/henry-moore-tate-britain", "article": "Among a number of small and often strange \u00adhumanoid sculptures \u00adsitting on low plinths in Tate Britain&apos;s Henry Moore exhibition, there is an object that made me laugh out loud. But it was a laugh tempered by \u00aduncertainty. A small slabby thing carved from warm Corsehill stone, the sculpture appears to represent a man lying in a bath, his arms at his sides, staring down at his own erection. It&apos;s the sort of universal situation any man might recognise. The head, at one end of the slab, is like a grave-stone and pierced by a single hole. At the other end is a rounded bulge, from which protrudes an elongated wedge-like ridge, riding up his torso and terminating between two bumpy little breasts. Maybe it&apos;s not a man after all, nor a person in a bath, but some sort of woman. This is yet another of Moore&apos;s reclining figures, from 1933-4, but it could be a funerary slab from some \u00adancient, even alien civilisation. What on earth was Moore thinking? Another sculpture nearby, carved in the same stone, is most definitely female, this time upright \u2013 a rounded, almost jug-like form with two pert breasts. Woman as vessel, then. Yet the head, again pierced by a single hole, is almost penile. So, too, is the head of a third sculpture, a head-and-shoulders carved in African wonderstone, a glassy black volcanic rock, part of which is striated with faint concentric bands of colour, spreading like little seismic ripples. The entire sculpture seems to grow from these rings. It&apos;s a weighty thing that you want to touch and hold, to feel its mass, its sexy, bulging, androgynous smoothness. These smaller sculptures, which Moore produced throughout his long career, repay all the attention you give them. The longer you look, the stranger they are. There are dismembered bodies, bowling-ball heads that want to eat smaller heads, holes that want to accept protruberences, body parts that morph into other body parts. One translucent alabaster sculpture describes a baby&apos;s head suckling at a breast \u2013 or does the breast suckle at the child? The whole thing has a sort of yearning, merging feel, and reminds me of the sculpted heads of Medardo Rosso, who died in 1928, two years \u00adbefore Moore carved this. A lot of what Moore did has an almost feminine feel. This is not just because he made so many sculptures of mothers and infants, nor because (as he admitted) he had a bit of a mother fixation. It is as much in his play of insides and outsides, in the flow of forms and space. There is also something inescapably phallic about many of Moore&apos;s women, and in the male and female dualities even of his \u00adabstract forms. Moore never read Freud, though throughout the 1920s and 30s the discoveries of psychoanalysis were very much in the air. Moore&apos;s smaller sculptures can be threatening, too. A number of little reclining figures from the end of the 1930s are made from lead, a material that attracted Moore because of its \u00adpoisonous nature. The small bodies look as if they have been licked into shape. Light flows queasily over their smooth grey surfaces. It is as if they have been infected by Salvador Dal\u00ed and the bad android in Terminator\u00a02. But what Moore appears to have been infected by, mostly, was Picasso \u2013 whose biographer, John Richardson, said that Moore was the &quot;petit-maitre of Picasso&apos;s bone-surreal&quot;, a cruel but fitting jibe. Giacometti&apos;s surrealist work, as well as that of Jean Arp and other European artists have left their mark. Moore looked long and hard at a great deal of what inspired other artists of the period: African carvings; Mayan, Egyptian and early Iberian sculpture \u2013 art that was called &quot;primitive&quot;. He \u00adburied himself in the British Museum and the Trocadero in Paris, knew \u00adGiacometti, and visited Picasso when the latter was painting Guernica. Morbid and sexual undertones So used are we to Henry Moore, we hardly give him the time his art \u00addeserves. This aim of this exhibition, which takes us from the 1920s up to the 1970s, is to show us his morbid and \u00adsexual undertones. The show avoids much of Moore&apos;s later work, when the artist went into production mode, making a form of sculpture that blinds us to his real achievements. All those public things on plinths, from Harlow New Town to Tokyo; all those British Council-sponsored exhibitions that \u00adforever circumnavigate the globe. Moore&apos;s bronze editions of \u00adinterlocking, rounded forms with their hollows and holes and fussy, scaly surfaces have \u00adbecome so much street furniture. The impression I grew up with was of a domesticated modernist, already old hat, so ubiquitous one almost didn&apos;t need to look. He was just there. It is the artist&apos;s smaller, more private works I like the best, the ones that don&apos;t appease airy humanist \u00adsentiment. The exhibition&apos;s curator, Chris Stephens, also hopes to present a Moore whose preoccupation was the human body as, in Stephens&apos;s words, &quot;abject, erotic, vulnerable, violated and visceral . . . absurd, uncanny and claustrophobic&quot;. Ooh-err, what&apos;s come over our Henry, king of the sucked-toffee blob in the town square? The mother-and-child-friendly sculptor? What Stephens really wants to do is give us a Moore for our time. A Moore who might hang out with Georges Bataille and the dissident \u00adsurrealist crowd, a Moore to set \u00adbeside Giacometti and Hans Bellmer, or even Louise Bourgeois, Paul \u00adMcCarthy, Bruce Nauman and Thomas Sch\u00fctte. It&apos;s true that Nauman has nodded to Moore in a couple of works, while Sch\u00fctte&apos;s reclining steel women owe some of their deformations to Moore. What began as jokes at Moore&apos;s \u00adexpense in the sausage \u00adsculptures of Fischli and Weiss, and in the \u00adperformances of Bruce McLean, has ended as a kind of homage. Sympathy for elms There is a falling off in Moore&apos;s post-second world war work, although the reclining figure he made for the 1951 Festival of Britain remains a \u00adpeculiar, startling and troubling thing. It is not a million miles from Francis \u00adBacon&apos;s 1944 Studies at the Base of a \u00adCrucifixion \u2013 if one could imagine those figures spending a day at the beach. But it is in the last room \u2013 just when the show, and Moore&apos;s art, seems to flag \u2013 that things really come alive again. Four great elm carvings \u00addominate the space, filling the air with their lovely reflected light. Each, again, is a reclining figure. The first is dated 1936, the last 1976-8. In this room, their scale seems just right. There is a sense of massive slumber and waiting. But what really strikes me is Moore&apos;s craftsmanship, his understanding and sympathy towards the great hunks of elm, the way he followed the grain and density of the wood when he hollowed space and revealed form. He let the material do the talking, and respected its nature. People don&apos;t talk much of &quot;truth to materials&quot; nowadays. I don&apos;t really go in for all the mythic \u00adqualities these recumbent figures might have, but they do have real presence. All the smoothing and rounding and \u00adhollowing of the forms, even their facelessness, has a point. There is a sense of great gravity and rest. The sculptures slow time down to a full stop, and us with it."}, {"sentences": ["InterpreterIn the Miso Soup by Ryu Murakami (translated by Ralph McCarthy) &quot;There are things people do automatically in this country that foreigners can&apos;t understand no matter how hard you try to explain.&quot; Kenji is a &quot;nightlife guide&quot; for Frank, an American tourist who might also be the serial killer who is stalking Tokyo."], "tags": ["Best books", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Colum McCann"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-24T11:00:00Z", "title": "Aifric Campbell's top 10 jobs in fiction", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/23/aifric-campbell-top-10-jobs-fiction", "article": "Aifric Campbell was born in Ireland.

The loss adjustor in my latest book has found the perfect profession for someone unable to come to terms with childhood tragedy. Work \u2013 and its absence \u2013 shapes our destinies and lays our souls bare.  &quot;My top 10 choices are all compelling stories beautifully told by writers who will keep you up all night.&quot; Estate agentThe Sportswriter / Independence Day / The Lay of the Land by Richard Ford You will see your estate agent, or &quot;realtor&quot;, in completely different light when you get to know Frank Bascombe who has &quot;lived to face down regret&quot;. His young son dies, his early literary success evaporates, he gets divorced and observes New Jersey and the human condition with grace and humour, often from behind the wheel of his car. Viciously funny and incredibly moving, I have re-read my copy of The Sportswriter so many times that the pages are falling apart. CowboyThe Border trilogy by Cormac McCarthy I first discovered McCarthy when All the Pretty Horses was published in 1993 and it took me back to the westerns I had loved as a child. John Grady Cole is &quot;a man come to the end of something&quot; at the opening of the first volume in the trilogy. When his grandfather rancher dies he rides off for Mexico on a journey that will make him feel &quot;the world&apos;s heart beat at some terrible cost.&quot; There is a magnificence to McCarthy&apos;s writing that is truly breathtaking. InterpreterIn the Miso Soup by Ryu Murakami (translated by Ralph McCarthy) &quot;There are things people do automatically in this country that foreigners can&apos;t understand no matter how hard you try to explain.&quot; Kenji is a &quot;nightlife guide&quot; for Frank, an American tourist who might also be the serial killer who is stalking Tokyo. Not to be confused with the other better-known Murakami, Ryu&apos;s subject is the moral emptiness of contemporary Japan and his books are guaranteed to send a shiver down the spine. Kenji is the curiously passive freelance interpreter who is unable to translate the horror in which he is complicit. Horribly compelling. Ballet dancerDancer by Colum McCann The little boy who danced for a ward full of wounded Russian soldiers in 1943 went on to become the greatest dancer in history. Rudi is wild, wonderful and outrageous and dances until his feet bleed and we see him through the eyes of a host of different narrators in this extraordinarily powerful novel. Colum McCann spins unforgettable fiction out of Nureyev&apos;s life.  FurrierSkin Lane by Neil Bartlett  Mr F lies about his occupation because &quot;to describe too accurately what he actually did every day would seem grotesque&quot;. The trouble begins when he starts to have recurring dreams about a naked body hanging upside down from a cistern. The cutting room in the hidden heart of the City and the eerie tools of the furrier&apos;s trade take you to the edge of suspense and beyond. A poignant and sinister meditation on beauty, obsession and desire. CopThe Given Day by Dennis Lehane Danny Coughlin suspects that &quot;his job was the wrong fit for his heart&quot;. The son of a police captain starts out as a beat cop who goes undercover to gather intelligence on political radicals and finds his loyalties tested to the limit when the police go on strike. A love story, a monster family epic set at the end on the first world war, and the inside story of the Boston police will make any Irish reader heartsick.  Car salesmanThe Rabbit novels by John Updike When Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom reaches middle age he takes pleasure in knowing &quot;that the earth is mortal too&quot; as he looks out the car showroom window. From high school basketball hero, to linotype printer to car dealer, we grow up with Rabbit through the last four decades of 20th century America. Lyrical, brutal drama of the everyday and a true celebration of the human condition in all its wonder.  WriterThe Speed of Light by Javier Cercas (translated by Anne McLean) &quot;Now I lead a false life, an apocryphal, clandestine, invisible life, though truer than if it were real, but I was still me when I met Rodney Falk.&quot; I&apos;m often suspicious of novels with writers as central characters since there is always the chance that the author is engaged in a self-help exercise but Cercas&apos;s story of the young Spanish writer who takes a teaching job in the US and befriends an off-beat Vietnam vet with a dark secret is utterly absorbing from the opening page. His prize-winning Soldiers of Salamis was critically acclaimed but I thought this was a far better novel. Heart-breaking and intriguing, I could not put it down. EntrepreneurThe White Tiger by Aravind Adiga &quot;All that remains to be told is how I changed from a hunted criminal into a solid pillar of the Bangalorean society,&quot; says Balram towards the end of this book. The son of a rickshaw puller &quot;born and raised in Darkness&quot; he dreams of transcending his fate and when he lands a job as chauffeur to a wealthy businessman the White Tiger finds his escape route. There is a steely ferocity to Balram&apos;s wit that is utterly captivating. SpyThe Untouchable by John Banville &quot;I have lived decorously here, I must not now turn into a shrieking hysteric.&quot; Victor Maskell writes in the journal he begins when, as an old man dying of cancer, he is exposed as a Soviet double agent.

Government officials today voiced concerns that fierce and prolonged criticism of Toyota in the US could spark a wider backlash against Japanese goods, just as exports are beginning to show real signs of life. Japan&apos;s exports rose by almost 41% in January compared with last year, according to figures released today. Exports to Asia leapt 68.1%, while those to the US grew 24%, the finance ministry said. The foreign minister, Katsuya Okada, said he hoped Toyoda would reassure the American public when he testifies on Capitol Hill later today. &quot;I certainly would like to hope this matter will not undermine the trust of the Americans, not just [in] Toyota as a company, but Japan as a whole,&quot; Okada said in an interview with the Guardian. &quot;It is essentially a matter of one enterprise ... there&apos;s very little the Japanese government can do.&quot; In written testimony released before his appearance in front of the house oversight and government reform committee, Toyoda said he was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; for accidents caused by defective Toyota vehicles. &quot;As you well know, I am the grandson of the founder, and all the Toyota vehicles bear my name,&quot; he said. &quot;For me, when the cars are damaged, it is as though I am as well. I, more than anyone, wish for Toyota&apos;s cars to be safe, and for our customers to feel safe when they use our vehicles.&quot; Optimism over Japan&apos;s export recovery was tempered by a report warning that damage to exports of cars and vehicle parts, which accounted for about 15% of total exports last year, could trigger a fall in GDP. A hypothetical 3% cut in Japan&apos;s car output would equate to a drop of 0.12\u00a0percentage points, or \u00a5600bn, in nominal GDP, the Daiwa Research Institute said. A fall of that size could lead to the loss of almost 50,000 jobs and have serious knock-on effects for other sectors, such as the electronics and service industries, it said. Yesterday the government downgraded its view on exports for this month, partly as a result of the Toyota recall. The cabinet office said exports were &quot;increasing moderately&quot; \u2013 a weaker assessment than last month when it said they were &quot;increasing&quot;. The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, a critic of Toyota&apos;s handling of the recall, reminded the firm of its responsibilities as the global face of Japan, Inc. &quot;Toyota is not only a Japanese company but also a local US company, and its subcontractors are very much localised,&quot; he said. &quot;In that respect Toyota should be fully aware of its responsibilities as an American company and as part of the American economy and face the [congressional] hearings earnestly and sincerely.&quot; Japanese TV showed clips of yesterday&apos;s testimony by Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, but more airtime was devoted to the performances of Japan&apos;s women figure skaters at the Vancouver Olympics. &quot;Even if figure skating is really what&apos;s on people&apos;s minds, I think people will be interested in seeing how Toyoda-san will perform,&quot; Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo, told the Associated Press. Japanese broadsheets echoed fears that Toyota&apos;s woes could spread to other sectors, given its place at the heart of the country&apos;s manufacturing tradition. &quot;Considering that Toyota represents Japan&apos;s corporate identity, a loss in confidence would potentially affect all Japanese products,&quot; said an editorial in the Nikkei business daily. The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan&apos;s biggest-selling newspaper, said it hoped Toyoda would &quot;take to heart his position as the de facto captain of this nation&apos;s manufacturing industry&quot;. Shares in Toyota fell 1.5% to \u00a53,275 in Tokyo today. They have lost about 20% of their value since 21 January, when the recall was expanded to cover millions of vehicles with &quot;sticky&quot; accelerators."}, {"sentences": ["The US safety regulator, NHTSA, sent a team to Tokyo earlier in 09 to discuss the accelerator problem.Toyoda says a specific team in Toyota&apos;s safety unit dealt with NHTS.", "That&apos;s the reason I spoke to Mr Toyoda directly.&quot;  5.14pm: Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-Washington DC) wants to know about the notorious culture of secrecy in Japan: &quot;Have you had difficulty penetrating the Toyota culture which teaches that these are issues that should not be aired in public?&quot;LaHood admits there have been &quot;some issues&quot; but says he&apos;s picked up the phone and talked directly to Toyota&apos;s president, and that staff from his department were dispatched to Tokyo to meet the carmaker face-to-face.", "He asks LaHood if it&apos;s true that no vehicle can possibly be 100% safe.The transport secretary won&apos;t give a straight answer: &quot;Our goal is to make every vehicle a hundred percent safe.&quot;  4.58pm: It&apos;s the turn of left winger Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), who wants to know whether the US government has the power to send investigators to Tokyo to rifle through Toyota&apos;s internal records and see what it knew, when, about dodgy accelerators.LaHood replies: &quot;We have asked for a voluminous amount of information from Toyota which we&apos;ll review.", "Akio Toyoda has travelled from Tokyo to give evidence in Congress about his company&apos;s safety crisis and he&apos;s likely to get a Washington-style tough ride."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Akio Toyoda", "Automotive industry", "Business", "US Congress", "US politics", "US news", "Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-24T15:46:50Z", "title": "LIVE: Toyota boss grilled by Congress", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/24/live-toyota-akio-toyoda-congress", "article": " 10.14pm: After six hours of testimony, we&apos;re getting much heat and little light. The Toyota men have said what they&apos;ve come to say, so I&apos;m going to sign off rather than document more grandstanding by the finest in Congress.To summarise: Mr Toyoda is very, very sorry about Toyota&apos;s faulty accelerator pedals. He doesn&apos;t know exactly when Toyota found out about the problem but he didn&apos;t learn about them personally until late 2009. His heart goes out to the relatives of those killed or injured, although he&apos;s not going to commit to paying their healthcare or funeral costs. And Toyota&apos;s slow response, Toyoda says, is largely down to its overly rapid growth in recent years which has taken the focus off safety.Toyoda will do his best to improve things next time by setting up a special safety committee, headed by himself. Oh, and don&apos;t try to make him answer questions with a &apos;yes&apos; or a &apos;no&apos;. He&apos;s not going to play that game.  10.06pm: Is somebody going to try to pin Toyoda down?John Duncan (R-Tennessee), has a go: &quot;I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve heard a good answer as to why it took your company so long to respond to these complaints.&quot;A long monologue from Toyoda, who basically just says he&apos;s set up a committee to ensure that Toyota&apos;s speed of response will be better next time.  10.01pm: Cuellar wants to know in what way Toyota has failed to live up to its own high standards.Toyoda doesn&apos;t bother answering, chooses to waffle instead: &quot;Above anything else, we&apos;ll make a double commitment with new vigour to make safety and customer first permeate throughout every Toyota business.&quot;He adds that Toyota will try to be more transparent.  9.56pm: A chummy tone from Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), who has a Toyota factory in his San Antonio district. He opens by saying: &quot;Konichiwa.&quot;  9.44pm: When did Toyota first learn it had a problem with unintended acceleration, asks Danny Davis (R-Illinois). Why did it take so long for Toyota to bring the problem to the attention of regulators?Another lengthy, uninformative answer from Toyoda, who&apos;s pretty good at waffling: &quot;In the name of our company&apos;s tradition and pride, I can clearly say that whenever a problem arises, Toyota pursues the facts thoroughly and rigorously and looks into those matters in great detail. In doing so, our fundamental approach and stance is to give the highest priority to customers&apos; safety and convenience....we provide and create products that satisfy the mandate of the times - in conserving the environment and in existing in harmony with nature....I do not know when we learned about this problem. But I do hope you understand the basic attitude of the company that I described.&quot;That settles that, then.  9.38pm: We&apos;re really hearing very little from Toyota&apos;s head honcho, Akio Toyoda. He&apos;s leaving his US chief to answer virtually all the questions. Toyoda is keeping his head down and when he does talk, it&apos;s in long, bland monologues of corporate-speak.Toyoda&apos;s just informed us that he treasures Toyota&apos;s corporate culture very highly and that its values are spread throughout the world. Not very enlightening.  9.35pm: &quot;Frankly it&apos;s refreshing to see corporate executives show remorse&quot;, says Jeff Fortenberry (R-Nebraska). He wants to know if Toyota&apos;s corporate culture is different in the US from in Japan. Inaba (the Toyota US chief) says he&apos;s been surprised at how similar corporate cultures are in America and Japan, but says there are sometimes communication problems because of the language barrier.  9.32pm: The Toyota guys are asked how confident they are that electronics isn&apos;t the cause of sticky accelerator pedals.Inaba: &quot;My level of confidence is 100%. I have full trust in Toyota&apos;s engineers.&quot;  9.18pm: The Ohio Democrat Dennis Kucinich has a crack, and he&apos;s taking no prisoners: &quot;We&apos;ve heard Mr Toyoda say that Toyota grew to fast. It&apos;s interesting we&apos;re being told that as we investigate cars accelerating out of control. It&apos;s ironic. The problem wasn&apos;t that you were moving too fast but moving too slow - too slow to recognise the material defects that were putting peoples&apos; lives at risk.&quot;  9.13pm: Chaffetz is asking some sticky questions about an internal Toyota briefing document that&apos;s critical of the US auto safety agency, NHTSA. The document says the agency is more focused on &quot;legal&quot; than &quot;engineering&quot; issues.Rather neatly ducking this question, Toyoda says he doesn&apos;t understand the document because it&apos;s in English, rather than Japanese.  9.08pm: Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) wonders if Toyota feels it&apos;s being treated as fairly as an American carmaker would have been by the US government.&quot;Yes, I believe so,&quot; replies Toyoda.  9.01pm: Meanwhile, in other news on the motor industry front - General Motors has just announced that it is shutting down the gas-guzzling Hummer brand after a sale to China&apos;s Sichuan Tengzhong. Bye bye, polluting Hummer.  8.45pm: Carolyn Maloney (D-New York) wants to know if Toyota will assume the medical/funeral costs of the Americans who died as a result of accidents involving faulty vehicles?Toyoda says he feels very sorry for those who were killed. Toyota&apos;s making every effort to make sure accidents aren&apos;t repeated.Maloney: &quot;You didn&apos;t answer the question.&quot;Toyota&apos;s US chief, Inaba, interjects to say the cases are subject to litigation so they&apos;ll leave the question up to their legal counsel.  8.35pm: Gerald Connolly (D-Virginia) is puzzled by Toyoda&apos;s timeline. The US safety regulator, NHTSA, sent a team to Tokyo earlier in 09 to discuss the accelerator problem.Toyoda says a specific team in Toyota&apos;s safety unit dealt with NHTS. He knew there was a meeting but he wasn&apos;t aware of the details.Connolly says that&apos;s &quot;extraordinary compartmentalisation&quot;.  8.32pm: Toyoda first became aware of problems with accelerators &quot;sometime toward the end of last year&quot;. But he can&apos;t be sure when the company was first made aware, as he was only appointed president in July. He wasn&apos;t privvy to that sort of information before he got the top job.  8.26pm: Stoical defence from Inaba, who says the document talking about a &quot;saving&quot; of $100m in limiting a vehicle recall was produced only a few days after his appointment as US chief executive. He was still on an orientation tour.Mica: &quot;Do you realise the people who&apos;ve been let down? Me, the people who go to work every day in my district in Toyota operations and sales.&quot;Toyota&apos;s US boss says he doesn&apos;t recall the meeting where this was discussed and it was totally inconsistent with Toyota&apos;s guiding principles.  8.23pm: John Mica (R-Florida) is going in with both feet - he says it&apos;s a very embarrassing day for Toyota to have the grandson of its founder up before Congress.&quot;I&apos;m embarrassed for you sir. I&apos;m embarrassed for my dealers who I&apos;ve talked to. I&apos;m embarrassed for thousands of hard-working Americans who work in more than 10 plants across the United States.&quot;He says it&apos;s &quot;appalling&quot; that Toyota boasted in internal documentsof saving $100m by restricting a recall of vehicles.&quot;This discredits everyone,&quot; booms Mica.  8.19pm: Toyoda: &quot;I sincerely regret that some people actually encountered accidents in Toyota vehicles.&quot;Toyota has made every effort to reproduce and duplicate these accidents, he says. But in all these re-enactments, no electronic problems have been found with vehicles&apos; throttles.  8.17pm: &quot;It&apos;s one thing to say your sorry&quot;, says Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland). But he&apos;s not impressed. He says Americans have been spending their hard-earned dollars on Toyotas in a tough economic time. &quot;How do you say to them we can trust you now when it seems as if there&apos;s no end to this series of promises that seem to come short of reaching the goal of safety?&quot;  8.12pm: Dan Burton (R-Indiana) is waving pedals around again. He&apos;s got one manufactured in Japan and one made by an Indiana company, CTS. Why does Toyota put different spec pedals in the same model of car?Toyoda gives a very, very long answer which is clearly testing the congressman&apos;s patience. The essence: a car consists of 20,000 to 30,000 parts. Suppliers design the pedals, Toyota approves these designs. Sometimes Toyota approves more than one design. Toyota doesn&apos;t want to be wholly dependent on one supplier.  8.06pm: Kanjorski gets tough - Americans grew up in an atmosphere of a great deal of faith that something stamped &quot;made in Japan&quot; has a good deal of quality - Toyota has damaged that and will be called on to pay compensation for that, via the US legal process.  8.03pm: Toyoda: &quot;Our speed of expansion outpaced our development and training of people working for us and right now I&apos;m fully aware of that.&quot;He says he&apos;s set up a new reporting structure of regional executives since taking the top job in June so that customers&apos; complaints can be swiftly communicated to head office.  8.01pm: Paul Kanjorski (D-Pennsyvania) tries to get chummy, tells Toyoda that when he returns to Japan he&apos;ll be able to brag about withstanding a quizzing by Congress, considered a badge of courage in the US. But as everything needs translating, there&apos;s no immediate response. This is going to be a slow and frustrating process for the gentlemen of Congress.  7.58pm: Toyoda says Toyota will be setting up a special committee on global quality, which will be headed by himself. First meeting to be held on March 30th.  7.48pm: Towns says he wants yes or no answers. Toyoda isn&apos;t playing by the rules, though - another long speech in Japanese.&quot;I&apos;m trying to find out, is that a yes or no,&quot; barks Towns before Toyoda&apos;s answer can be translated.  7.46pm: There are 4 categories of unexpected acceleration, says Toyoda, in rather scholarly fashion - problems with electronic throttles, the way the vehicle&apos;s used, the structure of the car and the structure of the parts.He&apos;s going into a long explanation of fuel supply. Towns tries to interrupt but Toyoda isn&apos;t playing ball - he&apos;s planning to press on, through an interpreter, at his own glacial pace.  7.40pm: A softball to start off. Edolphus Towns wants to know - have you told US regulators everything you know about sudden accelerator problems?Toyoda, through an interpreter, says: &quot;According to my understanding, we fully shared the information we have with the authorities.&quot;  7.36pm: By the way, if anyone wonders why the company&apos;s called Toyota and the grandson of its founder is called Toyoda, the Detroit News has the answer. It&apos;s to do with the number of the number of brush strokes required to write the name - Toyota requires eight, which is apparently a luckier number than the ten required for the family name.  7.33pm: He pledges to tighten the focus on quality, not quantity. And all senior management will be required to drive Toyota vehicles and check where the problems lie. He gives a &quot;personal commitment&quot; to fix the problem and put customers first.Toyada finishes and now Yoshimi Inaba, president of Toyota Motor North America, is making some opening remarks.  7.29pm: As per his script, Toyoda says he believes Toyota may have expanded too fast - and that the company&apos;s focus on safety may have become blurred.&quot;As you well know, I am the grandson of the company&apos;s founder, and all Toyota vehicles bear my name&quot; he says. &quot;For me, when the cars are damaged, it is as though I am as well.&quot;  7.26pm: &quot;I myself, like Toyota, am not perfect. At times, we find defects. But at all such times, we stop, try to find the defect and make changes to improve further,&quot; says Toyoda, who is reading from his prepared testimony - available here.  7.23pm: The Toyota pair are warmly welcomed by chairman Towns. Toyoda stares forward expressionlessly, listening to events via an interpreter. Toyoda begins in a confident voice: &quot;I&apos;d first like to state that I love cars as much as anybody and I love Toyota as much as anybody.&quot;However, he admits, in the past few months, customers have started to feel &quot;uncertain&quot; about the safety of Toyota cars &quot;and I take full responsibility for that&quot;.  7.20pm: Here comes Akio Toyoda. Dark suit, blue tie, slight scowl. He puts a translation microphone in his ear. Sits down calmly and arranges his papers neatly. Cameras go click, click, click. Chairman Edolphus Towns is banging his gavel.  7.16pm: Huge mob of photographers and camera crews materialise to await the arrival of Toyota&apos;s boss Akio Toyoda and his US chief, Yoshimi Inaba.  7.07pm: &quot;What a joy, Mr Chairman,&quot; declares LaHood jokingly as he&apos;s finally dismissed after three hours of testimony.There&apos;s now a 10-minute recess, then we&apos;ll finally hear from Toyota&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda.  7.00pm: Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) is taking the opportunity to exercise a hobbyhorse - she&apos;s outraged over Japan&apos;s protectionism and says only 3% of the Japanese market is open to US cars or automotive parts. Does Toyota&apos;s safety problem, she wonders, result from an attitude of market superiority and a false confidence?  6.50pm: For pity&apos;s sake. Joseph Cao, congressman from Louisiana, would just like to thank the transport secretary for everything he&apos;s done for Louisiana, particularly the state&apos;s second congressional district, and for his recent visit down south. He has no questions though.  6.37pm: Bit of melodrama. Congressman Bilbray declares that &quot;people are dying on the streets of San Diego county&quot; and that it&apos;s regulators&apos; fault for not getting on top of the problem.  6.35pm: The forensic examination of America&apos;s transport secretary, Ray LaHood, continues as everyone waits for the real event of the day - a quizzing of Toyota&apos;s president, Akio Toyoda.Brian Bilbray (C-California) declares himself a Toyota driver and wonders whether the Japanese firm&apos;s stellar reputation, alongside Mercedes and Porsche, at the top of satisfaction tables, created an inverted prejudice against strict review of the company.LaHood gives a brief answer to a very long question, simply replying that he doesn&apos;t think so.  6.20pm: More gesticulating with props! Dan Burton (R-Indiana) is waving around two gas pedals - one made in Japan and one in the US. He demands - why is only one of them faulty? The question appears to be rhetorical as the US transport secretary isn&apos;t given time to reply.  6.13pm: A Massachusetts Democrat, Stephen Lynch, thinks Toyota&apos;s dodgy accelerators are a software problem, rather than slipping floor mats or sticky pedals. He says Apple&apos;s co-founder Steve Wozniak, who apparently owns a Toyota Prius, agrees with him. Lynch says it&apos;s wrong to call in drivers, replace their floormats and send them out again thinking their cars are safe.  5.58pm: The wonderfully named Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) wants the US department of transport to be extra cautious that it doesn&apos;t display favouritism in the car industry towards GM and Chrysler, in which the government owns large stakes.&quot;When it comes to safety, there will be no compromises. There will be no sweetheart deals, there will be no cosy relationships,&quot; replies LaHood robustly. &quot;You have my commitment on that.&quot;  5.52pm: The US transport sec denies a &quot;cosy relationship&quot; between US safety regulators and the motor manufacturing industry.&quot;There is not a cosy relationship,&quot; says LaHood. &quot;In the last three years, we&apos;ve recalled 23 million cars.&quot;  5.28pm: Clearly getting impatient, LaHood asks for a 10-minute &quot;restroom break&quot;. The committee goes into recess.  5.24pm: Interesting piece from The Economist asks whether Toyota&apos;s problems root back to a target set in 2002 to raise the company&apos;s global market share from 11% to 15%. Argues that the company became reliant on an &quot;outer ring&quot; of suppliers outside Japan who it didn&apos;t keep a close eye on and didn&apos;t have a long relationship with.  5.21pm: &quot;Toyota became a little bit safety deaf,&quot; says the US transport sec. &quot;I also believe their business model for communicating between North America and Japan needs some change.&quot;He adds: &quot;They need to listen to one other and hear what one another are saying.&quot;  5.15pm: Q: &quot;Do you believe Toyota has been slow to respond to these issues?&quot;LaHood: &quot;Yes I do. That&apos;s the reason we went to Japan. That&apos;s the reason I spoke to Mr Toyoda directly.&quot;  5.14pm: Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-Washington DC) wants to know about the notorious culture of secrecy in Japan: &quot;Have you had difficulty penetrating the Toyota culture which teaches that these are issues that should not be aired in public?&quot;LaHood admits there have been &quot;some issues&quot; but says he&apos;s picked up the phone and talked directly to Toyota&apos;s president, and that staff from his department were dispatched to Tokyo to meet the carmaker face-to-face.  5.03pm: Mark Souder (R-Indiana), who represents a car manufacturing district, is trying to inject some common sense into proceedings. He asks LaHood if it&apos;s true that no vehicle can possibly be 100% safe.The transport secretary won&apos;t give a straight answer: &quot;Our goal is to make every vehicle a hundred percent safe.&quot;  4.58pm: It&apos;s the turn of left winger Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), who wants to know whether the US government has the power to send investigators to Tokyo to rifle through Toyota&apos;s internal records and see what it knew, when, about dodgy accelerators.LaHood replies: &quot;We have asked for a voluminous amount of information from Toyota which we&apos;ll review. If we have to go to Japan and meet with their engineers and get more information, that will be part of our review.&quot;  4.50pm: A curious phenomenon - a Republican congressman, John Mica, is criticising the department of transport for not spending enough. Mica wants to know why a budget increase of just $5m has been requested for the US road safety agency, NHTSA - &quot;it&apos;s a rather small amount&quot;.  4.44pm: They&apos;re arguing about whether the US road safety authority, NHTSA, has enough resources. LaHood says President Obama has authorised recruitment of 66 extra engineers.  4.36pm: Dan Burton (R-Indiana) wants to know why David Strickland, head of the safety agency NHTSA, isn&apos;t giving evidence. LaHood says the safety boss has &quot;only been on the job for 40 days&quot; and it would be unfair to make him appear.  4.32pm: &quot;I love Portuguese sardines,&quot; announces Kanjorski, going off at a slightly eccentric tangent. &quot;But if somebody died from botulism from eating sardines, I would have no idea where to go, what to do or who to inform.&quot;  4.31pm: Paul Kanjorski (D-Pennsylvania) says it&apos;s the biggest attendance of press and public he&apos;s ever seen at one of the committee&apos;s hearings: &quot;Obviously we&apos;ve struck a nerve.&quot;  4.29pm: Darrell Issa has a prop! He&apos;s produced a Toyota pedal and is gesticulating with it rather assertively.  4.28pm: The Washington Post&apos;s Dana Milbank has a scathing column about yesterday&apos;s evidence by Toyota&apos;s US chief, Jim Lentz. He says he suffered from repeated amnesia: &quot;Lentz&apos;s stammering performance put the &apos;oy&apos; in Toyota.&quot;  4.24pm: Towns: &quot;Do you think it&apos;s safe to drive a Toyota today?&quot;There&apos;s a rather equivocal response from LaHood, who says his department&apos;s website lists all cars up for recall: &quot;I want the owners of every one of those vehicles to take it to their dealer and make sure it gets fixed.&quot;  4.22pm: A full version of LaHood&apos;s opening statement is here. He says he met last night with the Saylor family who lost 4 relatives in a Toyota crash in San Diego last year, and offered condolences.&quot;We will not sleep at DoT and will will work 24 hours to make sure every Toyota vehicle is safe to drive.&quot;  4.17pm: LaHood says government safety agency receives 30,000 complaints every year and looks at every one of them. There were 524 recalls last year involving 23m vehicles: &quot;We haven&apos;t been sitting around on our hands. When people complain, we investigate.&quot;  4.14pm: Transport secretary Ray LaHood has been sworn in and is giving an opening statement. He says safety is his department&apos;s &quot;number one priority&quot;. For some reason, he&apos;s talking about texting while driving. Says he&apos;s on a &quot;rampage&quot; about it because it&apos;s a menace to society.  4.08pm: Over to Darrell Issa, the ranking Republican on the committee, who has been polling his constituents on Twitter over what to ask. Top question in his poll is whether the US government is biased because it owns stakes in Toyota&apos;s rivals, General Motors and Chrysler.  4.05pm: There have now been 39 deaths associated with sudden acceleration in Toyotas, says Towns: &quot;If the Camry and the Prius were airplanes, they would be grounded.&quot;  4.03pm: Committee chairman Edolphus Towns (D-New York) has gavelled us in, and proceedings are off. He&apos;s starting with a lurid description of a fatal Lexus crash in San Diego that caused the death of an entire family.Since 2000, he says one insurance company, State Farm, has reported more than 900 cases of &quot;SUA&quot; - sudden unintended acceleration - in Toyotas.Towns says he&apos;s sceptical that sticky pedals and floor mats are the root cause of the difficulty. &quot;In the case of Toyota, there is striking evidence that the company was at times more concerned with profit than safety,&quot; says Towns.  3.58pm: The first panel today will comprise two government officials - transport secretary Ray LaHood and David Strickland, who is administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Akio Toyoda will follow a little later in panel number two. He&apos;ll apparently be delivering his opening statement in English but will then use an interpreter for questions and answers.  3.45pm: Well I wouldn&apos;t like to be in the Toyota president&apos;s shoes today. Akio Toyoda has travelled from Tokyo to give evidence in Congress about his company&apos;s safety crisis and he&apos;s likely to get a Washington-style tough ride. Toyoda, 53, is the grandson of Toyota&apos;s founder. He&apos;s been running the Japanese carmaker since June and the buck stops with him over faulty accelerators and brakes that have been linked to 19 deaths and have caused a worldwide recall of 8.5m vehicles. In written evidence, Toyoda has already humbly apologised, accepting that Toyota&apos;s runaway growth over the past few years has blurred the company&apos;s focus on safety.  Quite apart from shedding light on Toyota&apos;s handling of the scare, today&apos;s examination by the House committee on oversight and government reform promises to be an intriguing clash of cultures. It&apos;s highly unusual for a foreign captain of industry to appear before Congress. There&apos;s already been discussion on US television about whether Toyoda will literally bow to lawmakers. As CNN reports, Japanese dialogue tends to be somewhat indirect, unlike the confrontational style favoured in US politics. And Toyoda isn&apos;t really accustomed to the limelight - at the start of this crisis, he was nicknamed &quot;no-show Akio&quot;.     Jim Lentz on Capitol Hill yesterday    Let&apos;s hope he does better than Toyota&apos;s US boss, Jim Lentz, who put in an unconvincing performance before a different Congressional committee yesterday.

His father, Ben Thigpen, was a\u00a0distinguished performer in the swing era, known for his long tenure with Andy Kirk&apos;s Clouds of Joy but, ironically, played little part in his son&apos;s musical progress once he had separated from the boy&apos;s mother. With or without his father&apos;s tutelage, Ed Thigpen far surpassed his father in both his jazz accomplishments and his prominence in the genre, earning the title &quot;Mr Taste&quot; for his sensitivity and classy control. Marked out by peers and commentators for his exceptional yet understated command of percussive techniques, especially when using wire brushes, Thigpen worked and recorded with a wide range of musicians but was best known for his association with Oscar Peterson. In six years with the Canadian pianist, he made an array of highly regarded albums, working alongside the bassist Ray Brown in what for many was Peterson&apos;s finest trio. Thigpen was born in Chicago and spent his infancy in St Louis, where his father lived, but moved with his mother to Los Angeles in 1935 after his parents had split up. After the death of his mother when he was 12, the boy was placed with a family who had little interest in his musical aspirations and, indeed, actively disliked the drums. Despite this, he persevered and took lessons. In what was a\u00a0highly segregated city, Thigpen mixed with many other African-American youngsters who aspired to be jazz musicians. At junior school, he participated in a three-way drum battle in which he came third, before moving on to the city&apos;s Jefferson high school. This establishment gained renown as a\u00a0training ground for\u00a0musicians because of the inspirational tuition provided by its music teacher, Samuel Browne. Thigpen benefited from Browne&apos;s encouragement, as did the trumpeter Art Farmer, the saxophonist Dexter Gordon and the drummer Chico Hamilton, all of whom passed through the school swing band during the teacher&apos;s time. After a year in college studying sociology, Thigpen opted for the musical life \u2013 he had already played local gigs \u2013 and spent a year in St Louis with his father, whom he named, along with Count Basie&apos;s drummer Jo Jones, as his principal influence. By 1951 Thigpen was in New York, where he worked for six months with the ex-Duke Ellington trumpeter Cootie Williams&apos;s combo at Harlem&apos;s Savoy Ballroom before his military call-up. Posted first to Fort Ord, in California, where he was a drum instructor, he served in Korea with the Eighth Army band. During a visit to Tokyo, Thigpen encountered Peterson for the first time when the Jazz at the Philharmonic (JATP) troupe was playing there. He\u00a0knew then that he wanted to perform with Peterson and told Brown: &quot;I need to play with this group.&quot; Four years later, Thigpen replaced the guitarist Herb Ellis in Peterson&apos;s trio, which had thus far managed without a\u00a0percussionist. Back in New York after demobilisation, Thigpen worked and recorded with the singer Dinah Washington and the pianists Toshiko Akiyoshi, Billy Taylor, Bud Powell and Lennie Tristano. The call from Peterson in 1959 led to a hectic period of travel, prestigious engagements and tours with the all-star JATP package, including visits to the UK. Thigpen impressed local critics with his bandstand authority, articulacy and courteous demeanour, often making time to conduct drum clinics and workshops. He was also a key presence on Peterson&apos;s recordings, including the critically lauded Songbook series and Night Train (1962), often cited as Peterson&apos;s finest album. After leaving Peterson, Thigpen joined Ella Fitzgerald&apos;s backing group for a year from December 1965, took on studio work and then returned to her band in 1968, staying for a further four years before trading continents and moving permanently to Copenhagen. He said race was a factor in his decision but added: &quot;In my case, it was the love of a woman.&quot; Using Denmark as his base, Thigpen built a considerable career as a bandleader, using younger Danish musicians and recording often. He linked up with other expatriate US musicians for club dates and tours, appearing at Ronnie Scott&apos;s in the 1990s with Roots, the all-star saxophone group, and was active as a teacher, running his own percussion studio. He wrote several drum manuals and was the subject of Don McGlynn&apos;s 2009 documentary film Ed Thigpen: Master of Time, Rhythm and Taste, its title an apt summary of Thigpen&apos;s personal and musical attributes. Always impeccably dressed and gracious in manner, Thigpen had suffered from Parkinson&apos;s disease latterly, yet continued to perform, last appearing in public in October 2009. He\u00a0is survived by his daughter Denise and his son Michael. Their mother, Inga-Lisa, died in 1981. \u2022 Edmund Leonard Thigpen, jazz drummer and teacher, born 28 September 1930; died 13 January 2010 \u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2010.

After all, as boss of Toyota, he is ultimately responsible for one of the biggest corporate crises in years. Around 8.5m Toyota cars have been recalled after developing problems with either acceleration or with brakes \u2013 problems that may have caused 39 deaths over the past nine years, and yet which have prompted the carmaker to take decisive action only in the last few weeks. Those facts on their own are damning enough for the world&apos;s largest carmaker. Yet much of the press has limited its condemnation to poor public relations. One respected commentator at the Financial Times criticised the auto giant merely for finding that &quot;sorry is the hardest word&quot; and urged executives to &quot;keep on apologising&quot;; that, presumably, would take the sting out of all those alleged deaths. For its part, the Economist has written off the entire affair as exemplifying the problems with Japanese corporate governance. Oh, if only those salarymen in Tokyo had learned from their counterparts in New York and London how capitalism should be done! Thankfully, the story laid out by US lawmakers yesterday was a simpler one. They began by telling a typical, and typically gruesome, story: a family got into a Lexus in San Diego, only to find that it suddenly accelerated for no good reason and crashed, leaving the entire family dead. Rather than thoroughly investigate mysterious episodes like these, Toyota executives concentrated on limiting damage to their employer&apos;s reputation. They bragged about &quot;favourable recall outcomes&quot; and initially called back only a few thousand cars. US road-safety regulators were dutifully dozy, asking too few questions until far too late. This is not about different modes of corporate management, or poor PR. It is about a company too fixated on becoming the world&apos;s number one to avert tragedy. That explanation does not come from another corner of the press, but from Mr Toyoda himself, who yesterday reiterated that his company had been too focused on growth and had &quot;confused&quot; its priorities. One could put it more plainly still, as former Toyota executive Jim Press has, describing his old employer as being &quot;hijacked&quot; by &quot;anti-family, financially oriented pirates&quot;. In so doing, a widely admired company has wrecked its reputation, ensured it will suffer years of poor performance \u2013 and in the process harmed the prospects for Japan&apos;s struggling economy. The best that can be said is that now the company has come clean it can start the long haul of rebuilding its relationship with consumers. To do so, it will need regulators to act tough and so prove that the company&apos;s cars are safe."}, {"sentences": ["Up until now, you could only buy them in Paris or Tokyo."], "tags": ["French food and drink", "Dessert", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-25T00:05:06Z", "title": "Are these the world's best macarons?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/25/macarons-pierre-herme", "article": "Ever since the fancy French patissier, Ladur\u00e9e, opened a shop in Harrods a few years ago, macarons have become a growing obsession among sweet-toothed gourmands in the UK. These brightly coloured, mini meringues, daintily sandwiched together with gooey fillings, have become a holy grail for cookery fanatics too, and hotly debated recipes abound with entire books and food blogs dedicated to them. I should explain that the French &quot;macaron&quot; is not the same creature as our English macaroon. Chewy English macaroons are made either by beating together ground almonds and caster sugar with some egg white, or by folding the almond and sugar into whisked egg white, before the resulting paste is placed in blobs on rice paper, and baked. Ours are an easy to make, tea-time treat, robust enough to be broken up into a trifle. The French version is a smooth-skinned, soft and delicate round of naughtiness that comes in every imaginable colour and flavour. At the risk of confusing things further, the term &quot;macaron&quot; now commonly refers to what is technically a &quot;gerbet&quot;, a pair of macarons sandwiched together with ganache (chocolate truffle cream), or butter cream. In Paris, a patissier is judged on his macarons and the current undisputed master is Pierre Herm\u00e9, who has just begun to sell his macarons in Selfridges in London. Up until now, you could only buy them in Paris or Tokyo. In 1976, aged 14, he was apprenticed under the innovative patissier Gaston Len\u00f4tre. At that time, macarons came in four guises: coffee, chocolate, vanilla and raspberry. &quot;I didn&apos;t really like macarons, they were too sweet for me&quot; says Herm\u00e9. &quot;I started to experiment with them in the mid 1980s,&quot; he says. &quot;I tried creating different flavours, such as lemon, pistachio, salted caramel and mandarin.&quot; The result caused a sensation in France. They are, to put it mildly, the most delicious macarons you could ever wish to munch. Take his pistachio flavour \u2013 an early Herm\u00e9 classic. You bite through the thinnest crisp crust into a soft, airy pistachio and almond meringue that melts into white chocolate and pistachio ganache, with just a hint of bitter almond. It is the way he combines new flavours with texture that really differentiates an Herm\u00e9 macaron from the rest. You cannot tell how or when the meringue becomes filling \u2013 the transition is so smooth \u2013 and as you eat, the texture and flavours change and develop in your mouth. The granular feel of quince melts on to your tongue as you eat his coing (quince) and rose flavour, and whole blackcurrants burst in your mouth as you bite into the dark chuao chocolate-and-currant-flavoured ganache of his Chuao variety. I start to feel a desperate desire to fully understand how they are put together. Could I recreate, I begin to wonder, such a perfect, otherworldly confection, as an Herm\u00e9 macaron?     Sybil Kapoor's chocolate macaron. Photograph: Graham Turner    The English version of Herm\u00e9&apos;s book, Macaron, isn&apos;t due to be published until later this year, so I ask Herm\u00e9 HQ direct for its easiest recipe, which turns out to be the Macaron au Chocolate Amer. Unlike the majority of macaron recipes published in Britain, it is made with an Italian meringue, which gives greater stability in the face of squishy fillings. You whisk a hot sugar syrup into whisked egg whites, before folding in extra raw egg white, sifted ground almonds and icing sugar, and melted 100% pure unsweetened chocolate. This mixture is piped into rounds, dusted with unsweetened cocoa powder and tapped to remove air pockets. It is then lightly covered and allowed to dry for 30 minutes to help ensure a smooth skin, before being baked at 180C for exactly 12 minutes. Once cool, it is filled with a ganache made with creme fraiche, butter, valrhona guanaju chocolate and more 100% chocolate. Herm\u00e9 is very particular about his ingredients. Finally, it is left in the fridge for 24 hours before eating so that the meringue softens into the filling. Despite me making two batches, my macarons are not up to the Herm\u00e9 standard. They have a distinctly macaroonish air, being somewhat chewy and crusty, and the first batch puff up to double their size. They do taste good, but not nearly as good as his. I console myself by remembering that Herm\u00e9 has spent a lifetime perfecting his skills, and I now feel completely guilt-free about shelling out \u00a31.70 for the odd Infinite Vanille, say, or the strawberry and wasabi-flavoured Magnifique."}, {"sentences": ["This new blog is linked to a festival of interactive performing arts taking place in Tokyo in March, and each post appears in both English and Japanese."], "tags": ["Arts policy", "Theatre", "Blogging", "Technology", "Arts funding", "Politics", "Stage", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-25T12:55:16Z", "title": "Noises off: Can bloggers save theatre funding? | Chris Wilkinson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/feb/23/theatre-bloggers-arts-funding", "article": "This week, we are harvesting a crop of new British theatre blogs that have recently sprung up out of the ether. The first of these is a new site about interactive theatre hosted by the British Council and curated by Andy Field. Field is building himself quite a cyber-empire at the moment \u2013 not only does he keep his own blog here but he is also a frequent contributor to the Guardian and writes regularly for the Forest Fringe website, of which he is co-artistic director.  This new blog is linked to a festival of interactive performing arts taking place in Tokyo in March, and each post appears in both English and Japanese. Frustratingly, these two translations are intercut, making the whole thing quite tricky to read. Nonetheless, it is worth persisting, as there are some extremely good posts up at the moment \u2013 including this one on intimacy and theatre which covers work from artists such as Adrian Howells, Francesca Steele and Ontroerend Goed; and this one on games and performance, which explores the political impact of making a piece of theatre whose form relies fundamentally on interactivity.  Elsewhere, the director and writer Chris Goode is drawing attention to another new blog that has emerged recently, Transductions. Goode says the site has &quot;some fine writers and artists hanging out there, the quality of thinking and finding-out seems to me remarkable&quot;. It describes itself as &quot;a blog collective dedicated to rethinking the obscure, the obvious, the open and the obscene. It aims to offer an environment designed for the unapologetic propagation, interrogation and (de-)creation of arts, and socioaesthetic forms and themes, of all kinds.&quot; This might sound intimidating at first, but it is well-written and covers an impressive range of subjects, so it is worth a look.  Yet perhaps the most important new blog of the last few weeks is this one run by Jonathan Holmes of the Jericho Project, which aims to be a place for &quot;influencing policy for the arts&quot;. It arose out of a discussion held at Devoted and Disgruntled about how the result of the upcoming election will affect the arts. As Holmes argues, &quot;it&apos;s probable that the next governmental spending review will have a devastating outcome for all in the arts unless we act very quickly. It follows that the time to do something about this is now, when there&apos;s a chance of influencing election manifestos and campaign pledges, rather than after the fact, when the task will be so much harder.&quot; As things stand, the blog has been pretty quiet since its creation, but we can only hope that this changes. There is clearly a great deal of concern over how the arts might fare, particularly if we end up with a Tory government. Many are not convinced by Tory shadow arts minister Jeremy Hunt&apos;s assurances that things will ultimately be OK. Aleks Sierz of the Pirate Dog blog dismisses Hunt&apos;s plans to increase private philanthropy, saying &quot;this Hunt really is such a comedian. In the worst recession since the second world war, he expects the rich and powerful to not only keep giving but to give more.&quot; Perhaps this new site could take inspiration from the Dublin Central Arts Workers blog, which was set up to enable artists in Ireland to lobby their government on very similar issues.

Lonely widower Frank Goode travels around the \u00adcountry in a fraught attempt to round up his busy grownup children for the first \u00adfamily get-together since their mother&apos;s funeral eight months previously. This is a sweet-natured film on the saccharine borderline, but with interesting moments; it does not deserve the cold critical response it has so far been given in the US, and the 66-year-old De Niro gives what, for my money, is his first decent, watchable performance in quite a while. British writer-director Kirk Jones has persuaded him to turn the heat down under his trademark \u00admannerisms and tics. It is good for once not to see the rat-trap mouth, the incline of the head, the sudden crinkly faced grin. His calm, careworn, less iconic and more human face is restfully presented to the camera. That said, it could and should have been better. De Niro and his \u00adsupporting cast are good, and there is a third-act \u00adcrisis and revelation \u00adcleverly \u00adconstructed so that the audience, for a second, shares Frank&apos;s stunned \u00adincredulity. But the power of that \u00adrevelation evaporates very quickly and, considering the pain of all that has gone before, the movie&apos;s final minutes are very slushy. The irony and the realism that had appeared built into the title are utterly expunged. Jones may have been aiming for something like Alexander Payne&apos;s About Schmidt or even Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story. He may have studied the genetics of dysfunction in Jonathan Franzen&apos;s novel The Corrections. This film, frankly, is in a lower league than any of these: and yet it is touching and intelligently acted. Frank is first-generation \u00adworking class, a retired guy with cardiac and \u00adrespiratory problems through \u00adhaving put in long, hard hours in a factory creating the PVC casing for telephone wires. His dedicated work and \u00adeducation ethic have put his children through c\u00adollege and into what Frank understands to be rewarding careers. But David (Austin Lysy), Rosie (Drew \u00adBarrymore), Amy (Kate Beckinsale) and Robert (Sam Rockwell) disappoint him dreadfully, one by one, by claiming to be too busy to come home for the family barbecue that Frank had been preparing. Only now does Frank understand that it was his late wife who had the relationship with the children. They told her everything and him nothing. Keeping him in the dark was how, as adults, they managed the \u00adrelationship. So Frank sets out to make \u00adunannounced visits to each of his kids in turn, with a shrewd sense of how it will embarrass and discomfit them, but with a complex need for apology: an apology to them for having been a tough and standoffish father, but also an apology from them \u2013 for not being straight with their dad. Medical issues mean that Frank can&apos;t travel by plane, so it will have to be train and Greyhound bus, allowing Jones to create the traditional melancholy spaces of the road movie. Big, gaunt empty bus stations are shown, in which Frank&apos;s lonely anoraked form looks vulnerable. We will see the interior of a train carriage, and then spot De Niro&apos;s face, miniaturised in its solitude, in a corner of the screen. And as his train whizzes along, we hear, along those same \u00adundulating telephone wires that he helped to encase, his children&apos;s tense conversations, desperately warning each other that their dad is on his way. Secrets have to be covered up. His most successful child appears to be Amy (Beckinsale), a high-flying ad executive with a stunning modernist home and a sensational corner office, to which he is uncomfortably invited and even impulsively asked to hear an ad pitch, on the grounds that the product is targeted at the older demographic. But there is something weirdly wrong with Amy&apos;s marriage and her relationship with her teenage son. Jones contrives an affecting yet tense scene in which Frank tries to bond with the boy through a game of golf. Robert (Rockwell) was \u00adsupposed to be an orchestra conductor, but Frank is furious to discover that his son is merely timpani. Frank makes a \u00adcharacteristically maladroit appearance at a \u00adrehearsal, his wheelie suitcase thumping and bumping so as to throw the players off their rhythm. Rosie \u00ad(Barrymore) lives in Las \u00adVegas, a dancer at a big hotel show that has apparently closed just before Frank \u00adarrived; but there is something weirdly amiss about her life. And David \u00adappears to be absent from his New York apartment. The \u00adclimax of Frank&apos;s \u00adbemusement and \u00adanxiety comes with a hallucinatory dream sequence in which he confronts them as little kids, and \u00addemands to know the truth: a bold if \u00admelodramatic scene whose potential to shock and \u00addisturb is consciously, and a little \u00adfrustratingly, withheld by the director. It is a refreshingly open, untricksy performance from De Niro, and very possibly the harbinger of an \u00adexcellent late period for him as an actor. As for the film, well \u2026 &quot;fine&quot; is what can \u00adreasonably be said.

The lineup: Nick Blank (vocals, music). The background: We were going to talk today about Cibelle, the MIA of Brazilian exotic pop, but we decided she wasn&apos;t new enough. Japayork, on the other hand, is so brand spanking new he&apos;s got the shiny coat of a freshly painted car \u2013 don&apos;t worry, not a Toyota. Japayork isn&apos;t his real name \u2013 don&apos;t be silly, no, it&apos;s Tokyocisco. Just kidding. We don&apos;t know his real name, apart from the first bit (&quot;Nick&quot;), so for the &quot;lineup&quot; bit above we made up a surname \u2013 &quot;Blank&quot; \u2013 because we thought it suited this clever little synth kid and his coolly emotional, catchy computer pop. With apologies, of course, to Boris Blank of Yello. We don&apos;t know much about the 22-year-old, apart from the fact that he&apos;s 22, and that he used to live in Tokyo and New York, and now resides in London where he works as a videographer and graphic designer. Tokyo, New York, London \u2013 he just needs to spend some time in Paris and Munich and he&apos;d be pretty much living the chorus from that old M song. Anyway, when he&apos;s not designing album artwork, he&apos;s remixing other musicians and making his own electronic pop songs, as well as well as the videos to go with them. What else? He&apos;s got high hair with one of those slick quiffs, like Frankmusik&apos;s and Erik Hassle&apos;s, that would be great to ski-jump off if you were tiny, and he&apos;s apparently on the verge of signing a mega record deal, so expect to see that audacious coiffe plastered all over billboards soon. Or not. What have we got to do to get one of these electronic pop gentlemen in the charts? Of all the recent electro pop boys \u2013 Frank, Hassle, Tommy Sparks, Dan Black \u2013 not one of them has yet managed to do what the L girls (La Roux, Little Boots, Lady Gaga) have, even if Ladyhawke didn&apos;t quite do the business, so there goes our theory about the letter &quot;L&quot; being a virtual guarantee of success. Japayork \u2013 who reckons he looks good in anything with sequins and claims to be from the future, although we&apos;d swear he was a refugee from 1981 \u2013 has got as good a chance as any of them, with a clutch (car pun from earlier paragraph intended) of spiffing, exuberant synth-pop tunes under his belt, incidentally a trendy designer one from Hoxton Market. So New is as fizzy as early Depeche or that other current remixer with solo-star ambitions, Starsmith. Our Now is mooted as his lead single, and has a throbbing pulse that makes you think of heavily maquillaged 80s frontcreatures with asymmetrical fringes. Teenagers opens with a scary Dark Vader evil robot voice and has a Pet Shop Boys-worthy hook. Best of all, and one of the first songs this year to make us think we need to start compiling our list of Tracks of 2010, is I Need It All, a fabulous burst of happy-sad hi-NRG boogie with a minor-chord verse and ecstatic chorus. We bet when he&apos;s at a club he dreams about going home and crying and wanting to die. The buzz: &quot;Lush, layered synth tunes and personal lyrics are sure to strike a chord with most people who hear them.&quot; The truth: It could be fifth time lucky for the synth-boy generation. Most likely to: Mash up Our Now and How Soon Is Now. Least likely to: Eat mash. What to buy: On Spotify you can hear a remix of a Temposhark track that he did, but apart from that there&apos;s nothing to buy till he gets signed.

There are simply masses of openings, and while Richard Eyre&apos;s West End revival of Private Lives has the star pulling power of Kim Cattrall and Matthew Macfayen, many more exciting gems are out of London. I&apos;ll be heading to the Drum in Plymouth to catch Bejan Sheibani&apos;s production of Sarah Ruhl&apos;s Eurydice, a play much admired in New York and which is touring before heading to the Young Vic. The Young Vic, by the way, has the pick of this week&apos;s London openings, with Luc Bondy directing David Harrower&apos;s new version of Schnitzler&apos;s sex tragedy, Sweet Nothings. I&apos;ll be stopping off at the Theatre Royal Bath to see Rosmund Pike fire her pistols in Hedda Gabler, and I&apos;m also going to Northampton, where the Addicted to You season includes DC Moore&apos;s Honest and a revival of David Hare&apos;s My Zinc Bed. I&apos;ll also visit the Mercury in Colchester for a tango-style Romeo and Juliet that sounds pretty good. But that only scratches the surface of the potential pleasures on offer: The Marquez Brother&apos;s The Dark Side of the Buffoon sounds really intriguing; it&apos;s at the Belgrade in Coventry, before heading for the Lyric Hammersmith. The latter opens Jeremy Dyson and Andy Nyman&apos;s Ghost Stories on Monday.  Forever in Your Debt at Warwick Arts Centre in a collaboration between Foursight Theatre and Talking Birds is on a topical subject, while Sebastian Barry&apos;s Andersen&apos;s English continues to tour, and is at West Yorkshire Playhouse and the Library Manchester this week. Also in Manchester, Matthew Dunster&apos;s version of 1984 at the Royal Exchange. On Saturday I&apos;m going to the fabulous little Brentwood theatre to see Eastern Angles&apos; The Long Way Home, and at some point in the future I hope to catch up with Theatre Alibi&apos;s The Ministry of Fear which appears at the Northcott in Exeter this week despite the fact that the theatre has gone into administration.  Lots of good stuff in Scotland. It&apos;s your last chance for the NTS&apos;s brilliant Wall of Death, and you want to get your skates on for The Government Inspector and Martin Crimp&apos;s The City, both at the Tron, although the former then goes out on tour. New Territories starts this week too, leading up to National Review of Live Art at the Arches in March. Martin McDonagh&apos;s The Beauty Queen of Leanane sounds as if it&apos;s getting a good revival at the Royal Lyceum, and, further down, back in England, I can personally vouch for Paul Kerryson&apos;s The Lieutenant of Inishmore at the Curve in Leicester.  Other things I rate include the delightful A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream at the Tobacco Factory in Bristol (much more fun than Hall&apos;s Rose revival, although Hall had the benefit of a radiant Judi Dench) and Mercury Fur at Picton Place, and there is fun to be had at Kneehigh&apos;s Hansel and Gretel - at Salisbury Playhouse over the weekend before heading for the Nuffield, Southampton. I haven&apos;t seen Arden of Faversham directed by Terry Hands at Theatre Clywd, but there are certainly good reports and it&apos;s a real curiosity. Of course Alfred Hickling gave five stars to The History Boys at West Yorkshire Playhouse, which also plays host next week to Talawa&apos;s revival of Mustapha Matura&apos;s Rum and Coca Cola. Hugh Hughes&apos; 360 is at Liverpool and Oxford as its heads towards the Pit. The latter has Lone Twin&apos;s Catastrophe trilogy playing this week. You should be booking your tickets for the Royal Court&apos;s revival of Debbie Tucker Green&apos;s Random, which starts in a shop in Elephant and Castle before heading out on tour, and also getting the brochure for the Brighton Festival \u2013 it includes new pieces from Dreamthinkspeak and Rimini Protokoll. The Norfolk and Norwich festival brochure should be out soon too, and is likely to have a few coups. In London this weekend, deepblue&apos;s You are Here is a hybrid of dance and installation at the Lilian Baylis studio and there is a fantastic upcoming week at BAC. Rush to get tickets for Deborah Pearson&apos;s intimate performance in the local library called Something Very Quiet is About to Happen, and take a look too at Polar Bear&apos;s Return and The Poof Downstairs, a black comedy created by Jon Haynes, one half of Ridiculusmus. Little Bulb are also creating mayhem with Sporadical and Third Angel stop by with class of &apos;76.

But with hindsight, the real winner to emerge from the process was not an ensemble, but an individual. The Latvian Mariss \u00adJansons found himself in the remarkable position of being the only conductor in charge of two of Gramophone&apos;s top-10 orchestras: Amsterdam&apos;s Royal Concertgebouw orchestra \u2013 which came out on top, narrowly beating the\u00a0Berlin Philharmonic \u2013 and the sixth-ranked Bavarian \u00adRadio Symphony \u00adorchestra. Unsurprisingly, Jansons is reluctant to make distinctions between excellence at this level. &quot;Of course they are both very, very good,&quot; he says, &quot;and in my position, I treat them equally. A \u00adlittle as if they were two sons.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t mean he objects to differentiating between excellence and mediocrity. &quot;Brought up&quot; in the Riga opera house by his singer mother and conductor \u00adfather, he learned his craft as a conductor in Leningrad in the fiercely competitive Soviet music system. He earned a reputation as an orchestra builder in Oslo in the 1980s, when he steered the Oslo Philharmonic from obscurity to international stardom. He then moved to Pittsburgh, where he became a leading figure on the world stage, before his triumphant return to European music-making in Amsterdam and Munich. &quot;You always have to fight for the best,&quot; he says. &quot;That took different forms. In the Soviet Union music was respected, but there were many other problems. In Oslo you had to battle for the art itself.&quot; He spent 23 years in Norway, &quot;fighting first for better players and better salaries. And then for a new concert hall for us to play in.&quot; Jansons revolutionised the orchestra&apos;s sound, but didn&apos;t get his new hall, and when he left there were bad feelings on both sides. &quot;It was a strange thing,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Norway is a very democratic place where everyone must be equal. That is obviously good. But when it means that it is politically impossible to say that one orchestra is better than another, even though it is obvious, that makes things very difficult for art.&quot; Next week he is in London with the Bavarians, who are following Barenboim and his Beethoven concertos in the Southbank Centre&apos;s Shell Classic International series of concerts. In their only UK concert this year they will perform Shostakovich&apos;s 10th symphony, which marks a return to Jansons&apos;s roots. As a child he moved to Leningrad when his father, Arvid, became assistant to the legendary conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky, who had premiered many of Shostakovich&apos;s symphonies, including the 10th immediately after Stalin&apos;s death in 1953. Jansons was not only privy to his father&apos;s discussions with Mravinsky about the music, he later took over his father&apos;s job at the orchestra and met Shostakovich &quot;many times, but only really as an observer. He was a very nice man but also very nervous, and I remember him mostly for being quiet and polite.&quot; In mid-career Jansons consciously began to conduct less Russian work, partly because he was wary of being typecast and also because he wanted to explore new musical worlds. But he always kept conducting Shostakovich. &quot;I first became involved with his music when, even in the Soviet Union, his work was not as admired as it is today. Russian people were the first to understand it and love it because everything about it is so much about Russia. It has been wonderful to see his music embraced all over the world in the years since as it speaks to me in a very particular and important way.&quot; Shostakovich may be a special case, but Jansons&apos;s approach to music generally is as much spiritual as it is professional. &quot;For me the two most important things in this world are art and religion. We must take care in \u00adassessing the value of our life to support these two things. Everyone knows that if you go to the theatre or a concert, or read a great novel or go to a wonderful exhibition, then when you come away, so long as it is good, you are inspired. Great music, and all great art, is food for your soul and your heart. Without it we might as well not exist.&quot; Even watching him rehearse, there appears an almost physical sense of him reaching into himself to tease out slow passages, and in the livelier sections his animated promptings see him leaving the podium to become airborne. In Munich last month, on his 67th birthday, he rehearsed for three hours in the morning, listened to a proposed CD recording in the afternoon, performed a concert in the evening and then attended a dinner in his honour given by Munich&apos;s political and business elite. The next day he took another three-hour rehearsal, gave a two-hour interview over lunch and performed again in the evening. While iron dedication and constitution-\u00adsapping schedules are par for the course for leading conductors, there is a sense that in Jansons&apos;s case, especially in the light of his medical history, the sheer intensity of his drive is elemental. In 1985 his father died of a heart attack in Manchester while working with the Hall\u00e9 orchestra. By coincidence, Jansons was conducting in the UK at the same time, but the show went on. In 1997 Jansons too suffered a heart attack, while conducting the closing scene of La Boh\u00e8me in Oslo. A second followed a few weeks later and he was fitted with a defibrillator. In Oslo, remarkably, even as he fell to the floor his right hand still attempted to keep time. &quot;Or at least that&apos;s what the orchestra said afterwards. I was unconscious so I don&apos;t know. But it didn&apos;t surprise me that much. Music has \u00adalways been so much more than simply what I do.&quot; Jansons was born in 1943 in Nazi-\u00adoccupied Riga, where his Jewish mother had to give birth in hiding. With the war over and the country under Soviet control, his parents returned to the \u00adopera house and Jansons went too. &quot;We didn&apos;t have a babysitter, so I went with them every day and it became part of me.&quot; At home he remembers playing &quot;Opera House&quot;, a game in which he would first pretend to be the conductor taking a rehearsal, &quot;and then I would change into my imaginary tails and I would conduct the performance. I would also sing and dance ballet and would take two pieces of wood and pretend to play the violin. Music absolutely filled my mind.&quot; He began to play the piano and violin seriously at the age of six and at 10 experienced his one and only glimpse of a possible life not utterly devoted to music. One of his neighbours in early-1950s Riga was a leading football coach who had watched him kick a ball about. The coach approached Jansons&apos;s parents to ask whether they might consider sending their son to a specialist sports school. &quot;They didn&apos;t hesitate even for a second,&quot; Jansons laughs. &quot;&apos;Absolutely not,&apos; they said. &apos;He will be a musician.&apos;&quot; And just as he followed his parents, so the Jansons dynastic tradition is continuing down the generations. His daughter from his first marriage is an accompanist at the Maryinsky theatre in St Petersburg \u2013 &quot;she, like me, didn&apos;t have a choice about music because we gave her music lessons when she was young&quot; \u2013 and his &quot;opera-obsessed&quot; granddaughter has just been offered a stage-manager job at the opera house. He now says that if the family had stayed in Riga he might have &quot;pressured my parents into doing something else. But instead we moved to Leningrad and everything changed.&quot; His father took up his conducting post in the city, and Jansons had to learn a new language, join a music school of extremely talented pupils and carry on his ordinary studies. &quot;I learnt how to work very hard. My mentality completely changed and I developed this great sense of responsibility and seriousness about my music. I became a different person.&quot; As his career progressed, he says, he had to overcome accusations of nepotism. &quot;In Russia at that time, if you were the child of a working man and you followed in your father&apos;s footsteps you gained respect,&quot; he explains. &quot;But that was not true if you came from the intelligentsia. There was suspicion.&quot; He began to step out of his father&apos;s shadow in 1968 when he was picked out by Herbert von Karajan from a masterclass of young conductors. Permission to work further with Karajan was refused by the Soviet authorities, but he was soon accepted on an exchange programme that allowed him to shadow the Austrian conductor at three Salzburg festivals. &quot;I was with him from nine in the morning until 11 at night every day. He was a great man with great ideas and because he was Karajan he could fulfil these ideas. He was like a bird flying in the air while the rest of us were on the ground. He seemed to be above it all and he could see everything.&quot; When Jansons won the Karajan \u00adconducting prize in 1970 he was offered a job by Mravinsky, and when his father died Jansons took his place as number two conductor at the Leningrad Philharmonic orchestra. Jansons has maintained his links with the orchestra and the city \u2013 from 1971 to 2000 he served as a part-time professor of conducting at the St Petersburg Conservatory and still maintains a home there, though he rarely has time to stay in it \u2013 and says that, despite the restrictions placed on him, when he looks back at the Soviet system he still sees good as well as bad. &quot;Of course there were injustices which everyone is glad have gone. But among the good things lost was a very high level of music education. I know it was partly political and about showing that the system, just as with sport, was better than the west. But it was nevertheless exemplary. And also, because we had few material goods, there was the compensation of a much higher spiritual value to life. Art was important and valued. Likewise friendship was very important because there were things that united us. Now money dominates everything and is the only measure. I would much prefer to see more of a balance between the material and the spiritual.&quot; When he was approached to take over the Oslo Philharmonic in the late 70s, the Soviet authorities again refused permission. But in one of the accommodations by which the system functioned, he was allowed to take on the responsibilities of the job without actually signing a contract. &quot;It is difficult to explain how it worked,&quot; he says. &quot;It was not the law of the country that you couldn&apos;t travel, it was a party rule. But they wanted foreign income. So while I was in Oslo I gave 90% of my \u00adearnings to the Soviet state. You could say I had received a wonderful education from them for free. But 90% was still a lot.&quot; It wasn&apos;t until Gorbachev and perestroika in the mid-1980s that Jansons&apos;s position was formalised in Oslo, but despite the uncertainty, and the disputes about a new concert hall, he elevated the orchestra to a new level of recognition. The rancour attached to his departure has recently been rekindled by the orchestra releasing a recording of him conducting Mahler&apos;s seventh symphony within months of the Bavarian Radio orchestra&apos;s recording of the same symphony \u2013 &quot;that was very stupid&quot; \u2013 but when he &quot;analyses the years we had together, I had a fantastic time. I was young and the \u00adorchestra was young, and we had a wonderful spirit. It is like first love. Even though it might end badly and you go on to other things, you don&apos;t forget it, and that whole process was something that probably happens only once in a lifetime between an orchestra and a conductor.&quot; In Munich he is again engaged in a campaign for a new concert hall to replace the poor acoustics and municipal drabness of the two halls the Bavarian Radio orchestra currently call home. He rates his chances of success as 50:50, &quot;which is not that good, but I am an optimist by nature. Munich is a rich city with a strong appreciation of music, so I think in this case it is more a matter of getting people to agree how to do it.&quot; If future programme planning is any guide, then the dispute will not result in him leaving Munich as he did Oslo, and it seems likely he will renew his contract when it expires in 2012, so allowing him to continue on the same musical and, by extension, spiritual path. His Lutheran faith has been a natural part of his life since childhood, and he is dismayed at what he sees as the moral decline of the modern world. &quot;I&apos;m not saying you can get rid of drugs or killing or corruption in an instant, but in the 21st century our spiritual life should be on a higher level than it is. I think children in the west should be in serious contact with both religion and the arts as a fundamental part of their education. They both make you think about important questions about the world: why we are here and how we should live.&quot; He says his health is good and his schedule is realistic, although he does complain that he finds it impossible not to keep working, even when supposedly on holiday. &quot;I do have a three-week vacation every year and in the first week I do no work at all but by the second I am studying scores. I know it would be better to have three weeks of no work at all, but it is very difficult for me after all my training. Since I was a child in the Riga opera house I have filled my life with thinking about music.&quot; It was when in a Swiss clinic, after the second heart attack, that despite never having smoked or drunk, he learned that he was a prime candidate for heart disease by dint of his genetic inheritance, diet, age and stress levels. Ostentatiously removing a large dollop of cream from his soup, he explains that his diet is now under control. &quot;But I am stuck with my genes and my age, and as for the stress . . . &quot; Although he has tried to take on less guest conducting, &quot;I know I haven&apos;t really slowed down enough. But I have two wonderful orchestras. I can come to great musical cities such as London and play the music of Shostakovich. If you&apos;re invited to conduct the Berlin or the Vienna Philharmonic, it is difficult to say no. I have long and friendly relationships with London orchestras and I want to play in New York and Vienna and Tokyo. What can you do? In the end, that&apos;s the thing about conductors. They don&apos;t retire.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["At Iruma military base in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, air force major Hiroshi Taniguchi is ready for anything.", "But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.", "Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution."], "tags": ["Japan", "Defence policy", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-02-28T20:20:27Z", "title": "Why Japan is ready for anything Pyongyang might want to throw at it", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/28/japan-defence-north-korea-china-missiles", "article": "At Iruma military base in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, air force major Hiroshi Taniguchi is ready for anything.

But even after offloading its Asian business, AIA, to Britain&apos;s Prudential for $35.5bn (\u00a323bn), the US insurer AIG faces an epic struggle to pay back the vast amount of money it received in a contentious bailout from American taxpayers. In three separate emergency injections of funding at the height of the credit crunch, AIG was handed $180bn by US authorities to avert a collapse considered likely to create a knock-on panic at the heart of the financial system. As a result, the US public owns 80% of the once-mighty insurer. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s responsible to say yet with certainty that the US taxpayer will or won&apos;t take a bath on AIG,&quot; said Bill Bergman, an insurance analyst at Chicago-based research firm Morningstar. AIG is beginning to show signs of improvement in revenue as customers, once scared by the possibility of bankruptcy, return to the insurer. But liabilities keep mounting in the company&apos;s core casualty business, which indemnifies individuals and companies against damage to themselves and their properties. &quot;They appear to have stopped the bleeding on incoming premiums,&quot; said Bergman. &quot;But they&apos;re pretty highly leveraged to the housing market and the credit market. Any further deterioration there is going to be a problem.&quot; At the core of AIG&apos;s original implosion was its financial products arm, largely run out of a Mayfair office in London, which wrote billions of dollars of credit default swaps protecting financial institutions against default by trading partners. Once considered low-risk, these blew up spectacularly when the US mortgage market collapsed. In Britain, the Serious Fraud Office is probing the division, once characterised by the Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke as a &quot;hedge fund \u2026 attached to a large and stable insurance company&quot;. AIG&apos;s financial products arm is being wound down and other businesses are on the auction block to pay back bailout funds, although the continuing recession has made it difficult to get decent prices. AIG has sold its US car insurance business, its Tokyo headquarters building, and a reinsurance division for a total of nearly $6bn. It has struck a deal to sell a Taiwanese operation and is negotiating to sell a foreign life insurance arm for a possible $15bn to MetLife. The company lost $10.9bn in 2009 \u2013 a hefty sum, but a significant improvement on its $99bn deficit in 2008. New boss Robert Benmosche, who became chief executive in August and condemned criticism of the company from &quot;lynch mobs with pitchforks&quot;, is widely credited with steering AIG towards calmer waters. To avoid the stigma of government support, the name AIG has been dropped from many businesses. The company&apos;s property and casualty business in the US is now known as Chartis. AIG&apos;s life and retirement insurances businesses in the US still have $240bn of assets, 16m customers and 300,000 staff \u2013 but the company is unlikely ever to reclaim the global dominance it once enjoyed."}, {"sentences": ["This week the British Council is hosting a raft of British artists and companies \u2013 including Tim Crouch, Melanie Wilson, Coney, Blast Theory, Stoke Newington International Airport with their Live Art Speed Dating and Duncan Speakman, amongst others \u2013 in a showcase of interactive performance at the Tokyo Performing Arts Market."], "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-02T12:43:55Z", "title": "Wisdom of the crowd: interactive theatre is where it's at | Lyn Gardner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/feb/28/interactive-theatre-connected-coney-lift", "article": "Five years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian arts pages about one-to-one performance. At the time these interactive performances in which it was just you and an artist \u2013 or, in one memorable case, just me, the artist and a very large, very dead pig \u2013 seemed as if they were merely an interesting sidestreet off the main theatrical highway. Not any longer. This week the British Council is hosting a raft of British artists and companies \u2013 including Tim Crouch, Melanie Wilson, Coney, Blast Theory, Stoke Newington International Airport with their Live Art Speed Dating and Duncan Speakman, amongst others \u2013 in a showcase of interactive performance at the Tokyo Performing Arts Market.  After years of politely ignoring them, British theatre has woken up to the audience, and the role they play in any piece of work. As Connected on-line curator, Andy Field, writes on the website and forum (which is well worth checking out) interactive performance &quot;is not a genre. This is not a niche.&quot;  Clearly not. New writing theatres such as The Royal Court and Soho are taking these developments very seriously, and the National Theatre, the National Theatre of Wales and festivals such as Brighton, Norfolk and Norwich and LIFT are beginning to understand the theatrical potential of collaborative creativity. It feels as if a real shift in the culture is taking place. The Connected showcase with its on-line discussions is a manifestation of this, but so too are projects such as Theatre Sandbox, which aim to help support and create theatre pieces using pervasive media technologies, which by their very nature often reframe the relationship between artist and audience.  Of course not all interactive theatre uses high technology. Adrian Howells&apos;s breathtakingly intimate Footwashing for the Sole takes the form of a simple ritualised encounter that merely utilises soap and water. Coney&apos;s brilliant Small Town Anywhere, a piece with no performers but merely a playing audience, is almost as low tech as you can get. But interesting possibilities do occur when the two combine. I recently had a conversation with one of the people involved in the Hide and Seek/Punchdrunk collaboration on the prototype of a piece called The Last Will, a hybrid of theatre and gaming, who commented that those like myself who came from a theatrical background arrived in the space and waited for something to happen, while the gamers immediately started pulling the set apart looking for clues (in one instance so thoroughly that he had to be stopped).  What this suggests is that audience behaviour \u2013 in particular, the traditional theatre behaviour of sitting politely in rows and not speaking \u2013 is a learned behaviour and one that can be quickly unlearned. We already see signs of that. Put people in a traditional theatre auditorium, and \u2013 with the exception of a few mobile phones going off \u2013\u00a0people behave traditionally. But let them loose in other spaces, and they now increasingly expect to get the opportunity to play, genuinely interact, curate their own experience of the work and feel that their presence really does make a difference \u2013 that being there matters. And if it really does matter, it changes the contract between artists and audiences. That&apos;s challenging, but also offers the potential for everyone to create, act and experiment together."}, {"sentences": ["If you are trying to convince a businessman in Tokyo to invest in the region, he will know the name of Birmingham but not some other places."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2010-03-02T19:21:08Z", "title": "Marketing the West Midlands: not such a hard sell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/heartofenterprise/marketing-the-west-midlands", "article": "The sheer variety of life within its borders makes the job of promoting the West Midlands to visitors and locals such a challenging task. How do you find common cause within an area that embraces Herefordshire farmers and Birmingham office workers, hi-tech researchers in Warwick and ceramicists in the Potteries? And a diverse countryside that encompasses both rolling moorlands and lush river valleys? And how do you market the region to potential investors and tourists from the other side of the world, who might know of both Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon, but not appreciate they are geographically so close? Or who might fail to realise that an idyllic rural holiday location in Worcestershire or Shropshire is but a few miles away from international transport links. This task has now fallen to a new regional marketing board, set up to lead on the promotion of the region&apos;s strengths under the &quot;Heart of England&quot; banner. &quot;It is a label we are sure we can make people feel comfortable with,&quot; says Professor Michael Clarke, the board&apos;s chairman. Altering attitudes  Changing both external and internal perceptions is therefore a major challenge for Clarke. As the board&apos;s strategic framework states: &quot;We are an innovative, well-connected and enterprising region . . . we enjoy outstanding natural and cultural assets and live in vibrant cities, historic towns and beautiful rural landscapes. However, it is evident that perceptions of the region do not always match this reality.&quot; The framework acknowledges that many people feel much greater affiliation with their local area or England than with the region, and research shows that it had the lowest number of business leaders, compared to other regions, who would strongly recommend the West Midlands to others. The board has therefore set itself a five-year programme of achieving a cohesive message of &quot;pride and advocacy&quot; locally, aligning regional brands, products and services under the Heart of England &quot;signature&quot; and also simultaneously striving for recognition at home and abroad. Clarke believes this can best be achieved by concentrating on the self-evident strengths of the region \u2013 a tradition of hardworking enterprise and innovation that dates back to the birth of the Industrial Revolution; the special tourist attractions that range from Shakespeare country to Cannock Chase; and a central physical location giving easy accessibility and good transport connections \u2013 all of which help create a good quality of life for both residents, visitors and newcomers. Jewel in the crown Crucially, the board will seek to use the region&apos;s greatest asset \u2013 the city of Birmingham itself \u2013 as part of this. Even its most ardent supporters would admit that despite its position as the nation&apos;s second-largest city, home of the motor car and with a glorious history of industrial achievement, Birmingham has not had a good image. Although the urban core has been dramatically transformed in recent years, there is much ambitious work still to come, including the massive revamp of New Street station and the eastern side of the city centre, as well the potential expansion of Birmingham airport and the high-speed rail link to London. As the framework states, the city has achieved &quot;a critical mass&quot; as a business centre and leisure destination. Clarke acknowledges that the region had previously often been reluctant to focus on Birmingham because of fears of downplaying the strengths of the rest of the West Midlands. Not so now, he says. &quot;The strength of the region relies on the transformation of Birmingham into a vibrant, exceptional, multicultural, international city with global recognition. It is a magnet for the whole region and we should not ignore it.&quot; Others agree. James Watkins, director of Business Voice WM, which represents the region&apos;s Confederation of British Industry, chambers of commerce and other employer&apos;s organisations, says: &quot;Birmingham is a world city and a driver for the region. We are glad this is being recognised. It is an incredible asset, and a strong Birmingham means a strong West Midlands.&quot;  Professor David Bailey of Coventry University Business School says the focus is correct: &quot;It is the best way of selling the West Midlands. If you are trying to convince a businessman in Tokyo to invest in the region, he will know the name of Birmingham but not some other places. It gets their attention and you use it as a hook to get people in, then sell them the attractions of other parts.

As usual, it went like this: Stranger: Where are you from? [Translation: You look a bit brown. Why are you brown?] Me: London. Stranger: No, where are you really from? [Translation: You are clearly telling me untruths. Brown people do not come from London.] Me: London. Stranger (exasperated): No, where are your parents from? [Translation: Now you&apos;re just being obtuse.] Me: Africa and America. Stranger (confused): Erm \u2026 so where are your family from, like, back in the day? [Translation: People who come from Africa and America do not look like you.] Me: Iran, India, Africa, America and England. Stranger (relieved): India and Iran! Do you ever go back? At this point, I have to explain that it&apos;s hard to go back to somewhere you have never been. I&apos;ve lived in London since I was a zygote, have a London accent and don&apos;t speak any languages except English \u2013 yet just because I&apos;m cashew-coloured, I&apos;m often questioned about my heritage. Over the last five years, I&apos;ve been asked: &quot;What&apos;s your caste?&quot; (I haven&apos;t broken any bones); &quot;Do you go to temple?&quot; (only on my way to Embankment); and &quot;Do you need special food?&quot; (as though the answer&apos;s going to be: &quot;Yes, St Peter isn&apos;t going to let me in if I&apos;ve munched on a bit of dead pig/cow/giraffe&quot;). It&apos;s not that I&apos;m embarrassed about my ethnic background. I don&apos;t think about it much, though it&apos;s good for jokes (&quot;I&apos;m half Iranian, half American \u2013 so basically, I hate myself&quot;). But some people seem to want me to think about it. &quot;Why don&apos;t you visit Bombay?&quot; they enthuse. &quot;You&apos;d love it.&quot; They may be right, but have yet to explain to me why I&apos;d love it more than Tokyo, or Guatemala, or any of the other places I haven&apos;t yet been. It&apos;s an odd misconception that you should somehow feel connected to a far-flung country because your ancestors lived there centuries ago, even if your entire life has been spent morris dancing in Loughborough. It&apos;s not that I think the questioners are all differently faced versions of Nick Griffin, either. I don&apos;t \u2013 they&apos;re probably just curious (except perhaps for the bloke who made a constipated noise when I told him my Dad was white). People with a different appearance often seem more interesting than those who look everyday, and questioners are clearly hoping for a more satisfying response than the mundane &quot;Right here&quot;. When they don&apos;t receive one, they probe. So my reluctance to enter The Conversation isn&apos;t due to shame or to fear of any dubious ulterior motives. It&apos;s partly down to exasperation at people thinking I&apos;m less British than them because I&apos;m brown; but it&apos;s mainly down to extreme boredom. The rundown of my convoluted four-continent-spanning genealogy takes ages unless I lie, and I&apos;ve started to deliver it in a funereal voice more monotonous than Tiger Woods&apos;s public apology. Luckily, I&apos;ve come up with a solution (one that could work for anyone in this situation, though you&apos;ll have to write your own version). I&apos;m going to print out large business cards, and the next time anyone tries to initiate The Conversation and doesn&apos;t accept &quot;London&quot; as the answer, I shall furnish them with the following: &quot;Hello! You may be surprised to learn that I have been asked this question before. Never fear: you shall have your explanation shortly. (Would you like to buy a TV by the way? I have one for sale; 24in screen, Samsung, five years old. Bit flickery, to be honest.) Right, are you sitting comfortably? Armchair? Cup of tea? Eccles cake? Then here goes: My maternal ancestors are Parsi Zoroastrians (I&apos;m not making this up) and hail from sunny Iran, currently home to uranium obsessives. Between AD700 and AD1000 the Parsis left Persia, as it was then called (I don&apos;t know the precise date, they didn&apos;t leave a note), and travelled to India. They stayed there for around a thousand years before getting a bit bored again (are you bored yet? I am, but then I&apos;m quite familiar with this story) and upping sticks for East Africa in the early 1900s. My grandad was a builder, though later he imported unfashionable jumpers from Nairobi featuring large pictures of sheep. They were the bane of my life in the playground, I can tell you. In 1966, lured by the fine climate and that lovely Enoch Powell, my mother&apos;s family moved to Britain and have been here ever since. They speak English and everything. Sadly I can&apos;t say the same for my father&apos;s family, who are all white Americans and live in the States. He moved here in 1970 and met my mother in London in 1978, though declined to apply for British citizenship. Do you know, this means I&apos;m allowed to vote in US elections even though I&apos;ve never been there? It sounds glamorous, but in 2008 I ended up voting for Barack Obama by fax in Printax Stationers in Clapham, which wasn&apos;t very exciting. So, that&apos;s the answer you were after. But me? I&apos;m from London.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["After taking much flack for creating ultra-potent beers, such as Tokyo (18.2%) and Hardcore IPA (9%), it seems that Nanny State - this &quot;paranoid hop overdose for a PC generation&quot; - is less about brewing than satire."], "tags": ["Beer", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-03T09:40:00Z", "title": "Big thirst for small beer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/mar/03/beer-strongest-weakest-best", "article": "Is it possible to brew a sarcastic beer?

It may have divided opinion on the beer blogs, but I think it&apos;s surprisingly good: explosively hoppy and beery for what is essentially pop. However, the spiel on the label - which, at some length, describes Nanny State as a beer for people left a &quot;quivering wreck&quot; by modern society: &quot;It&apos;s time to draw your net curtains, sit back with nanny and watch your favourite episode of Last of the Summer Wine&quot; - is so tart and mocking, you feel like a spineless coward for even considering it.  After taking much flack for creating ultra-potent beers, such as Tokyo (18.2%) and Hardcore IPA (9%), it seems that Nanny State - this &quot;paranoid hop overdose for a PC generation&quot; - is less about brewing than satire. It is BrewDog&apos;s message in a bottle, an attempt to make the brewer&apos;s critics look like idiots.  That BrewDog are publicly demonstrating that they could brew excellent lower-strength beers but choose not to seems to me a calculated attempt to further wind-up the Portman Group, Scottish MSPs and beer writer Roger Protz. Especially when BrewDog have closely followed Nanny State with their latest wheeze, Sink The Bismarck! At 41% ABV (and \u00a340 for a 330ml bottle) Bismarck! claims to be the world&apos;s strongest beer, narrowly beating rival Germany brewery Schorschbr\u00e4u&apos;s 40% Schorschbock.  It&apos;s all good fun this, but a bit frustrating, too. The world really doesn&apos;t need a 41% beer. Nor a 0.5% in-joke. No, in the face of a relentless rise in beer strengths, what the modern drinker needs and what BrewDog would be better applying their ingenuity to, is a genuinely brilliant, mid-strength session beer. It is a problem which few brewers seem keen to address, but if you a) love beer, b) would like to prolong the &apos;three-pint plateau&apos; (that period on a night-out where you&apos;re funny, chatty and relaxed, rather than dribbling incoherently in a corner), and c) are forever struggling to keep under 28 units a week, then there is almost nothing (good) out there to drink.  In recent years, there has been some limited movement in this direction, a small correction of the trend to continental strength 5%+ beers. Beck&apos;s Vier, Stella Artois 4% and Carling&apos;s 2% C2 were all launched, depending on who you listen to, to meet a massive new consumer demand; deceive drinkers into downing an extra pint or two each night; or to placate government. They may not be great or even good beers - Beck&apos;s Vier is the best of the bunch - but they do suggest a partial market shift toward less alcoholic beers.  CAMRA, meanwhile, has been urging Britain&apos;s craft brewers to go even lower. Each May it encourages brewers to produce a traditional mild-style beer (usually below 4%). In 2007, Hobson&apos;s Mild won CAMRA&apos;s Champion Beer of Britain competition outright. At the same time, and despite a lukewarm response from government (it had urged them to slash excise duty on beers below 2.8%), CAMRA is still working on plans to launch a national competition for such weaker beers. Personally, I don&apos;t think sub-2.8% beers are the answer. That is unnecessarily low. One problem, acknowledges, CAMRA&apos;s Iain Loe is that everyone&apos;s definition of what constitutes &apos;low&apos; strength is different. Moreover, I don&apos;t think that mild, a neglected, unfashionable and relatively dull beer style is the answer. But clearly there is much work to do. Browsing the bottled ale aisle at my local Sainsbury this week (other supermarkets are available), there is almost nothing in what I would consider the optimum session beer strength range, 3-4%. There are plenty of 5%+ beers to choose from, such as Black Sheep&apos;s Riggwelter (5.7%); Old Crafty Hen (6.5%); Suffolk Springer (6%); McEwan&apos;s Champion (7.3%), but I could only find two ales below 4%. Of those, Courage&apos;s Best Bitter (3.8%) is a peculiar taste that I&apos;m not desperate to acquire, and Mann&apos;s Brown Ale (2.8%) while pleasant, is probably best added to the gravy recipe on the back of the bottle. There were a handful of weaker canned beers available - Greene King&apos;s IPA (3.6%) the most tolerable. But turn to tins and you potentially open a whole other can of worms. For those of us who still drink in pubs it&apos;s also worth noting that the proper, cask versions of many ales are often a shade weaker than their bottled equivalent. But, even so, if you want to drink between 3-4%, you will struggle to find much beer worth getting excited about. Are British brewers missing a trick? Is there a thirst at Word of Mouth for decent mid-strength &apos;session&apos; beers? What do you drink when you want to get merry rather than mullered?"}, {"sentences": ["That would not have mattered if he had showed he was different from his predecessors, a Tokyo political commentator said."], "tags": ["Japan", "Conservatives", "Politics", "David Cameron", "Labour", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-03T14:30:00Z", "title": "A Japanese lesson for David Cameron | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/03/david-cameron-britain-japan-politics", "article": "Japanese people are fond of noting the similarities between their country and the United Kingdom. Both occupy islands situated on the edge of a continental landmass with which relations are sometimes awkward. Both are constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems. Both peoples, they say, set great store by traditions, good manners, well-kept gardens, and tea. The comparison does not usually stretch to party politics. But in the week that David Cameron launched an election campaign with the slogan Vote for Change, the parallels become harder to ignore. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, won a landslide victory last August with a similar mantra demanding &quot;regime change&quot;. His subsequent performance in office makes sober reading for Britain&apos;s Tories and those who may vote for them. Having successfully demonised the incumbent Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government for presiding over decades of waste, incompetence and corruption, Hatoyama&apos;s triumphant Democratic Party of Japan quickly ran into sleaze scandals of its own. DPJ secretary general and chief electoral strategist Ichiro Ozawa became enmeshed in a political funding investigation after three close associates were arrested for alleged falsification of records. Claims of financial irregularities involving other party figures have since come to light. And Hatoyama himself has not emerged unscathed after questions were raised about a previously undisclosed 900m yen inheritance from his 87-year-old mother. Like Cameron, the prime minister comes from a privileged background, and is seen by many Japanese as a bit of a toff. That would not have mattered if he had showed he was different from his predecessors, a Tokyo political commentator said. &quot;With the economy depressed, people are suffering hard times and they cannot accept money politics. They get angry, like with the MPs&apos; expenses in Britain ... Hatoyama promised change, and it turned out to be more of the same.&quot; Criticism of the centre-left DPJ extends to its handling of the economy, where deflation, falling tax revenues, and government debt amounting to almost 200% of GDP are intensifying a sense of British-style national decline. The days of the postwar Japanese economic miracle are long gone. Symbolically, and gallingly, China will overtake Japan this year as the world&apos;s second biggest economy. In an indicator of problems the Tories may face if they take power in Britain, the new government&apos;s promises to enact budget reforms, reprioritise public spending, introduce child benefits and extend free schooling remain unfulfilled and possibly unaffordable. On top of all that, a controversial shift is looming over immigration policy. Until now, self-consciously homogenous Japan has imposed strict limitations on any foreign influx. But an ageing population and a shrinking workforce means the country needs additional labour. Hatoyama has privately told officials to prepare for Japan&apos;s &quot;third opening&quot; to the world. The first came during the late 19th-century&apos;s Meiji Restoration, when Japan industrialised. The second came after the war in 1945. Now, says Hatoyama, a third social revolution is on the way. The DPJ&apos;s defenders say the party is genuine in its desire to put people first and break the grip of Japan&apos;s powerful bureaucrats on public policy. &quot;We really need to have a change in this country. Of course it&apos;s going to take time, after 50 years of the LDP. Of course they have made mistakes. We have to give them a chance,&quot; a sympathetic senior civil servant said. But domestic mis-steps combined with the prospect of a humiliating national climbdown \u2013 or a damaging confrontation \u2013 in a row with the US over the relocation of a military base in Okinawa have taken their toll on the new government&apos;s public standing. Six months into office, its approval ratings have slumped to about 40% amid speculation that coalition partners may peel away and Hatoyama may be forced to resign. &quot;The problem is they are still campaigning, not governing,&quot; a university analyst said. &quot;This is immature politics.&quot; As has often been the case in Britain in similar circumstances, the DPJ has one notable consolation. Even as it struggles to make its mark, its vanquished opponents, forced into unaccustomed opposition, are at each other&apos;s throats. Yoichi Masuzoe, the LDP&apos;s most popular leader, warned this week that he might form a breakaway party. The public now viewed the LDP as the &quot;lousy dumb party&quot;, he said, and if it did not quickly reform itself, it might never regain power. Cameron will hope this is the post-election fate that awaits Gordon Brown&apos;s Labour, and vice versa. As a political crunch looms ahead of upper house polls in July, Japan&apos;s new ruling party is in trouble. But its opponents are even worse off."}, {"sentences": ["Unite is seeking guarantees that these planes will not dominate routes such as New York and Tokyo, which are among the highest earners for existing cabin crew."], "tags": ["British Airways", "Airline industry", "Business", "Travel & leisure", "Air transport", "Travel", "Trade unions", "Politics", "Unite"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-05T19:31:20Z", "title": "Unite ready to agree to pay freeze and 'new fleet' to avert British Airways strike", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/05/british-airways-strike-unite", "article": "British Airways and trade union officials have set a deadline of 5pm on Tuesday to avert a cabin crew strike, as the Unite union considers tabling a compromise deal, including a two-year pay freeze for flight attendants. Unite&apos;s chief negotiator, assistant general secretary Len McCluskey, is considering a range of options as negotiators prepare a final offer to BA that could be tabled on Monday. According to sources close to the talks, Unite&apos;s options include: \u2022 A two-year pay freeze \u2022 A partial repeal of staffing reductions on flights \u2022 An agreement to create a &quot;new fleet&quot; consisting of new, lower-paid recruits on separate planes. The TUC, which is hosting the Unite and BA talks, said today that its general secretary, Brendan Barber, would end negotiations next Tuesday evening: &quot;On the initiative of Brendan Barber, both Unite and British Airways have now committed to the objective of completing these negotiations by close of play on Tuesday 9 March to determine whether or not a mutually acceptable settlement can be achieved.&quot; If the talks fail, Unite must provide seven days&apos; notice of strike action to BA, which means it can strike from 16 March at the earliest. It must stage a walkout by 22 March. But representatives at Unite&apos;s cabin crew branch, Bassa, have already started discussions on strike dates, and walkouts could be announced soon after the 5pm deadline if no agreement is reached. BA has demanded proposals from Unite that save at least \u00a360m a year on cabin crew costs, and officials from the union have been drafting these over the past few days. BA estimates that it will reach its savings target after it unilaterally cut crew levels from 15 to 14 on long-haul flights in November \u2013 a move that led to cabin crew voting for strike action last month. Unite is considering requesting a compromise that would see the 15th person put back on board on some of the busiest flights, with lower crew complements retained on the remaining services. The union says this will make up a substantial part of the \u00a360m cost savings. The rest would be achieved through a two-year pay freeze and, most significantly, a deal on the &quot;new fleet&quot; proposal. Unite is seeking guarantees that these planes will not dominate routes such as New York and Tokyo, which are among the highest earners for existing cabin crew. According to a BA presentation at the TUC talks, &quot;new fleet&quot; effectively creates a new airline within BA. The seniority system for cabin crew, where promotion is based on factors such length of employment, would be dismantled. This would allow senior staff to be recruited from outside BA into a new structure comprised of three roles: cabin crew, the new onboard post of customer service manager, and the office-based crew-team manager. It is likely that average pay would be brought in line with rival airlines such as Virgin Atlantic, which pays its flight attendants half as much as BA, according to the Civil Aviation Authority."}, {"sentences": ["Its insistence that Tokyo&apos;s new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan&apos;s democratic process."], "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "China", "US foreign policy", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-08T18:30:00Z", "title": "China threat can heal US-Japan rift | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/08/china-us-alliance-under-pressure", "article": "A long-running row about relocating a US Marine Corps base on Okinawa is threatening to boil over, with Yukio Hatoyama, Japan&apos;s prime minister, admitting at the weekend that failure to resolve the dispute could force his resignation. Given that his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to a watershed election victory only last August, such an outcome could be deeply embarrassing for the US and deeply resented in Japan. Despite its stated intention to pay greater attention to Asia, the Obama administration is making a hash of relations with Japan. Its insistence that Tokyo&apos;s new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan&apos;s democratic process. Blame for rising bilateral strains also lies with Hatoyama, who seems to have promised more than he can deliver. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior Liberal Democrat party opposition leader, openly mocked the prime minister last week for supposedly making an election pledge he had &quot;no idea&quot; how to fulfil. The Okinawa dispute reflects broader differences. Hatoyama&apos;s view that Japan needs a more &quot;balanced&quot; relationship with Washington after 65 years of polite subservience in the security sphere, and his related interest in developing an EEC-style east Asian economic community including China, have produced sharply critical reactions in Washington.&quot;The relationship between the US and Japan is in its worst state ever,&quot; said Hisahiko Okazaki, a former ambassador, in the daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun. &quot;The Japan-US alliance is too valuable an asset to lose,&quot; he wrote. Despite such dramatic huffing and puffing, the bottom-line reality, say senior foreign ministry officials, former and serving ministers, and leading commentators, is there is not the remotest chance that the security alliance will be &quot;lost&quot;. It may be adapted or modified. It may evolve. And for its part, says former deputy foreign minister Hitoshi Tanaka, Japan &quot;needs to think seriously about how it can better contribute to international security&quot; and &quot;to consider if it is still right to stick to the existing interpretation of the constitutional prohibition on the use of force&quot;. But the official consensus is firm that the US relationship will continue to form the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of Japan&apos;s defences, as foreign minister Katsuya Okada put it \u2013 a position shared by Hatoyama.The main reason behind this confidence that, despite all the stresses and strains, the alliance will endure is not hard to discern: growing mutual fear of China. If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change. Obama wants to befriend China and work with it. But if China chooses a diverging path, as it often appears inclined to do, the help and assistance of Japan in containing it will be indispensable to the US \u2013 and vice versa. Underscoring this point, last week&apos;s exchanges over Okinawa coincided with the latest, unsettling broadside from the People&apos;s Liberation Army that, according to some Japanese analysts, calls the shots in Beijing. &quot;China&apos;s big goal in the 21st century is to become world number one, the top power,&quot; wrote PLA senior colonel Liu Mingfu. China, he said, was determined to become the &quot;global champion&quot; while conflict with the US over &quot;who rises and [who] fails to dominate the world&quot; was inevitable. This may be bluster. But it is safer to assume it is not. With this unruly giant bellowing on the doorstep, Japan and the US need each other more than ever.

Raw tuna is a key ingredient in sushi and sashimi in Japan, the world&apos;s main purchaser of bluefin.

Cheap doubles may be a fundamental part of British culture, those 40% ABV glasses of tongue-numbing, liver-compromising liquor that are poured lovelessly down gaping gullets during Unhappy Hours in pubs and bars up and down this thoroughly peculiar country, but somebody forgot to tell England&apos;s batsmen. Of the eight major Test-playing countries, England are the only ones without a Test double-century against either Bangladesh or Zimbabwe. Even Jason Gillespie got one. England don&apos;t really do doubles at all, cheap or otherwise. In the last 20 years they have managed just eight in Tests, which puts them below everyone except Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka have 27. That&apos;s a damning statistic, and one of the reasons why England currently have no batsmen with a Test average in the fifties (the fact most of them aren&apos;t especially good has also contributed in its own small way). Alastair Cook, who resumes on 158 in Chittagong today, will never have a better chance of making a double-century, never in all his puff. Surely he will go on to &quot;make it a Daddy&quot;, as Graham Gooch, his mentor and England batting coach, constantly demands. The way Bangladesh bowled yesterday, Cook could probably get his average up to 50 as well if he really wanted: he only needs to score 654 not out to do so. Realistically, Cook and England, who were 374 for three overnight, will probably aim to bat for another 45 overs at just shy of five runs per over: that would take them to around 600 halfway through the afternoon session, and allow their young seam attack to have a go with the new ball either side of tea. In those three exasperating draws in the Caribbean last winter, England faffed around for more than 150 overs each time in the first innings. I doubt they will repeat that mistake here. It should all add up to a pretty straightforward victory, but with only one spinner you never know.* * You do know. You know full well. I&apos;m just trying to whip up some interest at 3am on a Saturday morning. Work with me here  A free piece of advice If you ever walk towards Guardian Towers from St Pancras International in the early hours of Saturday morning, don&apos;t take the shortcut up the hill on Goods Way. You might get an unexpected reminder that all the foie gras in the world won&apos;t change the fact that this is still Kings Cross in nature as well as name. It&apos;s going to take a long time to burn that particular sight from the memory.  Saturday morning, who&apos;s gonna play with me? Anyone got anything to talk about today? Good night out was it? Ah. Go on, tell me.  91st over: England 375-3 (Cook 158, Collingwood 32) It&apos;ll be the swing bowler Rubel Hossain to begin from the Ispahani End. This ball is only 10 overs old but it hardly moved off the straight all day yesterday. Rubel&apos;s second ball is a good yorker that Collingwood jabs down on. A no-ball is the only run from the over. Here&apos;s some stattage on Collingwood: with a qualification of 25 innings, no Englishman in the last 30 years has a higher Test average overseas. &quot;Morning!&quot; says Matt L, coming over all Patrick Swayze in Donnie Darko. &quot;I am ever so slightly refreshed and looking forward to some England-Bangladesh action. I would like to confess that this is not the first time I have tried to get published on an OBO in the small hours after a night of liver rot. Last time my drunken ramblings were rejected and Bull, I think, published some rubbish email about the pitch from Gary Naylor. Rejected, I proceeded to set up an email account in Naylor&apos;s name fully intending to write in confessing on his behalf to various acts of sexual deviancy. Fortunately for all involved I fell a sleep on the keyboard before sending anything. Anyway, enjoy the game.&quot; I&apos;m just looking forward to the first email from &apos;Gary Naylor&apos;.  92nd over: England 376-3 (Cook 159, Collingwood 32) Shakib Al Hasan will start at the other end, a slightly surprising move given how new this ball is. His first delivery is a full toss that Cook whips to leg for a single. It&apos;s an otherwise good over, and the fifth delivery turns Collingwood round, with the edge popping low and just to the left of silly point. &quot;I went to bed at 1am and set an alarm to get up and join you for this as way of thanks for yesterday&apos;s link,&quot; says Niall Harden, &quot;but my brain is very cross with me for doing so and the only interesting thing I can think of is that I emailed Gordon Brown yesterday telling him to keep his head up and not get too upset. I can provide the same service to you now, no problem. Also, I posted on Twitter that a show on the BBC was &apos;shit&apos; (it was Great Unanswered Questions) and within minutes someone involved in making the show got in touch to say sorry. Freaked me right out.&quot;  93rd over: England 377-3 (Cook 160, Collingwood 32) Rubel&apos;s first delivery to Cook is a good one that seams away enough to slip past the outside edge of Cook&apos;s defensive push. There are no slips for Cook, so Bangladesh aren&apos;t exactly thirsty for wickets. Cook pushes a quick single to equal his Test-best score of 160. &quot;Your view of Kings Cross is 100 per cent correct,&quot; says Neill Brown with disconcerting certainty. &quot;It amuses me that the first thing all those travelling to the Olympics in 2012 via Eurostar will see is the clean, well-presented St Pancras, when less than a mile away is the more accurate picture of modern London. It&apos;s like choosing to go to Denmark on your holidays and being greeted with a cold lager, served by a stunning blonde, only to find the real country here...&quot;  94th over: England 377-3 (Cook 160, Collingwood 32) Cook, trying to cut, is beaten by a ball from Shakib that was too close for the shot. Mushfiqur dropped it away. It&apos;s a maiden from Shakib, and England have scored just three runs from four overs so far. &quot;Evening/Morning/Whatever the hell it is Rob,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Improbably, my boss let me leave early today to watch the inaugural IPL match. I&apos;ve therefore been on the sauce since 2.30pm. However, being your classic insomniac, I still find myself here at 3am in the morning waiting for the Test to start, desperately downing pints of water to stave off the dark tendrils of the hangover that I know is going to catch up with me at some point during the morning session. If I send you an email that consists entirely of a low zombie-like groan you&apos;ll know that&apos;s me done for the night.&quot;  95th over: England 382-3 (Cook 160, Collingwood 37) Rubel spears in a leg-stump half-volley and Collingwood pings it economically through midwicket for the first boundary of the day. &quot;It&apos;s great to see Pietersen find his form just before the IPL starts,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;What with Eoin Morgan in good shape after the one-dayers as well, international cricket has confirmed its new role as fluffer before the all-important porn-fest in India.&quot; I really don&apos;t understand or care about the IPL. None of the teams have any identity. It&apos;s like the bloody Sugababes.  96th over: England 384-3 (Cook 161, Collingwood 38) Cook takes a single off Shakib to move to 161, his highest Test score. Make. It. A. Daddy. &quot;Given that it is 10am in Bangkok, I am at a slight advantage,&quot; says Paul Sumner. &quot;Actually, if you arranged TV coverage, I&apos;d do the OBO for you. There is not a lot else to do as Bangkok is supposed to be brought to a standstill by protesters this weekend. Friday was a bit of a joke, the organisers promised a million, and whilst no-one believed them, more than the 7,000 who did turn up were expected.&quot;  97th over: England 388-3 (Cook 165, Collingwood 38) Cook times Rubel very pleasantly down the ground for his first boundary of the day. That was an extremely good shot. &quot;To carry on the theme of last night&apos;s OBO, I state my case as the biggest loser by passing up a &apos;sure thing&apos; (as I&apos;m sure more successful humans would call it) for an early night and an early start to follow your coverage,&quot; apologises Paul Goodchild. &quot;If Cook doesn&apos;t make 200 I&apos;m going to weep into my Horlicks.&quot;  98th over: England 388-3 (Cook 165, Collingwood 38) Collingwood thinks about charging Shakib and then decides against it when Shakib drops shot. He is in a good groove here, Shakib. Collingwood, looking for the oxygen of runs, goes flying down the track and drags a big yahoo into his pad and over the right shoulder of short leg, who was looking somewhere towards long-on in anticipation of Collingwood connecting with the shot. Shakib&apos;s figures today are 4-1-3-0. &quot;I&apos;m currently following your OBO from press row at an NBA game,&quot; says Dave Hogg, whose life may or may not be more interesting than mine. &quot;All I can say is that I&apos;m looking forward to the resumption of the match in order to see some competitive sport this evening.&quot;  99th over: England 389-3 (Cook 166, Collingwood 38) Cook survives a very good shout for LBW from Rubel. It pitched on middle from over the wicket and came back just enough as Cook pushed defensively around his front pad. Hawkeye shows it would have hit a decent portion of off stump and there were no issues over bounce, so Cook was pretty fortunate there. England are struggling for runs this morning: 15 from nine overs.  100th over: England 390-3 (Cook 167, Collingwood 38) Collingwood is lucky that a vicious grubber from Shakib is wide of off stump, because it beat his attempted forcing shot completely. &quot;Please can you post a link to this,&quot; says Neil Withers. &quot;A friend of mine, Cranston Watts is running the &apos;Marathon des Sables&apos; on 2 April this year. It&apos;s known as the toughest race on earth and is 250 km over six days in the Sahara. On foot. Running. It&apos;s in aid of destitute orphan children in south-east India. He&apos;s mental and also the brother of Scottish international Fraser Watts \u2013 so there&apos;s even a tenuous link to cricket!&quot; You had me at running.  101st over: England 396-3 (Cook 172, Collingwood 39) Cook drives Rubel gunbarrel-straight for four. A top shot. Meanwhile, here&apos;s Mac Millings, and you know what that means. &quot;Tell that rank amateur, The 97th Over&apos;s Paul Goodchild, that the competition has been called to a halt, and the biggest loser found. Millings is here. Yesterday, Neil Stork-Brett said he dated a &apos;pneumatically-assisted equestrian rider who was also a part-time swimsuit model&apos;? Wow, what a loser. So he dumped her. Big deal. He had his oats, and dropping someone because they&apos;re &apos;superficial and not very bright&apos; is perfectly acceptable. It&apos;s happened to me lots of times. My version of the Storkers story is as follows. I met a girl at university, and it soon became clear that, beyond logic, she liked me, so I made my smooth Millings move, but this time it worked. We didn&apos;t go, y&apos;know, there, but a nice time was had. So the next day, I asked a housemate of mine what he thought of this girl. &apos;She&apos;s all right,&apos; he said, &apos;but she&apos;s got a big chin.&apos; I immediately realised he was right, and when I went out for a drink with her that night, all I could see was that massive mandible of hers, jutting. We had a couple of quiet drinks, and that was that. A few weeks later, I bumped into her in the canteen, and we sat opposite each other, exchanging pleasantries, until she said, &apos;It&apos;s a shame nothing happened between us, because I really, really love sex.&apos; And you might think she was just saying that to rub it in - and maybe, in part, she was - but the worst part was that I could tell she really, really meant it. So, Stork-Brett had his fun, and then dumped the hot girl, whereas I missed out on, potentially, weeks of top rumpo (which, in Aggregate Nookie Time would have added up to, literally, minutes) just because the girl had a fairly large chin. As a side note, a few months ago I got an update email saying that Neil Stork-Brett was now following me on Twitter, but by the time I had excitedly logged on to see if it was true, he had already dropped me. No one does loser like me.&quot;  102nd over: England 407-3 (Cook 173, Collingwood 48) Collingwood, on the charge, launches Shakib for a big six over midwicket. He&apos;s been itching to play that stroke for a few overs. &quot;Just off to bed here on the pacific coast of Mexico, nine thirty at night,&quot; says Mal. &quot;Here is a little something to lighten the mood.&quot; In the event that this links to some kind of sexx porn, it&apos;s important to point out that Rob Smyth is not legally responsible for whatever YouTube links the Guardian post under his byline.  WICKET! England 412-4 (Cook ct and b Mahmudullah 173) Dear Lord. What an extraordinary dismissal. The new bowler Mahmudullah sends down a filthy long hop and Cook, trying to hoick it out of the ground, just screws it straight back to the bowler. He leans on his bat in a combination of disbelief and disgust. What a weird way to end such a fine innings.  103rd over: England 412-4 (Collingwood 53, Bell 0) Earlier in the over Collingwood reached an excellent half-century from 76 balls. What a wonderful winter he has had. He steals a very sharp two to fine leg next ball, and England will hopefully kick off now after that fairly slow start. &quot;The pure, manly athleticism and coiled aggression fairly leaping out of that picture of the captains currently leading off this OBO will surely put paid to the locals&apos; gridiron-based disdain for cricket here in Alabama once and for all,&quot; says David Moore. &quot;Long conversations &apos;round the office watercooler about the merits of stationing someone at third man, at last you can be mine.&quot;  104th over: England 418-4 (Collingwood 55, Bell 4) Ian Bell needs a duck for an average of 227 against Bangladesh, having scored that many against them without being dismissed in the two-Test series of 2005. He fails, getting off the mark with a single and then premeditating a lap for a couple. He will enjoy this situation.  105th over: England 424-4 (Collingwood 56, Bell 9) Confident stuff from Bell, who dances down the track and drives Mahmudullah down the ground for four. This is the sort of innings in which he&apos;s damned if he does and damned if he doesn&apos;t. If he fails, he&apos;s Ian Bell; and if he scores a breezy 110-ball century, well, look at the score when he came in. &quot;I must be a bigger loser than the other emailers hanging on after a night on the booze,&quot; says Rai Skrupskis. &quot;It&apos;s 9pm here (New Mexico) and I have chosen to follow the OBO (lager in hand) rather than go out. All in hopes of a crushing Test victory. Pathetic, isn&apos;t it? Can&apos;t wait for the Ashes.&quot;  106th over: England 425-4 (Collingwood 57, Bell 9) &quot;Hello from the past: it&apos;s still Friday night here,&quot; says Troy Bassett. &quot;In Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA, I am struggling mightily to stay awake for at least part of the Test (which starts at 10:30 pm). BTW, I&apos;m new to cricket so I was very excited to get my Trent Bridge England-Bangladesh ODI tickets in the mail this week. It will be my first live match. Any advice for what to bring to the match? What to do in Nottingham?&quot; Go to Selectadisc! And the Social!  107th over: England 427-4 (Collingwood 57, Bell 10) England need to get a jump on here. There is no point at all scoring at two or three an over. They only need another 100-150 runs; whether they are four down or nine down is an irrelevance. And we could all do with something to keep us awake. &quot;What is your take on Cook?&quot; asks Elliot Wilson. &quot;Is he the real deal yet? I still have this lingering feeling that deep down he&apos;s still a boy in man&apos;s trousers, as evidenced by the need to refer to his father-figure-mentor G. Gooch on a reasonably regular basis.&quot; I think he&apos;s long a way from the real deal, as two fifty-plus scores in 10 Ashes Tests would suggest. This innings was excellent but it doesn&apos;t really change anything. His temperament is admirable, and because of that I still like the idea of trying him at No3 with a dasher opening alongside Strauss. He is still only 25, something we sometimes forget because he has been around for nearly four years now.  108th over: England 429-4 (Collingwood 58, Bell 11) Two from Shakib&apos;s over. &quot;I think that settles it,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;Troy is the biggest loser.&quot;  109th over: England 430-4 (Collingwood 59, Bell 11) One from Mahmudullah&apos;s over as England continue to bat for a draw. In the Sky box, Dominic Cork reckons England will try to bat on to 650 and declare an hour before the close. Bugger that. Get them in half an hour before tea. England are so bloody hopeless at ramming home a dominant position. I realise I am now criticising England for something they haven&apos;t even done yet, but it&apos;s 4.45am so I&apos;m running with it.  110th over: England 432-4 (Collingwood 60, Bell 12) England are looking for quick singles at every opportunity. That&apos;s good. What&apos;s less good is the fact they&apos;re picking up about two an over. England aren&apos;t so much applying the foot to the throat as offering a hand and saying Are you alright mate? Ooh I&apos;m really sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to hurt you. Can I get you anything? My bank details? Yeah sure, take what you like. My wife? Yeahhhhh, why not. Knock yourself out.  111th over: England 434-4 (Collingwood 61, Bell 13) These are basically the boring middle overs of the 50-over match. It&apos;s pretty unfathomable. England haven&apos;t hit a boundary \u2013 or even tried to hit one \u2013 for half an hour or so. Sometimes the box seat can get a bit too snug. &quot;Hello from the future,&quot; says James Walton. &quot;It&apos;s 12.40pm here in Wuhan China... you&apos;ll be happy to know that the world hasn&apos;t ended and the local bar has started selling Strongbow. I&apos;m currently nursing an massive headache as a result.&quot; I would suggest hair of the dog, but given the fact we&apos;re talking about Strongbow it&apos;s probably best just to take the hangover.  112th over: England 439-4 (Collingwood 66, Bell 13) Abdur Razzak replaces Shakib Al Hasan, who bowled pretty well this morning. Five from the over. This is modest cricket from England: 65 runs from 22 overs this morning while batting for a declaration on a flat one against Bangladesh does not compute. &quot;Would I be alone in thinking England should switch to Twenty20 mode and just try and smack everything out of the ground?&quot; asks Phil Withall. &quot;They&apos;re in a position where it really wouldn&apos;t hurt to try.&quot; If you&apos;re online following the OBO at this hour I suspect you&apos;re alone in a fair few things, but I agree that England should give it some humpty.  113th over: England 444-4 (Collingwood 68, Bell 16) That&apos;s a good shot from Bell, a graceful and classy push through the covers for three off Mahmudullah. &quot;Don&apos;t take my de-Tweeting (?) of you personally, young Millings,&quot; says Neil Stork-Brett. &quot;I had deactivated my account within two weeks of signing up as I realised I really had nothing to say that was even remotely interesting, funny or incisive. No, I save that particular &apos;pleasure&apos; for Smyth and my fellow OBO-ers.&quot; I wish somebody would put Twitter back in its box.  114th over: England 445-4 (Collingwood 69, Bell 16) Razzak almost hurries a quicker one through Collingwood. One from the over and this game really needs some Red Bull. &quot;Here&apos;s my tip for Troy Bassett, new to cricket in the 106th over: try not to lose your ticket between the gates and getting to your seat - that&apos;s what I managed to do at my first taste of live cricket at the T20 World Cup last summer, and it caused no end of trouble!&quot; says Sara &apos;No, cricket isn&apos;t exactly big here in Finland&apos; Torvalds.  115th over: England 446-4 (Collingwood 70, Bell 16) Collingwood, possibly out of sheer boredom, walks down the track to Mahmudullah but doesn&apos;t really go through with the shot and the ball plops into the off side off the pad. He does it again later in the over but this time squirts it to short square leg. &quot;Christ!&quot; says John Leavey, misidentifying me again. &quot;This is dull. What are we trying to do? Improve Bangladesh&apos;s Test ranking? No other game plan seems to be being applied.&quot;  116th over: England 450-4 (Collingwood 72, Bell 18) Four singles from Razzak&apos;s over. The last boundary was 11 overs ago, which is ridiculous in the circumstances. I can only think that England have decided to bat five and a half sessions in this innings and are tailoring their approach accordingly, but I really don&apos;t see the point of wasting extra time in the game. As Millings would doubtless ask, why do in 20 minutes what you can do in 20 seconds? &quot;In order to encourage the teams to hit more boundaries, how about some flashing lights, terrible music and unhappy dancing people every time the ball clears the ropes?&quot; asks Niall Harden.  117th over: England 455-4 (Collingwood 72, Bell 22) Mahmudullah is very harshly wided by Rod Tucker for a delivery that wasn&apos;t far down the leg side to Bell. Maybe he just wanted to move his hands a bit in an attempt to stay awake. Mahmudullah then drops hopelessly short and \u2013 glory be\u00a0\u2013 Bell pulls for four. That&apos;s the first boundary since the 105th over. &quot;Alas, I am unable to comply with the 91st over&apos;s promises of tales of sexual deviancy, but can I confess to a cricketing deviancy?&quot; says Gary Naylor, limbering up for another stint on Test Match Sofa. &quot;I much prefer Colly in Brigadier Block mode batting all day on a minefield for 67 than to see him at his most, er, fluent. Bell&apos;s forward press is a bit unnecessary against this bowling isn&apos;t it?&quot;  118th over: England 467-4 (Collingwood 75, Bell 31) Two fours in the over! I&apos;ll never forget where I was for this moment. Both came to Bell. The first was an excellent steer past slip off Razzak, and the second a feather through the covers. &quot;This is as tedious as Emmerdale,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;I&apos;ve got TMS on. It merely consists of Mark Butcher rambling about....I&apos;m not even sure. F1 I think. By the way TMS appear to have taken the Strauss option and sent out the B team. The TMS Lions if you will.&quot;  119th over: England 473-4 (Collingwood 77, Bell 34) &quot;Not that it&apos;s surprising we are doing well against Bangla, but has anyone actually looked world-class against them,&quot; wonders Paddy Blewer. &quot;I&apos;m stuck in Sydney waiting for annother flight to Canberra and wondered idly what a really brutal in form batsman might do. Early 90s Robin Smith? Viv? Richie Richardson?&quot; Slats. Smith would have struggled a wee bit against all these spinners, surely.  120th over: England 481-4 (Collingwood 82, Bell 35) England are still, for the most part, doing their work in ones and twos, but those are coming at an increasingly healthy rate now. That&apos;s partly because England are taking more risks in their running, and Collingwood survives a tightish run-out referral after taking two to fine leg. &quot;Very fit man Collingwood&quot; phwoars Bob Willis. &quot;This doesn&apos;t even sound like TMS, it sounds like my radio has wandered onto strange frequencies where lorry drivers talk about nothing,&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;I might get out of bed and start drinking again. Winner!&quot; There&apos;s nobody in the office. Not even the cleaners. There&apos;s an oven-temperature can of Carling \u2013 Carling \u2013 leering at me from the other side of the sports desk. I can feel the slightest moistness in my mouth. It shouldn&apos;t have come to this.  121st over: England 485-4 (Collingwood 85, Bell 36) Naeem Islam comes tantalisingly close to justifying his existence by bowling the penultimate over before lunch. Collingwood reverse-sweeps for three, one of them an overthrow.  122nd over: England 487-4 (Collingwood 86, Bell 37) That was a bit of a nothing session really: England scored 113 runs for the loss of Alastair Cook, who made 173 and will wonder for a long time how he got out to a rank long hop. See you in 30 minutes.  LUNCH  A loser in his own lunchtime &quot;Does it make me a default winner of the loser battle to email in my offering a day late having retrospectively read the OBO while eating a Fry&apos;s Chocolate Creme bar?&quot; wrote Tom Bowtell yesterday afternoon. &quot;My most glorious loserish moment came in November 2002 during the Ashes when I went to The Ministry Of Sound to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday. I am not a Ministry of Sound kind of person and found it all a little overwhelming and loud. At about 1.30am I decided I could take it no more so I slipped off the the toilets, locked myself in a cubical and there, in a place where endless drug sniffs, sexual jaunts and boozed-up fisticuffs had taken place, I sat on the closed toilet lid and listened to the TMS commentary on the second Ashes Test on my Roberts Sport Radio for about an hour. Damien Martyn was grinding out a 229-ball 95 and Richard Dawson was being plucky. At one point Dawson beat him twice in an over. At another point I caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the chrome toilet paper dispenser on the wall: and for the first time in ages I liked what I saw.&quot;  123rd over: England 488-4 (Collingwood 87, Bell 37) It&apos;s almost light outside. You&apos;re all asleep, aren&apos;t you. Shahadat Hossain will begin this afternoon session with his first over of the day. He starts with a bit of off-theory to Collingwood, to a 7-2 field. After a few deliveries well outside off, Collingwood tries to an ungainly swipe to leg, meeting only with fresh air. He then charges the final delivery and plays tip-and-run to mid-off. A good over from Shahadat, though. &quot;I suppose most teams hate touring Bangladesh as it is such a potential banana skin,&quot; says Don Wilson. &quot;Sooner rather than later they are going to beat one of the major sides in a Test match and nobody wants to be the first one. At least England have avoided this fate, unless they stuff it up in the second Test of course.&quot; Adelaide!  124th over: England 492-4 (Collingwood 90, Bell 38) Abdur Razzak will continue at the other end. Four from the over, the last two because of yet another misfield. Jack would be a very dull boy if he had to watch this. So what is the plan for England, anyway? I still think they should bat for no more than 80 minutes in this session, but the consensus among the Sky team is that they will go on until tea. That&apos;ll be fun. &quot;I have to be awake,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;They pay me for it. Two hours left and then home where I will drink until I&apos;m unconcious. Wake up at 8pm and start this shite again. Oh I love life.&quot; All together now...  125th over: England 494-4 (Collingwood 90, Bell 39)Shahadat continues with his off-theory to Collingwood. It&apos;s a decent plan because, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, Collingwood will have to manufacture strokes he would normally be loath to play if he is to keep the scoreboard moving at a good rate. Collingwood is restless, walking down the track a lot, but he can&apos;t gete Shahadat away and there are just two from the over.  126th over: England 501-4 (Collingwood 91, Bell 44) Collingwood works Razzak to leg for his 4000th Test run. That&apos;s 4000 more than most people thought he&apos;d score when he had a traumatic introduction to international cricket in the summer of 2001, and 3881 more than he thought he&apos;d score when he was omitted following that traumatic Test in Multan in 2005. He is a thoroughly admirable fellow, a true credit to the strawberry-blond community. Later in the over, Bell, who is also strawberry blond, makes room to lift Razzak high over extra cover for four. For a while it looked like Tamim Iqbal might take the catch running round from long off, but the placement was excellent.  127th over: England 505-4 (Collingwood 92, Bell 47) &quot;In the US it&apos;s only 1.30am so after a cool beverage or three the chance to watch some proper Test cricket before bed is quite tempting,&quot; says Paul Delve, lining up the inevitable &apos;however&apos;. &quot;However having watched an hour or so, there isn&apos;t any proper Test cricket on. If you can&apos;t catch a ball what chance do you have? I don&apos;t like to be too negative but I&apos;m off to bed. This is rubbish. Just declare already for a bit of entertainment.&quot;  128th over: England 513-4 (Collingwood 99, Bell 48) Collingwood tickles Razzak fine for four \u2013 I think it came off just pad but was given as runs \u2013 and then square-drives for three to move to 99. &quot;So, you can see when it&apos;s dawn (123rd over),&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;We all imagined you in a dank basement (even new buildings come equipped with a dank basement; it&apos;s an old charter or something) lit only by flickering modems, but now it seems you have a little tent of blue that prisoners call the sky. Silver sails too?&quot;  129th over: England 524-4 (Collingwood 100, Bell 57) Collingwood gets his tenth Test century with a push into the off side for a single off Shahadat. They do indeed all count. Bell cover-drives the next ball sumptuously for four to reach his half-century, and then he drives the following delivery back whence it came for four more pristine runs.  130th over: England 530-4 (Collingwood 105, Bell 58) Collingwood gets in a tangle while reverse-sweeping Razzak, and as the ball loops back towards his stumps he half-volleys it to safety with his right foot. Back of the netc. He gets four from an orthodox sweep later in the over, but only because of some dismal fielding from Shahadat. Bangladesh have been desperately poor in the field.  131st over: England 535-4 (Collingwood 108, Bell 60) &quot;I&apos;ve had sex with a woman from every one of the Test-playing nations except New Zealand,&quot; says  Walter Mitty  Dean Butler, who may or may not be high as a kite on energy drinks. &quot;Has anyone completed the full set?&quot; Given that we&apos;re the only two people here, you know the answer to that, don&apos;t you.  132nd over: England 542-4 (Collingwood 114, Bell 61) Collingwood gives Razzak the charge and lifts him lazily to cow corner for four more. &quot;Do you genuinely think it likely that a new captain (stand-in, no less), is likely to declare at any point before batting the opposition out of the game?&quot; asks Olly Bevan. &quot;I don&apos;t know what Cook is like as a captain, but it&apos;s probably ok if he&apos;s a little churlish at this point (though I appreciate this makes your job mind-numbing). Any more inspired rants by either Willis or Key?&quot; But it&apos;s Bangladesh! As for rants, I don&apos;t think even Bob can be bothered. Talking of Bob, who would you least like to bump into in a dark alley: this Bob or this Bob?  133rd over: England 547-4 (Collingwood 116, Bell 63) Shakib Al Hasan replaces Shahadat, who bowled diligent off-theory for at least three overs before deciding he simply couldn&apos;t be bothered any longer. There is a single from each delivery except the last, so even I can work out that there were five runs from the over. &quot;You got the night shift again,&quot; says Jeremy Bunting. &quot;Coincidence or chance? Do you volunteer or are you going to work on your way back from last night?&quot; I don&apos;t know anymore.  134th over: England 553-4 (Collingwood 119, Bell 66) &quot;OK, I&apos;d love for Ian Ronald to get a century too, but surely it&apos;s time to declare?! Shouldn&apos;t Cook pretend to have more faith in his bowlers than the rest of us do?&quot; says Sara &apos;I&apos;m the only one on this train to Helsinki who knows, let alone cares that Collingwood hit a century&apos; Torvalds.  135th over: England 565-4 (Collingwood 126, Bell 68) Shakib drops a stinging return chance offered by Collingwood. It was a full toss, and Collingwood really clubbed it back whence it came. Shakib, reaching two-handed to his right, couldn&apos;t hang on. Bell drives a single next ball, and that means he has the greatest record of any Test batsman against a single country. Exciting times. Collingwood goes down the track later in the over and drives a delightful straight six.  136th over: England 583-4 (Collingwood 134, Bell 79) Eighteen from the over. It starts with another six from Collingwood, this one spanked over wide long-on after he charged down the track at Razzak. I didn&apos;t mean that to rhyme, but us lyrical poets can&apos;t always control our vibe. Bell then comes down the track to drive charmingly over extra-cover for four, and follows up with a straight drive high over Razzak&apos;s head for another boundary. &quot;I&apos;m considering challenging you to a duel re: the Walter Mitty comment, Smyth,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;We&apos;re literally a mile apart in our respective work places. Perhaps it could be staged on Hampstead Heath.&quot; If I could be bothered to do anything, I&apos;d consider thinking about contemplating this.  137th over: England 595-4 (Collingwood 145, Bell 80) Collingwood, on the charge, cleaves Shakib to cow corner for four and six from consecutive deliveries. &quot;A couple of questions for Dean Butler,&quot; says Phil Withall, before asking three questions. &quot;Does he include Zimbabwe as a Test-playing nation, has he just turned over having &apos;knocked off&apos; another one and how does he fare at the one-day teams?&quot;  WICKET! England 596-5 (Collingwood c Tamim Iqbal b Razzak 145) Collingwood tries to reach his 150 in the grand manner but only holes out to long off, where Tamim Iqbal takes a good running catch.  138th over: England 597-5 (Bell 82, Prior 0) Prior, cutting at Razzak, is dropped by this sadly inept wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim. I can&apos;t remember a worse wicketkeeper at this level. &quot;I&apos;d like to put forward my credentials in the loser stakes,&quot; announces Sanjay Ziddi. &quot;I&apos;m Indian, living in the States, and yet here I am awake when I should be asleep or at a club somewhere, following the OBO for a test match featuring two countries I&apos;ve never been to on one window, while trying (and failing miserably) to win the T20 World Cup at Stick Cricket as Scotland on another. I need HELP!&quot;  WICKET! England 599-6 declared (Bell c Rubel Hossain b Shakib Al Hasan 84) Two balls after dropping Bell at long off, Rubel Hossain takes a wonderfully nonchalant running catch in the same position. And with that comes the declaration. England will have half an hour at Bangladesh before tea.  INNINGS BREAK  Andrew Stroud is a loser He says so, and when you read this you won&apos;t disagree.  &quot;We&apos;ve all watched cricket scores updating slowly via Ceefax. Well, my claim for loser status is the Ashes 98-99, early days of Internet, specifically the Adelaide Test. I was working in Rio at the time, and remember sitting up through the early hours monitoring Cricinfo as the fifth day started. Could we expect an epic batting effort from Ramps &amp; Stewie to save or even win the game? The inexplicable absence of Ceefax on Brazilian TV meant I was forced to sit up thorough the night, hunched over the refresh button, on a dial-up connection, in my tiny flat, watching at first with joy, then being unable to tear my eyes away as it all went wrong... If that doesn&apos;t qualify, how about the fact that I&apos;m writing this listening to TMS, instead of changing the nappy of my week old son and future England opening bowler? Or the vicarious thrill I get whenever Andrew Strauss plays well, because if you don&apos;t listen that carefully, it might almost be me getting that ton...&quot;   1st over: Bangladesh 4-0 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 4, Imrul Kayes 0) Stuart Broad, the senior seamer for the first time in his Test career, opens the bowling and sees his first ball cut swaggeringly past point for four by Tamim Iqbal. He&apos;ll be a lot of fun to watch in this series, and over the next 10-15 years. &quot;Today&apos;s a good day,&quot; says Neil Tague. &quot;Yes, I&apos;m working on a Saturday morning, but how many other readers picked up a hardback copy of Brightly Fades the Don for peanuts from their local Oxfam yesterday? That spells winner to me. Or maybe I need to get out more.&quot;  2nd over: Bangladesh 8-0 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 4, Imrul Kayes 4) As expected, it&apos;ll be Bresnan rather than Finn to share the new ball. A pretty accurate over is ruined by a dismal wide half-volley that Imrul Kayes square-drives over the top for four. No swing for Bresnan, and the (very) early signs are that wickets won&apos;t come easily for England.  WICKET! Bangladesh 13-1 (Imrul Kayes c Prior b Broad 4) Stuart Broad roughs up Imrul Kayes with the minimum of fuss. It took just three consecutive short balls to get him. The first flew off the grille for four leg-byes; the second was gloved down uncomfortably; and the third prompted a desperate hook stroke, with the ball looping up for Prior to take a routine catch down the leg side. That&apos;s good, ruthless work from Broad and England.  3rd over: Bangladesh 13-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 5, Junaid Siddique 0) Broad greets Junaid Siddique with two pretty good short balls, both of which really carried through to Prior. As Bob Willis says, I&apos;d get Finn on him and have this sort of attack from both ends.  4th over: Bangladesh 14-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 5, Junaid Siddique 0) An accurate but harmless over from Bresnan. It&apos;s not swinging, so I&apos;d get him straight off and get Finn on. &quot;What&apos;s the point of Bangladesh playing international cricket if they are learning at this glacial pace?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. They won more Tests in their first decade than Sri Lanka. (Yes, I know they played more games too, but it shows they are not that far short of where we might expect a side to be after 10 years.)  5th over: Bangladesh 22-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 10, Junaid Siddique 3) Siddique gets off the mark with a pleasant push through mid-off for three and then Tamim cuts in front of square for four with a flourish. &quot;Incorrect with your prediction of no easy wickets Smyth,&quot; challenges Dean Butler. &quot;I&apos;m finishing work so goodnight by the way. It was as ever fun (the OBO not work).&quot; Now I know you&apos;re making things up.  6th over: Bangladesh 26-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 10, Junaid Siddique 7) Bresnan beats Siddique with a fine delivery that gripped off the seam and roared past his attempted forcing stroke. Siddique&apos;s response is an uppish drive that bounces just short of the diving Carberry at point before shooting away for four.  WICKET! Bangladesh 27-2 (Junaid Siddique ct and b Broad 7) This is too easy. Broad digs in a short one on leg stump and Siddique, looking completely the other way, gloves it up in the air for Broad to take a simple return catch. Excellent stuff from Broad but Siddique did not have a solitary clue. Harmison helped himself to some very cheap wickets here six winters ago and now Broad is doing the same.  6.5 overs: Bangladesh 27-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 11) The players took an early tea after that dismissal.  TEA  7th over: Bangladesh 27-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 11, Aftab Ahmed 0) Broad bowls the final delivery of the over he started before tea. Aftab Ahmed ducks underndeath a short one. &quot;Could you plug the Cambridge Science Festival for me please?&quot; says Niall Taylor. &quot;I am volunteering there today, joining the ranks of your followers who do energetic things for nothing. It is free, so broadly charitable, and I&apos;m missing the final session for it.&quot;  8th over: Bangladesh 33-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 16, Aftab Ahmed 0) Tamim cracks Bresnan through the covers for four more.  9th over: Bangladesh 39-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 22, Aftab Ahmed 0) A wonderful shot from Tamim, who helps a short ball from Broad all the way over fine leg for six. Then he keeps the strike with a single off the last delivery.  10th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 31, Aftab Ahmed 1) I lost my entry for that over I&apos;m afraid, but all it really involved was two handsome boundaries for Tamim off Bresnan.  11th over: Bangladesh 50-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 32, Aftab Ahmed 1) A few technical problems. Sorry about this.  WICKET! Bangladesh 51-3 (Aftab Ahmed c Bell b Swann 1) Graeme Swann strikes in his first over yet again. It really is extraordinary how often he does that. Aftab tried to play a lap-sweep, but the ball only looped to Bell, who had run round from short leg in anticipation of the sweep. Aftab looked very unhappy with the decision although I haven&apos;t seen any replays yet.  12th over: Bangladesh 51-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 32, Mahmudullah 0) Replays weren&apos;t really conclusive with regard to that Aftab dismissal. It certainly went off the pad and straight to Bell; it&apos;s just a matter of whether it touched the glove on the way through. I don&apos;t think it did.  13rd over: Bangladesh 59-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 40, Mahmudullah 0) Finn replaces Broad and starts with a poor delivery on leg stump that Tamim Iqbal whips very fine for four. His third ball is a fraction too full and worked classily through midwicket to the fence, but he responds well by beating Tamim with one slanted across him. &quot;Can we have a few Crowded House references for the big Finn, please?&quot; says John Starbuck. Knock yourself out.  14th over: Bangladesh 66-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 41, Mahmudullah 5) Mahmudullah goes for an unseemly sweep at Swann but gets away with the resulting LBW shout by virtue of being well outside the line. A push-driven four through extra-cover next ball gets him off the mark in fine style.  15th over: Bangladesh 75-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 42, Mahmudullah 14) Mahmudullah takes consecutive boundaries off Finn, both to third man. So Finn&apos;s first two overs have gone for 17. &quot;Sadly Selectadisc in Nottingham closed down a few years ago,&quot; says Paul King. &quot;There was talk of it reopening but don&apos;t think it has. However anyone in the East Midlands&apos; second city should visit the extraordinary Rob&apos;s Records if they get a chance.&quot;  16th over: Bangladesh 77-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 43, Mahmudullah 15) Mahmudullah has started very positively and sweeps Swann for a single the ball after smashing a straight drive back at him on the bounce. Then Tamim completely misses a big sweep shot. &quot;Crowded House song would have to be Chocolate Cake, their tribute to TMS,&quot; says Phil Withall.  17th over: Bangladesh 85-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 50, Mahmudullah 16) Finn&apos;s expensive start continues with a leg-stump delivery that Tamim Iqbal tickles fine to reach a hugely entertaining fifty from only 53 balls. &quot;I&apos;m here and reckon it definitely hit the glove,&quot; says Anthony Hulse of Aftab Ahmed&apos;s dismissal. &quot;Watching the slo-mo you can see the red bit on the end of the glove is clearly pushed back by the ball. Not so clear in the super close up, but very obvious in the normal one.&quot;  18th over: Bangladesh 88-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 52, Mahmudullah 17) &quot;Operation Dirtbox!&quot; shouts one of the England fielders between overs. I don&apos;t want to know. These two are playing very nicely and, along with Shakib, are probably Bangladesh&apos;s best batsmen. &quot;Oi! Where do you get off calling my home town the second city of the East Midlands?&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;You need to be very careful discussing local sensibilities. Brum is the second city of England, yes, but Nottingham is first in the east and generally known as The Queen of the Midlands. Derby, Leicester, Lincoln? Pah!&quot; That wasn&apos;t me!  19th over: Bangladesh 90-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 52, Mahmudullah 19) Bresnan replaces Finn, whose three overs cost 25. Bresnan really should be meat and drink on this pitch. Saying which, his second ball is a beauty which seams away just enough to beat Mahmudullah&apos;s defensive grope. That really was a jaffa. &quot;I&apos;m sure everyone will be pleased to learn that I have now returned from work to my exclusive north London residence and am now sipping a chilled beer,&quot; says Dean Butler. I&apos;ve often wondered about booze etiquette when you work nights. I got a very funny look or 12 when I wearily tucked into a can of cider one morning on the train home during the last Ashes series in Australia.  20th over: Bangladesh 98-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 60, Mahmudullah 19) Swann will probably bowl through from this end now. What turn he is getting is very slow. The lack of bounce means that Tamim can sweep confidently from outside off stump, as he does for four twice in that over. The second brings him to 1000 Test runs. He&apos;s not even 21 yet, so you wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he reaches 10000 one day. &quot;We&apos;re listening in Tokyo,&quot; says Mark Hiratsuka. &quot;No, really - my son (three today) and I are following the OBO by mobile from a park in the west of the heaving metropolis. At least I am - he seems more interested in a smallish snake passing by...&quot; Many happy returns to Hiratsuka the younger.  21st over: Bangladesh 103-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 61, Mahmudullah 23) Mahmudullah pushes Bresnan really nicely through the covers for three; he looks a good player, this fellow. &quot;I&apos;m an American studying in Canada who just came in from a night out and your updates are a nice fix in lieu of tobacco,&quot; says Alison Jakobovic. &quot;In consideration of my lungs, please keep up with them as I&apos;m sure there are other people in my position who are appreciating them just as much, if not for quite the same reason. Also, I really hope Steven Finn lives up to his potential. It would be lovely to have him and Broad leading the attack for the next five years... yes I am shallow. But I&apos;m young. It&apos;s allowed.&quot;  22nd over: Bangladesh 103-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 61, Mahmudullah 23) Mahmudullah, pushing nervously, drags Swann&apos;s quicker ball into his back foot. That could easily have hit the stumps. An excellent maiden from Swann, full of variety. &quot;I think I would have shot a stranger a startled glance if I spotted them necking cider at 7am on the train,&quot; says Tom van der Gucht. &quot;I think, unfortunately, as a drink it has trampish connotations and conjures up images of desperados drinking to forget their sorry existences. However if you had been wearing a dinner jacket and were chugging from a bottle of Verve Clique people may have considered you something of a 13th Duke of Wymbourne cad and smiled whimsically at your roguishness whilst secretly envying your all-night frivolities.&quot; It was Marks &amp; Spencer cider, so at least I was a classyish tramp.  23rd over: Bangladesh 110-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 68, Mahmudullah 23) Tamim Iqbal steers Bresnan carefully wide of Collingwood at second slip and away for four. Then he has an almighty leaden-footed yahoo at a short one, meeting only fresh air.  24th over: Bangladesh 115-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 69, Mahmudullah 27) &quot;Come on Avatar!&quot; shouts one of the England fielders. Fat lot of good it did, because Mahmudullah drove the next ball from Swann through extra-cover for four. Bangladesh are rattling along at more than 4.5 runs per over.  25th over: Bangladesh 117-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 70, Mahmudullah 27) Bresnan goes around the wicket to Tamim Iqbal, who moves into the seventies with the aid of a slight misfield from Kevin Pietersen. &quot;Apart from the answer &apos;Because that&apos;s his new nickname,&apos; does anyone know why Matt Prior keeps calling Graeme Swann &quot;Avatar&apos;?&quot; asks Anthony Pease.  26th over: Bangladesh 124-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 70, Mahmudullah 35) A brilliant stroke from Mahmudullah, who dances down the track to Swann and drives him for a handsome straight six. He looks a very accomplished young batsman. &quot;As you have worked a night you can test your etiquette on home soil by having a can of cider whilst walking through Kings Cross when you leave work,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;Oh hang on half the people in the streets in Kings Cross will also be drinking cider in the morning.&quot;  27th over: Bangladesh 134-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 70, Mahmudullah 45) Mahmudullah carries on his merry way, flashing Bresnan behind point for four and then pulling him emphatically for four more. Shot! &quot;As you have worked a night you can test your etiquette on home soil by having a can of cider whilst walking through Kings Cross when you leave work,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;Oh hang on, half the people in the streets in Kings Cross will also be drinking cider in the morning.&quot;  28th over: Bangladesh 140-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 71, Mahmudullah 50) England are suddenly hemmorhaging runs. Mahmudallah sweeps Swann fine for four to move to 49 and then takes a single to reach an extremely good half-century from 54 balls.  29th over: Bangladesh 145-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 75, Mahmudullah 51) Broad replaces the ineffective Bresnan (10-1-47-0) and Tamim opens the face to guide him for four. Ten overs to go, and counting.  WICKET! Bangladesh 145-4 (Mahmudullah c Collingwood b Swann 51) Mahmudullah&apos;s excellent innings comes to an end in tame fashion with a gloved sweep that loops straight to Collingwood at first slip. No argument that time, and that&apos;s the end of a fine partnership of 94 in 18 overs.  30th over: Bangladesh 145-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 75, Shakib Al Hasan 0) A wicket maiden for Swann.  31st over: Bangladesh 146-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 76, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Broad immediately bombs Shakib Al Hasan with short stuff, all of which he defends well. There are another eight overs to go.  32nd over: Bangladesh 147-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 0) &quot;Come on boys, the original two men on nought fellas!&quot; shouts one of the England fielders. Quite why this would be the original I have no idea. Anyway, Tamim scuppers the plan by getting off strike, leaving Shakib to defend the remainder of Swann&apos;s over.  33rd over: Bangladesh 148-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Broad has a biggish shout for LBW against Tamim but it was clearly sliding down leg from around the wicket. Broad has been sharp today.  34th over: Bangladesh 148-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Tamim, who looks to be playing for the close now, defends solidly in that over from Swann. A maiden.  35th over: Bangladesh 149-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 1) Shakib is beaten by a good delivery from Broad that was too close for the cut stroke he was attempting, but he gets off the mark next ball with a work to midwicket. Tamim is then beaten by a real peach that seamed and lifted. That really was a marvellous leg-cutter, a mirror image of the sort Jason Gillespie used to bowl to right-handers in his pomp.  36th over: Bangladesh 149-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 1) A maiden from Swann to the near strokeless Shakib, whose sole intention is to be at the crease tomorrow morning. Three overs to go.  37th over: Bangladesh 149-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 1) A smart move from Alastair Cook, who has decided to give Steve Finn two overs while Bangladesh are batting for the close. The first of them, to Tamim Iqbal, is a maiden.  WICKET! Bangladesh 149-5 (Shakib Al Hasan b Swann 1) This is a stunning piece of bowling. Having almost bowled Shakib with the previous delivery, a quicker one that kept low, he lured Shakib forward into the drive with a tantalising piece of flight, and the ball turned sharply from middle stump to hit the top of off. High-class spin bowling, even if it wasn&apos;t a great stroke just before the close, and a big breakthrough for England in the penultimate over of the day.  38th over: Bangladesh 149-5 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shahadat Hossain 0) The nightwatchman Shahadat Hossain survives a long, long referral to the third umpire for a catch at silly point via bat and boot. It was an odd one: from behind the wicket it definitely looked out, but from in front it looked equally certain that it had hit the ground. The third umpire could not be absolutely certain that it was out, so it was the right decision.  39th over: Bangladesh 154-5 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 81, Shahadat Hossain 0) That&apos;s the end of another good day for England, who are set fair for an innings victory despite a very fine innings from Tamim Iqbal.

Yet if Yakuza 3&apos;s story covers well-trodden ground, it&apos;s about the only part of the game that feels conventional. Newcomers to the Yakuza series are catered for in lengthy recaps of the first two games at the outset, though anyone expecting a Japanese Grand Theft Auto will likely be disappointed at the size of the sandbox. Similarly, those spoiled by the fluid combat sequences of God of War III or Batman: Arkham Asylum will bristle at the loose brawls, which can initially feel awkward. But that&apos;s because Yakuza 3 does things very much its own way. It is steeped so utterly in Japanese culture that it&apos;s impossible to come away without a little more knowledge of the place. The action is broken up by an astonishing wealth of distractions, from crane-grabbing arcade games and gambling dens to golf and fishing interludes. And the skull-crackingly brutal fights provide improvisation as well as spectacle: smashing a bicycle over someone&apos;s head has never felt so spontaneous, nor, oddly, so satisfying.

Yakuza 3 is best described as the Japanese answer to Grand Theft Auto, except with an impeccable brawling engine, drawn heavily from the great Japanese beat-em-up tradition, in place of the cars and guns. You play Kazuma Kiryu, legendary ex-Fourth Chairman of the Tojo Clan, now retired to the bucolic surroundings of Okinawa, where he runs an orphanage. You can tell he&apos;s still a Yakuza, though, thanks to the trendy shirt and facial hair, plus the tattoo covering his back. Early indications aren&apos;t great, as Yakuza 3 proceeds at a glacial pace, with countless cut-scenes, conversations to trawl through (in subtitled Japanese, thankfully, rather than incongruously dubbed into American) and trivial tasks that involve looking after kids. But graphically, it is fantastic, and the gloriously immersive and detailed Tokyo and small-town Okinawa neighbourhoods evoke memories of Yu Suzuki&apos;s overblown but groundbreaking Shenmue. Indeed, Yakuza 3 has been hailed by Sega fanboys as the nearest thing to Shenmue 3, and its labyrinthine but gripping storyline \u2013 the Yakuza are circling around Kiryu-san&apos;s orphanage due to a putative deal to build an American air base and resort in the vicinity, and Kazuma, after being reluctantly dragged into the local Yakuza family, returns to Tokyo when full-blown internecine war breaks out \u2013 augmented with countless agreeably weird side-missions, and the ability to shop, hang out in bars and so on does indeed make it worthy of Shenmue comparisons. Gameplay-wise, it&apos;s fairly old-fashioned, although the brawling engine is nice and responsive. You get points to upgrade Kazuma&apos;s abilities when you defeat bosses (who literally are Yakuza bosses), and if you come across &quot;revelations&quot; \u2013 strange goings-on that you photograph with your mobile and blog about \u2013 you get extra fighting abilities. Mini-games, including the obligatory gambling games and even a full Tiger Woods-style golf engine, are rife, as are hidden collectibles. Even the core game is lengthy, and completists should be able to keep themselves occupied for weeks or even months. Yakuza 3 won&apos;t be to everyone&apos;s taste, but if the idea of immersing yourself in a meticulous and, more often than not, pretty bonkers reconstruction of the world of the Yakuza appeals, you&apos;ll love it. If you played Shenmue, it will probably elicit a few tears of nostalgia. And maybe ponder the irony of Sega providing Sony with an exclusive game that will become a cult classic, which has roots in the Dreamcast era when Sega and Sony were sworn enemies."}, {"sentences": ["He really needs to do both to be him.&quot; Kitano won the Golden Lion at the 1997 Venice film festival for Hana-Bi; the next thing he did on television was parade down the streets of Tokyo in his underwear."], "tags": ["Art", "Takeshi Kitano", "Installation", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-15T21:30:01Z", "title": "Takeshi Kitano: one original gangster", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/mar/15/takeshi-kitano-interview", "article": "There&apos;s plenty of evidence that artists can make decent movies \u2013 Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor Wood, Julian Schnabel to name a few \u2013 but it rarely works the other way around. Looking at Dennis Hopper&apos;s goatee-stroking conceptual works, or Sylvester Stallone&apos;s hamfisted attempts at abstract expressionism, you\u00a0suspect they were misled into overestimating their talents by a coterie of star-struck sycophants. So when it was announced last year that Takeshi Kitano, Japan&apos;s foremost film-maker, was holding an art exhibition in Paris, the alarm bells rang. Over the last 15 years, Kitano has turned out a series of spare, violent, existential thrillers, but increasingly his prime concern seems to be his own navel: last month saw the UK release of his 2005 film Takeshis&apos;, a wilfully confusing essay exploring the many facets of Kitano&apos;s personality. He followed that with the self-referential Glory to the Film-Maker, this time exploring the burden of being an important movie director. Variety magazine&apos;s damning verdict? &quot;Hailed as Kitano&apos;s 8&amp;\u00bd, pic weighs in closer to 1&amp;\u00bc&quot;. And then there are the paintings. Anyone who has seen 1997&apos;s Hana-Bi, Kitano&apos;s best film, will be familiar with them: the movie is full of the director&apos;s own artworks. At best, they are colourful, crafted examples of what you might call &quot;the naive style&quot;; at worst, they are the sort of amateurish doodles you might find at a flea market. Yet here he is in Paris, with carte blanche to take over the Fondation Cartier, a prestigious steel-and-glass culture outlet on the Left Bank. Meanwhile, over at the Pompidou Centre, there is a parallel retrospective of Kitano&apos;s films; last week, France&apos;s minister of culture made him a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres \u2013 the country&apos;s highest artistic accolade. In fact, Kitano&apos;s takeover turns out not to be an exhibition at all; it&apos;s a children&apos;s funfair. Some of his paintings have been turned into giant transparencies and stuck on the glass walls; there are jokey installations and interactive exhibits making fun of art. The centrepiece is a clanking contraption like a steam locomotive, turned by a giant pair of disembodied feet in tatty woollen socks; at its prow, there is an ordinary sewing machine stitching a little piece of material. The might of industry is harnessed to make a pointless little decoration. Another installation, The Japanese Imperial Army&apos;s Secret Files, consists of scale models of animals turned into weapons: a whale with an aircraft runway strapped to its back, an elephant with a gun attached to its trunk, that sort of thing. There is a stall where participants can fire paintball guns at large cut-out dinosaurs and a machine that produces random Jackson Pollock-style paintings. There are strange chimera, animatronic puppets and scientific brainteasers. Far from being another journey into Kitano&apos;s psyche, it&apos;s generous, accessible, funny. &quot;I still haven&apos;t figured out why a prominent institution like the Fondation Cartier would want to hold an exhibition of my work. Not a clue,&quot; says a bemused Kitano, talking through his interpreter. Far from the shark-like killer he often plays in his movies, he is genial and expressive in person, verging on the cuddly. He is starting to look like the 63-year-old he is, even if his hair has blond highlights. &quot;When people tell me I&apos;m an artist, I say what? It&apos;s impossible for me to take the idea seriously. So I just wanted to have fun here. Psychologically, I&apos;m still a 12-year-old boy.&quot; A sideline in standup The title of Kitano&apos;s exhibition is Gosse\u00a0de Peintre, which you could translate either as &quot;kid of painting&quot; or &quot;painter&apos;s kid&quot;. It&apos;s a reference not just to Kitano&apos;s juvenile side but also to the fact that his father was a painter and decorator. In his autobiography, Kitano wrote of being embarrassed by his father&apos;s lowly trade, and at having to help paint the houses of his classmates. He is now generally sceptical about contemporary or conceptual art, or indeed anything too theoretical. He says he has never heard of Damien Hirst, although he is friends with Japanese pop art mogul Takashi Murakami. &quot;The thing about art for me is that you can go on theorising your work forever, because it&apos;s open to interpretation,&quot; he says. He points to his steam engine contraption as an example. &quot;I can give a straightforward answer: it&apos;s just funny, isn&apos;t it? Or I could say it&apos;s a very ironic comment on ecology and the advances of technology, in that human beings waste all these resources like iron, coal, plastic and whatnot, just to sew this little thing.&quot; He agreed to the exhibition because he had been making a film about art, recently released in France. Entitled Achilles and the Tortoise, it is a black comedy about a terminally self-absorbed artist, who goes through every style in the book before realising, at the end of his life, that he&apos;s simply no good. Again, all the paintings featured in the film are by Kitano. He says he has no illusions about his own talents. &quot;I paint for the sheer joy of painting,&quot; he says. &quot;I have never sold any of my paintings. I&apos;d rather give them to people for free.&quot; To Japanese audiences, Kitano&apos;s populist mischief-making will be nothing new. To the west, he might be Takeshi Kitano, respected film-maker and actor; back home, he is better known as &quot;Beat Takeshi&quot;, ubiquitous television celebrity, Japan&apos;s answer to Chris Tarrant. He has been a household name there since the 1980s, initially for his frank, fast-talking standup comedy. Now, he hosts eight TV shows a week, including a maths quiz, a Harry Hill-style clips show, even an art-based variety show called Anyone Can Be Picasso. He is regularly ticked off by the censors for pushing the boundaries of decency, and his audiences love him for it. But until recently Japanese audiences have largely ignored Kitano&apos;s movies, which only found an audience when they were praised by European critics. He saves his arthouse auteur persona for when he&apos;s overseas. It&apos;s a double life even Clark Kent would struggle to get his head around. According to his producer, Masayuki Mori, who has known him for 30 years, Kitano&apos;s career is like a pendulum. &quot;The more serious he gets in his films, the stronger he swings back to the other side, and the more absurd and stupid his TV shows get. He really needs to do both to be him.&quot; Kitano won the Golden Lion at the 1997 Venice film festival for Hana-Bi; the next thing he did on television was parade down the streets of Tokyo in his underwear. You wouldn&apos;t have caught Kurosawa doing that. Or even Chris Tarrant. It probably says more about us than him that Europeans tend to prefer Kitano&apos;s dark, violent, mysterious side. But he is the first to observe that comedy often simply doesn&apos;t translate as well as &quot;matters of life and death&quot;. To Kitano, there is no great contradiction in his work, anyway. &quot;Humour is like violence. They both come to you unexpectedly, and the more unpredictable they both are, the better it gets. That&apos;s how it works. If somebody slips on a banana, it&apos;s funnier if it&apos;s someone high up, like a king or an emperor, than if it&apos;s an ordinary man. So this demonic character is shared between comedy and violence. They both lurk in the most unpredictable moments.&quot; After the crash Perhaps his Paris exhibition will finally fill in some of the gaps in Kitano&apos;s divided personality \u2013 except that the pendulum swings the other way there, too. He might poke fun at art, but painting clearly has a therapeutic, even spiritual dimension for him. He took it up in 1994, while recovering from a serious motorcycle accident. He hit a crash barrier and suffered severe head injuries \u2013 the right side of his face still bears the scars. The way Kitano tells it, a piece of bone threatened to enter his brain. &quot;The surgeon said I might go crazy if they didn&apos;t operate. I thought, &apos;Good. I might become a crazy painter \u2013 like Picasso or Van Gogh!&apos;&quot; Those early paintings appear in Hana-Bi, as the work of a character who is coming to terms with being paralysed after a shooting incident. Mori, the producer, later tells me Kitano has no memory of the crash and gets events mixed up. The surgeon did want to operate, but to restore facial movement on his right side. Kitano refused, preferring to accept his fate. Death, violence and suicide are constant preoccupations in his work. In several of his films, Kitano&apos;s character kills himself in some way, or at least contemplates it; he has described his motorcycle accident as an &quot;unconscious suicide attempt&quot;. He has also regularly committed career suicide, it seems, by making a wilfully unappealing comedy just as he is starting to get serious critical acclaim. Acknowledging this, he has referred to his recent films as part of an ongoing &quot;creative destruction&quot; of his career, and it&apos;s difficult to tell whether he is joking or not. Either way, that stage of his life is coming to an end, he says. His next movie, Outrage, will return to more familiar yakuza thriller territory. &quot;Psychologically as well as physically, during the last two or three films I&apos;ve been going through the transition from being a middle-aged man to being an old man. It&apos;s been excruciating, but I think I&apos;ve survived it.&quot; Does he feel reborn? &quot;No. I feel ... fermented,&quot; he says with a laugh. With his restless intelligence, it&apos;s hard to imagine Kitano ever describing himself as settled, but he seems to have struck a happy equilibrium \u2013 part wise old man, part 12-year-old kid."}, {"sentences": ["One ad, &quot;Tokyo Dancing Hotel&quot;, sees Jackman call on his theatrical skills in a choreographed routine reminiscent of his song-and-dance performance as a host at last year&apos;s Oscars.", "&quot;For Tokyo Dancing Hotel you see an image of Hugh Jackman standing, dancing on water with two Japanese girls in a rooftop garden and that single image becomes iconic and something that people will always reference back to Lipton,&quot; said Gracey."], "tags": ["Advertising", "Marketing & PR", "Media", "Hugh Jackman", "Film", "UK news", "X-Men"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-18T07:25:05Z", "title": "Hugh Jackman steps in for Lipton ads", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/18/hugh-jackman-lipton-ice-tea", "article": "     Australian actor Hugh Jackman, star of films including X-Men and Australia, is to show off his dancing skills in a global TV campaign for Lipton Ice Tea. It is the first time that Jackman, perhaps best known as Wolverine in X-Men and the rugged stockman Drover opposite Nicole Kidman in Baz Luhrmann&apos;s Australia, has appeared in a TV ad campaign. The first of two ads will break internationally from Monday. One ad, &quot;Tokyo Dancing Hotel&quot;, sees Jackman call on his theatrical skills in a choreographed routine reminiscent of his song-and-dance performance as a host at last year&apos;s Oscars. The second ad, &quot;Hard Day&apos;s Work&quot;, sees Jackman in a love scene with Latin American actress Ana de la Reguera. The ads were directed for the agency DDB Paris by Michael Gracey, the man responsible for Evian&apos;s Roller Babies and T-Mobile&apos;s flashmob-style dance. &quot;For Tokyo Dancing Hotel you see an image of Hugh Jackman standing, dancing on water with two Japanese girls in a rooftop garden and that single image becomes iconic and something that people will always reference back to Lipton,&quot; said Gracey. Lipton Ice Tea, which is produced by Lipton in a joint venture with PepsiCo, signed Jackman in a three year-deal in January, identifying his performance at the Oscars as evidence of his appeal to a global fan base. The campaign, which will run online in the UK, forms part of Lipton Ice Tea&apos;s &quot;Drink Positive&quot; marketing strategy, which launched earlier this year. Lipton Ice Tea used celebrities in its TV advertising during the 1980s and early 1990s, including Magnum PI&apos;s Tom Selleck, Sylvester Stalloneand tennis star Jimmy Connors. But the brand has not used a &quot;face&quot; since 2002, when Eric Cantona fronted a campaign across Europe. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The minister for immigration, Chris Evans, said that $12.5m in visa fees would be returned to applicants who have requested General Skilled Migration (GSM) visas. Evans said new rules for work visas responded to falling demand for graduates trained in skills such as hairdressing and catering and with lower English language proficiency. The Migration Occupations in Demand List, which Evans said was outdated and contained 106 occupations, many of which are less-skilled and no longer in demand, will be replaced. The Skilled Occupation List is being developed by an independent body, Skills Australia, and will be more targeted towards skills in demand in the Australian economy, his department said. &quot;This will make a permanent difference so that Australia is able to choose who migrates to this country, based on whether they are going to make a contribution,&quot; Evans told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. &quot;If they don&apos;t have the English language skills, don&apos;t have the trade skills and can&apos;t get a job, then really, they shouldn&apos;t be eligible for permanent residency.&quot; The GSM visa has created a surge in demand for vocational training and English language courses since it was introduced in 2001.

The Daily Yomiuri reported that Fortress Japan staff pressurised customers into signing contracts for English-learning programmes, often telling students that they would never be able to find work with their current level of English. Students complained of being telephoned repeatedly and coerced by sales staff at interviews. The study options offered to prospective students also lacked flexibility. Concerns about Fortress Japan&apos;s selling style were raised last year and the company was the first to be investigated by the new consumer protection agency.

Oi!'s rise and fall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/18/oi-cockney-rejects-garry-bushell-interview", "article": "The Cockney Rejects&apos; 1980 performance at Birmingham&apos;s Cedar Club remains unnoted in the annals of rock history. It warrants no mention when music journalists compile the 100 Most Shocking Moments in Rock, nor the 100 Craziest Gigs Ever, which seems like a terrible oversight. In fairness, no one is ever going to rank the show by the East End quartet \u2013 then enjoying chart success with a punk take on the West Ham terrace anthem I&apos;m Forever Blowing Bubbles \u2013 alongside Jimi Hendrix at Monterey in terms of musical brilliance. Still, it has its own claim to historical import: by all accounts, it was the most violent gig in British history. &quot;I&apos;d seen quite a bit on the terraces or outside football grounds, but this was carnage,&quot; says Jeff Turner, today an immensely amiable decorator, then &quot;Stinky&quot; Turner, the Cockney Rejects&apos; teenage frontman, cursed with what his former manager Garry Bushell tactfully describes as &quot;a bit of a temper&quot;. Turner continues: &quot;There was a lot of people cut and hurt, I got cut, my brother [Rejects&apos; guitarist Micky Geggus] really got done bad, with an ashtray, the gear was decimated, there was people lying around on the floor. Carnage.&quot; The problem was football-related. &quot;Most of the punk bands at the time, they had their ideals \u2013 the Clash, Career Opportunities, political stuff, fair play,&quot; says Turner. &quot;When I was a kid, my thought for punk rock was that it could put West Ham on the front pages.&quot; To this end, the band \u2013 affiliated to the club&apos;s hooligans in the Inter City Firm \u2013 had appeared on Top of the Pops in West Ham\u00a0shirts. &quot;After\u00a0that, everybody wanted to fight us, but you couldn&apos;t back down,&quot; says Turner. &quot;Once you were defeated, it would have opened the floodgates for everybody.&quot; So the Rejects and their party fought: &quot;Twenty Cockneys against \u2026 well, not all 300 Brummies were trying to attack us, but I&apos;d say we were trying to fight off 50 to 100 people.&quot; In the aftermath, Micky Geggus was charged with GBH and affray, and the Cockney Rejects&apos; career as a live band was, in effect, over. An attempt to play Liverpool later that year ended after six songs &quot;because there was 150 Scousers trying to kill us&quot;, while a subsequent gig in Birmingham was aborted by the police: &quot;The old bill got wind of it and escorted us on to the M6,&quot; says Turner. &quot;At the time, I was gutted, but now, I think, thank God for that. Someone could have died.&quot; Perhaps it&apos;s unsurprising the gig has been swept under the carpet of musical history: after all, so has the genre the Cockney Rejects inadvertently inspired. Thirty years after Bushell \u2013 then a writer for the music paper Sounds, as well as the Rejects&apos; manager \u2013 coined the term &quot;Oi!&quot;\u00a0to describe a third generation of punk-inspired working-class bands playing &quot;harder music on every level, guitar driven, terrace choruses&quot;, it remains largely reviled or ignored in Britain. In the eyes of its remaining fans, Oi! is the &quot;real thing&quot;, the genuine sound of Britain&apos;s streets in the late 70s, populated by artists Bushell championed when the rest of the music press concentrated on &quot;bands who dropped literary references you wouldn&apos;t have got if you didn&apos;t have a masters&apos; degree and wrote pretentious lyrics&quot;. Bands such as the Cockney Rejects, the Angelic Upstarts \u2013 Marxists from South Shields managed by a man Bushell colourfully describes as &quot;a psychopath \u2013 his house had bars over all the windows because people had thrown firebombs through it&quot; \u2013 Red Alert, Peter and the Test Tube Babies. It briefly stormed the charts. The Angelic Upstarts followed the Cockney Rejects onto Top of the Pops, while Splodgenessabounds made the Top\u00a010 with the deathless Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please. But today, if the general public have heard of it at all, they tend to agree with the assessment once offered by journalist and broadcaster Stuart Maconie: &quot;Punk&apos;s stunted idiot half-brother, musically primitive and politically unsavoury, with its close links to far-right groups.&quot; It is, asserts Bushell, &quot;without a doubt, the most misunderstood genre in history&quot;. The problem isn&apos;t really to do with the music, although protracted exposure to the oeuvre of Peter and the Test Tube Babies \u2013 home to Student Wankers, Up Yer Bum and Pick Your Nose (and Eat It) \u2013 could leave all but the hardiest soul pleading tearfully for a few literary references and pretentious lyrics. The problem is Oi!&apos;s adoption by the far-right as its soundtrack of choice. It wasn&apos;t the only part of street culture to attract the attentions of the National Front and the British Movement in the late 70s and early 80s. Losing out at the polling stations thanks to the rise of Margaret Thatcher, the NF had instigated a programme of &quot;direct action&quot;: it would attempt to kick its way into the headlines at football matches and gigs. Chart bands such as Sham 69, Madness and the Specials had concerts disrupted.In 1978, seig-heiling skinheads caused \u00a37,500 worth of damage at a Sham 69 gig in London. But it was to Oi! that the far-right was most attracted, not least because it attracted both football hooligans and the re-emergent skinhead movement \u2013 two groups the NF&apos;s direct-action programme targeted for recruitment. &quot;We played a gig in Camden, we saw these Nazi skinheads beating the shit out of these two punks,&quot; remembers Turner. &quot;They&apos;d managed to wreck Sham 69&apos;s career, but us with our following&quot; \u2013 the ICF was then headed by Cass Pennant, whose parents were Jamaican \u2013 &quot;we weren&apos;t going to have it. We just went down and absolutely slaughtered them. We declared to them that if they ever set foot where we were again, we&apos;d decimate them.&quot; And so it proved. &quot;Neo-nazis confronted the Rejects again at Barking station,&quot; remembers Bushell. &quot;They basically told them, &apos;We&apos;re going to come to your gigs, we&apos;re going to do this and do that.&apos; The Rejects crew battered them all over the station. They didn&apos;t come to the gigs after that.&quot; Bushell points out that there was &quot;a Nazi subculture all the way through punk. Malcolm McLaren started it all with the swastikas, which thick people saw and thought, &apos;Oh, they must be Nazis.&apos;&quot; There were white power punk bands, too \u2013 such as the Dentists and the Ventz, which were formed by the &quot;Punk Front&quot; division of the National Front, in lieu of real punk bands showing any interest in promoting white supremacy. It was a trick the NF would be forced to pull again when Oi! bands resisted their overtures \u2013 the party recruited a failed punk band from Blackpool called Skrewdriver and repositioned them as the musical voice of the neo-Nazi movement. &quot;It was totally distinct from us,&quot; says Bushell. &quot;We had no overlap other than a mutual dislike for each other.&quot; Bushell&apos;s latterday career as a gleeful provoker of the liberal left, writing for the Sun and the Daily Star, probably hasn&apos;t done much to help public perceptions regarding Oi!&apos;s political affiliations. When Oi! was at its height, however, he says he was a Trotskyist who did his best to infuse the movement with socialist principles. He organised Oi! conferences and debates, &quot;trying to shape the movement, trying to stop the culture of violence, talking about doing unemployment benefits, working with the Right to Work campaign, prisoners&apos; rights gigs \u2013 I thought we could unite punk and social progress.&quot; Not everyone was receptive: &quot;Stinky Turner was at one debate, and he didn&apos;t contribute much, apart from the classic line, &apos;Oi! is working class, and if you&apos;re not working class you&apos;ll get a kick in the bollocks.&apos;&quot; He laughs. &quot;Perfect! That was what the Rejects were all about.&quot; Trotskyist or not, Bushell also managed to exacerbate the problem, not least by masterminding the unfortunately titled 1981 compilation Strength Thru Oi!. &quot;I didn&apos;t know!&quot; he protests. &quot;I&apos;d been active in politics for years and had never come across the phrase &apos;strength through joy&apos; as a Nazi slogan.It was the title of a Skids EP.&quot; To compound matters, its cover featured a photograph of a skinhead who turned out to be the delectable-sounding Nicky Crane, who \u2013 nothing if not a multi-tasker \u2013 managed to combine life as a neo-Nazi activist with a secret career as a gay porn star. &quot;I had a Christmas card on the wall, it had that image that was on the cover of Strength Thru Oi!, but washed out. I honestly, hand on my heart, thought it was a still from The Wanderers,&quot; Bushell says. &quot;It was only when the album came through for me to approve the artwork that I saw his tattoos. Of course, if I hadn&apos;t been impatient, I would have said, right, fucking scrap this, let&apos;s shoot something else entirely. Instead, we airbrushed the tattoos out. There were two mistakes there, both mine. Hands up.&quot; Much worse was to follow. A July 1981 Oi! gig featuring the 4-Skins and the Business in Southall \u2013 the scene of a racist murder in 1976 and the race riot that ended in the death of Blair Peach in 1979 \u2013 erupted into violent chaos: 110 people were hospitalised, and the venue, the Hambrough Tavern, was burned down after being petrol bombed. Depending on whose version of events you believe, it was either sparked by skinheads attacking Asians or Asian youths attacking gig-goers: either way, the Southall riot stopped Oi!&apos;s commercial progress dead. The Cockney Rejects found that shops refused to stock their new album, The Power and the Glory: &quot;I&apos;d sung a song called Oi Oi Oi and all of a sudden there&apos;s an Oi! movement and I didn&apos;t really want anything to do with it,&quot; says Turner. &quot;This awful, awful shit happened in Southall, we were never there, and we got the rug pulled out from under our feet. I went from the TV screen to the labour exchange in 18 months.&quot; An inflammatory article in the Daily Mail exacerbated the situation further: &quot;We never had an problems with Nazi activists at our gigs until after the Mail&apos;s piece,&quot; says Bushell. &quot;Only then did we have people coming down, thinking it was going to be this rightwing thing, When they discovered it wasn&apos;t, that&apos;s when the trouble started. I was attacked at an Upstarts gig at the 100 Club by about 20 of them. I had a knife pulled on me at Charing Cross station.&quot; That should have been that, had it not been for Oi!&apos;s curious afterlife in America. Steve Whale \u2013 who joined the Business after Southall and struggled on through the 80s, repositioning the band as &quot;street punk&quot; \u2013 unexpectedly found himself in possession of a US recording contract with Bad Religion&apos;s label Epitaph, lauded by bands including Boston&apos;s Irish-punk stars the Dropkick Murphys and the extraordinarily influential California band\u00a0Rancid. Jeff Turner has just returned from a tour of Japan: &quot;Osaka, Tokyo, Nagoya. I haven&apos;t got fortunes but I&apos;m able to do that. That&apos;s all I can ask for, it makes me\u00a0happy.&quot; &quot;I had Lars Freidricksen of Rancid come in and sit in the pub round the corner from my house, welling up, telling me if it wasn&apos;t for Oi! he might have killed himself as a teenager,&quot; says Garry Bushell. &quot;I thought, &apos;Fuck me, it&apos;s really had an effect on these people.&apos; I&apos;m not proud of the way Oi! was misunderstood, but I&apos;m proud of the music, proud of what it started, proud of what it gave punk.&quot; In Britain, he concedes, the genre&apos;s name is still blackened in most people&apos;s eyes. &quot;There were people in 1976 saying punk had to be a Nazi thing because of the swastikas. The difference is, those bands had rock journalists on their side. The Oi! bands only had me.&quot; He laughs, a little ruefully. &quot;I did me best.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["\u2022 It&apos;s not too long before I head off to pastures unknown, but as if that uncertainty wasn&apos;t enough, researchers in Tokyo have built a robot journalist that examines its surroundings, asks questions, writes short articles and publishes them to the web."], "tags": ["YouTube", "Google", "Robots", "Technology", "Viacom"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-19T07:30:00Z", "title": "YouTube defends itself, Google China rumours spread - and robot journalists take over the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/mar/19/breakfast-briefing", "article": "\u2022 If you missed yesterday&apos;s slanging match between YouTube and Viacom, well, you&apos;re in for a treat.

It&apos;s due to demographics. First: advances in medicine and a diet high in raw squid have helped to make Japan the oldest society that has ever existed in the long history of human societies. Second, because of its ridiculously low birth rate and frosty attitude to immigrants, Japan is now the first large industrialised country to experience a population decrease as a result of natural causes. In short, as its oldsters get even older, and its youngsters spend all their time commuting on packed trains in identical black suits instead of having wild unprotected sex, Japan&apos;s population is shrinking. Very rapidly, in fact. In 2008, it lost 79,000 people. If such trends continue, the Japanese child and working-age population will decrease by almost half in the coming 50 years, while the ranks of the elderly will swell. What does this mean? To Richard Hendy, whose ongoing online essay Spike Japan is some of the funniest and saddest writing on contemporary Japan today \u2013 and to whom I am in debt for the statistics in the preceding paragraph \u2013 it means rust. Lots and lots of beautiful rust. A self-proclaimed &quot;luster after rust&quot;, Hendy travels the Japanese hinterland taking photos of crumbling architecture and shuttered buildings. He goes to the remote, and not-so-remote, places from which the population is disappearing. He tracks abandoned railway lines. He takes pictures of deserted schools. He wanders through silent factories. And he revels, if that&apos;s the right word, in the melancholy beauty of his adopted country&apos;s air of neglect. He says things such as &quot;What a patchwork quilt of corrugation&quot; or &quot;Look how delicately the embers of rust lick up and down the ridges and furrows; how the windows shed tears, grow beards of rust&quot;. Meanwhile, he unspools a wry and uniquely informed commentary on Japan&apos;s twin woes: economic (aka &quot;the malodorous pall of the Bubble&quot;) and demographic. Together, these two demons have all but utterly consumed hundreds of towns, thousands of villages. Hendy is determined, in his odd way, to honour them. You can scan through Spike Japan for the spectacular snaps, but you&apos;ll likely soon be snared by the stories, too; the rhapsodies about decaying infrastructure. He goes to Oizumi, where the Brazilian descendants of Japanese emigres had a large, vibrant community until the recession shuttered most of the main-street shops. He follows the Kashima Tetsudo line, which recently joined the ranks of Hokkaido&apos;s dead railways; between 1985 and 1989 it lost a full 20 passenger lines, &quot;an axe even more brutal and wielded over a shorter span than the one Richard Beeching brought down on British Rail in the 1960s&quot;. He takes snaps of disused bridges, forsaken hamlets and station platforms lost to encroaching greenery. The photos have an eerie poignancy. Can this really be the world&apos;s second-largest economy? Like most Japanophiles, he has a taste for kitsch. He gets drunk at a bad dance party in an abandoned brewery in Kushiro. He raves about &quot;the magnifience of [the] squalor&quot;, of the dilapidated former party district of Monbetsu. He visits what must be the least scary House of Horrors ever constructed, a shabby joke of a ride populated with creaky animatronic monsters that ends with two talking bears pleading for the disputed Northern Territories to be returned to Japan. But he saves his best photos, and his best writing, for &quot;the big one&quot;: Yubari, in Hokkaido. Explaining his fascination with Yubari, he writes:  It&apos;s always been about the unparalleled enormity of what Yubari has been through in the last half-century, as it lost almost all its coal mines in a single generation, from 1965 to 1990, and a staggering 90% of its population in two generations: 1960 to the present. The poster children for the industrial decline of the US, places like Youngstown, Ohio, Gary, Indiana, even the baddest of them all, Detroit \u2013 none come close to the experience of Yubari, which has gone from being a vibrant if still gritty metropolis of around 120,000 people in 1960, replete with cinemas, dancehalls, and even a five-storey department store, to a mere shell of a city. It&apos;s a city in name only, its 11,500 people strung out across the hills and mountains in what now amounts to no more than a straggle of villages.  Yubari now staggers forward on the crutch of its comically optimistic melon industry, as well as an exceedingly creepy caramel factory, where the employees on the assembly line wear white biological-hazard suits like something out of ET. Hendy takes awestruck photos of the posters of Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and John Wayne films that Yubari administrators have seen fit to erect throughout its desolate town centre. Elsewhere, he finds a poster for a sweet potato liquor that proclaims: &quot;Our town will revive full of smile in near future,&quot; and a huge, corroded pillar reading: &quot;Model town: with everyone&apos;s effort we can drive away bad behaviour.&quot; The pillar is the only remnant of the nearby town of Kashima, home to 20,000 people in 1960, now vanished from the map in all but name. Most affecting of all is the hilarious, terrifying, heartbreaking ruin of Coal History Village. Like failing mining towns the world over, when supplies ran low, Yubari turned to the dark alchemy of tourism in a desperate bid to turn coal into gold. Coal History Village was half museum, half theme park. The entire complex, water slides and all, now stands derelict. The photos are incredible. &quot;Everything in Yubari rusts,&quot; Hendy writes. As Yubari, so Japan. Hendy&apos;s demographics seem implacable: the dependency ratio of retirees to the working population will skyrocket. Medical costs will join it in the clouds. The pension system will run out of money. Spending on infrastructure will stop. The economy will shrink, year after year after year. &quot;Japan is on the threshold of turning into the world&apos;s first post-growth society,&quot; Hendy writes. That he&apos;s able to find beauty on the other side of that threshold is, perhaps, his most remarkable achievement."}, {"sentences": ["There was an instant message text box by the side of the video and when I asked in English what they were talking about someone answered: &quot;We&apos;re discussing how to build a company while we&apos;re university students.&quot; I then noticed there was a link to a map showing exactly where their brainstorming was taking place \u2013 at Tokyo Metropolis Shibuya Ward."], "tags": ["Digital video", "Technology", "Internet", "Digital media", "Data protection"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-19T13:55:00Z", "title": "Where does privacy fit in the online video revolution? | Victor Keegan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/19/streaming-video-online-privacy", "article": "I spent part of yesterday attending a business meeting in Japan. I didn&apos;t understand a word of what was said, yet a message of sorts was coming across about where the internet is going. I stumbled upon the meeting by chance as I was playing around with Ustream.tv, a service that enables you to create or participate in live video streams anywhere in the world. On this occasion, someone was filming the entire meeting on their iPhone and broadcasting it to as many people in the world that cared to listen (in this case 24, including me). There was an instant message text box by the side of the video and when I asked in English what they were talking about someone answered: &quot;We&apos;re discussing how to build a company while we&apos;re university students.&quot; I then noticed there was a link to a map showing exactly where their brainstorming was taking place \u2013 at Tokyo Metropolis Shibuya Ward. The internet is, of course, drowning in video and you could be forgiven for wondering whether it needs any more. US internet users alone watched \u2013 wait for it \u2013 32.4bn videos in January 2010, according to comScore Video Metrix service. But the revolution is only just beginning and is already changing direction as it becomes more immediate and communitarian. Web sites such as Seesmic.com have for some time enabled live interactive video and the likes of qik and kyte enable you to stream or upload near-live videos from your mobile phones to your own global TV channel. I have qik on my new Google Nexus One phone and it is unbelievably easy to use. Two new sites that have caught my eye are vPype.com and Create.tv, which are taking video towards what vPype describes as &quot;a place for authentic real-time conversations to happen in a trusted community&quot;. Interestingly, vPype \u2013 a US company based in California \u2013 chose to launch in London this week because it believes Europe, the birthplace of internet telephony company Skype, is much more attuned to using live video in a conversational way than the US. vPype claims it is different because it streams from &quot;the cloud&quot; (remote servers) giving a more seamless experience and is being launched as a Facebook app giving it access to a live interactive network of more than 400 million people. Arnold Waldstein, chief marketing officer of the company, told the socialmedia world forum in London this week that vPype is filling a gap caused by &quot;video being used everywhere but not socially&quot;. Who could he be thinking about? Ustream also connects to Facebook and, like vPype, has a freemium model whereby a basic version is free and a more sophisticated one costs extra. If video is entering a period of live interactivity then it may need new tools to rise above the blandness of most of the YouTube archive (though other places such as Metacafe and Vimeo have more sophisticated filtering systems). Enter sites like Wreckamovie and Create.tv which enable online video editing. Create.tv, which hasn&apos;t officially been launched yet (but is available to play around with) enables people around the world to cooperate not just in editing online, but also doing storyboarding and all the other things involved in making a film. It is not as sophisticated as stand-alone editing suites, but it is a big step forward for global collaboration. Editing can be done for public or private consumption and it has online mentors to help solve problems and to help the site to spread the word. Create.tv was involved in doing a collaborative film for Oxfam for its climate change initiative, The Wave. The way things are going it won&apos;t be long before practically everyone has a mobile phone capable of streaming whatever is happening around them for as long as they like. We could all have tiny cameras on our spectacles or belts to do just that \u2013 streaming our lives to an archive in the cloud. The controversial website ChatRoulette, which links you randomly to anyone else sitting in front of a web cam (as long as they have given permission), is but a taste of the future when everyone will have instantaneous access to almost anyone else. The main limitation at the moment is battery life which some people are solving by linking phones and cameras to a reserve power supply in their backpacks. There are pluses and minuses to all of this. An archive in the cloud would be amazing tool not only to jog ones memory about what happened years ago (if there is a search engine that can do it), but an historic gift to posterity \u2013 if anyone ever has the time to go through it. It could reduce crime, since so many crimes, including personal attacks, would be on video, but at the expense of a huge and unprecedented invasion of our privacy. Indeed, if people accepted all this as they have done for CCTV cameras, we would have to redefine what the word privacy means. Whatever our fears about governments collecting data about ourselves, we seem to be two steps ahead of them in revealing it all ourselves voluntarily. twitter.com/vickeegan"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;This time last week I was following the fine, fine OBO fun in a Tokyo park, complete with snakes; this session I&apos;m on a bullet train speeding to &apos;Japan&apos;s Briefcase&apos; - the hideous industrial city that is Nagoya."], "tags": ["England in Bangladesh 2010", "England cricket team", "Bangladesh Cricket Team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-20T00:05:00Z", "title": "Bangladesh v England - day one as it happened | Rob Smyth", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/20/bangladesh-england-second-test-live", "article": " Preamble Good morning. So, congratulations to England on their victory in the second Test here in Dhaka, which secures only their second series win overseas since the heady days in 2004-05. This particular movie told us the ending in the opening scene \u2013 in the trailer, in fact \u2013 yet that does not mean it hasn&apos;t been worth watching. The most important thing, as always, is not what happens but how it happens, why it happens, and what arc each character goes through. For England, that means a particular focus in this match on Michael Carberry*, Jonathan Trott, Tim Bresnan and Steven Finn as they jockey for position ahead of You Know What; on Alastair Cook&apos;s captaincy, which was underwhelming in Chittagong, at least according to some numpty on the Wisden Cricketer site; and of course on Kevin Pietersen, who would be compelling viewing even in a documentary about Tiddlywinks. * Who isn&apos;t even playing. A great start by me.  Kings Cross in the wee hours on a Friday night Where&apos;s that eek emoticon?  Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat first on what Bob Willis says is a &quot;very dry&quot; pitch. And if anyone knows about that which is very dry, it&apos;s our beloved Bob.  Team news England pick five bowlers shock. James Tredwell comes in for his debut in place of Michael Carberry, so Jonathan Trott will open and Kevin Pietersen will presumably bat No3 for the first time in his Test career. That&apos;s a good move from England, and it&apos;s nice to see that they weren&apos;t stubborn just for the sake of it. Bangladesh make two changes, brining in Jahirul Islam and Shafiul Islam for Aftab Ahmed and Shahadat Hossain.  Bangladesh Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Jahirul Islam, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan (c), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam, Rubel Hossain. England Cook (c), Trott, Pietersen, Collingwood, Bell, Prior (wk), Bresnan, Broad, Swann, Tredwell, Finn.  The only song you&apos;ll need to listen to during tonight&apos;s play Yeah it&apos;s obvious, but so what. And muchos thanks to whoever introduced me to this during the last Test.  Sky have just shown a very enjoyable pre-play chat between the ever-excellent pair of Graeme Swann and Mike Atherton, running through how he balls his two main deliveries: the off-spinner and the slider. Swann says that he bowls with the shiny side facing away, which is unusual among offspinners, and has a slightly different grip to most others, with his fingers further into the ball. That was really good; only two of three minutes but full of insights for us common folk. I&apos;ll be turning it square within weeks.  1st over: Bangladesh 7-0 (Tamim Iqbal 7, Imrul Kayes 0) Stuart Broad opens the bowling, and his first delivery, to Tamim, is a good one that flies off the edge and low through backward point for four. Tamim, who is 21 today, then pushes three through mid-off. This looks, as Mike Atherton says, a very decent toss to win on a pitch which, unlike that Chittagong soul-sapper, should deteriorate on days four and five. &quot;What am I doing up?&quot; asks Alex Netherton before answering his own question. &quot;Listening to the cees next door play ironic eighties music. Thanks irony, thanks the internet, thanks Dalston, thanks London, thanks England. Thanks. No thanks.&quot;  2nd over: Bangladesh 17-0 (Tamim Iqbal 17, Imrul Kayes 0) Bresnan takes the new ball, even though he struggled with it in the first Test, and his first ball is a rank long hop that Tamim Iqbal smashes through the covers for four. That redefined the word &apos;swaggering&apos;. But then he&apos;s dropped next ball. He went for a booming cut stroke but the ball bounced a bit and flew off the edge towards second slip; Paul Collingwood leapt up but it went through his left hand and away for four more. It wasn&apos;t much of a chance. That takes Tamim to 15 from six balls. An opener, in a Test match, has 15 from six balls. This is definitely the 21st century. No sign of swing for Bresnan; a brave captain would get him straight off here and give it to Finn. &quot;Evening/morning,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Cook: &apos;I don&apos;t want to downgrade him but he&apos;s not a feasible option as a second spinner&apos;. Scrap! Scrap! Scrap! I reckon Cook and KP need to meet behind the bike sheds after school and sort this out once and for all. My money&apos;s on Cook deceiving KP with his matinee looks before proving himself to be a surprisingly nuggety fighter and immobilising KP with a swift kick to the swingers.&quot;  3rd over: Bangladesh 17-0 (Tamim Iqbal 17, Imrul Kayes 0) There&apos;s reasonable bounce, by subcontinental standards, with this new ball, and Imrul Kayes is beaten by a good one from Broad but otherwise defends solidly. It&apos;s a maiden. In other news, I still can&apos;t get enough of this. I found myself humming it in Sainsbury&apos;s the other day. A zenith.  4th over: Bangladesh 25-0 (Tamim Iqbal 25, Imrul Kayes 0) Tamim blasts Bresnan&apos;s first ball for four to move to 21 from 11 balls, and then picks up a couple of twos to make it 25 from 16. What a charming player he is. I want to hear Mark Nicholas commentate on him. I want to hear him say crackerjack as Tamim laces another boundary through the covers. &quot;Did you get the short straw again or do you choose to do this to yourself?&quot; asks Rai Skrupskis. &quot;Isn&apos;t there anything better to do on a Friday night in London? There isn&apos;t anything better to do in Albuquerque at the moment. Obviously.&quot; I&apos;m actually not sure there is anything better to do in London on a Friday night you know.  5th over: Bangladesh 33-0 (Tamim Iqbal 25, Imrul Kayes 7) Now Imrul Kayes joins in the fun, pinging a leg-stump half-volley through square-leg for four. England have a fair old job on today: the pitch is flat, of course, and it looks desperately hot, the sort of day when the sweat stings your eyes and you feel like you need to change your grundies every five minutes. We might just have a game here, you know. &quot;Whilst looking through an old family album last weekend and shuddering through the usual horror of pictures of myself with a lustrous mullet, I came across one particular gem,&quot; says Neil Stork-Brett. &quot;An autographed Sheffield Shield ticket stub of WA v QLD (1987?) by no less a person than Ian Botham. Scoff all you like, but how many Test wickets has your autographed piece of tat got eh? Eh?&quot; Well, no, you&apos;re right, my Scarlett Johansson, Zooey Deschanel, Victoria Pendleton and Jennie Bond autographs don&apos;t have any Test wickets, but I think I know who&apos;s winning. I keep meaning to read more about Botham&apos;s year in the Sheffield Shield, especially that flight.  6th over: Bangladesh 38-0 (Tamim Iqbal 26, Imrul Kayes 11) England already have a deep point out from Tamim. That might seem negative but I think it&apos;s a fair decision. What I don&apos;t agree with is persisting with Bresnan, who is doing nothing with this new ball. That&apos;s not a criticism of him; there&apos;s just nothing there. Give it to Finn, see what bounce he can get before it softens, and get Bresnan back to bowl as excellently with the ageing ball as he did at Chittagong. He&apos;s so obviously hittable that Imrul Kayes is able to drive him high over extra cover for four. A shot of remarkable impudence which leads Mike Atherton to cite Clayton Lambert, who along with Philo Wallace had a couple of remarkable assaults against England&apos;s new-ball bowlers in the Caribbean in 1997-98. &quot;S to the pam,&quot; says Poppy McNee. &quot;My pleasure.&quot;  7th over: Bangladesh 43-0 (Tamim Iqbal 27, Imrul Kayes 11) England haven&apos;t really hit Imrul Kayes with any short stuff so far, which is a surprise given the meek nature of his first-innings dismissal at Chittagong. A shortish delivery from Broad deflects off the pad for four leg-byes, and Bangladesh are going at more than a run a ball. &quot;I just had an urge to be unpatriotic and stick \u00a320 on Bangladesh to win,&quot; says TRAITOR Phil Withall. &quot;Only snag is that the best price I can find is 7/1! Seems a little short. I mean you can get 33/1 on the Kiwis beating Aus.&quot; That&apos;s because the Kiwis are 12 for four, chasing nine million. I don&apos;t think Bangladesh will win this, but they might give England a serious scare. It looks a very good toss to win.  8th over: Bangladesh 51-0 (Tamim Iqbal 35, Imrul Kayes 11) Bresnan does come off, but it&apos;s to be replaced by Graeme Swann. It&apos;s hard to argue with that, given Swann&apos;s form, record and all-round dudeness. But, as Bob Willis notes, it&apos;s pretty rare to see a spinner inside the first half-hour of a Test. He has a slip and short leg for Tamim, who square-drives the second ball delightfully for four and then hammers the last majestically through the covers for four more. The early overs of a Test used to be about caution, but there&apos;s nothing crepuscular about this start. It&apos;s wonderful stuff. Tamim is only 21 today; what a player he is going to be. What a player he is.  WICKET! Bangladesh 53-1 (Imrul Kayes c Finn b Broad 12) Imrul Kayes screws a loose, looping drive at Broad&apos;s slower ball towards mid-off, where Steven Finn takes a fine low catch on the run. It was great athleticism and judgement because the ball suddenly died on him, but he still got his hands under it. An important wicket for England, not least because Tamim Iqbal was dropped by Cook two balls earlier.  9th over: Bangladesh 53-1 (Tamim Iqbal 36, Junaid Siddique 0) So, that Tamim chance. He dragged a full delivery from Broad to mid-on, but Cook mistimed his leap and it flew off his left wrist. By Test standards, it was a sitter. &quot;Rob - I&apos;ve just stumbled in, horrid drunk, and it seems that Bangladesh are scoring at six an over????&quot; says Ed Battison. &quot;Confused now, surely our attack can&apos;t be that bad?&quot; They haven&apos;t been bad at all. It&apos;s just been exhilarating batting from a rare talent.  10th over: Bangladesh 54-1 (Tamim Iqbal 37, Junaid Siddique 0) A decent over from Swann, the highlight of which was a quicker one that almost got through Tamim. &quot;Thanks for that Edward Khil link Rob,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;As an experienced insomniac I&apos;m always on the look out for tunes that will suddenly come back to me at 4.30 in the morning and go round and round my brain until I wake exhausted 30 minutes after I finally fall asleep and with only 15 minutes before I&apos;m supposed to be setting off for work.&quot; I love his ludicrous little laugh after 1:53. Hohohohohoho!  11th over: Bangladesh 58-1 (Tamim Iqbal 38, Junaid Siddique 3) Tamim, as his wont, is now settling down to play properly after that blazing start. It&apos;s like a turbo-charged version of the old Steve Waugh tactic; he would calculate the necessary risks to get to 20 at a run a ball, thus spreading the field and reversing the momentum. Then he would book in for bed and breakfast, usually grilled Pom. Siddique, for his part, is in no hurry and eventually gets off the mark with a very pleasant drive down the ground for three off Broad.  12th over: Bangladesh 78-1 (Tamim Iqbal 57, Junaid Siddique 4) This is unreal batting from Tamim! He has just smacked Swann for 4446 from consecutive deliveries, in the process reaching a stunning half-century from only 34 balls. Thirty. Four. Balls. There was a thrash down the ground, a zesty slog-sweep, another clump past the bowler and then a big drive over long-off for six. He went charging down the wicket to the next ball as well, so nearly yorking himself in the process, but the ball squeezed off the inside-edge to safety. Twenty from the over. Sensational stuff.  13th over: Bangladesh 87-1 (Tamim Iqbal 66, Junaid Siddique 4) Finn is on for Broad, who bowled a decent spell of 6-1-21-1. It&apos;s all the same to Tamim, who times a full delivery exquisitely through midwicket for four and then flat-bats him through extra-cover for four. He has 66 from 42 balls. What was that about him knuckling down? This is an outrageous performance, and he is on course to become the first batsman since Majid Khan in 1976-77 to score a century before lunch on day one of a Test match. England are down to one slip already. &quot;I, for one, do not thank you for the Edward Khil link,&quot; trolololos Doug Velardo.  14th over: Bangladesh 95-1 (Tamim Iqbal 74, Junaid Siddique 4) Tamim continues to assault Swann, sweeping him flat and hard for four and then slog-sweeping the next ball high over midwicket for four more. This is simply extraordinary. Swann switches to over the wicket, and Tamim defends. Swann&apos;s four overs have cost 37. Time for drinks. Who needs one? &quot;It has to be said that exposing players like Tamim Iqbal to the Test arena more ethan justifies Bangladesh&apos;s Test status,&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;Would it be wrong to start worrying about the Ashes now. As I&apos;m already a TRAITOR I suppose I can.&quot; I&apos;m surprised you&apos;re not singing Under The Southern Cross I Stand already.  DRINKS Talking of which, good night out was it?  15th over: Bangladesh 108-1 (Tamim Iqbal 74, Junaid Siddique 16) Siddique takes time out from watching Tamim to strike Finn for three boundaries in the over: two pushes through the covers and a nice square-drive. He looks a very good player \u2013 graceful, organised and composed \u2013 but England are ragged. The last four overs have disappeared for 50! &quot;Viv Richards&apos; record is 56 balls, right?&quot; says Chris Wright. &quot;What do you reckon?&quot; That will be beyond him, surely \u2013 he needs 26 from eight deliveries \u2013 but he could definitely get the third-fastest. The top two, Viv and Adam Gilchrist, did theirs while batting for a declaration in the third innings, with all the freedom that suggests. To do this in the first innings, on the first morning, is without precedent and almost beyond comprehension.  16th over: Bangladesh 114-1 (Tamim Iqbal 80, Junaid Siddique 16) That rarest of birds: a boundaryless over. Tamim manufactures three sweeps off Swann, each of which bring two, but that&apos;s all. Yes, that&apos;s all. Just a run a ball. Tamim has 80 from 54 balls. Unreal. &quot;After the first Test the BBC website described Steven Finn as being &apos;fairly nimble in the field for a big man&apos;,&quot; says John Leavey. &quot;We have cricket&apos;s equivalent of Peter Crouch at last!&quot;  17th over: Bangladesh 114-1 (Tamim Iqbal 80, Junaid Siddique 16) James Tredwell draws a straw so short that it barely exists, coming on for his first bowl in Test cricket just as Bangladesh are running riot. It&apos;s a very solid over to Siddique, who is content to take a look at Tredwell and thus plays out a maiden. Well bowled. &quot;Does emailing you now, at 4.21am in a Test against Bangladesh, grant us entry into some sort of exclusive club?&quot; asks Mark Taylor. &quot;(As an aside I&apos;m keeping up my unintentional record of emailing another OBO Test series from a different town/city/county; it&apos;s been fourish years, and at the last count 11 moves, I&apos;m now working as a reporter for the Newbury Weekly News in deepest darkest Berkshire.)&quot; And, in answer to your earlier question, you have just been granted a year&apos;s free entry to the Winners&apos; Enclosure, a place occupied only by the OBO&apos;s finest.  18th over: Bangladesh 115-1 (Tamim Iqbal 81, Junaid Siddique 16) One from Swann&apos;s over. Tamim has calmed down in the last couple ten minutes. I like that, the fact that he is playing each ball on its etcs rather than trying to reach his century as quickly as possible. He still has 81 from 57 balls. &quot;Just wondering, do you like spinach?&quot; says Stuart Wilson. Who are you calling Popeye, eh? Do you want som- oh. &quot;If so you might want to pop to my wife&apos;s spinach-based market stall for your breakfast. You can get spinach muffins, spinach quiche and spinach salads, but sadly not spinach beer. Feel free to advertise to all spinach-loving (Johannesburg-based) OBO readers.&quot;  19th over: Bangladesh 116-1 (Tamim Iqbal 82, Junaid Siddique 16) Tredwell gets his first bowl to Tamim, who is content to push a single to mid-off. Tredwell has started well: 2-1-1-0. &quot;Drifting from horrible drunk to incipient hangover, cricket not helping, please make it better...&quot; says Ed Battison. &quot;Was a good night though, thanks for asking.&quot; I&apos;m impressed that you can remember the word incipient, never mind spell it.  20th over: Bangladesh 117-1 (Tamim Iqbal 83, Junaid Siddique 16) Tamim has definitely dropped a couple of gears. With the field spread he is just helping himself to singles. Siddique is building his innings carefully, so there&apos;s just one from that Swann over. &quot;Bangladesh seem to be taking the piss out of England; isn&apos;t that your job?&quot; says Yemon Choi. &quot;Have to confess that rather than hanging on the OBO to update me with yet another over of disdainful batting, have been rewatching The Fast Show. Which was nice. Oh, and regarding Eduard Khil, see thisvia this.&quot; I&apos;m looking forward to watching those in the lunch break. In fact I&apos;d go so far as to say that I&apos;ve never been as excited about anything, ever.  21st over: Bangladesh 118-1 (Tamim Iqbal 84, Junaid Siddique 16) Tredwell has just a slip and a short-extra for Tamim, who sweeps for a single. England&apos;s think tank \u2013 well, Cook and Prior \u2013 have a quick mid-over chat, after which they bring in a silly point and short leg for Siddique. That&apos;s good to see because Siddique is playing very carefully so there&apos;s no reason not to have them. Good start from Tredwell, just two from three overs. &quot;Tamim Iqbal is employed by the Guardian OBO, and is batting like this so that us Friday drunks will think it&apos;s an ODI and will happily sit and refresh, waiting for the power plays,&quot; says Joe Meredith. &quot;Confirm or deny?&quot; No comment.  22nd over: Bangladesh 119-1 (Tamim Iqbal 85, Junaid Siddique 16) Tamim&apos;s cautiousness can be traced by the drinks break; perhaps a word was passed down from the dressing-room, or perhaps England slipped something special into his water. Obviously that would never happen in cricket, but it&apos;s not exactly unheard of in top-level sport. &quot;This boy Tamim looks a real dasher,&quot; says Anupam Srivastava. &quot;The way he is playing Swaan is unbelievable.&quot; If they don&apos;t kill off Test cricket, he is going to score a helluva lot of runs over the next 15-20 years.  WICKET! Bangladesh 119-2 (Tamim Iqbal c Prior b Tredwell 85) James Tredwell has got his first Test wicket, and it&apos;s the big one. It may also have been a poor decision. Tamim went for the sweep but it went off his forearm and up in the air, and Prior ran to his right to take a good catch diving forward. The key is whether it hit the glove or the edge of the bat before going onto the forearm; I&apos;m not sure it did, but England were very certain. Then again, they usually are. Tamim certainly looked disappointed on the way off, waving his forearm at Rod Tucker. Either way, tat&apos;s the end of a truly wonderful innings from Tamim, 85 from 71 balls on the first morning of a Test. It&apos;s a real shame he didn&apos;t get to a century, especially as he may have got a bad one.  23rd over: Bangladesh 119-2 (Junaid Siddique 16, Jahirul Islam 0) The debutant Jahirul Islam is the new batsman. &quot;Exclusive clubs - pah!&quot; pahs Mark Hiratsuka. &quot;This time last week I was following the fine, fine OBO fun in a Tokyo park, complete with snakes; this session I&apos;m on a bullet train speeding to &apos;Japan&apos;s Briefcase&apos; - the hideous industrial city that is Nagoya. Hangovers 0 - 1 300kph trains...&quot;  WICKET! Bangladesh 122-3 (Jahirul Islam LBW b Swann 0) The debutant goes for a duck. He pushed tentatively round his front pad at an orthodox off spinner and Tony Hill raised the finger. That looked tight on both line and height, and Hawkeye just had it hitting the top of leg. &quot;He has started his Test career with a nought,&quot; says Mike Atherton, before getting a flashback to Trent Bridge 1989 and adding wistfully: &quot;Many have...&quot; That was Benaudesque, and obviously compliments come no higher when it comes to commentary.  25th over: Bangladesh 124-3 (Junaid Siddique 21, Mahmudullah 0) England are back in the game. This is a good thing. The less palatable offshoot is that Matt Prior&apos;s gob is once again open for business. I like Prior a lot, and I know this is his job and he does it well, but he really does talk some bollocks. &quot;It all started when he dug a hole boys,&quot; he says of the largely strokeless Siddique, who works Tredwell&apos;s first loose delivery through midwicket for a couple. &quot;What was the deal with Tim Bresnan sliding on the boundary and showing black underwear?&quot; asks Khademul Islam. &quot;Bob Willis called it a &apos;panto moment&apos; - and &apos;panto&apos; here can be taken in many different ways. We are worried, though, black is no colour to wear on hot days, inside or out - he&apos;s going to itch and scratch in bad places tonight. Ah, mad dogs and Englishmen!&quot;  26th over: Bangladesh 125-3 (Junaid Siddique 21, Mahmudullah 1) I missed an over somewhere. Sorry. Sue me if you want. &quot;Fear and Loathing in the Winner&apos;s Enclosure,&quot; says Mark Taylor. &quot;They are serving Relentless cocktails and Gary Naylor is signing autographs in here, it&apos;s everything I&apos;ve ever dreamed of, before waking up screaming. My half-cut/half-asleep brain has malfunctioned, its actually been six something years - I made the original Is It Cowardly To Pray For Rain book (still dining out on it), and genuinely can&apos;t believe it&apos;s gone by that fast. I don&apos;t even know why I&apos;m telling you this; you do it for so long it just becomes part of you.&quot; Six years since Harmison&apos;s seven for 12. All our yesterdays.  27th over: Bangladesh 129-3 (Junaid Siddique 21, Mahmudullah 5) Mahmudullah pads up to Tredwell, bringing a polite LBW enquiry. The umpire would have been guessing. This hasn&apos;t stopped them in the past, but Rod Tucker rightly says not out. Mahmudullah does it again later in the over, bringing a bigger shout. Still not out, mind. Mahmudullah cuts the next ball for four. &quot;What am I doing?&quot; demands Allan Casey. &quot;I&apos;m hiding from the wife and her friends as they play Bunco. I&apos;d never heard of it until I came to the US but it is very popular. It&apos;s a bit like inviting the WI around for a drink and a bit of a gamble.&quot;  28th over: Bangladesh 133-3 (Junaid Siddique 25, Mahmudullah 5) Siddique cuts Swann nicely for four as the camera cuts to a fat, topless middle-aged bloke with a serious tan. I wonder if he&apos;s English. Yeah, I wonder. &quot;The cynic in me can&apos;t help thinking that Tamim Iqbal&apos;s innings may have been intended, however obliquely, to catch the eye of an IPL franchise,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Not that I blame him.&quot; Harsh, man. If he had that in mind he&apos;d have kept blazing his way towards a century, surely. In many ways, that circumspection was one of the most impressive parts of his innings, because it showed an awareness of the bigger picture and an ability to control himself.  29th over: Bangladesh 134-3 (Junaid Siddique 25, Mahmudullah 6) One from Tredwell&apos;s over. Cook at silly point appeared to have dropped a very sharp chance, high to his left, but it transpired it had only come off Mahmudullah&apos;s pad. Well that&apos;s what the Sky chaps said; I&apos;d like to see it once more to be absolutely sure.  30th over: Bangladesh 135-3 (Junaid Siddique 25, Mahmudullah 7) Mahmudullah is padding up an awful lot, and that brings another LBW enquiry, this time from Swann. Mahmudullah&apos;s judgement of what to leave has been fine so far, but it&apos;s a risky habit to get into.  31st over: Bangladesh 139-3 (Junaid Siddique 25, Mahmudullah 11) A bizarre stroke from Mahmudullah; in the final over before lunch he charges Tredwelkl and heaves him over extra-cover for four. It&apos;s an appropriate end to a blistering morning session, the highlight of which was the birthday boy Tamim Iqbal carving England hither and thither. He made 85 from 71 balls until he got an iffy decision. It was unforgettable stuff. See you in 30 minutes for the afternoon session.  LUNCH  The Lunchtime Play, by Neil Stork-Brett (Names and dates have been omitted to protect the innocent.)The scene: our hero (that&apos;s me) sitting minding his own business at a BBQ/party. Host enters stage right. Host: Can I get you a beer, NSB? Not drinking tonight? Me: No, no. I don&apos;t need to drink if I&apos;m having a good time. Lady at adjoining table: Don&apos;t you mean you don&apos;t need to drink to have a good time? Me: I know what I meant. Hostess enters stage left. Hostess: We&apos;re thinking of playing charades later. While I&apos;m up, can I get anyone a drink? Me: I&apos;ll have ten beers, thanks.  This email, from Edward Genochio, ended up in my spam folder during the last Test. But it&apos;s a nice one so here it is  &quot;I used to bowl non-spinning off-breaks at such a lack of pace that senior batsmen would often keel over and die before the ball actually reached them. (We always appealed, and usually the umpire would give the correct decision: OUT, hit wicket.) A typical over from me would consist of the &apos;offie&apos; - wide outside off stump, usually gathered by second slip flinging himself to his right; the &apos;wrong&apos;un&apos; - fired wide down the leg side, going for anything between one and seven byes, depending on whether the batsmen could be bothered to run (our &apos;keeper refused, on principle, to trot back and collect the ball from where it came to rest half way to the fine leg boundary - and since no-one else would do the job either, I usually had to field off my own bowling. At fine leg.); the &apos;mystery ball&apos; - the one that flew out of the back of my hand, went straight up in the air, and finally lodged firmly in its own divot about halfway down the pitch. (This one once copped the non-striker on the top of the head after he got over-eager in his backing up. That learned him.) At this point the &apos;keeper would clap his hands together, call out &apos;Good variation there fella, keep &apos;em guessing&apos; - which was a coded instruction for me to feign a back spasm and ask someone else to finish the over.   32nd over: Bangladesh 139-3 (Junaid Siddique 25, Mahmudullah 11) Stuart Broad will begin after lunch, around the wicket to Siddique with one slip and everybody on the fence. Sort of. The first ball is full and straight and Siddique gets a very late inside-edge onto the pad just before it rams into off and middle. England have a man at short midwicket and also at, what, short point as part of a tight off-side ring. That&apos;s a maiden. No sign of reverse swing yet. Meanwhile, here&apos;s the beginning and end of a very short series: Great OBOs of the Past.  33rd over: Bangladesh 145-3 (Junaid Siddique 25, Mahmudullah 17) A vote of confidence for Tredwell, who bowled well before lunch and starts after it ahead of Graeme Swann. &quot;You&apos;re beautiful, Jimmy T,&quot; says Matt Prior before, sickeningly, launching into a quick blast of that James Blunt song. That was horrific. Mahmudullah lifts Tredwell&apos;s first ball confidently over the leg side for four, but later in the over he pads up again to bring a biggish LBW appeal. Hawkeye shows it was missing off, so that&apos;s another good decision from Rod Tucker, but Mahmudullah needs to be careful here. He&apos;s already survived four of those \u2013 all correctly, admittedly \u2013 and it&apos;s not unheard of for an umpire to get so bored of a batsman padding up that he eventually triggers him. On the boundary, Collingwood is getting a splint wrapped round a finger on his left hand, presumably the one that was struck when he tried to catch a scorcher from Tamim this morning.  34th over: Bangladesh 157-3 (Junaid Siddique 37, Mahmudullah 17) Siddique gets through the off-side ring this time, driving a slower one from Broad through extra cover for four. Then he times four more through midwicket and finally slaps a full toss to the cover fence. &quot;Carvery bowling,&quot; says Dominic Cork, putting a new spin on the old buffet-bowling cliche. Twelve from the over, and England are going round the park. David Hopps, the Guardian&apos;s man in Dhaka, is too busy to contribute to the OBO as he is furiously following his Facebook group. It&apos;s not an I Heart David Hopps group, although somebody should set that up soon, but a group for those who oppose this utterly preposterous conference system that has been mooted. You know what you need to do. Your county needs you.  35th over: Bangladesh 162-3 (Junaid Siddique 37, Mahmudullah 22) Mahmdullah sweeps Tredwell&apos;s first ball vigorously through midwicket for four. This is terrific stuff from Bangladesh, who are on course for around 280 from their 50 overs. Oh yeah. &quot;This looks like a good idea,&quot; says Simon Ward. &quot;What you need are OBOs of what&apos;s on ESPN Classic at the moment, so I can watch along in a separate browser window.&quot;  36th over: Bangladesh 162-3 (Junaid Siddique 37, Mahmudullah 22) Broad is replaced by Graeme Swann. Mahmudullah ties his shoelace. &quot;You know what happens after the shoelace boys&quot; says Matt Prior. Someone fills your mouth with a gigantic sponge so that you can&apos;t invade my ears for the next hour or so, Matt? Is that the answer? A maiden from Swann.  37th over: Bangladesh 164-3 (Junaid Siddique 39, Mahmudullah 22) England&apos;s best hope of control seems to be with two spinners. And their best chance of wickets: Tredwell beats Siddique with a gorgeous delivery that turns past the edge and only just misses off stump. He has bowled very well, although you suspect many people might struggle to take him a seriously \u2013 probably, a bit like Tim Bresnan, because of the way he looks. We&apos;re a pretty baldist society. JUSTICE FOR THE BALD AND BALDING COMMUNITY. &quot;On the subject of Great OBOs of the Past, can I suggest South Africa v Australia in the semi final of the 2007 World Cup?&quot; says Phil White. &quot;Seems apt after all your talk of Cook going on to make one in the first Test.&quot; Yeah, that one went down well.  WICKET! Bangladesh 167-4 (Siddique LBW b Swann 39) This is a fine piece of bowling. Swann had been working Siddique&apos;s outside edge but then suddenly he beat him on the inside with a bit of drift. Siddique, pushing around his front pad, looked pretty plumb by modern standards.  38th over: Bangladesh 167-4 (Mahmudullah 25, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Swann has turned this round. His first five overs went for 43; since then he has taken two for 15 from nine. Top stuff. Is anyone awake? It would appear to be light outside. Get up!  39th over: Bangladesh 175-4 (Mahmudullah 33, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Mahmudullah continues to play aggressively, cutting Tredwell&apos;s first two deliveries for four. &quot;It is a very baldist world,&quot; laments Phil Withall. &quot;hen my daughter was born all said she looked like me. Once she grew hair she suddenly looked like her mother. And if I have the Mr Potato head/daddy thing one more time...&quot; Bald turd? That&apos;s a hate crime.  40th over: Bangladesh 179-4 (Mahmudullah 33, Shakib Al Hasan 4) Shakib survives a referral for a Wayne Phillips dismissal. He drove Swann onto the toe of Cook at silly point, from where it looped to Matt Prior. It was extremely difficult to tell whether it just bounced before it hit Cook&apos;s toe \u2013 on balance I suspect it did \u2013 and after about 700 replays, the third umpire gave Shakib not out. It&apos;s the right decision, as the evidence was not conclusive.  41st over: Bangladesh 184-4 (Mahmudullah 38, Shakib Al Hasan 4) Mahmudullah cuts Tredwell for four once again. He plays that shot with real authority. As opposed to imaginary authority. &quot;I was chuffed that you printed my message about Great OBOs for a split second,&quot; says Phil White. &quot;I soon realised it came straight after the sentence &apos;JUSTICE FOR THE BALD AND BALDING COMMUNITY&apos;. I am as bald as a cueball. Hope my mate and fellow OBO obsessive James Lace doesnt see this. He will though.&quot; OBO obsessive. He sounds like a winner.  42nd over: Bangladesh 184-4 (Mahmudullah 38, Shakib Al Hasan 4) Cook has persisted with short leg and silly point, which is good to see. Mahmudullah defends a maiden from Swann, who is in a real groove now. As opposed to an imaginary etc. &quot;Song for the overnight England-watcher,&quot; says Yemon Choi. &quot;Especially when the attack has been taken to the cleaners (have memories of listening to the 2006-07 Ashes in a freezing spare room in Newcastle, with only Kerry O&apos;Keeffe&apos;s anecdotes to alleviate the pain of Collingwood&apos;s Adelaide double ton coming to naught). Is it wrong to be mildly fascinated with the spelling of Kerry O&apos;Keeffe&apos;s name? It is wrong, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s really wrong. Deviant even. It&apos;s one step away from [that&apos;ll do - imaginary ed].  43rd over: Bangladesh 192-4 (Mahmudullah 38, Shakib Al Hasan 12) Shakib takes consecutive boundaries off Tredwell with a cut and a sweep. Then he fresh-airs a very ambitious sweep stroke. Bangladesh are still rattling along. Anyway, the last time England picked two genuine offspinners was, I think, the dream team of Emburey and Watkinson against West Indies at Old Trafford in 1995. Emburey and Watkinson! Combined age 75! Winker did really well in that series actually, saving the fifth Test with the bat. I loved that series for all manner of reasons, not least Robin Smith&apos;s performance on an Edgbaston deathtrap.  44th over: Bangladesh 193-4 (Mahmudullah 39, Shakib Al Hasan 12) &quot;Your lunch email from Edward Genochio had my head in a spin,&quot; says Dominic Dirupo. It&apos;s okay: they didn&apos;t really keel over and die. &quot;Edward = Dicky. Genocchio is Knee in Italian. Dicky Knee! Isn&apos;t that what Shane Warne called Makhaya Ntini and got in trouble as it was considered a racial slur as Dicky Knee was a character played by John Blackman? It&apos;s a complete Keyser Soze moment. I feel like asking Carol Vorderman for a big one and four small ones please.&quot; It&apos;s Rachel someone now. And isn&apos;t it six numbers? God I miss the days of sponging off the taxpayer, when the hardest thing I had to do was the Countdown conundrum.  45th over: Bangladesh 193-4 (Mahmudullah 39, Shakib Al Hasan 12) I&apos;m struggling to keep up with the overs, with these two spinners rattling through them. That&apos;s a maiden from Tredwell from Mahmudullah. &quot;At least your Test is more interesting than our Test. Getting pummelled by Australia is very dull,&quot; says Kathy Stodart. &quot;The Merv Hughes interview in the tea-break was very funny though.&quot; Good comeback from Vettori, mind. His improvement as a batsman over the next 13 years has been extraordinary.  46th over: Bangladesh 193-4 (Mahmudullah 39, Shakib Al Hasan 12) A-hem. Thanks to those who pointed out that I inadvertently typed the bad word in the 43rd-over entry, and apologies to those who read it. Worryingly, that is the second time I&apos;ve made that mistake this week. I&apos;m unravelling! I don&apos;t want to know what Freud would make of it, no. Swann bowls the third consecutive maiden. &quot;Tredwell is less a spin bowler and more a slow bowler - flight is his weapon of choice rather than turn,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;In these days of ultra-attacking batsmen, flight is under-rated, as Monty has found out.&quot;  47th over: Bangladesh 194-4 (Mahmudullah 40, Shakib Al Hasan 12) There&apos;s something peculiarly fascinating about watching two English spinners bowl in tandem, such is the infrequency with which it happens. England appeal for LBW against Mahmudullah even though he was hit approximately five miles outside off stump while playing a shot. Shakib then pushes Tredwell between the legs of Cook, who couldn&apos;t his hands down quickly enough. &quot;During the slow overs we guys sitting vodka-soaked and watching the match have bets going who in the England team is the probable MI5 recruiting agent - Tredwell we have decided,&quot; says Khademul Islam. &quot;When he takes off his cap and bowls he looks like an Oxford don tapping Kim Philby on the shoulder: come come boy...&quot;  48th over: Bangladesh 195-4 (Mahmudullah 41, Shakib Al Hasan 12) Just two runs from the last five overs. In other news, the gospel is spreading. &quot;Apologies if this has been sent before,&quot; says Jeremy Stevens, &quot;but this might help get you through those lonely hours..&quot;  49th over: Bangladesh 201-4 (Mahmudullah 44, Shakib Al Hasan 15) Shakib top-edges a sweep but it drops well short of deep backward square. Six singles from the over, and it&apos;s time for some drinks. Coffee, pint thereof. &quot;Apparently in some parts of the Balkans being bald is considered sexy,&quot; says Peter Norton, shattering the illusion that it&apos;s considered sexy by everyone, everywhere, ever. &quot;They refer to it as the third buttock. On the question of cricket, I am beginning to think that BD may post 400 runs on the first day. I spent two years in BD when I was young. Lovely place, even if it does not have the facilities than young English cricketers pine for.&quot; The third buttock. That&apos;s wonderful.  50th over: Bangladesh 205-4 (Mahmudullah 44, Shakib Al Hasan 19) Shakib premeditates a lap at Swann and ends him lifting it into his neck. He tries it later in the over, prompting an LBW appeal from England. It actually went flush off the bat and fine for four. Is there anything England won&apos;t appeal for? It&apos;s pretty undignified and, yes, that kettle is black. Shakib looks very jittery against Swann, who cleaned him up at Chittagong.  51st over: Bangladesh 207-4 (Mahmudullah 46, Shakib Al Hasan 19) Tredwell (17-3-54-1) is replaced by Bresnan (3-0-23-0), who bowled beautifully with the old ball in Chittagong. Mahmudullah pushes a couple into the covers, aided by Pietersen misfield. There was a hint of reverse in that over. No hint of emails, mind. Not that I&apos;m bored, lonely, tired and whiney or owt.  52nd over: Bangladesh 212-4 (Mahmudullah 50, Shakib Al Hasan 20) Shakib sets off for a dodgy single on a Pietersen misfield only to be sent back; he was home by the time Pietersen&apos;s errant throw whistled high over Matt Prior&apos;s head. Then Mahmudullah plays an exquisite cover-drive for four to reach a high-quality half-century. He does look an extremely good player. That was such a beautiful stroke.  53rd over: Bangladesh 212-4 (Mahmudullah 50, Shakib Al Hasan 20) Bresnan and England go up for a big LBW shout against Shakib. I can see only two very, very, very, very minor problems: it definitely him outside the line, and there might have been an inside-edge. Still, this is good stuff from Bresnan, who seems to relish bowling with the old ball. A maiden.  54th over: Bangladesh 214-4 (Mahmudullah 52, Shakib Al Hasan 20) &quot;Seven and eight boys&quot; says Collingwood, who seems to have contracted Prioritis. Swann goes around the wicket to Mahmudullah, who crunches him to short midwicket, where Trott fields well. In praising Trott, Prior calls him &quot;Sloth&quot; three times in quick succession. He did the same a few overs ago. A clear wind-up. I bet Trott really loves that nickname.  55th over: Bangladesh 215-4 (Mahmudullah 52, Shakib Al Hasan 21) Bresnan is desperately trying to make something happen here, but he can&apos;t in that over. So there. &quot;Am getting the Sky commentary out here in Bahrain,&quot; says John Leavey. &quot;They keep referring to Finn as being 6&apos; 7&quot;. I thought that in some Big Paper article recently he fessed up to being 6&apos; 8&quot;. Don&apos;t the Murdochites read the Guardian? Oh.&quot;  56th over: Bangladesh 219-4 (Mahmudullah 52, Shakib Al Hasan 25) &quot;Come on Sloth, half an hour Sloth!&quot; says Prior. Swann drops short and Shakib cuts him for four to bring up a good fifty partnership. The two spinners have dropped short just a touch too often today. &quot;I am currently following OBO while my young daughter watches &apos;the wheels on the bus&apos; , a DVD of quite terrifying tedium,&quot; says Alex Jarman. &quot;Watching cricket from distant parts of the world is THE ONLY THING small children are good for. I&apos;ve been here since 5.45 by the way.&quot;  57th over: Bangladesh 226-4 (Mahmudullah 59, Shakib Al Hasan 25) England pay the price for having only one slip when Mahmudullah, dangling his bat like a femme fatale dangling one of her getaway sticks to lure some patsy into trouble, edges Bresnan through second slip at shin-height and away for four. He&apos;s beaten next up by a fine delivery that swung away just a fraction, and beaten again when he chases a wide one. Finally he pulls over midwicket for three. Bresnan is bowling very well here. I&apos;ve had a \u00a310 bet with Sam Collins, the editor of the Wisden Cricketer site, that Bresnan won&apos;t take 100 Test wickets. I still think I&apos;ll win, but Bresnan has bowled extremely well with the old ball in this series.  WICKET! Bangladesh 226-5 (Mahmudullah c Collingwood b Finn 59) The new bowler Steven Finn strikes with his first ball. Mahmudullah went for a leaden-footed drive outside off and edged it straight to backward point. Simples.  58th over: Bangladesh 226-5 (Shakib Al Hasan 25, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) The new batsman is little Mushfiqur Rahim, one of the stars of the first Test. Finn gets one to pop just enough so that Mushfiqur has to drag his bottom hand off the bat at the point of contact. A wicket maiden.  59th over: Bangladesh 227-5 (Shakib Al Hasan 26, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) Shakib pushes Bresnan for a tight single to mid-off. There are just over 10 minutes to tea.  60th over: Bangladesh 235-5 (Shakib Al Hasan 34, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) Shakib edges Finn low through backward point for four and then times a nice boundary through square-leg.  61at over: Bangladesh 237-5 (Shakib Al Hasan 34, Mushfiqur Rahim 2) Tredwell replaces Bresnan, who bowled a good four-over spell. Mushfiqur, light on his feet, makes room to cut Tredwell for two to get off the mark. Anyone got any tips on how to stop yourself falling sleep when your eyelids get really heavy? It&apos;s for an, a-hem, friend.  62nd over: Bangladesh 250-5 (Shakib Al Hasan 45, Mushfiqur Rahim 2) Shakib drives consecutive Finn deliveries expansively through extra-cover for four. Lovely batting. Meanwhile, David Lloyd is still absent for the commmentary box with Dengue fever. &quot;What was the Coen Brothers film?&quot; says Bob Willis. &quot;No country for old men?&quot; Anyway, that&apos;s tea. See you in 15 minutes.  TEA  WICKET! Bangladesh 254-6 (Shakib LBW b Tredwell 49) Woeful cricket from Shakib Al Hasan in the first over after tea. He survived a massive shout for LBW (inside-edge), struck an unconvincing boundary over mid-off, and then completely missed a sweep at a straight one. He wasn&apos;t plumb, but he was definitely out.  63rd over: Bangladesh 254-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 2, Naeem Islam 0) At the start of that over, with Tredwell preparing to bowl, Prior screamed &quot;C&apos;mon Sloth!&quot; I&apos;m starting to  hope  worry that this is going to end in fisticuffs. &quot;I&apos;ve had a zesty three hours of sleep and I&apos;m plotting pointless Corrigan-style revenge on the neighbours for their witty impressions of English People In London Who Are Fascinated With Their Own Overestimated Importance,&quot; says Alex Netherton. &quot;Best I&apos;ve come up with is sellotaping their doorbell down. A petty triumph. Suggestions please.&quot; What would de Botton do? An evil Alain de Botton?  64th over: Bangladesh 254-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 4, Naeem Islam 0) It&apos;s spin at both ends, with Swann resuming. England just needed one more to get in amongst the tail, although Razzak at No9 isn&apos;t a complete joke. Mushfiqur survives a gentle shout for LBW; he was outside the line. &quot;Wake up!&quot; says Ian Moore. &quot;Hugh Morris on TMS just said that as regards the position of bowling coach candidates have been asked throw their hat into the ring. Seems as good a test as any.&quot;  65th over: Bangladesh 256-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 4, Naeem Islam 2) Naeem pushes Tredwell through the covers to get off the mark. I wonder when England last bowled more than 90 overs in a six-hour day. Barring the apocalypse, it is going to happen here.  66th over: Bangladesh 258-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 5, Naeem Islam 3) &quot;Just wondered if you could be kind enough to follow the lead of the Barmy Army in promoting a Sport Relief tie in, for those who are looking to inspire their kids into sporting activity,&quot; says David Cotton. &quot;Each donation of \u00a312+ via www.justgiving.com/Elite4sportrelief receives a personally signed &apos;thank you&apos; from an Olympic athlete and regular updates on their progress up until 2012.&quot; Which isn&apos;t quite matched by the offer of a poem from Poppy McNee, but you do get one of those if you sponsor her here. And, while we&apos;re here, this is another very worthy cause. I don&apos;t know if you get a poem with this one.  67th over: Bangladesh 259-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 5, Naeem Islam 4) Naeem played a shot a ball in the second innings at Chittagong, but he&apos;s back to the strokeless Naeem we saw in the first innings of the first Test and takes just a single to deep mid-on. &quot;Problem with Bangladesh is that they are unable to keep focus in Test cricket,&quot; says Anupam Srivastava. &quot;They have played superb cricket so far today but we are sure to see another collapse very soon and they will squander another good opportunity!&quot; Siddique and Mushfiqur seem to have really good focus, but it&apos;s definitely a problem for some of the other batsmen.  68th over: Bangladesh 263-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 6, Naeem Islam 6) &quot;Perhaps Bob Willis meant the Coen brothers film the Lloydykillers,&quot; LOLs Chris Purcell, &quot;or maybe The Man Who Wasn&apos;t There, even O Brother Where Art Thou, but probably not A Serious Man.&quot; Barfin Sink? Sorry. That&apos;s pitiful.  69th over: Bangladesh 274-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 17, Naeem Islam 7) Having been very watchful so far, Mushfiqur takes a few steps down the track and drives Tredwell over long-off for six. What a delightful stroke, and what a charming little talent he is. He shows that again later in the over by making room and cutting for four. He was so quick on his feet there. &quot;Rob,&quot; says Ed Battison. &quot;The hangover&apos;s gone from incipient to full-on crashing about and is stopping me sleeping quite effectively, possibly not the right time for you to try and develop one too but you never know...&quot; It&apos;s an option, and I&apos;m all about options.  70th over: Bangladesh 278-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 21, Naeem Islam 7) Broad comes on to replace Graeme Swann. There is a hint of reverse into Mushfiqur, who simply waits for the bad ball and cuts it for four. He is playing beautifully. &quot;Rahim is like a 10-year-old standing in a ring against heavyweights, but he is doing well,&quot; says Anupam Srivastava. &quot;Good for him and Bangladesh.&quot; What he said. On the evidence of this series, Bangladesh have a pretty strong batting line-up: Tamim, Junaid, Mahmudullah, Shakib, Mushfiqur and even Naeem at No8.  71st over: Bangladesh 283-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 25, Naeem Islam 8) Another cracking shot from Mushfiqur, who runs down the track and spanks Tredwell right back over his big bald head for an emphatic two-bounce four. Mushfiqur has his dancing shoes on today; he is bopping all over his crease to the spinners, and it&apos;s great to watch.  72nd over: Bangladesh 283-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 25, Naeem Islam 8) Have a look at Naeem Islam&apos;s Test career. It&apos;s early days, but so far he has had two distinct approaches: block and thwack. Today he is blocking, and he is doing it very well. A maiden from Broad. &quot;Tell your, erm, friend that the very best way to revive those tired optic nerves is to rub the palms of your hands a few times until they are warm, then place for ten seconds over the eyes,&quot; says Geoff Roberts. &quot;Repeat, repeat. This is recommended by Master Wang, a well-known Chinese Chi-Gong expert, so it must work for you. It&apos;s going England&apos;s way, so you can afford to close the eyes for a few minutes can&apos;t you? I expect a brief report in ten minutes.&quot;  I&apos;m  he&apos;s not too bad now. He managed to lose his face in a sinkful of cold water during the tea interval, apparently.  73rd over: Bangladesh 284-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 26, Naeem Islam 8) Mushfiqur drives Tredwell to deep mid-on for a single. I still don&apos;t think he needs to have mid-on deep just yet, but I&apos;m not the England captain, am I. Naeem blocks the rest of the over. He looks an accomplished No8. &quot;So David Lloyd has gone dowm with Dengue fever or &apos;breakbone fever&apos; as it is known colloquially,&quot; says Peter Norton. &quot;Poor bugger if he has. One of my friends had it. It took him ages to recover and he really suffered.&quot;  74th over: Bangladesh 289-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 27, Naeem Islam 8) An errant delivery from Broad goes for four leg-byes via the pad of Mushfiqur. Broad is trying all the variations he used so successfully in the Caribbean last year \u2013 pace, line, length \u2013 but to little avail at the moment. &quot;Was up at 4am, unable to go back to sleep having been traumatised by reading this article about always-injured NBA player Greg Oden&apos;s enormous man item,&quot; says Mac Millings. &quot;Because I don&apos;t have enough reasons for insecurity as it is. Mind you, makes a change from not being able to get back to sleep at 4am because I can&apos;t stop reliving the humiliation of every single thing I&apos;ve ever done.&quot; Millings is married with at least one kid. Maybe two, I forget. He&apos;s a fake loser.  75th over: Bangladesh 292-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 8) Mushfiqur is put down by Prior. He went to glide a quicker ball from Tredwell to third man and got a thick edge, but Prior couldn&apos;t hold on. Those are hard chances, but Prior is livid: after the next ball he kicks the turf in frustration and shouts &quot;Fuck off!&quot;. Think of the children, Matty! &quot;It&apos;s worrying to see the Aussie second-string bowling line up dismissing New Zealand with the ease that England&apos;s second string should be doing with Bangladesh, but then again scrolling down the current Kiwi team sheet there isn&apos;t much quality in the ranks likely to inspire fear or even slight hesitation,&quot; says Tom van der Gucht. &quot;At least Bangladesh have some young spunk are are willing to give it a go, New Zealand look like the team cropped together in the episode of Dad&apos;s Army with Fred Trueman.&quot; England will lose the Ashes 5-0 \u2013 nowt surer \u2013 but I wouldn&apos;t be too harsh on their efforts with the ball in this series. In fact I wouldn&apos;t be harsh at all. I think they&apos;ve generallly bowled well on a couple of soul-crushing surfaces.  76th over: Bangladesh 292-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 8) Broad is replaced by Finn, who bowls an accurate maiden to Mushfiqur. Prior is stomping round emitting all sorts of heat. He&apos;s signalling to the dressing-room to ask how big an edge it was. It was a significant deviation, so I don&apos;t think he should be too hard on himself. &quot;Why has Broad decided to become a medium pacer today?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;After 28 Tests, he should be offering a lot more. If he&apos;s not fit, he shouldn&apos;t be playing.&quot; Has he not just gone into Caribbean mode? I think he&apos;s perfectly fit. (Insert your own joke here.) I just don&apos;t think he thinks hitting the pitch is the way to go in these conditions.  77th over: Bangladesh 292-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 8) Naeem Islam is defending against Tredwell with almost contemptuous ease. He seems happy to let Mushfiqur take care of scoreboard duties, and it&apos;s another maiden. &quot;I know I&apos;m a JCL today, turning up only at tea-time, but I&apos;d like to wish everyone a Happy Equinox nevertheless,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Let&apos;s hope it&apos;s a good one.&quot;  78th over: Bangladesh 293-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 8) Another good over from Finn to Mushfiqur, with just a single off the penultimate ball. &quot;Fake loser?&quot; sniffs Mac Millings. &quot;Couldn&apos;t relay your libel to my wife and (I have done it twice) two kids, because, as well adjusted humans, they are still sleeping soundly. But I know their response, as I&apos;ve heard it before: &apos;No one&apos;s that good an actor.&apos; Little known true story - when the Marylebone Town Hall official asked my wife if she took me to be her husband, she started laughing, and took about a minute to stop. Fortunately, the booze kicked in. PS That&apos;s right, I&apos;m a romantic. We eloped. To Marylebone Town Hall.&quot; Welcome to the Winners&apos; Enclosure, Millings. Come sit at the top table.  79th over: Bangladesh 293-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 8) A maiden from Tredwell, and it&apos;s nearly time for the new ball. &quot;Just playing OBO catch-up, and I checked out the link to the fastest Test centuries (over 15),&quot; says Ed Wilson. &quot;At the bottom of the Cricinfo page is the astonishing information that &apos;NJ Astle&apos;s second hundred in his 222 v England at Christchurch in 2001/02 took 39 balls&apos;. Tell me more! Is that quicker than Afridi&apos;s ODI tonk-fest?&quot; That&apos;s definitely the barmiest passage of play I&apos;ve ever seen in a Test (well, read about, having gone to bed in the early hours of Saturday morning presuming an England victory by around 200 runs). Booth was there, the lucky bugger. You can read all about it here and see it here.  80th over: Bangladesh 301-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 16) Paul Collingwood is going to bowl the last over before the second new ball, his first of the series. Naeem, pushing forward, snicks to the left of the only slip (Swann, who is at around third slip) and away for four. Then he drives pleasantly for four more to take us up to the drinks break. &quot;I think it&apos;s unfair to call Millings a fake loser,&quot; says Alex Netherton. &quot;He&apos;s a real loser. He&apos;s upped the stakes to a point where he&apos;s got something to lose. He&apos;s upped his potential (inevitable) fall from grace, what have you done?&quot;  81st over: Bangladesh 301-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 16) England take the new ball at the first opportunity and, for the sixth time in the series, give it to the wrong man: Bresnan rather than Finn. Mushfiqur thinks about chasing a wide one but then withdraws. That aside he defends carefully. It&apos;s a maiden. &quot;A little known fact about Mr Millings is that he recently gave up his British citizenship to become an American,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;I&apos;m not having turncoats in the Winners&apos; Enclosure.&quot;  82nd over: Bangladesh 301-6 (Mushfiqur Rahim 30, Naeem Islam 16) Bob Willis is showing the old ball to the camera; it&apos;s a rare old piece of filth, seriously tattered. &quot;A shocking mess&quot; says Bob. Naeem Islam goes chasing the new ball when Broad slips one wide, but his bat meets only the still Dhaka air. Later in the over, Naeem tries to leave but, in doing so, gets a slight deflection off the face of the bat and just wide of off stump. A very good maiden from Broad. This is a vital little spell. If these two get through to the close, Bangladesh could easily reach 400 tomorrow. Collingwood, meanwhile, is limping. &quot;Thank you Alex Netherton,&quot; says Tom van der Gucht, using a phrase never previously heard on this earth. &quot;Up until this moment in my life I was happy drifting under the delusion that I was an amiable loser; now I realise that to be a loser you have to achieve something that you then lose, I have subsequently had to reclassify myself as a failure, and an unhappy one at that.&quot;  WICKET! Bangladesh 301-7 (Mushfiqur Rahim c Prior b Bresnan 30) I take it all back. Bresnan has just produced a real snorter to get rid of the dangerous Mushfiqur Rahim, a sharp lifter on off stump that took the edge on its way through to Prior. Not bad for a stout lad. He bowls some jaffas, does Bresnan.  83rd over: Bangladesh 301-7 (Naeem Islam 16, Abdur Razzak 0) &quot;Actually, O&apos;Hagan, I&apos;m a dual citizen,&quot; says Millings, &quot;and, therefore, as both a Limey and a Yank, a dual loser.&quot; The best thing is that he sent the email and then updated it, with the subject line Turncoat 2.0. Yes, I think we&apos;ve found one here.  84th over: Bangladesh 309-7 (Naeem Islam 24, Abdur Razzak 0) Naeem, walking into a full, straight delivery from Broad, is lucky to inside-edge it to fine leg for four. He gets four in more authentic fashion two balls later by virtue of a withering cover-drive. &quot;Happy equinox day!&quot; says Miriam Kimber. &quot;Apart from the equinox, can you think of any other things where the entire world is sharing the same experience?&quot;  85th over: Bangladesh 309-7 (Naeem Islam 24, Abdur Razzak 0) Bresnan slips a good one across the left-handed Razzak, the highlight of his third consecutive maiden with the new ball. GIVE IT TO FINN. &quot;Mr Millings obviously forgot the bit in the American oath (that&apos;s &apos;American oath&apos;, rather than &apos;American oaf&apos;, which would be an oxymoron) where you renounce all other citizenships,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;Sorry, Mac, but you now have to stop spelling properly and grow a backside the size of Connecticut.&quot; That or being English? I think I know who&apos;s winning.  86th over: Bangladesh 311-7 (Naeem Islam 26, Abdur Razzak 0) Naeem has an endearingly simple approach to batting. When he is playing with any of the top seven, he blocks; when he isn&apos;t, he looks to attack. He would have got four for a square-drive in that Broad over but for a fine stop from Collingwood. Meanwhile, they are testing the fire alarm in Guardian Towers. Thanks for that! &quot;I&apos;m watching via a dodgy Indian stream, which cuts to an advert for Vodafone about six times an over,&quot; says James Walsh. &quot;It features a ghost magician putting a man in a box, which is then carried off by a cheery orchestra of other ghosts. This takes place in a big top populated by big headed aliens.&quot; Spike Jonze gets everywhere.  87th over: Bangladesh 314-7 (Naeem Islam 26, Abdur Razzak 3) &quot;There&apos;s a competition at the end of this year,&quot; says Steve Churnin. &quot;How would we feel about England going in looking like this: Strauss, Kieswetter, Cook, KP, Colly, Bell, Bresnan, Swann, Broad, Anderson, Finn. I realise that involves Bresnan (a) being in the team and (b) batting at No7, but with Swann/Broad at 8 and 9 I reckon the tail should be long enough. And Bresnan doesn\u00b4t seem to get really smashed about. Could do the job as fourth seamer. Could he?&quot; Yes, but four seamers won&apos;t be an option because four bowlers is the lesser of two evils. There is more chance of Mac Millings making eye contact with a stranger than there is of England going into the Ashes with five frontline bowlers. Plus there&apos;s no reason to even consider dropping Prior, who averages nearly 40. I&apos;d like to try Cook at No3 with a right-handed dasher but it won&apos;t happen. I would say Strauss, Cook, KP, Collingwood, Bell, Prior, Swann, Anderson and Broad are as certain to play as certain can be eight months before the actual event. The only two positions that are open are those of No3 and third seamer.  WICKET! Bangladesh 314-8 (Razzak LBW b Swann 3) Graeme Swann strikes with the first ball of a new spell. It was a hopeless mow across the line from Razzak, who missed a ball that would have hit the outside half of leg stump. Diabolical batting. Swann could sneak another five-for here.  88th over: Bangladesh 318-8 (Naeem Islam 27, Shafiul Islam 2) Shafiul, missing a big drive, survives a referral for a stumping. His back foot did slip out of the crease but he dragged it back just in time. It was desperately tight, but could not have been given with a clear conscience. &quot;Does Richard O&apos;Hagan (85th over) mean a &apos;tautology&apos; rather than an &apos;oxymoron&apos;?&quot; says Sam Collier. &quot;Shall I shut up?&quot;  89th over: Bangladesh 321-8 (Naeem Islam 28, Shafiul Islam 4) A quiet over from Bresnan. We will get more than 90 overs today, as there are still 13 minutes to go. What time do public houses open on a Saturday? As a member of the public, one might choose to house oneself. &quot;My my, Nathan Astle could swing a bat,&quot; says Ed Wilson. &quot;Andy Caddick must have aged ten years in that clip. Innings like that make me question the logic of Twenty20 cricket. Test cricket can still throw up astonishing bouts of slogging, but doesn&apos;t demand them. And when they do come along, it makes the enjoyment more intense. A bit like the difference between watching avant-garde french cinema and actual porn. I might go and catch the last few overs at the gym. Which means I&apos;ll arrive there just as the last wicket falls...&quot; Amen to that. The Test cricket/Twenty20 bit, not the gym filth.  90th over: Bangladesh 322-8 (Naeem Islam 29, Shafiul Islam 4) England offer Naeem Islam an easy single so that they can get Shafiul on strike. Naeem declines until the penultimate delivery of Swann&apos;s over, which he pushes to long-on. &quot;A sunny springtime day in Salzburg, and my son&apos;s 11th birthday,&quot; says Tim Hughes. &quot;But my wife has a stinking hangover and is back in bed, leaving me to make the boy&apos;s birthday cake...chiz. My son is called Stanley (the only Stanley in Austria) and it would really make his day if you could say happy birthday to him on OBO. And can you sing &apos;Nellie the Elephant&apos; for him?&quot; Let&apos;s know our (well, my) limits, eh? Happy birthday Stanley!  91st over: Bangladesh 324-8 (Naeem Islam 31, Shafiul Islam 4) Tredwell replaces Bresnan. He should have time for a couple of overs before the close. Nothing happens in that one, save a decent cut for two by the impressive Naeem Islam. But he keeps Naeem on strike, so Swann will have a go at Shafiul. &quot;Phil Brown&apos;s Ashes XI,&quot; says Alex Netherton. &quot;Phil Brown (c), Maxi Jazz, Mandela, Geovanni, Daley Thompson, Geovanni (wk), Geovanni, Botham, Garth Crooks, Geovanni, Geovanni.&quot; No Iain Dowie, Phil? &quot;Iain Dowie&apos;s medium-pace legcutters are little slugs.&quot;  92nd over: Bangladesh 328-8 (Naeem Islam 31, Shafiul Islam 8) That&apos;s an interesting stroke from the No10 Shafiul Islam, who slaps Swann through the covers for four with a nice easy swing of the bat. &quot;Yes, I realise the dropping Prior idea seems a little strange,&quot; says Steve Churnin. &quot;But - good as his wicketkeeping is now, and good as his average is - I like the look of Kieswetter, and if he&apos;s in the team for batting, it could open up another spot for a batsman or fifth bowler (esp important since there are presumably a couple of back-to-back Tests). Plus Prior is getting swearier by the minute, so dropping him might save Athers\u00b4 blushes. Plus he\u00b4s really, really unfunny behind the stumps.&quot; I like the idea of five bowlers, and you might just be able to get away with it if your lower order includes Broad, Swann and Bresnan, but in practice it just won&apos;t happen.  93rd over: Bangladesh 329-8 (Naeem Islam 32, Shafiul Islam 8) The penultimate over of the day, from Tredwell, brings just a single to Naeem Islam.  94th over: Bangladesh 330-8 (Naeem Islam 33, Shafiul Islam 8) That&apos;s stumps. IPL? Not today thanks! That was a fabulous day&apos;s play, full of the ebb and flow and subtlety that only Test cricket provides. Tamim Iqbal, on his 21st birthday, smashed a stunning 71-ball 85 before copping a bad decision, while England&apos;s five-man attack all chipped in on another desperately flat track. England are on top, but not by that much. Thanks for your emails; I&apos;ll be back at 3am tomorrow morning.

But its punctuality, speed, cleanliness and staff friendliness (and I write as one who suffers the torture of First Capital Connect) were not the most impressive thing about Japan. A rather more humble piece of technology says a lot more about what they get right, and what we get wrong. It&apos;s the vending machine. Every 50 metres or so down a Japanese street, you&apos;ll find a row of vending machines. Japan has more of them per head than any other country, selling the usual drinks and snacks \u2013 although some specialist &quot;vendos&quot; offer fried squid, lobster, iPods and even, it&apos;s said, used women&apos;s knickers. But it&apos;s not their number, or the fact that they always work. Everything works in Japan. It&apos;s the fact that they are there at all. How long would a street vending machine last in Britain before it is broken into and smashed up? I&apos;d give it a couple of weeks. Then there are other things. No potholes. No graffiti. No litter \u2013 and hardly any street bins. People just choose not to throw rubbish on the ground. The Japanese urban environment is easier and safer than any I&apos;ve ever visited. So Japan&apos;s a regimented country, with a cowed people fearful of breaking rules? Hardly. I&apos;ve never seen so many people laughing, smiling and relaxed. Japan is the most equal society on earth. The top 10% of earners have 4.5 times the income of the bottom 10%. In Britain the top 10% grab 13.8 times the share taken by the lowest 10%. I suppose I was experiencing a street-level view of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett&apos;s superb book The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better. Yet in a week spent visiting companies, speaking to economists and interrogating investment analysts, I think I was supposed to reach a rather different conclusion. The Anglo-American school of capitalism scoffs at Japan. It&apos;s a bubble economy that burst and which, two decades later, still can&apos;t revive. Companies won&apos;t shed labour or cut costs. Runaway public spending floods into pork-barrel construction projects creating a fiscal deficit that makes even Greece look prudent. The country is, they say, quite literally on a road (and a bridge, and a tunnel) to nowhere. Meanwhile in the west \u2013 but especially in the US \u2013 dynamic capitalism destroys but then renews. If your head never left the pages of right-wing economic textbooks (and you swallow the guff that manufacturing doesn&apos;t matter any more) you might believe all this. Indeed, World Bank figures show that back in 1995, Japan&apos;s nominal GDP was $5.3tn (\u00a33.5tn), or not that far short of the US&apos;s $7.3tn. Since then, Japan&apos;s nominal GDP has actually fallen to $5.1tn, while the US is now at $14.3tn. The economic evidence is clear: Japan is a basket case, and the US is our only model. Yet there are no Detroits in this supposedly failing economy. Instead you realise the price we pay for winner-takes-all capitalism. Arriving back in Britain, I came through BAA&apos;s gruesome Heathrow terminal three (thank you, the money makers behind its debt-laden takeover). In the underground, I shoved coins into the ticket vending machine. Of course it was broken. The District, Circle and Jubilee lines were all out of action (thank you, public/private partnership). At Victoria, I boarded a depressingly dirty train (thank you, train-leasing financiers). Japan has its problems, not least its 200%-plus public sector debt. But it has a lot to teach us about social cohesion, while still producing world-class companies \u2013 and bosses who take pay cuts rather than make redundancies. \u2022 Patrick Collinson was a guest of Neptune Investment Management in Japan. p.collinson@guardian.co.uk "}, {"sentences": ["So why has he brought a group of financial journalists to Tokyo?", "JO Hambro&apos;s Scott McGlashan, who has one of the longest records of investing in Japan, believes 2010 will be a strong year for the Tokyo stock market.", "There have been short-term blips but it has been a depressing long-term experience.&quot; However it now believes Tokyo &quot;may finally offer good opportunities, provided investors pick carefully&quot;."], "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Money", "Investing", "Business", "Stock markets"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-20T00:05:30Z", "title": "Will Japan's investment funds blossom again?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/mar/20/japan-investment-funds-stock-market", "article": "Chris Taylor constantly wrestles with the paradoxes of investing in Japan. He runs Neptune Japan Opportunities, the best-performing fund for Brits wanting to invest in the country, but almost revels in telling you what a basket case Japan has become. The economy is &quot;ugly beyond belief&quot; and the country has &quot;bucket loads of problems&quot;, he warns. Neptune&apos;s economist, James Dowey, chips in with dismal figures on Japan&apos;s GDP. It&apos;s \u00a5500tn (\u00a33.7tn), but was at the same nominal level more than a decade ago. This is a country that is flatlining. How do corporates react in such an unfavourable environment? The answer is to cut investment, capital expenditure and wages. And in aggregate, it means no one increases their bottom line. Companies can&apos;t raise profitability and face a vicious downward spiral. So why has he brought a group of financial journalists to Tokyo? To write that investors should dump his fund? This has got to be the oddest press trip on record \u2026 But Taylor hasn&apos;t lost his marbles. He doesn&apos;t buy Japan. What he buys is Japanese companies. In sector after sector, he says he can find three or four companies that are world class and which are often the dominant global player in their market. He takes us to Toray Industries. In the 1950s it was competing against Britain&apos;s Courtaulds in the rayon market. Soon, Toray was facing the same sort of price competition that drove Courtaulds from the market. But instead of rolling over it invested in research and development, seeking new markets for materials. Now it&apos;s the world leader in carbon-fibre technology with global sales of some $12bn (\u00a37.9bn).     japan funds table    Half its manufacturing plants are in Japan, and inevitably the business took a hammering when demand imploded as the global recession began to bite. Its response says a lot about Japanese capitalism. Senior vice-president Norihiko Saitou tells us it embarked on cost-cutting which included 30% pay cuts for board members, the axing of bonuses for managers and the end of overtime. But redundancies were out of the question. &quot;It is a very important company policy not to lay off people,&quot; he tells us, through an interpreter. It has a 30-year plan for carbon fibres, a lightweight material that is replacing steel in aeroplanes and cars, and so substantially reduces weight and energy use. Boeing has signed it up to supply materials for its Dreamliner.It&apos;s this approach which may explain why Toray is a world leader and Courtaulds a shadow of its former self. And Toray&apos;s share price is around \u00a5505, up 43% from \u00a5353 last March. Taylor reckons scores of Japanese companies such as Toray are ideally placed to benefit from not just the recovery in world trade but the coming boom. Global GDP was $55tn in 2007. He believes it will be $80tn by 2015, but most of that growth will be in non-OECD countries. &quot;The Chinese haven&apos;t even begun to gear up,&quot; he says. Japan is the biggest investor in China, directly and through companies the Japanese control in Taiwan. Taylor&apos;s strategy is to buy Japanese multinationals, avoid stocks exposed to the moribund domestic economy and hedge the currency. He is a big fan of hedging and warns of the value traps that so often ensnare investors in Japan. His analysis of global debt took him out of banks and real estate in 2007. He&apos;s back in financials and multinationals now but is fully hedged in the belief that the yen will fall. He finds the domestic economic situation in Japan almost comically bad, with a paralysed and corrupted political class unable to cope with the daunting challenges of a rapidly ageing population and colossal fiscal deficit. Shigeki Morinobu, president of the Japan Tax Institute, shows us a graph that makes Alistair Darling&apos;s budget challenge look like child&apos;s play. Government spending this year will be around \u00a5100tn, tax receipts around \u00a537tn. Japan is hooked on government spending so far in excess of what it raises in taxes that it just can&apos;t find a way out. Much of that money goes on pensions and healthcare for the elderly, where the bill just keeps rising. Government debt has topped 200% of GDP, and financing it from famously thrifty Japanese households can&apos;t go on much longer. The savings ratio has plummeted from 20% of national income two decades ago to 2% today. Crunch time for Japan could come in the 2011 budget. Government spending, which has propped up the economy since the bubble burst in the early 1990s, must fall. Taxes may have to rise. Either way, it makes the prospect for the domestic economy grim.

Tron, Tue to 27 Mar Lyn Gardner Taking Steps, London     Taking Steps.    Here&apos;s another small theatrical coup at the Orange Tree. Not only is it staging Alan Ayckbourn&apos;s Taking Steps for the first time in London since its 1980 premiere, it also has the man himself in the directing chair at the Richmond theatre for the very first time. Ayckbourn has written an incredible 74 plays in his illustrious career. While he has slowed up in recent years (only by his own prolific standards), My Wonderful Day played on Broadway last year and is just finishing a tour of the UK, and his latest creation, Life Of Riley, is due to be finished this year. Taking Steps is set across the three floors of a rundown house, a supposedly haunted former brothel, and chronicles the farcical lives of its resident eccentric renters and owners \u2013 a dodgy builder, a hard-drinking tycoon, a bed-hopping lawyer among them \u2013 following them over the space of 24 hours. Orange Tree, TW9, Wed to 29 May Mark Cook Juliet And Her Romeo, Bristol     Juliet And Her Romeo.    Theatre is so often about the new: young playwrights, companies and actors. So it&apos;s good to see older people in a reworking of Shakespeare&apos;s play that casts the lovers in their 80s. Particularly when it features a brilliant cast of veteran actors including Tim Barlow and Michael Medwin, led by Si\u00e2n Phillips and Michael Byrne. Directed by Tom Morris, who was involved with Jerry Springer: The Opera, this production, in which the lovers&apos; anxious children try to prevent the match, could be an unlikely hit too. Old Vic, to 24 Apr Lyn Gardner Arthur And George, Birmingham     Arthur & George.    In 1906, a Birmingham solicitor, George Edalji, was released from prison still protesting his innocence after being convicted for sending anonymous letters and mutilating livestock. Desperate to prove that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice, he turned to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes. David Edgar adapts Julian Barnes&apos;s semi-fictional take on the tale, creating an enjoyable mystery which also explores Englishness, racism and intolerance.

Now, the writer is getting a sort of greatest hits retrospective at the Menier Chocolate Factory with his two most successful plays \u2013 not least because they became highly popular films \u2013 Educating Rita and Shirley Valentine. The part of Rita (Julie Walters was the Liverpool hairdresser attempting an OU English in the 1983 movie) is taken by Laura Dos Santos, who played the role on Radio 4 last Christmas opposite Bill Nighy. Her tutor on this occasion will be Larry Lamb, recently deceased of the Walford parish as Archie in EastEnders. In Shirley Valentine, Meera Syal is the eponymous frustrated middle-aged housewife who finds love on a Greek island, a part memorably played on both the stage and screen by Pauline Collins.

Photograph: Adam Levy    Philip Ridley is no stranger to controversy with plays such as the brilliant Mercury Fur, so you might think that the professional premiere of a play written to be performed by school groups as part of the National Theatre&apos;s Connections season would hardly be news. But it&apos;s the timing that&apos;s important: Ridley&apos;s play \u2013 set in an abandoned Bethnal Green council flat \u2013 sees a trio of homophobic and racist thugs finding a mixed-race teenager who has taken up residence, and it&apos;s touring BNP-targeted areas as the election campaign hots up. The production has attracted the BNP&apos;s attention online, and it now plays Birmingham, Doncaster and Dudley before returning for London runs in Hammersmith and Greenwich. The Drum, Thu &amp; Fri Lyn Gardner The Mermaid Princess, Leicester     The Mermaid Princess.    Back in the UK after last year&apos;s tour of The Snow Queen, Italian company Teatro Kismet should bring its own very distinctive visual approach to Hans Christian Andersen&apos;s famous tale about the little mermaid who falls for a human prince and sacrifices her tail, her voice and her life for love. Like Andersen&apos;s The Red Shoes, it is a story in which a young woman is punished for desire, but this fine company often puts an intriguing spin on its fairytale storytelling, producing shows that are both visually ravishing, unexpectedly sensual and interestingly subversive. This production was created for Tokyo&apos;s famous Setagaya Public Theatre and should showcase the company&apos;s knack for simple inventiveness. The shows are also often multilayered and multifaceted, making them as much a treat for adults as they are for children; an excellent choice for a family theatre outing, then.

Laurie Lee&apos;s memoir of growing up in the Slad Valley in Gloucestershire during the first world war is written in prose like liquid honey and conjures a world where it&apos;s always summer. Translating that to the stage without slipping into nostalgia will be tricky, but this production \u2013 which includes live music and songs and an ensemble of six \u2013 offers a way of reproducing everyday hustle and bustle with vividness rather than haziness.

The phenomenon of the so-called &quot;endless city&quot; could be one of the most significant developments - and problems - in the way people live and economies grow in the next 50 years, says UN-Habitat, the agency for human settlements, which identifies the trend of developing mega-regions in its biannual State of World Cities report. The largest of these, says the report - launched today at the World Urban Forum in Rio de Janeiro - is the Hong Kong-Shenhzen-Guangzhou region in China, home to about 120 million people. Other mega-regions have formed in Japan and Brazil and are developing in India, west Africa and elsewhere. The trend helped the world pass a tipping point in the last year, with more than half the world&apos;s people now living in cities. The UN said that urbanisation is now &quot;unstoppable&quot;. Anna Tibaijuka, outgoing director of UN-Habitat, said: &quot;Just over half the world now lives in cities but by 2050, over 70% of the world will be urban dwellers. By then, only 14% of people in rich countries will live outside cities, and 33% in poor countries.&quot; The development of mega-regions is regarded as generally positive, said the report&apos;s co-author Eduardo Lopez Moreno: &quot;They [mega-regions], rather than countries, are now driving wealth.&quot; &quot;Research shows that the world&apos;s largest 40 mega-regions cover only a tiny fraction of the habitable surface of our planet and are home to fewer than 18% of the world&apos;s population [but] account for 66% of all economic activity and about 85% of technological and scientific innovation,&quot; said Moreno. &quot;The top 25 cities in the world account for more than half of the world&apos;s wealth,&quot; he added. &quot;And the five largest cities in India and China now account for 50% of those countries&apos; wealth.&quot; The migration to cities, while making economic sense, is affecting the rural economy too: &quot;Most of the wealth in rural areas already comes from people in urban areas sending money back,&quot; Moreno said. The growth of mega-regions and cities is also leading to unprecedented urban sprawl, new slums, unbalanced development and income inequalities as more and more people move to satellite or dormitory cities. &quot;Cities like Los Angeles grew 45% in numbers between 1975-1990, but tripled their surface area in the same time. This sprawl is now increasingly happening in developing countries as real estate developers promote the image of a &apos;world-class lifestyle&apos; outside the traditional city,&quot; say the authors. Urban sprawl, they say, is the symptom of a divided, dysfunctional city. &quot;It is not only wasteful, it adds to transport costs, increases energy consumption, requires more resources, and causes the loss of prime farmland.&quot; &quot;The more unequal that cities become, the higher the risk that economic disparities will result in social and political tension. The likelihood of urban unrest in unequal cities is high. The cities that are prospering the most are generally those that are reducing inequalities,&quot; said Moreno. In a sample survey of world cities, the UN found the most unequal were in South Africa. Johannesburg was the least equal in the world, only marginally ahead of East London, Bloemfontein, and Pretoria. Latin American, Asian and African cities were generally more equal, but mainly because they were uniformly poor, with a high level of slums and little sanitation. Some of the most the most egalitarian cities were found to be Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh. The US emerged as one of the most unequal societies with cities like New York, Chicago and Washington less equal than places like Brazzaville in Congo-Brazzaville, Managua in Nicaragua and Davao City in the Phillippines. &quot;The marginalisation and segregation of specific groups [in the US] creates a city within a city. The richest 1% of households now earns more than 72 times the average income of the poorest 20% of the population. In the &apos;other America&apos;, poor black families are clustered in ghettoes lacking access to quality education, secure tenure, lucrative work and political power,&quot; says the report. The never-ending city Cities are pushing beyond their limits and are merging into new massive conurbations known as mega-regions, which are linked both physically and economically. Their expansion drives economic growth but also leads to urban sprawl, rising inequalities and urban unrest. The biggest mega-regions, which are at the forefront of the rapid urbanisation sweeping the world, are: \u2022 Hong Kong-Shenhzen-Guangzhou, China, home to about 120 million people; \u2022 Nagoya-Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe, Japan, expected to grow to 60 million people by 2015; \u2022 Rio de Janeiro-S\u00e3o Paulo region with 43 million people in Brazil.

His first features as director, made in wartime, had nationalistic strains but No Regrets for Our Youth (1946) and Drunken Angel, about an alcoholic Tokyo doctor trying to get a stagnant pool drained, established a critical engagement with contemporary Japan. 2) Stray Dog (1949)            Drunken Angel inaugurated Kurosawa&apos;s working relationship with the actor Toshiro Mifune, which was repeated in this picture, with Mifune playing a policeman on an increasingly obsessive quest to retrieve his stolen gun. Set during a sweltering summer, Kurosawa&apos;s breakthrough film confirmed both his feel for contemporary Tokyo and his admiration of American genre pictures. 3) Rash\u00f4mon (1950)            Recognised at Venice and the Oscars, Rashomon was not just Kurosawa&apos;s international breakthrough but the standard-bearer for new Japanese cinema. Recounting a bandit&apos;s (Mifune) ambush of a couple in a forest from several contradictory perspectives, its radical challenge to conventional narrative was complemented by beautiful, often stylised photography. 4) The Idiot (1951)            Slashed - to Kurosawa&apos;s enduring indignation - from its original lengthof more than four hours, The Idiot was an early example of the director&apos;s adaptation of European literary sources to a Japanese context. Dostoyevsky&apos;s novel is relocated to Hokkaido, with Masayuki Mori as a recently released war criminal and Mifune his temperamental friend. 5) Ikiru (1952)             Centred on the final phase of a middle-aged salaryman&apos;s life, Ikiru show Kurosawa in full-blooded humanist mode. Takashi Shimura is the bureaucrat whose diagnosis of terminal cancer initially sends him into alienated despair before he finds a kind of redemption in a project the hero of Drunken Angel might have appreciated. 6) Seven Samurai (1954)             Seven Samurai, about a band of masterless samurai defending a village from bandits, arguably remains Kurosawa&apos;s towering cultural achievement. The biggest movie Japan had seen at the time, in terms of budget, production and box-office takings, it was also an enormous influence on Western cinema, as well as enormously influenced by it. 7) Throne of Blood (1957)            Transferring Macbeth to medieval Japan reaps dividends: this is one of the most impressive of all screen adaptations of Shakespeare, streamlining the narrative and expressing it through a series of bravura visual coups. Mifune is the ambitious samurai at the centre of a stark world laced with violence, beauty and irony. 8) The Hidden Fortress (1958)            Another period samurai adventure starring Mifune, The Hidden Fortress was another Kurosawa masterclass in the conflation of Japanese andHollywood tropes. The filmmaker&apos;s first widescreen effort, its story of a ragtag band trying to transport a princess to safety and eventually help her free her land is the acknowledged source for George Lucas&apos;s Star Wars. 9) Yojimbo (1961)            Similarly, Yojimbo drew on film noir and classical Westerns only toprove massively influential itself, with Sergio Leone taking inspiration from its tale of an effectively nameless lone warrior playing one side of criminals off against another. A funnier, more grotesque sequel, Sanjuro, followed the next year. 10) Ran (1985)            The final decades of Kurosawa&apos;s life saw his greatest struggles for artistic freedom, prompting him to look beyond Japan for funding. Shot in colour and influenced by King Lear, Ran, his final grand-scale project, was not without professional and personal cost but confirmed his abilities remained intact. 11) (and one for luck \u2026) Dreams (1990)            One of three more films that followed before his death in 1998, Dreams was an elliptical collection of tales based upon Kurosawa&apos;s actual dreams.

The handheld console is expected to arrive before the end of the fiscal year in March 2011. A Christmas 2010 release is likely, at least in Japan, putting it into direct competition with the launch of Sony&apos;s PlayStation Move and Microsoft&apos;s Natal devices. Backwards compatibility fans will be pleased to note that it will run all previous DS releases. The company has not revealed which specific 3D technology it will be utilising, though apparently special glasses will not be required to appreciate the effect. A mobile phone with a 3D display designed by telecoms technology company KDDI, was released by Hitachi last year \u2013 the device uses twin LCDs to give the impression of a three-dimensional display. Although Nintendo president Satoru Iwata has consistently played down suggestions that the iPhone and other powerful smartphone devices represent a threat to the dedicated handheld games console, this is clearly an attempt to further distinguish the DS brand from non-dedicated gaming platforms. And with the current worldwide interest in 3D technology, thanks to the enormous success of Avatar and the launch of several 3D-capable TV sets, this puts Nintendo right at the top of the technological agenda once again. The venture is not without risks. The company has only just launched the Nintendo DSi XL, an enlarged version of its standard handheld \u2013 its fanbase may well balk at the announcement of yet another update. And this won&apos;t be the company&apos;s first foray into alternative display technologies \u2013 released in 1995, the Nintendo Virtual Boy sought to provide a virtual reality-style 3D experience using an immersive headset device that projected basic red and black visuals. Over-priced and tending to induce migraines in users, it was a massive flop. However, time and technology have moved on and gamers will no doubt relish the opportunity to experience classic DS brands like Zelda, Mario &amp; Luigi and Mario Kart in multicolour 3D \u2013 especially as this is likely to be the cheapest way to experience the technology at home.

I&apos;ve also watched or rewatched a lot of anime, in which girls pilot giant robots, hunt down vampires or learn ninja skills. I think you can see what I&apos;m\u00a0getting at here. For years I avoided anime because I was put off by the big saucer eyes. Then it dawned on me the faces and figures were no more stylised than in the prints of, say, Utamaro or Hokusai. It&apos;s just a way of looking at the world. The film that truly converted me, however, was Hayao Miyazaki&apos;s Spirited Away, in which a 10-year-old girl has the oddest, most captivating adventure since Alice in Wonderland. In the films of Studio Ghibli (co-headed by Miyazaki), girls and women aren&apos;t also-rans, as they are in 99% of Hollywood output; they fly gliders, run with wolves or design seaplanes. Even ordinary schoolgirls lead lives of quiet enchantment, like 14-year-old Shizuku in Whisper of the Heart, who discovers first love and a talent for storytelling in a Tokyo setting that is simultaneously realistic and magical. Where were these heroines when I was growing up? I had to make do with Lady Penelope. Beyond Ghibli, even male-centric anime, such as the ninjas-in-training Naruto, feature gutsy girls like pink-haired Sakura, who starts off drippy but toughens up as the series goes on. &quot;Girls need to be strong to survive,&quot; she says. As far as I&apos;m aware, all the anime I&apos;ve ever seen were written and directed by men. With sexism more ingrained in Japanese society than our own, it&apos;s perhaps not surprising so many female characters in adult-orientated anime are objectified \u2013 even as their actions give them an independence not often granted to women in Hollywood blockbusters. Major Kusanagi, the big-bosomed bionic heroine of Mamoru Oshii&apos;s mesmerising Ghost in the Shell (one of the inspirations for The Matrix and a plot I&apos;m still unable to fathom, even after repeated viewings) is frequently nude or leaping around in a form-fitting bodysuit that makes her look naked. Maybe she is a male fetish object \u2013 but hey, I dig her, too. Faye Valentine, the gambler in the sci-fi noir-western anime Cowboy Bebop (almost a dry run for Joss Whedon&apos;s Firefly) wears va-va-voom hotpants and crop-top \u2013 not the most practical gear for a spaceship, though it doesn&apos;t stop her being funny and feisty. More ambiguous is the sexual presen-tation of Neon Genesis Evangelion&apos;s Misato Katsuragi, a strict lady scientist with a party-animal domestic life, who frequently thrusts bosom or bottom at Shinji, the schoolboy pilot of a giant robot protecting the remains of civilisation; but these glimpses are from Shinji&apos;s point of view, and she&apos;s one of a lineup in which girl pilots and scientists outnumber their male counterparts. In the case of Satoshi Kon&apos;s Perfect Blue (J-pop noir thriller in the style of Dario Argento), the hallucinatory sexual violence is as much commentary of the objectification of young female celebrities as a part of its protoganist&apos;s mental journey. Kon&apos;s follow-up, Millennium Actress, couldn&apos;t be more chaste, however, a tale of unrequited love played out via the history of Japanese cinema, with a central character clearly inspired by actress Setsuko Hara, who worked with Ozu, Kurosawa and Naruse, all of whose directing styles Kon references. If I had a small daughter, I would try to wean her away from Edward Cullen and Miley Cyrus and towards such anime series as the thrilling steampunk saga Nadia: Secret of Blue Water \u2013 inspired by Jules Verne, conceived by Miyazaki and featuring a 14-year-old lion tamer/acrobat in 1889 Paris. And I would teach her to read subtitles, so she wouldn&apos;t have to settle for naff dubbed versions. You want strong female role models?

She appears on this list because she&apos;s unlike any other mainstream pop starlet currently working, and has an abundance of only periodically realised potential. Sound strange? I&apos;ll try to explain. Her musical stylings, on the surface, are nothing especially remarkable \u2013 largely sugary, innocuous piano ballads that you could expect to hear in an unassuming Chinatown gift shop because the 70-year- old shopowner finds it soothing. But every few tracks (including her Nipponese debut single, the gorgeous Ashita e No Sanka), Alan employs one or both of her secret weapons: her chillingly ancient-sounding &quot;Tibetan wail&quot;, and her ability to play the erhu. Those would be, respectively, a singing technique wherein the vocals are extensively held at a high-pitched waver, and the mournful Chinese string instrument you&apos;ve probably heard on the soundtrack to any martial arts movie ever made. Even the briefest appearances of either transforms Alan&apos;s music into genuinely beautiful, ethereal mood pieces that are more moving and substantial than the vast majority of mass-marketed pop ballads. As well as Ashita e No Sanka, she&apos;s worth hearing for Red Cliff, the theme song to the Chinese drama of the same name \u2013 available in both a Chinese and a Japanese version \u2013 and the subtly pretty Together, which is the first song for which she composed the music. She still has a way to go before perfecting her signature style, but she&apos;s more than worth watching along the way. Where can I hear her? http://bit.ly/jpopalan Nana Kitade Nana Kitade is a bit of a mystery. After releasing her most recent album, 2009&apos;s exceptional Bondage, her contract with Sony expired and fans were left with a note from the company stating that Kitade was on hiatus owing to health problems. Now she&apos;s announced she will be fronting a band called Loveless. So far they don&apos;t appear to have a label, and have been performing live shows around Tokyo instead. It is not easy to find out any more about the band than that. Low sales might be the real reason Sony didn&apos;t renew Kitade&apos;s contract, but it&apos;s hard to believe there&apos;s no place in Japan&apos;s mass market for her mischievous blend of pop-rock or her unique image. Not to mention that almost every one of her singles has been the theme song for an anime, videogame, or TV drama. Isn&apos;t that enough to warrant some good faith? Kitade is perhaps best known for her Lolita style of dress, something she adopted after her first album but seems to have now ditched. Lolita is an incredibly elaborate fashion fad in Tokyo, wherein the wearer dons layers of frilly dresses, bonnets and parasols until they resemble some sort of rococo porcelain doll version of Little Bo Beep \u2013 a wonderful contrast to Kitade&apos;s bratty, punky music. Now with Loveless, judging by the website photos, she&apos;s let go of the &quot;cute&quot; component altogether. With Kitade sporting teased hair, dark, smudged makeup, ropes and an arm piercing, it&apos;s safe to assume her music will also take a turn for the darker. Without a label to influence her or sales to worry about, it will be interesting to see what kind of rawer, badder music she might be performing live these days (the inclusion of a cover of Nirvana&apos;s Territorial Pissings on Loveless&apos;s setlist makes this question all the more interesting). We can only hope that some of it hits the shelves soon, and that she doesn&apos;t disappear completely. Here&apos;s to her health.

The first was Tommy February6, a sugary synth-loving alter ego in which Kawase put on wire-frame glasses and played up an innocent, adolescent image \u2013 bright colours and cheerleading outfits included. Following that came the superior Tommy Heavenly6, for which she adopted a goth-lite style and made rollicking 90s-style alt-rock. The number of Japanese females successful in three different musical outfits is paltry, \u00a0 which makes Kawase (technically now Mrs Okuda after marrying her Brilliant Green bandmate Shunsaku Okuda) \u00a0 so remarkable. In all three acts, Kawase sings in an enticingly awkward mishmash of English and Japanese, sometimes starting a sentence in one language and finishing it in the other. This practice isn&apos;t uncommon in J-Pop, but it&apos;s usually used more sparingly. To her credit, though, Kawase has a better handle on the pronunciation than most, and could do well in the western indie scene, were she inclined to test the waters. She also knows a good turn of phrase \u2013 witess Tommy Heavenly6&apos;s song My Bloody Knee-High Socks. The only one of these three identities that&apos;s still going is the Brilliant Green. As good as the band is, it&apos;s a shame that&apos;s her only current outlet. Luckily for the uninitiated, there are 10 albums of Kawase goodness. Where can I hear her?  http://bit.ly/jpoptomoko  Ayumi Hamasaki She may be declining in popularity, relevance and quality, but Ayumi Hamasaki is still the undisputed Queen of J-Pop, and it will be a long while before anyone can surpass her. She is as famous in Japan as Madonna is in the west \u2013 her face is plastered all over Tokyo. She&apos;s a chameleonic style icon whose innocent pop-princess image has never taken a turn for the oversexed, though she&apos;s often used cosmetic surgery. Musically, she has married accessible, mainstream hits with over-the-top costumes and high-concept videos long before Lady Gaga did. And most of the time her music is very good. Hamasaki&apos;s lyrics and delivery \u2013 she has an earnest, unpolished singing voice \u2013 project a vulnerability that makes her songs strangely endearing and her ballads occasionally touching. My favourite song of Ayumi&apos;s is Ladies Night, a hymn to girl power. The lyrics encourage a friend to leave an abusive relationship \u2013 not a common pop theme. That willingness to address unusual subject matter makes her noteworthy. I hope she doesn&apos;t change. Where can I hear her?  http://bit.ly/jpopayumi Shiina Ringo Shiina Ringo has been a significant influence on at least two of the singers on this list, and consistently ranks high in Japanese polls for favourite artists. Her popularity through the years, even though she&apos;s taken extended breaks from music, speaks volumes of the rabid love she inspires in her fans. This, naturally, includes me. She is my favourite Japanese artist, and I sometimes think she might be my favourite artist anywhere. Before forming the band Tokyo Jihen in 2004, Ringo released three solo albums, each better than the last. The third, Karuki Zamen Kuri No Hana (2003) is her masterpiece. Layered with complex sounds and tempo switch-ups, it&apos;s an album that demands and rewards multiple listens. It would have been hard to top, so it&apos;s understandable that she turned her focus to her band for the next few years before releasing her fourth solo album (with composer Saito Neko in tow), 2007&apos;s Heisei Fuuzoku. Its songs were used in and inspired by the movie Sakuran, and featured updated reworkings of a few of her older tracks. While it doesn&apos;t match her other three solo efforts, it had some memorable moments, and contained what might be her best song yet, Gamble. Sanmon Gossip, released last year, is probably her lightest album, and she finally consummates her relationship with the loungey jazz she&apos;s been flirting with for years. All but absent are the hard-rocking, thrashy, catchy melodies for which she&apos;s known. Togatta Teguch comes closest to her former style and provides a reminder of past glories. While I&apos;m not the biggest fan of her jazz-piano departure, musicians reinvent themselves,and I&apos;m too ecstatic that she&apos;s still making music to quibble.

Almost 25 hours later, but at 9.30pm the same day, it will finish on the other side of the international dateline in the Galapagos Islands, where scientists will share a candle-lit dinner with several hundred residents and environmental activists. In between, Earth Hour , the annual worldwide call for action against climate change, will spread darkness across all seven continents, drawing in 120 nations, 1,700 municipalities and hundreds of millions of people. In the UK, many hotels and restaurants will be offering special candle-lit dinners where guests will be able to see well-known sites plunge into blackness, including Big Ben, Edinburgh castle, the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Belfast city hall, Durham cathedral, St Paul&apos;s cathedral and the London Eye. Now in its fourth year, the event organised by WWF, has spread an ever widening expanse of hour-long darkness. Two million people took part at the first switch-off in Sydney in 2007. Last year, hundreds of millions participated in 88 countries. This year, organisers expect the figure to be close to a billion. Beijing&apos;s Forbidden City and London&apos;s Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower, the Hiroshima peace memorial, the Empire State Building, Rio de Janeiro&apos;s Christ the Redeemer statue, and the world&apos;s tallest building, Burj Khalifa. will all plunge into darkness. Nations that have signed up for the first time this year include Saudi Arabia, long seen as resistant to climate change action, Mongolia, Nepal and the Czech Republic. Another debutant is a first group of participants from Antarctica: the Davis Research Station, which is home to several dozen scientists who presumably will not be also switching off their heaters in -10 degrees Celsius.James Leape, international director general of WWF, said the worldwide event was particularly important after the disappointment of the climate conference in Copenhagen last year. &quot;There was a sense after Copenhagen that we, as a world, had lost momentum,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the important things about this year is that it is a chance for people to say &apos;Hey, we are still concerned about climate change.&apos; A lot of people are looking for an opportunity. If they speak out by themselves, it may not make much of an impact, but through this shared action of Earth Hour, they have a platform to speak.&quot; Leape is in Beijing to attend a darkening ceremony at the Forbidden City, the 600-year-old symbol of Chinese power. Last year, China&apos;s support for Earth Hour clashed, time-wise, with the anniversary of the Tibetan unrest in 2008, prompting some organisations, including Peking university, to warn students not to get involved. This year, with no such complications, participation is enthusiastic. Fifteen Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Dalian, have signed up. Pandas in Sichuan will be involved, along with cartoon characters in Hong Kong, and rock bands in Xiamen. Chinese organisers are using the event to kick-off a &quot;low-carbon lifestyle week&quot; aimed at persuading consumers in the world&apos;s most populous country not to follow the wasteful example of developed nations. The message is catching on at the grassroots. Among the events in the former Chinese capital of Xian, will be a free unplugged music concert. Across the world, people are expected to mark the event in ways that reflect the diversity, creativity and inequality of the human population. In cities like Tokyo, Seoul and New York, netizens are being asked to record landmark buildings&apos; switch-off on their mobile phones and upload them online. In Zimbabwe, hundreds of children will join a candle-lit picnic at Victoria Falls. In Canada, an Earth Hour Blackberry application has proved a hit. Elsewhere, the world&apos;s highest paid supermodel, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and World Cup-winning footballer Francesco Totti will act as spokespeople for the event, along with South Africa&apos;s archbishop Desmond Tutu. Not everywhere is going dark. Tanzania initially did not sign up because few would notice a switch off in Dar es Salaam and other cities where only 10% of people have electricity. Instead, WWF organised a &quot;switch on&quot; of solar energy for a local school last year. It will scale this up to 20 schools this year.In Madagascar, 99% of the country has no electricity and people are frightened to be on the streets after dark because of the instability that has followed the political crisis. But WWF says residents have asked to participate. &quot;There are only 12 street lights on the Chatham Islands and for safety reasons these will remain on,&quot; said Pickles. Organisers said locals would enjoy making the news, but the event would have to compete with a 21st birthday party at the one hotel in town. &quot;A lot of people will be there,&quot; said Lee Barry, Earth Hour Project Manager in New Zealand. &quot;Hopefully someone will remember to turn the lights off.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Japan&apos;s patience with North Korea has similarly run thin, and it is unlikely that Tokyo could be relied on too heavily as a voice of caution.", "At this point, I suspect that officials in Beijing, Washington, Tokyo, and perhaps even Seoul are hoping that Cheonan sank becaue of an accidental explosion."], "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-26T19:01:00Z", "title": "South Korean ship in troubled waters | Robert Farley", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/mar/26/south-korean-ship-sinking", "article": "Late last night, the South Korean patrol ship Cheonan suffered an explosion and sank. As of midnight Korean time, 58 of the 104 member crew of the Cheonan had been rescued. The cause of the sinking of the Cheonan, a 1,300 ton missile corvette, is as of yet unknown. However, the South Korean cabinet has convened an emergency meeting to deal with the situation, and some reports suggest that a North Korean torpedo may have struck the Cheonan.  Details remain sketchy, and at this point it is unclear whether Cheonan sank as the result of an attack, or because of an accidental explosion. Another South Korean patrol ship reportedly fired on North Korean targets in the area. The area in which Cheonan sank has recently seen several skirmishes between North and South Korean forces. In January, patrol vessels from each nation exchanged gunfire with one another. A similar exchange in November resulted in severe damage to a North Korean vessel, and the death of a North Korean sailor. The disputed area involves several islands that are claimed by both sides. South Korea recognises a UN-drawn line of demarcation, while North Korea does not. If Cheonan sank because of an accident, the incident will serve as an example of the challenges presented by high tension situations like that between North and South Korea. In such situations, a lack of information can lead to considerable danger, as both sides face pressure to react without having a grasp of the full situation. If, on the other hand, Cheonan was destroyed by a torpedo, the situation must be considered extremely grave. Forty-six crewmen at last report have yet to be accounted for, and are unlikely to survive long in cold Korean waters. South Korea cannot ignore a provocation of this magnitude, and will likely be forced to respond in some fashion. South Korea&apos;s navy substantially outmatches its North Korean counterpart, but the North Korean response to any South Korean retaliation remains uncertain.  The problem of discerning North Korean intentions complicates factors. It is possible that the North Korean government ordered the attack in order to provoke the South, but the attack may instead have been launched by lower level local commanders. Even if this were the case, however, it would be impossible for South Korea to divine genuine North Korean intentions. If the sinking of Cheonan was intentional, it creates a serious crisis for the Koreas&apos; neighbours and for the United States. None of the US, Japan, or China desire the threat of major military action on the Korean Peninsula. The US, still embroiled in Iraq and Afghanistan, doesn&apos;t want another military confrontation on its plate. At the same time, it will be difficult for the US to restrain South Korea from some form of retaliation. Japan&apos;s patience with North Korea has similarly run thin, and it is unlikely that Tokyo could be relied on too heavily as a voice of caution. Beijing has only limited affection for its North Korean client, but certainly does not want war, or even the threat of war. North Korea&apos;s intentions remain mysterious; if it intended to signal its toughness and resolve to South Korea, it may have bitten off more than it can chew.  At this point, I suspect that officials in Beijing, Washington, Tokyo, and perhaps even Seoul are hoping that Cheonan sank becaue of an accidental explosion. If the North Koreans sank Cheonan and killed dozens of South Korean sailors, the situation in northeast Asia may become very dangerous very quickly."}, {"sentences": ["In May last year the North claimed to have tested a nuclear device as large as that which destroyed Hiroshima, less than two months after a rocket launch which Tokyo and Washington believed was a test of long-range missile technology."], "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-26T19:30:00Z", "title": "South Korean naval ship sinks in disputed area after 'explosion'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/26/south-korea-navy-ship-attack", "article": "A South Korean navy ship sank today leaving scores of sailors missing and several reported dead, following an apparent explosion as it patrolled the disputed sea border with the North. Seoul sought to play down suggestions the damage may have resulted from an attack by its neighbour, after claims that the ship may have been sunk by a North Korean torpedo. A presidential spokeswoman, Kim Eun-hye, said it was premature to say what caused the disaster, telling Reuters: &quot;It is not clear whether North Korea was involved.&quot; Defence officials said that the 1,500-tonne ship began to sink at 9.45pm on Thursday local time off the island of Baengnyeong in the Yellow Sea, near North Korea. Helicopters, naval frigates and coastguard vessels had saved 58 of the 104-strong crew by midnight. Local media reported deaths, citing an unnamed naval official. The navy told the Yonhap news agency in a statement: &quot;The ship appears to have begun sinking after an explosion at the rear of the ship. We have been unable to find the exact cause as of this moment.&quot; A second South Korean ship reportedly fired at an apparently unidentified vessel sailing away from the area towards North Korea, although a defence official said movements on the radar might have been a flock of birds. The South&apos;s YTN TV network reported that the government was investigating whether the sinking was due to an attack by the North. Pyongyang has yet to respond to the incident. If it were involved, it would be a massive escalation of its longstanding tensions with the South. It would also anger the US and China, which have been hoping it is moving towards returning to stalled aid-for-denuclearisation talks. Christian Le Miere, senior analyst in Asia for Jane&apos;s Country Risk, said: &quot;It is still unclear whether this was hostile action. It could have been a mine or an accident involving explosives.&quot; Selig Harrison, director of the Asia programme of the Centre for International Policy in Washington and author of Korean Endgame, said: &quot;It&apos;s generally not understood that there&apos;s been a progressively growing crisis between North and South Korea. Now we&apos;re in a new situation and I&apos;ve been afraid something would give, because the present government [in Seoul] has cancelled the basic premises between North and South.&quot; He said Seoul had announced it would review the statements in which it repudiated policies of predecessor governments designed to bring about a collapse of the North and affirmed a relationship of coexistence. &quot;That was really a fundamental step because to North Korea it means the south is going back to the policy of promoting collapse,&quot; Harrison added. However, others had seen signs of some improvements in relations on the peninsula. The Northern Limit Line has long been an area of tension. In 1999, at least 17 North Korean sailors were killed in a firefight there. Three years later, another clash saw six South Korean and an estimated 13 North Korean sailors die. In November last year it saw its first exchange of fire for seven years in November, damaging vessels on both sides. Le Miere said it appeared that the stricken vessel was the Cheonan, a Pohang class corvette commissioned in 1989. &quot;It is very rare for a ship of this size to be involved in a clash in the west \u2026 [if that is the case] it is a significant development in the engagements,&quot; he added. President Lee Myung-bak called an emergency security meeting, reportedly telling his ministers: &quot;Finding the truth [behind the incident] is important, but saving our soldiers is more important.&quot; The two sides are technically still at war because the 1950-3 conflict ended with a ceasefire and not a peace treaty. Relations improved when the South introduced a &quot;sunshine policy&quot;, but deteriorated sharply when Lee took office in 2008 with a pledge to be tougher, cutting off free-flowing aid. In May last year the North claimed to have tested a nuclear device as large as that which destroyed Hiroshima, less than two months after a rocket launch which Tokyo and Washington believed was a test of long-range missile technology. Pyongyang said it was launching a satellite. Many analysts believe the moves were intended to grab Washington&apos;s attention and set the stage for a return to stalled denuclearisation talks in conditions more favourable to Pyongyang.

The Aim-listed landlord, which controls more than half the buildings in Canary Wharf, reported a 10.7% rise in rental income to \u00a3318.4m, allaying fears that the office market would be hit by financial institutions fleeing higher taxes and tighter regulation. London is now tied with New York for the title of the world&apos;s most important business centre, according to a recent report from the City of London Corporation. Songbird brushed off talk of an exodus of bankers from the City, a view with which John Cahill, analyst at KBC Peel Hunt, agreed. &quot;It&apos;s hard to have [another] crash, given prices have come down by 50%,&quot; he said. &quot;The government&apos;s taxation doesn&apos;t help, but we&apos;re not talking crisis here.&quot; The relocation options for bankers are limited, with New York and Tokyo in the wrong time zone and Frankfurt seen as too dull. The moneybroker Tullett Prebon has given its 700 staff wishing to avoid the 50% City bonus tax the option to move to places with more favourable tax regimes, such as Geneva, but the uptake is thought to have been modest. The value of Songbird&apos;s portfolio, excluding additions, rose by 7.6% to \u00a35bn in the second half of last year, and is just 0.4% less than at the end of 2008. The company swung to a pre-tax profit of \u00a3335m from a \u00a31.9bn loss in 2008, when it suffered big property write-downs. Despite the financial crisis that engulfed many of its banking clients and led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a major tenant in Canary Wharf, Songbird said that its 750,000 sq metre portfolio was still 96.2% let at the end of December, compared with 99.7% at the close of 2008. Possible new tenants include the oil group Shell, which is thought to be considering a move to the Docklands while its South Bank headquarters is being refurbished. Songbird&apos;s chairman, David Pritchard, said: &quot;The strength and potential of Canary Wharf Group&apos;s existing portfolio, coupled with the resilience of its rental income, provide us with an engine for managed growth despite fragility remaining in the wider UK economy.&quot; Songbird came close to collapsing under the weight of its debts last year but managed to eliminate them after raising \u00a31bn in a refinancing that saw the Qatar and Chinese sovereign wealth funds become its largest shareholders. Analysts welcomed the results, which also boosted shares in property developers including British Land, Hammerson and Liberty International. &quot;Following the autumn refinancing, Songbird&apos;s structure is significantly clearer,&quot; KBC Peel Hunt said in a note. &quot;The unique estate offers long-term value and is geared towards a continued recovery in the London office market.&quot; The upbeat results led to profit-taking by investors and Songbird&apos;s shares closed down 4.5p at 170p."}, {"sentences": ["A land dispute between local gangs brings him back to Tokyo for more violence between heavily tattooed antagonists and myriad distractions in the form of mini games, from quiz machines to golf to managing your very own nightclub hostess."], "tags": ["Games", "Culture", "Technology", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "Games consoles"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-27T00:07:01Z", "title": "Games out this week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/27/video-games-out-this-week", "article": "Just Cause 2, PC/PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 Just Cause 2 is a game about bodily flinging your character, special agent Rico Rodriguez, from rooftops, over cliffs and on to speeding vehicles and aircraft, often directly into your next firefight.

Officials have yet to confirm any deaths, although fatalities have been reported by local media.

He said North Korea was unlikely to attack the far more powerful South Korean military. The explosion prompted a number of crew members to jump into the water, the military said. First Lieutenant Baek Jae-woo, a lecturer on ship design at the Republic of Korea Naval Academy, told Reuters that it would not be clear what caused the explosion until the ship was towed to harbour.

Magical realism laced the tales. In his second novel, Solo, Dasgupta largely dispenses with the supernatural but retains the impulse to subvert conventional narrative. The novel opens with Ulrich, a near-centenarian Bulgarian chemist, &quot;combing through his life&quot; to see what, if anything, he has to leave behind. There are many entry and exit points within Solo; in what is emerging as a trademark, Dasgupta sets up a web of cross-cutting links and echoes. But the novel has two central concerns: the nature of failure, and how we connect to others. Dasgupta divides the novel into two &quot;movements&quot;. By focusing first on Ulrich&apos;s &quot;Life&quot;, he sets himself the challenge of holding the reader&apos;s attention and sympathy. Much is strangely muted, as if the events and characters sit behind a drab net curtain. The second section is prefaced by an accident that leaves the old man sightless, which frees Dasgupta to explore Ulrich&apos;s &quot;Daydreams&quot; \u2013 the culmination of a lifetime&apos;s repressed responses \u2013 and to bring into being three new characters: Boris, Ulrich&apos;s part-doppelganger, part-son, as well as Khatuna and Irakli, siblings with complex relationships to the chemist. The action shifts from rural Bulgaria to gangster-dominated post-communist Georgia and ends up in post-millennium New York, where the violin-playing Boris becomes a musical sensation. Having grown up in the UK and lived in three continents during his 38 years, it is perhaps not surprising that Rana Dasgupta&apos;s perspective is what French critic Nicolas Bourriaud identified as &quot;altermodernist&quot; \u2013 an &quot;in-progress redefinition of modernity in the era of globalisation, stressing the experience of wandering in time, space and mediums&quot;. This novel&apos;s sombre message is that we all go &quot;solo&quot;, whether through a life lived &quot;too long&quot;, like Ulrich&apos;s, or through one cut short. But, as Boris&apos;s violin-playing also shows, solos can be moments of exquisite definition, points at which a person comes into his or her own.

This mobile phone footage of a massive crush of passengers was shot at the Komsomolskaya station.  3.24pm: Security concerns are spreading: police in Washington DC and New York City are being extra vigilant on their subways systems, CNN reports.  2.40pm: Train services have resumed on the affected subway line, Russia&apos;s Interfax news agency says. This seems very fast - presumably the damage from the bombs was limited to the subway cars themselves and did not affect the stations.  2.35pm: Russia Today, the Russian English-language TV news station which began broadcasting in 2005, says on its Twitter feed that two undetonated explosives belts have been found at Park Kultury, the second metro station to be hit. No source for this yet, or any more details.  2.31pm: Following on from the reports of the fare-hiking cab drivers (see 10.37am), Vladimir Putin has called on all businesspeople &quot;not to abuse this situation, inflate prices or create additional difficulties, but to express solidarity with those in trouble and in need of your support&quot;.  2.25pm: Al-Jazeera has this useful video recap of previous attacks carried out by separatists from the North Caucasus.  2.01pm: Miriam Elder tweets from Moscow that there seems to be minimal coverage of the attacks on Russian TV. She says: &quot;Soap operas, nature shows, etc since this morning, with just the random update here + there&quot;.  1.22pm: Another expert quoted by Reuters, Galina Yemelianova from the University of Birmingham.  The use of suicide is against Caucasian tradition so this kind of attack is another indication of the incorporation of jihadist tactics into the North Caususus insurgent groups. The networks also continue to recruit women. Often they have lost everything - husbands, brothers, children - and they are willing to kill themselves as revenge. The method of suppression by the federal government in the north Causasus has been quite counter-productive. It has pushed the insurgency out of Chechnya. It is increasingly multi-ethnic and is spreading to other parts of the region through underground jihadist networks which have become more and more active.    1.18pm: Here is a video report from the Guardian featuring commentary from Luke Harding, the Guardian&apos;s Moscow correspondent.  12.39pm: We might have a partial answer to the point made by Mihailovich (see 12.21pm). Reuters are reporting that Putin is to break off his visit to Siberia and will be returning to Moscow later today.  12.35pm: Shortly before Obama&apos;s statement, Gordon Brown&apos;s spokesman said the prime minister was &quot;appalled&quot; at the events in Moscow and sent his condolences to the Russian people.  12.30pm: President Obama has condemned the bombings. In a White House statement, he said the American people stood united with Russia in opposition to &quot;violent extremism and heinous terrorist attacks&quot;.  12.21pm: In case anyone&apos;s not reading the comments, let me flag up this interesting input from one reader, Mihailovich:  Will be interesting to see the extent to which Putin allows Medvedev to take the lead on the response to this. It is all very well pretending to have handed over power when it comes to chats with EU delegations and diplomatic bun fights with the Americans, but at moments of national crisis like this he may feel obliged to flex his muscles.   11.57am: A couple more snippets from the English-language webiste of the RIA Nostovi news agency in Moscow:\u2022 Tomorrow will be a national day of mourning in Moscow for the bomb victims.\u2022 Security is being stepped up across the country, particularly in cities with metro systems, President Medvedev says.             11.53am: Here&apos;s a long but fascinating video about the huge, ornate Moscow metro system. Filmed last year, it has a poignant section showing off the latest security systems which metro bosses hoped would stop future terrorist attacks.  11.42am: Some reports are linking the fact the attackers were women to the phenomenon of the so-called black widows, a series of previous female suicide bombers from Chechnya, some of whom were reputed to be the widows or sisters of men killed by Russian forces.  11.09am: What does this attack mean for Russia&apos;s and its leaders? Reuters, whose coverage of the attack has been swift and wide-ranging, has lined up some experts to comment. Here&apos;s a snippet from Jonathan Eyal, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute thinktank:  This is a direct affront to (Russia&apos;s Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin, whose entire rise to power was built on his pledge to crush the enemies of Russia. It is an affront to his muscular image.   11.04am: All you ever wanted to know about the Moscow metro, usually referred to as the world&apos;s second-busiest such network after Tokyo&apos;s, here.  10.57am: The head of Russia&apos;s Federal Security Service, or FSB \u2013 whose headquarters are located very close to the site of the first blast \u2013 has publicly stated what was only assumed up till now, that authorities believe the bombers are likely to be from North Caucasus, where Russia faces Islamist insurgency in Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia. Alexander Bortnikov told the president, Dmitry Medvedev, that this assessment was based on examination of the bombers&apos; bodies.  10.49am: Several reports say that among the injured were people caught in crushes as passengers tried to leave the stations. This video would seem to bear this out - about one minute in there is mobile phone footage showing desperately packed platforms.  10.37am: With no immediate suspects behind the blast, some Muscovites have an alternative focus for their anger - the city&apos;s taxi drivers. According to a series of outraged tweets \u2013 which, it must be stressed, are not confirmed \u2013 some drivers have suddenly increased their prices to match the new demand for their services.  10.27am: Russia&apos;s RIA Novosti news agency has a particularly startling first-hand account from a Moscow woman, Alexandra Antonova, who escaped Lubyanka station, scene of the first blast, only to get on a train straight to Park Kultury, where the second bomb went off:  &quot;I was in shock. I was deafened by the sound of the blast, but at first I didn&apos;t think it was a terrorist attack. Then I saw all the smoke and realised it had been an explosion. My only thought was to get away as quickly as possible,&quot; she said.She managed to change to a different train and arrived at Park Kultury metro station, the site of the second attack, just a few minutes before the blast.&quot;I was very lucky,&quot; she said.   10.14am: We have a first response to the blasts from Russia&apos;s president, Dmitry Medvedev, and it&apos;s what you might expect. The country will fight terrorism &quot;without hesitation, to the end&quot;, he said, according to Reuters, while stressing that such operations must respect human rights.  10.08am: As happens these days following events like this, Twitter is fast filling with despairing messages. This typical one reads: &quot;got a friend there and he uses the subway and can&apos;t reach him.. wish me luck&quot;.  10.03am: And another update from Luke Harding:  Vladimir Markin, a spokesman in the prosecutor general&apos;s office, said that both attacks were carried out by female suicide bombers. Parts of the body of the bomber at Park Kultury have been recovered and examined, he said, which showed that the bomb was at belt level. She was carrying between 1kg and 2kg of explosives.   10.00am: An eyewitness account of the second blast, told to Russia&apos;s RIA news agency and quoted by Reuters:   I was in the middle of the train when somewhere in the first or second carriage there was a loud blast. I felt the vibrations reverberate through my body. People were yelling like hell. There was a lot of smoke and in about two minutes everything was covered in smoke.   9.46am: Miriam Elder in Moscow is at the Pirgorov hospital, where a number of casualties from the Park Kultury blast have been taken. She says:  There&apos;s quite a few relatives and friends waiting to see the injured, and they&apos;re being allowed in one at a time. One woman emerged later carrying a man&apos;s white shirt, covered in blood. Overall, everyone is being very calm and patient. It was the same at the metro station, where I was about half an hour after the explosion. People were leaving the station very calmly, as if nothing had happened.   9.40am: A couple of new things to note, from Reuters:\u2022 The death toll is now believed to be 37, with 38 injured.\u2022 Russia&apos;s civil aviation authorities have ordered increased security at airports, apparently fearing another attack.             9.38am: Here&apos;s some raw video footage from Russia Today. Be warned: It doesn&apos;t feature anything too grisly, but there are some shots of bloodied, conscious victims being treated. There is also what looks like a brief CCTV of the inside of one of the stations.  9.28am: The Moscow-based English-language TV news channel, Russia Today, has a couple of reports from correspondents outside the affected stations here. Thus far they seem to be relaying the facts we already know but it could be worth checking back later.  9.23am: The BBC website is also running a live blog on the attack aftermath.  9.18am:Both targeted stations are on the same metro line, Sokolnicheskaya. While this remain closed, other parts of the system are open, although police are checking some passengers&apos; bags, the AFP news agency notes.  9.10am: An update from the Guardian&apos;s Luke Harding in Moscow:  &quot;At Lubyanka metro, the epicentre of the explosion was in the second car,&quot; said Pyotr Biryukov, a Moscow government official. &quot;At Park Kultury, it was the third car. Somebody got into the carriages and blew themselves up.&quot;But damage to the stations themselves was minimal, Byrukov added, saying that they were expected to reopen this afternoon.   9.06am: Attacks like these are not unknown in Moscow. In February 2004, a single bomb on a metro station killed 39 people, the worst such incident before today. Another 10 died later that year in a blast outside a station, with Russian authorities blaming both attacks on Chechen rebels.  8.57am: Here is a Russian photo gallery of the blast aftermath. Be warned, a couple of the pictures show injured survivors.  8.51am: Another key fact which has emerged so far is, of course, that both bombers were women, according to Moscow&apos;s mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. The latest update from Reuters recounts that the first blast, shortly before 8am (0500 BST) hit the second carriage of a train as it stood in Lubyanka metro station, killing at least 23 people. The second blast struck as another train waited at Park Kultury station, killing 14 more people.  8.45am: The basic facts as we know them so far are straightforward and grim: at least 35 people killed in apparently co-ordinated suicide blasts on metro trains during Monday morning&apos;s rush hour. The death toll is likely to rise. Authorities have swiftly declared the blasts to be the result of terrorism, but as yet there is no indictation who may be responsible."}, {"sentences": ["From the mid-80s onwards, many of the company&apos;s new works were made through residencies in international cities, including Rome, Lisbon, S\u00e3o Paulo, LA, Istanbul and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Dance", "Culture", "Stage", "Pina Bausch", "Ballet"], "publicationDate": "2010-03-30T11:13:17Z", "title": "Step-by-step guide to dance: Pina Bausch/Tanztheater Wuppertal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/29/dance-pina-bausch-tanztheater-wuppertal", "article": "     In short Pina Bausch was the high priestess of dance theatre: a gaunt, chain-smoking figurehead whose penetrating vision reached both the heights and the hell of human nature, and turned the unremarkable town of Wuppertal into a place of artistic pilgrimage. Backstory            Philippine (&quot;Pina&quot;) Bausch was born in Solingen, Germany, in 1940. Her parents ran a restaurant, and Pina would often amuse customers with impromptu dances. After childhood ballet classes, she went on to the Folkwang school in Essen, headed by Kurt Jooss, who drew on the concept of Ausdruckstanz, the expressionist dance that had flourished in pre-war Germany. From there she won a three-year scholarship to New York&apos;s Juilliard School, where she studied with English ballet choreographer Antony Tudor and performed with both American modern dance groups and the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. She returned to Essen in 1962, becoming a founder member of Jooss&apos;s new Folkwang Ballet, where she began choreographing in 1967. She led the company after Jooss&apos;s departure in 1969, until she accepted the directorship of the Wuppertal Opera Ballet in 1973. She remained there for the rest of her life, despite only ever signing one-year contracts. &quot;I was always ready to go. It was never meant that I stay here in Wuppertal,&quot; she said. &quot;It just happened.&quot; To the disgust of traditionalists, Bausch completely revamped the Wuppertal into a vehicle for her own searing style of Tanztheater. Rules of style and presentation were bulldozed by her imperatives of emotional and psychological expression. Despite the hostile reactions, however, she began to attract an international cult following and the small town of Wuppertal became a mecca for the world of dance (and beyond: her devotees included several actors, directors, artists and film-makers). From the mid-80s onwards, many of the company&apos;s new works were made through residencies in international cities, including Rome, Lisbon, S\u00e3o Paulo, LA, Istanbul and Tokyo. Shortly after arriving in Wuppertal, she met Rolf Borzik, who became both her lover and principal stage designer until his untimely death in 1980. A year later, she married the Chilean poet and academic Ronald Kay, with whom she had one son (named Rolf). A tall, sepulchral figure who subsisted on cigarettes and coffee, Bausch was at her most iconic as the somnabulist in Cafe M\u00fcller (1978), a role she continued to perform into her 60s. On film, she also appeared as a strange, otherwordly presence in Federico Fellini&apos;s The Ship Sails On (1982), and in Pedro Almod\u00f3var&apos;s Talk to Her (2001). She died suddenly in July 2009, just five days after being diagnosed with cancer. Her company, though, remains determined to carry her legacy into the future.  Watching Pina Bausch            You can divide Bausch&apos;s work into three broad phases. Her earliest works were the most conventionally choreographic, with a development and denouement, and movement as the principal medium. The most powerful of these is The Rite of Spring (1975), set to Stravinsky: its emotional force still leaves audiences reeling. From Bluebeard (1977) onwards, Bausch abandoned development and progression: all her subsequent pieces are loose, unpredictable montages of scenes, strung together by free association. As she began to work more with ideas drawn from her performers&apos; personal lives, soul-baring confession came to dominate the choreography. Meanwhile, movement became just one of an anarchic array of mediums that included song, film, costume, set design and props. Her later location pieces used her performers&apos; reactions to the cities in which they were resident as source material for surreal, sometimes comic dances about local people and places. The result is like riffling through sets of intriguingly warped postcards. Throughout her work, some themes recur: human frailty and brutality, the power and the pity of personal relationships (particularly between men and women), the blind force of desire, the desperate veneer of normality (she often dresses her performers in formal gowns and suits, representing a shiny layer of convention). Her earlier pieces, especially, were harrowing in their portrayal of haunted souls and precarious sanity; later in her career, there was more humour, though it was wry rather than sunny. Bausch&apos;s sets are often overwhelming \u2013 rocks and rivers (Vollmund), huge ramparts of earth (Viktor), bleak screes of dead leaves (Bluebeard), a field of flowers (Nelken). Bausch&apos;s works are not meant to be watched: they&apos;re meant to be experienced. (See Pina Bausch: clip-by-clip dance guide for my own, more personal take on the experience). Surrender to her vision \u2013 with the pieces regularly lasting for three hours with no interval, you have little choice \u2013 and you&apos;ll find that they can flay your soul.            Who&apos;s who After Borzik, P\u00e9ter Pabst was Bausch&apos;s regular stage designer. Bausch&apos;s dancers often stayed with the company for many years; notable women included Jo Endicott, Nazareth Panadero and Meryl Tankard; among the men, Dominique Mercy and Jan Minarik. Mercy and Robert Sturm are currently co-directors of the company. Fact During an early Bausch performance, one outraged audience member invaded the stage, grabbed a bucket of water that Tankard was using as a prop, and tried to chuck it over another dancer who was reciting a poem over and over ad nauseum \u2013 but she ducked, and the audience was drenched instead. And no, it wasn&apos;t part of the choreography. In her own words &quot;I loved to dance because I was scared to speak. When I was moving, I could feel.&apos;&apos;Interview with Valerie Lawson, ballet.co.uk, 2002 &quot;I am less interested in how people move than in what moves them.&quot;A famous quote, first given to Jochen Schmidt of the Frankfurter Allgemeine in 1984 &quot;I didn&apos;t want to imitate anybody. Any movement I knew, I didn&apos;t want to use.&quot;Quoted by Luke Jennings, Observer, 2009 In other words &quot;She has basically re-invented dance \u2026 She is a category of dance unto herself.&quot;William Forsythe in a profile of Bausch by the Guardian&apos;s John O&apos;Mahony &quot;You can count on one hand the number of modern-dance-makers who have changed the landscape \u2013 and Pina Bausch was one of them.&quot;Judith Mackrell, Guardian, 2002 &quot;Pina&apos;s vision was second to none. I&apos;d put her up there with Beckett and Bacon as one of the towering figures of the 20th century.&quot;Michael Morris, director of Artangel, Guardian, 2009 &quot;A Bausch evening \u2026 takes place in those three to four inches between nature and nurture, good and evil, and just about any other dichotomy one cares to name. It&apos;s a tight crawl space.&quot;Laura Jacobs, New Criterion, quoted by Janice Ross, 1999 Do say            &quot;The traumatised psyche of middle Europe made flesh.&quot; Luke Jennings wrote that in the Observer last Sunday. It&apos;s rather good. Try saying it. Don&apos;t say &quot;The pornography of pain.&quot; New Yorker critic Arlene Croce wrote that in 1984. Don&apos;t say it \u2013 she&apos;s been getting it in the neck ever since. See also Bausch is hugely influential across the world. Reinhild Hoffman and Susanne Linke, also from the Folkwang school, were very much part of the German Tanztheater movement, of which Sasha Waltz is a younger member. In Belgium, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Alain Platel and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui have all been inspired by Bausch; in Britain, the best-known company is DV8 Physical Theatre.

Does it provide exciting opportunities for interactivity that should be exploited? Or, as in the case of Twitter, does it only serve to further reduce our attention spans and our ability to connect with anything that needs to be said in more that 140 characters? These are the questions bloggers are exploring this week. For Lyn Gardner, the web certainly holds enormous promise and potential for theatre-makers. In a recent post on this blog, she argued that &quot;the growth of pervasive media and digital technologies is offering theatre-makers and audiences unprecedented new challenges and opportunities&quot;. Yet not everyone is so convinced. George Hunka recently came across this article in the New York Times by Michiko Kakutani about the effect of the web on our ability to appreciate art. Kakutani suggests that the rise of the net has helped create a culture with attention-deficit disorder in which people will &quot;tweet and text one another during plays and movies, forming judgments before seeing the arc of the entire work&quot;. And where the constant feedback demanded by interactive technology can, in effect, become like a &quot;giant focus group&quot; that challenges &quot;the autonomy of the artist&quot;. Hunka shares this cautious scepticism towards cyber-interactivity. &quot;Internet users,&quot; he says, &quot;seem to be a jumpy lot, demanding the instant gratification that is denied by more complex art of any kind. It is a call for an increased shallowness in some ways, and these digital and virtual connections, it must be remembered, are digital and virtual, not particularly human.&quot; Yet perhaps the real issue the internet poses for artists is that, as 99 Seats suggests, it forces them to work harder. &quot;Audiences,&quot; he argues, &quot;are smart ... They see plot twists coming a mile off. They know tropes and devices the instant they appear and are rarely fooled \u2026 Too often, in theatre, they&apos;re getting the same old slop; even when it&apos;s postmodern slop, [they] see where it&apos;s going and would rather engage in something that engages them back. If someone is texting or Twittering during your show, maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 it&apos;s not them. It&apos;s you.&quot;  Of course, interactive art is not just confined to the virtual reality of the web; it can also flourish in the concrete reality of the city. At its best, it can traverse the two. Theatre-maker Tassos Stevens was recently in Tokyo for the British Council&apos;s Connected festival, where he took part in a panel discussion about how we make art in the city. He posts his notes from that discussion on his blog, and they provide an excellent insight into how the real and virtual worlds can be combined.  Stevens&apos;s company, Coney, creates events that are &quot;about the audience. We often talk to them using digital technology to bring them into the story wherever they are. Digital infrastructure means that we can bring people to work that is happening in any place.&quot; And once they have gathered people in this way they can then work to transform their audiences&apos; view of their surroundings. To illustrate this, he describes one project that took participants on an adventure through and around the National Theatre: &quot;By having an adventure in the building about the building, we could transform the way people felt inside that place and the way they perceived the building.&quot; Andy Field, who also took part in this discussion, gives another example of how the virtual world can be used to transform our view of the real world. He cites the work of the company Blast Theory that &quot;often examines our relationship to new digital technologies in the city. GPS tracking devices, mobile phones, the internet. Their art asks its audience to reconsider their relationship to these everyday technologies. In Rider Spoke, the matrix of isolated Wi-Fi networks arrayed across the city are repurposed as a way of building up a map of memories and experiences.&quot;  Arguably, in both of these examples, the audience is being asked to work much harder, and concentrate much more than they would in more traditional pieces of theatre. So perhaps, ultimately, we should avoid looking at the net as either intrinsically good or bad. Rather, we should see it as a tool, and like all tools, it is only as good as the person or people using it."}, {"sentences": ["With a threatening soundtrack and the occasional simple red-light wash, as the late Tokyo playwright Koharu Kisaragi wrote, &quot;the film makes you break out in sweat just by shooting a safe, peaceful gymnasium.&quot; Many of Ito&apos;s rare and brilliant films, which were screened at the Flatpack film festival in Birmingham last weekend, use the same technique: shooting photographs and arranging them frame-by-frame to create the illusion of reality."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Festivals"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-01T15:00:11Z", "title": "Flatpack film festival turns spotlight on Takashi Ito", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/apr/01/flatpack-film-festival-takashi-ito", "article": "In 1984, a young Takashi Ito travelled to the art school in Wurzburg, Germany, to screen a short film he&apos;d made a few years before. The film, Spacy, was an odd experiment: it was simply 700 photographs of the inside of an empty school gymnasium, shot in various different orders, frame-by-frame. When the screening ended, according to fellow film-maker Nobuhiro Kawanaka, thunderous applause broke out and a faculty member spontaneously passed around a hat that came back filled with a &quot;mountain&quot; of banknotes. Expecting a nine-minute experimental Japanese short to garner anything like that kind of reaction now would be a bit like waiting patiently for your toaster to pop up a chicken. Then again, Spacy is a little slice of genius. (You can see the first few minutes here.) Ito \u2013 now a professor of art and design at Kyoto University \u2013 arranges the photographs so that the viewer appears to be taking a roller coaster through an endless series of gyms: forward, left, right, down through the floor; with increasing speed in a recursive world that seems to branch into a vast yet self-repeating space. With a threatening soundtrack and the occasional simple red-light wash, as the late Tokyo playwright Koharu Kisaragi wrote, &quot;the film makes you break out in sweat just by shooting a safe, peaceful gymnasium.&quot; Many of Ito&apos;s rare and brilliant films, which were screened at the Flatpack film festival in Birmingham last weekend, use the same technique: shooting photographs and arranging them frame-by-frame to create the illusion of reality. Some are almost like jokes: in Wall, he zooms in and out of a photograph of a massive looming brick storehouse to an 80s electropop beat, bouncing left then right, making the giant wall dance. Others are more like what we&apos;d consider contemporary art installations: Zone, which took the top honour at the Oberhausen short film festival in 1995, takes place in a white room in which a man, wrapped in gauze and tied to a chair, is tormented by various lit-up figures dancing around the room \u2013 a mummified train set, a freaky child in a mask wearing Christmas lights. The older his films, though, the more cutting-edge they get. Grim, from 1985, alone makes it worthwhile picking up the new box set released earlier this year. Inside an apartment, blobs or what Ito calls &quot;skins&quot; of fidgety light peel themselves off the walls and somehow achieve corporeal form. The effect is like watching the traces of a family flicker like ghosts through an abandoned flat. It&apos;s the best visual representation of nostalgia (or so it seems to me) that I&apos;ve ever seen, and in its creepy layering effects and flickering overlaps is a direct precursor of the late-90s J-horror blockbusters of Hideo Nakata (Ringu) or Takashi Shimizu (Ju-On). Ito doesn&apos;t try to tell stories. His films couldn&apos;t be books, or songs, or even the component photographs he often uses to make them. He wields the medium of film for its own ends. As he told Image Forum in 1984: &quot;Film is capable of presenting unrealistic worlds as a vivid reality and creating a strange space peculiar to the medium. My major intention is to change ordinary, everyday life scenes, and draw the audience (myself) into a vortex of supernatural illusion by the magic of films.&quot; Watch his short films because they prefigured digitisation, or for Takashi Inagaki&apos;s awesome electronic scores, or because Ito&apos;s films were ripped off pretty thoroughly by the Japanese horror industry.

There&apos;s plenty to think about if the Nigerian city of 16 million tightly packed inhabitants is the ultimate expression of modern urban living. Lagos is growing at such an astonishing rate that by 2015 it is predicted to be the third largest city in the world, behind Mumbai and Tokyo, but it is an unlikely model metropolis. Although the country has vast oil resources, the city&apos;s infrastructure is appalling. Three-quarters of Lagos residents live in slums. The rail network manages one train per week. Despite being the world&apos;s sixth biggest oil producer, power cuts are a daily occurrence and a national joke. Lagosians have renamed the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) as Never Expect Power Always. When I first visited Nigeria, my parents&apos; homeland, a decade ago, I was unprepared for the reality. It was like landing on another planet. Although the city is a nightmare to navigate, the Lagosians are a breed apart. Millions of quick-witted economic migrants have created a city characterised by personal ingenuity and entrepreneurship. Nothing is wasted, everything is a commodity. &quot;Lagos is not a kind of backward situation but an announcement of the future,&quot; the architect Rem Koolhaas has said. &quot;What is now fascinating is how, with some level of self-organisation, there is a strange combination of extreme underdevelopment and development.&quot; Will Anderson, the series producer of Welcome to Lagos, a fascinating new three-part documentary, agrees. He believes the way they have addressed the problems of extreme population growth is a lesson for us all, especially now that half the world&apos;s population live in cities, including one billion slum dwellers. &quot;I am an anthropologist by background, but rather than looking at marginal and tribal populations, I wanted to look at massive cities. If a Martian came down to Earth, they would report back that we are a species that lives in cities. And in some degrees the people in Lagos are doing it better than we are in the west,&quot; he says. The series looks at life on the Olusosun rubbish dump, the workplace and home to more than 1,000 scavengers who sift the garbage looking for recyclable material. This is a vibrant, self-policing community living next to a mosque, a barber&apos;s shop and three cinemas. The film-makers also take us to Makoka lagoon where 300,000 people live on water and in squatter camps on the beach. It is soon clear that most Lagos residents will do anything to earn a few dollars a day, from back-breaking labour to sharp business deals, because there is no welfare state to provide a safety net. But among Lagosians, who tend to combine relentless entrepreneurial flair with the belief that God will provide, there is little time for self-pity, a fact reflected in the series. &quot;We did not want the people to come across as victims because that is not how they see themselves,&quot; says Anderson. &quot;They are normal people doing what they have to do to survive. They encounter the same obstactles as the rest of us, but it&apos;s just that they do so in extreme circumstances.&quot; Welcome to Lagos will be shown on BBC 2 at 9pm on 15, 22 and 29 April  Voices from the margins ERIC OBUH  Eric, 28, works as a scavenger on the Olusosun landfill site, the largest dump site in Lagos, and has recorded his first album &quot;Send Them Come&quot;. &quot;They call me Slender, Vocal Slender, that&apos;s my music name. Because I&apos;m very lean in the face, and because I&apos;m always singing my songs. I have so many songs I still want to record, good songs that I&apos;ve written, but no one has heard. Songs about divine love, peace and unity in Nigeria, and others which praise all the girls. &quot;The film crew have made me a website. MySpace. It&apos;s not easy to get a website on your own. I know about 200 singers in Ajegunle where I live, but only two or three have websites. Ajegunle is the biggest ghetto in Lagos. It&apos;s where all the biggest Nigerian stars come from, people like Daddy Showkey, Baba Fryo, Mighty Mouse, African China, B&apos;Clean, and Nico Gravity. Every night there&apos;s a party going on somewhere, people playing music on the street corners, or setting up sound systems to dance to. &quot;One day I&apos;m going to be more famous than Craig David. Then I&apos;ll have enough money to be able to spend all day on my music, instead of working here on the dump. A lot of people who know me, my friends, and my family, they don&apos;t know I work in the dump. They believe I just do music. And I want to keep it that way, so I will have respect. It&apos;s not that the dump is bad, because the money I get from it keeps my body and soul together, and helps me make my music.&quot; MOHAMMED ADAMU Mohammed, 30, is a cattle dealer at the Oluwainshola Cattle Market and Slaughter Yard on the outskirts of Lagos. &quot;I am planning to marry presently, some time soon. I think it is the right time. I&apos;m 30 now, and I have sent a message to my family letting them know I am ready. They will arrange everything. Her name is Aysha. I have met her three times already, during my trips home to my village in the north. She is good, I like her, there is love and understanding and I don&apos;t doubt her at all. My family are very happy with me. To have only one wife is OK by me. I have seen the disadvantages people have with more than one wife. I want to get a house in Lagos, and to live with her here. She has never left her village. But I cannot be going up and down to the north all the time \u2013 the expenses would be too much. &quot;I am waiting to know the exact day of the wedding. I will have to provide property for her, and decorative things, two or three bags of clothes. The bags will be filled with everything concerning women&apos;s dresses, including the shoes. The only thing they have asked me for is jewellery. The whole thing will cost around 150,000 naira (\u00a3600). I know I can reach that amount. &quot;When the day comes, me and my friends will go to the north, and my wife&apos;s family will cook. W e&apos;ll gather for prayers, and then I&apos;ll take my wife to the house to celebrate the wedding. The next day I&apos;ll bring her back to Lagos, and continue selling cows in the market.&quot; ESTHER OGUNLEKE Esther, 24, lives in a house built on Kuramo Beach, a tiny spit of sand attached to Victoria Island, Lagos&apos;s most upmarket neighbourhood. &quot;I&apos;ve just finished reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. One of the film crew left me her copy when she said goodbye. I thought it was beautiful and exciting, and I want to read the next one in the trilogy, but I haven&apos;t been able to find a copy anywhere. I pray to God that he will provide one. I love to read so much. &quot;This is me, outside my house on Kuramo beach. It&apos;s a small stretch of sand attached to Victoria Island, one of the most upmarket neighbourhoods in Lagos. Everyone thinks only drug addicts, armed robbers and prostitutes live here, but they never come to find out the truth. I&apos;ve lived on the beach for almost eight years. There&apos;s about 1,000 of us here. Shopkeepers, motorbike taxi drivers, even businessmen who work in banks. My best friend, Lati, runs a cinema house next to where I live. We watch Nollywood movies, and all the Chelsea matches. I could never be friends with anyone who supports Manchester United. They are the Red Devils. They are devilish. Maybe they are using their devilish substance to win all the major trophies they have been winning. I hate them. Their nickname is very bad. Up Chelsea! Blues for life! &quot;My house cost about \u00a360 to build. You have to buy the wood and tarpaulins, and then pay a tax to the local chairman. I like to keep it very clean. When I was arguing with my husband, we had a big fight about who was going to get the house. I wasn&apos;t going to let him leave me homeless, with nowhere to go. &quot;In this picture, I&apos;m getting dressed up for church. I&apos;m a member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. On the first Friday of every month they hold a &apos;miracle service&apos;. Sometimes there&apos;s more than a million people praying together; it&apos;s quite fantastic, and then I know God will never give up on me ...&quot; JOSEPH ORJI Joseph, 39, is a scrap trader at the Olusosun landfill site, and lives 10 minutes walk away with his wife and two young daughters. &quot;My business depends on the dollar. When the dollar goes down, the price goes down. When the dollar is up, the price goes up. The only difference between me and someone who works in the stock market is the suit and the tie, and the fine shoes. I&apos;ve been working on the dump for 12 years. I&apos;m a buyer. I buy from the scavengers, and sell to the reprocessing factories. Aluminium, zinc, copper wire, rubber slippers \u2013 all this is what I buy. &quot;All these big rich people, they don&apos;t like to conserve things. They throw everything away, even if there&apos;s nothing wrong with it! My house is full of the things I&apos;ve found on the dump. Toasted-sandwich makers. Field glasses. Even my daughter&apos;s teddy. &quot;My older daughter, Peace, will be four in May. One day, she&apos;s going to be the future Miss World. My wife Elizabeth and I believe she&apos;s going to be great in life. That&apos;s what we pray for. I don&apos;t mind what she does or how she does it \u2013 she&apos;ll make her own life. &quot;I&apos;m not ashamed to work in the dump. All my neighbours know that&apos;s where I work.I don&apos;t rob. I don&apos;t steal. I&apos;m an honest person. What is important is love for your family. That&apos;s what drives you to walk that extra mile. If there was a dump that was stinkier than this one, where I could earn more, then I&apos;d go there to work, just to make sure my family enjoys life. The government are not interested in our recycling business. They don&apos;t look at us as human beings. They just look at us as if we are miscreants. Vagabonds. But they don&apos;t know that we are the tyres of the nation.

The show, known for its opulent atmosphere, lavish sets and costumes, and preoccupation with the problems of the wealthy, ran alongside Ronald Reagan&apos;s years as US president, 1981-89. It made Forsythe internationally famous and rich. During the second year of the run, Forsythe remarked: &quot;I can&apos;t afford to bulge. Being a 64-year-old sex symbol is a hell of a weight to carry.&quot; With his earnest demeanour, Forsythe, as the patriarch plagued by a scheming ex-wife (Joan Collins), a bisexual son, and other tribulations ranging from murder and greed to lust and incest, held the series together while attempting to do the same with the Denver family. Unlike Larry Hagman&apos;s JR, his counterpart in Dallas, Forsythe as Blake exuded suavity and upper-class elegance. In fact, it was a persona he had perfected for many years on television. Forsythe may have had a famous face, but his voice alone became equally well-known in a previous popular TV series, Charlie&apos;s Angels (1976-81), in which he played the unseen Charlie Townsend, who directed his young women&apos;s crimefighting operations over a speaker- phone. Because Forsythe recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set, he rarely met any of his co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts. &quot;I was coming off the court when she came up to me and said, &apos;Charlie! I finally met Charlie!&apos;&quot; Forsythe recalled. Forsythe was offered the Charlie role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, Gig Young, showed up too drunk to read his lines. &quot;I didn&apos;t even take my pyjamas off \u2013 I just put on my topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron said, &apos;That&apos;s perfect.&apos; And I went home and went back to bed.&quot; Born John Lincoln Freund in Penns Grove, New Jersey, Forsythe determined to become an actor despite the opposition of his Wall Street businessman father. From Abraham Lincoln high school, Brooklyn, he went to the University of North Carolina. There he excelled in dramatics as well as at baseball, and his first job was as a radio broadcaster with the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1943, while serving in the US army air corps, Forsythe made his Broadway debut in Moss Hart&apos;s production of Winged Victory, among many other future stars. That same year, he was brought to Hollywood by Warner Bros, where he was immediately cast in the small role of Sparks in the submarine drama Destination Tokyo, starring Cary Grant. However, he did not return to the big screen for another nine years, and even then his film appearances were only sporadic. Instead, Forsythe concentrated on television and the stage. In 1947, he took over from Arthur Kennedy as the disillusioned son in Arthur Miller&apos;s first produced play, All My Sons, on Broadway, and then replaced Henry Fonda in the title role of the long-running naval comedy-drama Mister Roberts in 1950, sounding uncannily like his predecessor. In 1953, he created the role of the well-meaning Captain Fisby in John Patrick&apos;s The Teahouse of the August Moon. The character (played by Glenn Ford in the movie), who attempts to bring American-style democracy to the natives of Okinawa, was portrayed by Forsythe with a splendid mixture of ingenuousness and self-righteousness. In between his two stage hits, Forsythe made dour appearances in a few films, notably Robert Wise&apos;s The Captive City (1952), in which he was a small-town newspaper editor fighting widespread corruption; and John Sturges&apos;s Escape from Fort Bravo (1953), where, as a Confederate prisoner, he is conveniently killed by Indians at the end to allow William Holden to get his girl (Eleanor Parker). In fact, Forsythe, a rather wooden film actor, was a sub-Holden type. Nonetheless, Alfred Hitchcock must have liked him, because he cast him in two of his films: the black comedy The Trouble With Harry (1955) had three people each believing they had killed a man, one of them being Forsythe as a painter; and Topaz (1969), where he is convincingly dull as a CIA man. In The Happy Ending (1969), Jean Simmons, while watching Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca, comments to Forsythe, as her boring commuter husband, &quot;They&apos;re more alive than we are.&quot; There is no truer line in the picture. Television suited his personality much better, as he proved in the series Bachelor Father (1957-62). As playboy Hollywood attorney Bentley Gregg, responsible for raising his orphaned niece, he gained stardom. This led to The John Forsythe Show (1965-66), in which he played father to his own real daughters, Brooke and Page Forsythe, by his second wife, Julie Warren, whom he had married in 1943; by his first marriage, to Parker McCormick (1938-40), he had a son, Dall. Other sitcoms in which Forsythe starred were Rome With Love (1969-71) and the political satire The Powers That Be (1992-93). In the cinema, he was seen as establishment figures: in Kitten With a Whip (1964) he was a politician being blackmailed by delinquent Ann-Margret; he was a politician again, married to Lana Turner, in the fifth remake of the melodrama Madame X (1966). In Cold Blood (1967) had him as an investigator of the bloody murders, and in And Justice For All (1979), he played a judge. One of his last big screen portrayals was as the modern-day equivalent of Marley&apos;s Ghost in Scrooged (1988). After Julie died of cancer in 1994, Forsythe, renowned as a &quot;nice guy&quot; in the industry, went into semi-retirement, devoting much of his time to the United Nations Association, the American National Theatre and Academy, and the American Cancer Society. He is survived by his three children and his third wife, Nicole Carter, whom he married in 2002. \u2022 John Forsythe (John Lincoln Freund), actor, born 29 January 1918; died 1 April 2010"}, {"sentences": ["The 35-year-old former flanker, who played for Japan in three World Cups from 1999 to 2007, fell off a platform at Kamakura, south of Tokyo on Saturday.", "Watanabe, who was born in Hokkaido, joined the Toshiba team Brave Lupus in Tokyo in 1997 after graduating from Nippon Sport Science University."], "tags": ["Japan rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-05T12:10:38Z", "title": "Japan rugby player Yasunori Watanabe killed after being hit by train", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/05/japan-rugby-yasunori-watanabe-killed", "article": "The former Japan international rugby player Yasunori Watanabe has died after being hit by a train at the weekend, police said today.

The Californian company Better Place will test its automated battery-swap stations in Tokyo. It is the latest element in the company&apos;s ambitious plans to build the world&apos;s first infrastructure networks for electric cars by the start of next year. Globally, road vehicles generate around a fifth of carbon dioxide emissions. The figure is the same for the UK. According to a study for the Department for Transport, widespread adoption of electric vehicles with a range of 30 miles or more could halve road transport emissions. One of the biggest challenges, however, to the large-scale implementation of electric cars is the problem of infrastructure for recharging. Better Place has come up with a model that involves building networks of charging points and battery-switch stations. At these a robotic mechanism will swap the empty battery in a car for a fully charged one. This means electric cars can be &quot;refilled&quot; in minutes, rather than taking several hours to charge their batteries. On 26 April in Tokyo Better Place will begin the first public trial of its battery-switching stations. &quot;We&apos;re applying the switch technology to taxis and working with Tokyo&apos;s largest taxi operators, Nihon Kotsu,&quot; said Better Place. The trial is expected to last for 90 days. The first part of Better Place&apos;s technology, a network of 100 public charging points, is already being trialled in Copenhagen. Using data from the trials, Better Place will launch its first commercial network in Israel at the end of the year. &quot;All of our components will be tested together with the Renault Fluence electric vehicles. There will be 10 cars this year, and as we work out the kinks in the system we&apos;ll scale up by bringing in additional vehicles and deploying additional infrastructure,&quot; the company said. Further cars will be introduced as the network is built up in size. Electric Renault Fluence cars will be available for consumers to buy by the end of next year and Better Place expects to be able to serve several other makes of car as long as their batteries are easily swappable by its robots. How consumers will pay for Better Place&apos;s services is yet to be worked out but Jason Wolf, a business manager at the company, has said that users would probably pay a monthly subscription for unlimited access, or a one-off fee for casual users.

What first strikes the eye about the Pompidou-Metz is its bizarre, undulating roof. This complex structure, made of no fewer than 10 miles of laminated spruce and larch, is an extraordinary creation, drooping over the concrete, steel and glass core of the building in a seemingly random fashion, as if a passing bird had dropped a giant floppy hat on its head. Coated in fibreglass, the roof has been shaped as much for practical reasons as for aesthetic ones \u2013 to keep sun, rain and snow at bay. It is, I can&apos;t help thinking, the building&apos;s best and most redeeming feature. Up close and on the inside, concrete, steel and glass take over, while every glance upwards allows another view of this glorious timber form. The Pompidou Centre in Paris, opened in 1977, is one of the most visited art galleries in the world. So it makes perfect sense that it should choose to expand \u2013 creating this regional outpost in Metz, north-east France, a short, sensationally fast (1hr 25mins) TGV ride away from the capital. The Pompidou-Metz, rising up as if from the ocean like a great conch, was meant to open three years ago, but such experimental architecture rarely goes exactly to plan, and I suspect that roof might be to blame. It is now seven years since the design contest was won by a team comprising Shigeru Ban (Tokyo), Jean de Gastines (Paris) and Philip Gumuchdjian (London). Their curious new building, due to open next month, is just two minutes walk from the town&apos;s magnificent central station, designed like a castle by German architect J\u00fcrgen Kr\u00f6ger in the early 1900s.     Rising like a conch from the shore ... the Pompidou-Metz. Photograph: Roland Halbe    Just as the original Pompidou was designed to reinvent a large area of central Paris, so the Pompidou-Metz forms the centrepiece of the city&apos;s amphitheatre quarter, a district formerly given over to industry. It is, by any standards, an important building: much cultural pride rides on its curving shoulders, locally and nationally. And for Metz, a city not on the regular tourist beat, here is a chance to reinvent itself. So does the new gallery pull it off? Beneath that hat, the building at first feels all over the place, its galleries, cafes and intervening public spaces rushing off in all directions. Fishier and fishier. Yet some sort of logic does start to emerge. You enter a lobby, with the usual cafe, bookshop and so on, before entering the forum, a soaring space for displaying large-scale installations (since the advent of Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine Hall, every gallery needs one). Above and through this vast space, three huge concrete tubes crisscross, with windows at either end. These are the three principal galleries, reached by stairs or lift in the central 77-metre tall tower, which stands like the mast on a ship, skewering your attention. Each space has been carefully crafted to offer framed views of the city&apos;s monuments, including Kr\u00f6ger&apos;s fairytale station. What curious galleries these are: concrete corridors in the air relying, to a great degree, on artificial lighting in an era when it has become commonplace for galleries to demand diffused daylight everywhere. Ban points out the advantages: these galleries are entirely free of columns, or any other interruption, so offer seamless spaces for showcasing art. In any case, this is meant to be as radical a building as the original Pompidou, which stunned the world with its own big idea: wearing its insides outside, it looked for all the world like a brightly painted North\u00a0Sea\u00a0oil rig. The architects were well aware of the extraordinary story of Metz itself when putting their design together. Perilously close to the border with Germany, Metz has changed hands many times. This sense of flux invades the fabric of this new building \u2013 in the sense that nothing is wholly certain here and anything, culturally, can happen. Even the funding reflects this flux: although fundamentally a French project, the \u20ac69m (\u00a361m) Pompidou-Metz has also been funded by the EU. Five centuries of masterpieces Its tall tower leads up to a rooftop cafe-restaurant, a viewing gallery, and a studio intended for live performances, particularly of an experimental type. From up here, the building looks and feels more like the big top of a circus, with views out to new landscaped gardens planted with cherry trees. Throughout, though, this is a strange and ambivalent building. It has the feeling of being a book of bits rather than a considered, tightly edited volume. This may be the point: such spatial oddity and aesthetic uncertainty goes, I think, to the heart of the Pompidou-Metz project. The idea here is that anything might go \u2013\u00a0that art, architecture and curatorship is an adventure rather than an ordained or highly governed experience. Like its predecessor, the Pompidou-Metz will take some getting used to. Much, of course, turns on the quality and variety of what goes on show; the first major exhibition will be an ambitious attempt to find out what makes a masterpiece by displaying 800 art works drawn from the past five centuries. What is for sure, though, is that the gallery is not some opportunistic franchise, there to cash in on the Pompidou name, but an art centre in its own right, intended to have an identity very much its own.     Metz in the frame ... the view from inside. Photograph: Roland Halbe    Although the product of team work, the design bears many of the hallmarks of Ban, an American-educated Japanese architect celebrated for his work with unexpected materials: houses made from recycled paper tubes, a museum made from 156 shipping containers. Ban has the knack of conjuring inventive buildings from very little. The Pompidou-Metz, and certainly its roof, is very much his kind of structure. Ban describes it as a &quot;crustacean&quot;. When I look back at this provocative new building from the gaping mouth of Metz-Ville station, sunlight flashes off its roof, making it vanish for a moment \u2013 as if it had slid back into some primordial sea. From Venice to Vegas: Other gallery outposts  The idea of creating branches of established museums is not a new one. In 1969, Peggy Guggenheim handed the collections in her Venetian palazzo to her uncle Solomon, making it a European outpost of his famous Frank Lloyd Wright-designed museum in New York. London&apos;s Tate opened its first regional outpost, Tate Liverpool, in 1988, in a magnificent warehouse given a makeover by James Stirling. Tate St Ives, designed by Evans and Shalev, followed five years later. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice and the regional Tates are all galleries with their own special characters, collections and displays; it would be unfair to call any of them clones. But what has changed in recent years is the idea of the museum or gallery &quot;franchise&quot;: a branch of the Guggenheim, Louvre or Hermitage borrowing shows, most of its ideas and content, and, most importantly, its name from a parent institution. Since the 1990s, the Guggenheim has opened new branches around the world, even in Las Vegas (a failure: it closed in 2003). Las Vegas was also host to the hybrid Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, which closed in 2008. Frank Gehry designed the eye-popping branch in Bilbao, while future Guggenheims are under construction in Guadalajara, Mexico (due to open in 2011) and Abu Dhabi (Frank Gehry again, 2011). The first major Louvre branch, a giant mushroom designed by Jean Nouvel (below), is taking shape in Abu Dhabi for 2012. In London, the Victoria and Albert museum is preparing to venture beyond the confines of South Kensington: the first V&amp;A &quot;abroad&quot; will be built in Dundee, Scotland. In architectural terms, the danger is that these can be expensive, over-the-top projects, parachuted into far-off countries without the subtlety that comes from architects working within the confines and discipline of cities they know well.

This is set to get worse from today as taxi fares in the capital defy the pay freezes in place elsewhere, and rise by 2.3%. The average cost of hailing a black cab will increase to \u00a310.39 during the day and \u00a314.15 at night, according to Transport for London (TFL). The fare rise, the lowest annual increase since 2004, aims to take into account the rise in average national earnings and will also help drivers cover rising operating costs, which include increases to insurance and fuel costs, it said. Earlier this week, petrol prices rose to an average of \u00a31.20 a litre, the highest on record. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: &quot;The capital is blessed with wonderful cabbies and we&apos;ve deliberated long and hard to come up with an increase we think is fair to everyone during these tough economic times.&quot; Bob Oddy, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers&apos; Association, said: &quot;We welcome this small but important increase. Like everyone else, London&apos;s cabbies continue to face significant challenges.&quot; While taxis drivers might breath a sigh of relief at the rise, passengers are likely to be less impressed. Anyone making a journey of more than a few miles will be used to paying substantially more than the average price quoted by TFL. Before today&apos;s rise is taken into account, to travel six miles in the capital cost between \u00a317 and \u00a333, depending on the time of day and how long the journey takes. Meanwhile, a journey between Heathrow and central London typically cost between \u00a340 and \u00a375, though delays or heavy traffic can make this higher. A separate scheme due to start this autumn will see the cost of a taxi from central London to elsewhere in the capital rise to up to \u00a350. The &quot;golden fares&quot; scheme, devised by Westminster council, will operate from a taxi rank in Leicester Square on Friday and Saturday nights and will require passengers to pay before they get in the taxi. Minimum rates will start at \u00a320 for up to three miles and will rise to \u00a330 for seven-mile trips. Ten-mile journeys will cost \u00a340, while journeys up to 12 miles will cost \u00a350. However, price increases are unlikely to deter people from taking the capital&apos;s black cabs. Last year the vehicles were voted the best taxis in the world in a survey for the website Hotels.com, despite also being voted the most expensive. London cabbies, who can spend up to four years studying the Knowledge, the infamous in-depth study of a number of pre-set London street routes, were voted the world&apos;s friendliest and knowledgeable taxi drivers.

Taking place over two days at St Andrews last September, the David Mitchell Conference featured papers by more than 20 scholars, including such treats as &quot;Writing Inside/Out: Genre and David Mitchell&apos;s Paratext&quot; and &quot;Hypertext, Palimpsest and the Virtual Text: Tracing the Digital in David Mitchell&apos;s Ghostwritten&quot;. If you knew nothing about Mitchell other than the titles of these treatises, you&apos;d be forgiven for assuming that he is an experimental writer in the postmodern mould; that he&apos;s achingly self-conscious and (probably) insufferably earnest; and that his work singularly lacks commercial appeal. The first of these assumptions would be correct: Mitchell is experimental. But the others would all be wrong. For Mitchell, as his scores of fans know, is a long way from being the stereotype of the pretentious postmodernist and his work is anything but unreadable. In fact, in the 11 years since he announced himself with his multi-narrative first book, Ghostwritten, Mitchell has built a reputation as just about the most audacious, thrilling and, above all, entertaining young British novelist there is. He&apos;s that genuine rarity, a writer of startling ambition whose work is challenging and unconventional, yet whose storytelling gifts keep you turning the page. AS Byatt, an early fan, identifies this knack for narrative as being critical to his success. &quot;David tells a good story. He doesn&apos;t have any intention of refashioning the world, he doesn&apos;t even really have a message. His writing just gives intense pleasure.&quot; At the same time, he&apos;s an experimenter with the ability to &quot;imagine these extraordinary large structures&quot; \u2013 although she points out that &quot;he&apos;s an innovator because he wants to do something new, not because he wants to be the kind of writer who is known as experimental&quot;. Byatt&apos;s sentiments are echoed by the broadcaster John Humphrys: &quot;He is just a brilliant storyteller. Everyone seems to write big books these days. And mostly they&apos;ve become rather tedious. Mitchell&apos;s novels are long, but they don&apos;t feel it. The narrative moves.&quot; If Ghostwritten established Mitchell as a talent to watch, his subsequent efforts have confirmed him as a writer of dazzling range and impressive consistency. His second novel was the Booker-shortlisted Number9dream (2001), the story of a young Japanese man combing Tokyo for his missing father. What might have been a derivative tale of Murakami-style alienation was made distinctive by the interleaving of dream sequences and reality, so that it was never clear if what we were reading was actually happening or just taking place in the narrator&apos;s head (or, indeed, was some kind of video game). Next came the even more ambitious, Calvino-inspired Cloud Atlas (2004), a giant Russian doll of a novel featuring six linked narratives ranging dramatically in location and time. It, too, was Booker short-listed and received rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. It was also the first of Mitchell&apos;s novels to be a big commercial success, selling more than 500,000 copies in the UK after being selected for the Richard and Judy Book Club. A slimmer, more autobiographical fourth novel, Black Swan Green (2006), followed; for some, this marked a disappointing change of direction (although others pointed out that it was typical of Mitchell that he should publish what is usually a first novel \u2013 the one about growing up \u2013 fourth). Mitchell fans will no doubt be pleased that his fifth novel marks a return to boldly imaginative territory. Indeed, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet, which is published next month, may just be Mitchell&apos;s most ambitious book yet. Set in 1799, in shogun-era Japan, it describes (in gleeful, often gruesome detail) life on the small island of Dejima, a Dutch trading concession close to Nagasaki. Dejima, with its cultural intermingling, represented an intriguing early example of the clash of civilisations. Mitchell tells his story through the eyes of a young clerk, De Zoet, who gets stranded on the island when war breaks out between the British and Dutch, and who embarks on a passionate affair with a young Japanese midwife. In many ways, the most surprising thing about The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet is that Mitchell allows his imagination to rest in one place for so long. In earlier books, his narratives tended to zigzag. AS Byatt reckons that it&apos;s &quot;extraordinarily entertaining and well-realised \u2013 he really knows Japan, he really knows how they think&quot;, although, for her, the novel doesn&apos;t quite reach the heights of Cloud Atlas. So who is the man responsible for these trailblazing fictions? What gives David Mitchell the ability to inhabit so many different worlds? People who know Mitchell regularly say two things about him: first, that he&apos;s extremely private, and second, that he&apos;s extraordinarily nice and unassuming. He was born in 1969, the son of artists who moved to Worcestershire when he was seven (his father worked as a designer for Worcester porcelain). He described himself as a shy child whose middle-class background made it hard for him to fit in with the farm kids he went to school with. This social awkwardness was compounded by early difficulties with language. He didn&apos;t properly learn to speak until he was five and as a child suffered from a bad stammer. Being a stutterer makes you unusually attuned to language and Mitchell has described how, in the playground, he would think ahead to avoid words he could stammer over, coming up with posh-sounding options that would, in turn, elicit mockery from his fellow pupils. Thus he gained an early insight into the pitfalls of speech, its nuances and social gradations. Mitchell&apos;s early literary efforts consisted of poems for the parish magazine. He went to Kent University (and stayed on for an MA in postmodernism), after which he spent a while working at Waterstone&apos;s. He lived in London for a couple of years before moving to Hiroshima, where he stayed for seven years, combining working as a foreign language teacher with writing. He met his wife, Keiko, in Japan and they had a daughter before moving, in 2003, to southern Ireland, where they still live (they now have a second child). Mitchell is not a writer who in any way courts fame and he keeps himself detached from the literary scene. He conveys the impression of being almost monk-like in his dedication to writing; it is, for him, virtually a religious calling. But Mitchell doesn&apos;t work exclusively on novels; he has recently found time to write the libretto for the Dutch composer Klaas de Vries&apos;s opera WAKE, which will have its premiere in the Netherlands next month. Japan has been a huge influence, both personally and in terms of his artistic development. It has provided him with a subject but, more broadly, he has written of the appeal of being an &quot;alien among natives&quot;, of living in a society where he could never hope to fit in, where he had to &quot;kiss my sense of social belonging goodbye&quot;. This sense of detachment, Mitchell said, encouraged him as a writer; lacking a firm sense of &quot;citizenship in the real world&quot;, he had to &quot;stake out a life in the country called writing&quot;. And he has made that country an extraordinarily rich, variegated place; as one critic pointed out, his novels &quot;contain multitudes&quot;. But Mitchell&apos;s nowhere man tendencies have struck others as a limitation. He is, everyone agrees, a brilliant ventriloquist, a writer with an almost unique ability to roam between settings and inhabit a range of novelistic registers. But what, exactly, does his own voice sound like? In what was one of the few less than adulatory reviews of Cloud Atlas, the novelist Philip Hensher wrote: &quot;I still couldn&apos;t say that I could identify a page of prose as Mitchell&apos;s.&quot; The American critic Laura Miller, another Mitchell sceptic, agrees that his work has been shackled by an overreliance on aping the styles of others. &quot;The feeling with his early novels, particularly Ghostwritten, was: why am I reading a Murakami pastiche when I could be reading Murakami?&quot; Yet for his legions of devoted fans, such concerns miss the point. To them, Mitchell is the nearest thing to a magician that contemporary literature has to offer, someone whose work, at its best, has a belief-defying quality that can only be marvelled at. As Humphrys puts it: &quot;I don&apos;t quite know how he does it. Technically, I suppose a lot of his books shouldn&apos;t work, because he creates these incredibly implausible scenarios, but he always gets away with it.&quot; The good news for his fans is that Mitchell, who is still only 41, will probably be getting away with it for quite some time to come. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2010.

The haul of minke whales and a single finback was well down on last year&apos;s catch of 680. The fleet said Sea Shepherd&apos;s attempts to sabotage the hunt had deprived it of 31 days&apos; whaling. The annual confrontation between the two groups reached its height in January with the sinking of Sea Shepherd&apos;s high-tech powerboat, the Ady Gil, after a collision with the Shonan Maru 2 harpoon boat. The speedboat&apos;s skipper, Peter Bethune, later boarded the Shonan Maru 2 to carry out a citizen&apos;s arrest of the captain and hand over a \u00a32m bill for the destruction of the Ady Gil. The 45-year-old New Zealander could face a lengthy prison term after being indicted by Japanese authorities on five charges, including trespassing and assault. The whalers used water canon and a sonic crowd control device to deter Sea Shepherd, whose crew responded by hurling rancid-butter bombs. The whaling fleet&apos;s leader, Shigetoshi Nishiwaki, said he was &quot;furious&quot; with Sea Shepherd for preventing it from reaching its quota during the five-month season. &quot;They say they protect the sea, but they don&apos;t care about leaking oil or leaving pieces of a boat behind,&quot; he said, in a reference to the stricken Ady Gil. This winter&apos;s catch fell one short of the total for 2006-7 season, when the fleet returned home early after a fire broke out aboard the Nissin Maru. Japan is permitted to slaughter the whales for &quot;scientific research&quot; thanks to a clause in the International Whaling Commission&apos;s 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling. As the commission prepares to meet in Morocco in June, Japan has proposed scaling back its Antarctic hunts in return for permission to step up its coastal whaling activities. Australia, which opposes the move, has threatened to take Japan to the international court of justice unless its ends its annual hunts in the Southern Ocean, in the Antarcatic region. The whale wars will continue in Japan with the resumption of the trial of two Greenpeace activists charged with theft and trespassing while investigating alleged embezzlement by the whaling fleet. Toru Suzuki and Junichi Sato could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. A ruling is expected in June. Greenpeace said yesterday it had called on Japanese authorities to reopen an investigation into its allegations of widespread corruption in the programme. &quot;Our initial allegations have been repeatedly upheld by industry insiders,&quot; Sato said. &quot;It is time for the cover-ups, the lies, the corruption and the squandering of taxpayers&apos; money to end.&quot; The group said negligible demand for whale meat in Japan had created a 4,455-ton stockpile, adding that this year&apos;s catch would send another 1,800 tons into frozen storage."}, {"sentences": ["Australia has threatened to go to the international court of justice to end Tokyo&apos;s &quot;lethal research&quot; into almost 1,000 whales every winter."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Environment", "Conservation", "Iceland", "Norway", "World news", "Europe", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-15T14:18:07Z", "title": "Whale hunting deal could limit Japan's catch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/15/whale-hunting-proposal-limit-japan", "article": "The US is spearheading an attempt to limit, and possibly phase out, whale hunting by Japan, Iceland and Norway ahead of a crucial meeting of the International Whaling Commission. The proposal would allow the three countries to continue killing a smaller number of whales commercially over the next decade, with a view to ending the controversial hunts altogether, according to a report in the New York Times. The paper said that the countries would have to agree to closer monitoring of their whaling fleets, including the use of tracking devices and the presence of international observers. They would also be expected to participate in a whale DNA registry as a deterrent against illegal trade in whale meat. The newspaper cited negotiators as saying that an agreement could be reached in weeks, ahead of the IWC&apos;s annual meeting in Morocco in June. It is not clear, however, whether its 88 members would ratify the move. The compromise, which could change dramatically in the coming weeks, would force Japan, Norway and Iceland to cut their annual whale cull by about half, a move that would spare more than 5,000 whales over the next decade. &quot;This is one of the toughest negotiations I&apos;ve been involved in in 38 years,&quot; the IWC chairman, Cristian Maquieira, told the paper. &quot;If this initiative fails now, it means going back to years of acrimony.&quot; But campaigners said the proposal would do little to protect whales in the short term and did not compel the three countries to end whaling after 10 years. &quot;Countries shouldn&apos;t be looking at ways to legitimise existing loopholes in the IWC moratorium, but at closing them altogether,&quot; Willie MacKenzie, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said. &quot;Scientific whaling is being used to permit commercial whaling and whale sanctuaries are not being respected, so this compromise stands in the way of conservation. Governments that oppose whaling, including the UK, should be fighting just as hard as Japan to get their way.&quot; Any proposal that would permit Japan to continue its hunts in the Antarctic is expected to be opposed by Australia and New Zealand. Australia has threatened to go to the international court of justice to end Tokyo&apos;s &quot;lethal research&quot; into almost 1,000 whales every winter. Japan uses a loophole in the 1986 IWC moratorium on commercial whaling to kill whales for what it claims is vital scientific research. This week Japan&apos;s whaling fleet returned to port with just over half its target catch after clashes with the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd. Pressure to crack down on the illegal international market in whale meat is expected to grow after a report presented evidence that meat from Japan is being served at restaurants in South Korea and the US. In the report, published yesterday in the journal Biology Letters, scientists from Oregon State University performed DNA tests on whale meat sold since 1993 and found that some of it had come from whales slaughtered during Japan&apos;s research programme in the Antarctic. &quot;Since the international moratorium it has been assumed that there is no international trade in whale products,&quot; said Scott Baker, associate director of the university&apos;s marine mammal institute. &quot;But when products from the same whale are sold in Japan in 2007 and in Korea in 2009, it suggests that international trade, though illegal, is still an issue.&quot; Yesterday police in the South Korean capital Seoul raided a Japanese restaurant and questioned its owner on suspicion of serving illegally imported whale meat. The study suggests that meat served last year at a restaurant in Los Angeles came from a sei whale \u2013 an endangered species \u2013 that had also been sold in Japan."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s not just a dialogue between Europe and the United States but a global dialogue.&quot; Among the films vying for the prestigious Palme d&apos;Or are works by world cinematic heavyweights including Tokyo-born Takeshi Kitano and Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose Copie Conforme is his first work filmed outside his home country and stars Juliette Binoche."], "tags": ["Cannes film festival", "Film", "Mike Leigh", "Stephen Frears", "France", "World news", "Culture", "Imelda Staunton", "Woody Allen", "Oliver Stone", "Ridley Scott", "Juliette Binoche", "Europe", "Cannes 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-15T18:21:33Z", "title": "Chad and Ukraine in Palme d'Or running as Cannes field widens", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/15/cannes-film-festival-mike-leigh", "article": "Mike Leigh, the Salford-born doyen of English cinema at its grittiest, will return to the red carpet of the Croisette next month as the only British director in competition for the Palme d&apos;Or at this year&apos;s Cannes film festival.

Also flying the flag for Britain will be Stephen Frears, whose adaptation of Posy Simmonds&apos;s Guardian comic strip Tamara Drewe is to be screened out of competition along with films by Woody Allen and Oliver Stone. Ridley Scott&apos;s action-packed blockbuster Robin Hood will kick off the 63rd edition of the festival. Speaking amid the gilt mirrors and marble walls of Paris&apos;s Grand hotel, festival chief Thierry Fr\u00e9maux told the world&apos;s media that this year&apos;s selection process had been rather difficult and lengthy. But he added that, with entries from 13 countries including Chad and Ukraine, the finished lineup reflected a growing desire to broaden the festival&apos;s horizons. &quot;Our selection shows the fact that great film-making is alive in every country,&quot; said Fr\u00e9maux. &quot;It&apos;s not just a dialogue between Europe and the United States but a global dialogue.&quot; Among the films vying for the prestigious Palme d&apos;Or are works by world cinematic heavyweights including Tokyo-born Takeshi Kitano and Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose Copie Conforme is his first work filmed outside his home country and stars Juliette Binoche. And, while Cannes 2010 is shaping up promisingly for the host nation, with three French films vying for the Palme d&apos;Or and another by Nouvelle Vague hero Jean-Luc Godard, Socialisme, appearing in the Un Certain Regard category, it looks likely to be another modest year for the United States. Only one American director, Doug Liman, is in the running for the Palme d&apos;Or. His spy thriller Fair Game is based on the true story of ex-CIA officer Valerie Plame and stars Naomi Watts and Sean Penn as the outed spook and her diplomat husband. Despite months of speculation, a question mark still hangs over the eventual screening of fellow US filmmaker Terrence Malick&apos;s latest creation, which some had predicted would make it into the lineup. Fr\u00e9maux said yesterday that the The Tree of Life, starring the Hollywood power duo of Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, &quot;is not ready&quot;. But he left open the possibility that it might still be added to the programme before the festival opens on 12 May. This year&apos;s jury \u2013 to be headed by Tim Burton and made up of film figures including Kate Beckinsale and the Puerto Rican actor Benicio Del Toro \u2013 will have much to chew through with the 16 Palme d&apos;Or contenders. But it is away from the coveted group that many of the big names will be in the eye of publicity storms. Oliver Stone, whose Wall Street sequel, Money Never Sleeps, will be getting its premiere out of competition along with Frears&apos;s take on a feisty journalist&apos;s exploits in rural England. Allen, who is notoriously averse to showing his films in the official Cannes competition, will also be showing on the sidelines of the festival \u2013 although his London-filmed movie, You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, is bound to attract intense excitement on the Croisette. &quot;We tried to ask him to be in the competition for once and the answer was &apos;no&apos;,&quot; said Fr\u00e9maux. Gilles Jacob, the festival chairman, added that another invitation \u2013 this one largely symbolic \u2013 had been extended to the Iranian director Jafar Panahi to be guest of honour at the 2010 festival. Panahi, an outspoken critic of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s regime, has been in prison since his arrest in Tehran in March. The decision had been taken for Panahi&apos;s &apos;professional competencies&apos;, Jacob said, but added: &quot;From a human point of view, I believe that having him at the festival would be very good for artistic freedom.&quot; For those critics hungry for a dash of drama ahead of the opening night, yesterday&apos;s press conference provided an opportunity to delve into an ongoing battle over the event&apos;s media coverage. Angry at moves to restrict the amount of time they will be permitted to report on the festival, news agencies including Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France Presse boycotted the press conference. &quot;There is obviously no question of not doing our utmost to ensure this boycott is no longer in place when we&apos;re in Cannes,&quot; said Fr\u00e9maux. &quot;We will do everything to find a solution.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The head of sport at Tokyo Broadcast System was so impressed by the ratings for the Kamedas&apos; fights, he commented, &quot;They appear to have jumped straight out of a cartoon, and this may be fresh for fans.&quot; Presumably he was thinking of fans who hadn&apos;t already been satiating their bloodlust by watching YouTube clips of unlicensed backroom bouts between Huckleberry Hound and Deputy Dawg."], "tags": ["Boxing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-15T23:10:02Z", "title": "Touchline terrors, behold Shiro Kameda, the eastern master", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/16/shiro-kameda-boxing-father", "article": "The cultural differences between Britain and Japan may be varied and wide, but I think many UK parents will have stood on the touchline at junior football matches next to someone like Shiro Kameda. This week Mr Kameda was banned indefinitely from all Japanese boxing after directing a 30-minute &quot;epithet-laden tirade&quot; at referee Guadalupe Garc\u00eda. The verbal assault followed his son Koki&apos;s loss to Thailand&apos;s mellifluously monikered Pongsaklek Wonjongkam in a WBC world title fight. &quot;You will know what happens if you make me mad,&quot; Kameda senior allegedly yelled, &quot;I will have your head. You hear me, stupid?&quot; An indignant Garc\u00eda later told the press: &quot;I&apos;ve never received such a disgusting humiliation by anyone,&quot; which suggests that whatever else the Mexican does in his life, he shouldn&apos;t become a match official in the Northern League. The WBC also felt moved to ban Kameda senior for 90 days, president Jos\u00e9 Sulaim\u00e1n saying he could not &quot;tolerate anything tarnishing the sport&quot;, which coming from a man who has spent several decades doing business with Don King may sound a little disingenuous. Shiro Kameda, it should be said, has a bit of previous in this department. In fact he has built a reputation over the past few years that suggests that when it comes to singling out the craziest of sport&apos;s ubiquitous mad dads he is more than capable of holding his own against the likes of Damir Dokic and Jim &quot;Mary, kill the bitch&quot; Pierce, though in truth he still lags a little behind Christophe Fauviau, the Frenchman who drugged his children&apos;s tennis opponents. The Osaka-based Kameda has three boxing sons \u2013 Koki, Daiki and Tomoki (the latter excitingly nicknamed &quot;El Mexicanito&quot;) \u2013 who he has trained since boyhood in a manner apparently so rigid and frill-free it would probably have led the Spartans to phone social services. The brothers, known as &quot;the brat pack of boxing&quot;, burst on to the Japanese fight scene five years ago and quickly picked up a legion of fans who previously had shown about as much interest in pugilism as Alan Hansen does in prepositions. The head of sport at Tokyo Broadcast System was so impressed by the ratings for the Kamedas&apos; fights, he commented, &quot;They appear to have jumped straight out of a cartoon, and this may be fresh for fans.&quot; Presumably he was thinking of fans who hadn&apos;t already been satiating their bloodlust by watching YouTube clips of unlicensed backroom bouts between Huckleberry Hound and Deputy Dawg. Eldest son Daiki, another flyweight, was the first to create a stir, entering the arena dressed as a 12th-century warrior monk and celebrating victory by standing in the centre of the ring singing. According to reports this &quot;brought schoolgirls rushing&quot; to watch him. This clearly demonstrates key differences between Britain and Japan, because the schoolgirls who hang around my house dipping chocolate chip cookies in jars of marshmallow slush and making a strange puffing noise whenever I point out that they might refrain from wiping their hands on the furniture afterwards, show little desire to rush anywhere, let alone to watch some sweaty little bloke in satin shorts belting out We Are The Champions, or a monk. Whatever (you pick the language up from them, you really do), Daiki is described as having brought the attitude of US wrestling to the Japanese prizefight scene. Unfortunately he also brought some of the moves of US professional wrestling to his 2007 world title fight with Daisuke Naito \u2026 Things had got off to a bad start when Daiki described his opponent as a cockroach and pledged to ritually disembowel himself if he didn&apos;t win. When the fight started he followed up a series of low blows and elbows by picking up Naito and slamming him on to the canvas, then landing a couple of slaps to his head for good measure. All this was apparently at the urging of his dad, who was acting as his second. As I say, we&apos;ve all stood next to that sort of bloke at school football matches. Or indeed that sort of woman, because thankfully in these more liberated times being a foul-mouthed psychotic foghorn is no longer an exclusively male preserve. In fact, last month a friend of mine had to lead the Under-11 team he coaches off the field, following a pitch invasion by a mother who was menacing his side&apos;s centre-half following what she described as &quot;a right mortal fucking assault&quot; on her son for which she was going &quot;to have your pissing kneecaps&quot;. It might all have been a lot worse but, as my friend observed, since the angry mum was eight months pregnant her progress was considerably slower than that of the fleeing kids. Following the Naito scrap Shiro Kameda was banned from corner duties for life, while Daiki was suspended for a year \u2013 this despite the fact that in an act of contrition he shaved his head and apologised to his opponent. &quot;I was a bit surprised when he turned up at my house,&quot; Naito commented later with what I think we might judge admirable understatement. Now Kameda senior is gone from Japanese boxing arenas forever. Let&apos;s just hope he doesn&apos;t have any younger kids who are keen on football."}, {"sentences": ["Most Dramatic Title Of The Week  Beetle Queen Conquers Tokyo, a film lifting the rock on Japanese insect collecting."], "tags": ["Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-16T23:08:19Z", "title": "From Big Boi to Pretty Green, this week's winners and losers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/17/populist-this-weeks-winners-and-losers", "article": "Psychedelic Rap Banger Of The Week  OutKast&apos;s Big Boi returns with the ace Soul II Soul-sampling Shutterbugg.

More recently I don&apos;t, because my absence would be too noticeable. In the 60s my mother ran the Hotel International in Margate. I spent tons of time in the kitchen. I used to steal cream caramels when they came out of the fridge. When little my favourite thing to eat was a pomegranate. I&apos;d peel, take out every single seed individually, make sure all the pulp was off and then eat the hundreds of seeds one by one. I&apos;d like to be a pomegranate. My favourite cinematic food scene is of the paralysed man dreaming of eating oysters in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. The first time I had surplus income, as an artist, I bought oysters. I was 30 or 31 and I&apos;d never had one. Suddenly I&apos;d spend every spare penny on oysters. At one point I was on 70 to 100 a week. If anyone really wants to seduce me, a picnic is the way to go. I fantasise about them and when I see old-fashioned hampers I get a wave of nostalgia for something I&apos;ve never had. I own a couple myself but I&apos;ve never used them. I just stroke them. I find it really difficult eating cute things. I mean, I never eat rabbit. Even when Mark Hix makes me his [rabbit and crayfish] Stargazy Pies, I can&apos;t have rabbit in it. Stuck on my fridge is a magnet which says &quot;Foie Gras is Cruel&quot;.

When falling in love I always imagine what I would cook for the person and how this culinary foreplay would work, but nine times out of 10 it ends in disaster. It&apos;s because of wishing everything to be perfect, when all I really want is a good shag. I was in Japan, on the outskirts of Tokyo, with Nic Serota [director of the Tate], and he said, &quot;Tracey, tell me you&apos;re not going to eat that.&quot; And as I said &quot;Yeah&quot; I looked down and it was dark and it was alive.

Irons could reprise his mittel-European accent from Die Hard with a Vengeance, while Nighy \u2013 soign\u00e9, snake-hipped and with the air of a potentially very naughty boy \u2013 can turn the knees of women of a certain age to jelly. These thoughts occur to me as the beaming baron sweeps across the floor of his auction house in a tailored blue suit with matching silk tie. &quot;Yes, it is true I am a baron, but nobody ever calls me that, apart from the BBC,&quot; he says, shaking my hand, his incessant rictus smile hardening. Behind him are nine urinals, sitting in a row. His fate, it transpires, is bound up with theirs. The baron biopic would start in Basel 58 years ago, with the birth of a boy to a mother who is Switzerland&apos;s leading expert in ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging, and a father who is a pharmaceutical magnate. That boy&apos;s passion for art whisks him to Tokyo, London, Monte Carlo and New York, as he becomes not just an art expert but the greatest auctioneer of his age: the so-called Man with the Golden Gavel. It will tell of his friendships with the great art collectors of the day, including Charles Saatchi, and of his love life: two marriages, plus intervening dalliances with socialites. The film&apos;s final scenes haven&apos;t yet been written; whether the story ends happily or in calamity depends, in part, on these urinals. They are no ordinary sanitaryware, but an installation called Russian Revolutionary Porcelain, by Alexander Kosolapov. Together they are expected to fetch up to \u00a3180,000 when De Pury brings the gavel down on them later this week. The urinals are one of 450 lots that De Pury \u2013 chairman and chief auctioneer of the world&apos;s third-largest auction house, Phillips de Pury \u2013 hopes to sell for as much as \u00a313m at the Saatchi gallery, in a themed sale of contemporary art called Bric. This stands for Brazil, Russia, India and China, and the auction could be a coup or a disaster. One reason to fear the latter is that the art market has hardly been immune from recession and remains jittery. But De Pury argues that the slump, while painful, is now over. &quot;From October 2008 to June 2009, the market was at rock bottom,&quot; he says. &quot;Major lots of fantastic quality failed to sell.&quot; Among them was Takashi Murakami&apos;s 23ft Buddha figure, Mr Pointy (it sounded classier under its Japanese name, Tongari-kun), which was estimated to fetch \u00a33.5m but failed to raise a single bid in October 2008. The following February, the baron had to withdraw a Jeff Koons vitrine filled with basketballs and footballs. It was expected to fetch around \u00a32.2m but failed to attract any interest. &quot;Let me tell you we weren&apos;t the only ones who suffered,&quot; says the baron. Auctions collapsed at Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s, too. Few wanted to repeat the Koons or Murakami debacles, so clients began to ask De Pury to broker discreet private sales. &quot;I have always been happy to do so, since that way I can place an item in the hands of a collector who I know would appreciate it, which is clearly not the case at auction.&quot; The baron is adept at smilingly applying positive spin. Euphoria for a $29m Picasso  The other risk when it comes to this latest auction is that De Pury&apos;s big idea to beat the recession \u2013 to curate themed auctions, Bric being the sixth of a projected 18 \u2013 has not always worked. Last month, there was one called Sex. Of the 271 erotic-themed contemporary lots, only 69% sold, and the auction made only 78% of the pre-sale estimate. The word &quot;flaccid&quot; was used in several reports of the event. This is hardly a word that has haunted De Pury&apos;s career. Rather, they call him the Mick Jagger of auctioneers, the man with a reputation for making sale rooms around the world fizz with wild bids. When I ask him how many millions of art he has sold in a 40-year career, De Pury says he isn&apos;t sure, but takes me through the big moments, including those giddy six-and-a-half minutes at Sotheby&apos;s in 1995 when he sold Picasso&apos;s blue period masterpiece The Absinthe Drinker, to the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation \u2013 not for the $12m pre-sale estimate, but for an astounding $29.1m. &quot;It was quite difficult to get bids. Then there was euphoria afterwards. It was a wonderful moment.&quot; The foundation is selling it in June, for an estimated \u00a340m. &quot;These are not the most exciting moments,&quot; says De Pury, however. &quot;What I get a kick out of is making the value of contemporary artists I love rise. Richard Prince [the American painter] used to sell for \u00a330-70,000. Now his works sell for up to $10m, and he has had a big retrospective at the Guggenheim. I am especially proud of this.&quot; He prefers to be taste-maker rather than money-maker? &quot;I prefer both.&quot; He doesn&apos;t baulk when I liken him to Saatchi. &quot;The difference is Charles is faster that anyone else. He has deep pockets, too.&quot; True, but De Pury&apos;s are hardly shallow: the Saatchi Gallery has free admission because the baron&apos;s auction house bankrolls it. De Pury&apos;s most lucrative years may, however, be behind him. His auction house is now regularly described by the FT and New York Times as &quot;struggling&quot;. But De Pury is bullish, at least in public; he can&apos;t afford to be otherwise. &quot;Last week in New York, I was at the rostrum for seven hours without a break. There was so much bidding, we had to get extra phones. I could only have a furtive KitKat under the rostrum to sustain me.&quot; He\u00a0was auctioning 318 works from the estate of Nina Abrams, late wife of publisher Harry N Abrams. The collection fetched $6m, twice the estimate. And the auction was a &quot;white-glove&quot; event, meaning every lot sold. &quot;I don&apos;t think the market is as jittery as you suggest,&quot; says the baron, his smile hardening again. &quot;It is rebounding, chiefly because of the worry of inflation and what may happen to financial markets. Art is not a bad thing to invest in. Historically, it has outperformed most other asset types.&quot; One of Phillips de Pury&apos;s out- performing assets is the baron himself. He approaches the rostrum with an elegant, leggy gait. Then there&apos;s the voice: as we talk, his Swiss vowels mingle with excited saliva as his best sentences build to an excitable conclusion. If only he&apos;d brought his gavel along to the interview: he could have clinched all those declarations with a pound of the table. The baron is multilingual: he can electrify an auction in English, French, German, Italian and Russian. Does it still give him a thrill? &quot;It does \u2013 but even after so many years I feel nervous before each one. It&apos;s a high-wire act: you can&apos;t prepare, you have to improvise. What I try to do is to create excitement.&quot; Does this excitement effectively ratchet up the prices? &quot;Perhaps. But I think of myself as the cream, or the dessert, or a goalscorer \u2013 behind which is a whole team of experts.&quot; What about those auctions where nothing meets the pre-sale estimate? &quot;You must remain cheerful and not pass on one&apos;s feeling of gloom to the audience.&quot; As a teenager, De Pury wanted to be an artist, but became an auctioneer instead. He proved adept, rising from Swiss auction houses to Sotheby&apos;s in London in 1974. Twelve years later, after spells elsewhere, he became Sotheby&apos;s chief auctioneer then, in 1997, he left again to open galleries in Geneva and Zurich. &quot;Sotheby&apos;s had become large and bureaucratic,&quot; he explains. The washbasin wedding invite In 2000, he was approached by Frenchman Bernard Arnault. Arnault had just bought the auction house Phillips, aiming to break Sotheby&apos;s and Christie&apos;s stranglehold, and thought the baron was just the man to help. It didn&apos;t work: Arnault&apos;s money ran out and so De Pury, who took a majority share of the business, refocused the house as boutique auctioneers, specialising in contemporary art, jewellery and design. That did work: during the noughties&apos; boom, he led Phillips to remarkable success. In one afternoon in 2006, he brought down the gavel on $40m of art. In 2008, the company was purchased by the Russia-based Mercury group, with De Pury remaining as chairman. In a recent BBC4 documentary, De Pury&apos;s Russian paymasters were caught looking glum as he failed to sell another lot for its reserve price. The subtext was that the Russians might be losing patience. Is the firm in trouble? &quot;Not at all! I&apos;m very optimistic. The art market is resilient. I have been through several recessions. I feel confident we will continue to do well.&quot; Clearly, though, a lot is riding on Bric. De Purys senses a transition. &quot;In 1988, I was privileged to conduct the first auction in Russian since the 1917 revolution. There were 3,000 Russians there, but all the collectors were west European and American. Now many of the greatest collectors are Russian \u2013 and they are buying Russian. The westernisation of art is being replaced by easternisation.&quot; And Bric aims to capitalise on that? &quot;That is the idea.&quot; Even if the Bric sale proves as limp as Sex, the Baron Simon de Pury biopic need not end in calamity. Earlier this year, De Pury quietly got married, to a Phillips colleague. The couple announced the event with a card of Elmgreen and Dragset&apos;s Marriage, an image of two washbasins with tied waste pipes. &quot;I united my professional with my non-professional passions,&quot; says the baron. &quot;And I am more happy than I have been for a good while.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2010.

BBC executives claimed expenses totalling \u00a3173,527.04, from September to December last year, quarterly figures published by the BBC today reveal. That is down slightly on the amount in the previous quarter, when they billed the taxpayer \u00a3188,284.98. The quarterly expenses figures, which the corporation began to publish last year, show the BBC spent a total of \u00a33,561 on a hotel room in London for the Radio 3 controller, Roger Wright, during last year&apos;s annual Proms festival, the annual centrepiece of the station&apos;s schedule. Wright claimed the money for hotel accommodation in a undisclosed location from 24 July-26 August. A BBC spokeswoman said that the hotel room was booked because Wright does not live in London and many of the Proms end late at night. &quot;Roger doesn&apos;t live in London and attends every single Prom of the season including the late-night Proms that start at 10pm,&quot; the spokeswoman added. &quot;Therefore, it is sometimes necessary for him to book hotels due to Proms running late and the need for evening and early morning meetings relating to the production of the Proms.&quot; The expenses figures come as the BBC revealed its commercial arm BBC Worldwide shelled out \u00a36,000 for a flight to bring the director general, Mark Thompson, back from a business deal in Australia. After bills of \u00a3638.73 and \u00a3538.45 on cars during a trip to in Palo Alto last June, the latest wave of expenses to be claimed by BBC management, published today, reveals Huggers has continued his penchant for taxi travel. He has, however, reduced his bill from quarter to quarter \u2013 spending \u00a34380.53, compared with \u00a35010.52 in the second quarter of 2009. Expenses for October to December 2009 show Huggers required transportation for him and his team during their four-day stay at the InterContinental Grand in Seoul. Also on the trip was Thompson, who spent \u00a3335 on a dinner for six with the Japanese state broadcaster, NHK, in Tokyo. In November, Thompson also took a trip to Australia to do business on behalf of Worldwide, which included a return flight costing an astonishing \u00a36,005.50. A BBC spokesman said of Thompson&apos;s Australia trip: &quot;This flight was business class. The cost was fully paid by BBC Worldwide as part of a trip to visit Worldwide businesses in Australia, so no licence fee funds were used.&quot; The BBC spokesman added: &quot;The cost of the car for Erik and the team of three during their trip to Seoul covered four days. During the trip they attended various meetings and hiring a car allowed them to maximise their time during a busy schedule by planning for meetings during their stay and conducting confidential business.&quot; At the other end of the scale Thompson spent \u00a395.85 on parking meters, including 10 worth 75p. His only gifts and hospitality accepted were to chef and BBC presenter Raymond Blanc&apos;s 60th birthday party and a dinner at two Michelin-starred restaurant the Ledbury with consultants McKinsey. Thompson did not incur many lunch expenses during the quarter but he did take Terry Wogan for lunch at a cost of \u00a3113.34 before the veteran DJ left his Radio 2 morning show. The expenses claim also shows that Alan Yentob, the BBC&apos;s creative director, travelled business class from London to New York in September last year to film part of his &quot;Imagine&quot; arts series for BBC1. The return flight cost \u00a33,381. The BBC also paid \u00a33,810.40 for a business class flight to Los Angeles for the controller of drama commissioning, Ben Stephenson, in November 2009 for a series of meeting with US studios about co-productions. The corporation said that on both trips, the executives concerned went directly into meetings. &quot;Upon arrival, Ben went straight into production meetings,&quot; a spokeswoman said. Yentob &quot;attended back to back meetings and was filming for Imagine&quot;. The BBC also met accomodation costs of \u00a33,600 for Nic Newman, its future media &amp; technology controller for journalism at the BBC, who attended a three-month course in Oxford during an unpaid sabbatical. The BBC Vision director, Jana Bennett, took 101 cabs over the quarter \u2013 fewer than the 109 clocked up by chief operating Caroline Thomson last spring. Bennett&apos;s expenses included \u00a3942.62 worth of taxis in just under a month last November, due mostly to having to attend senior management meetings over two days. A BBC spokesman said: &quot;As the director of BBC Television, Jana Bennett&apos;s diary is incredibly busy so she has to use her time as efficiently as possible. &quot;Whenever she is travelling to meetings she will schedule in a number of business calls to make the best use of this travel time.\u00a0Because of the confidential nature of these discussions it is not possible to hold them in public.&quot; It was a quiet quarter for gifts and hospitality for leading BBC executives. The BBC director of audio and music, Tim Davie, and the BBC&apos;s chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson, received no gifts or hospitality, and Bennett only a ticket to see Julius Caesar following a Royal Shakespeare Company AGM, while the BBC Vision director of operations, Bal Samra, was given two Chelsea FC tickets by BBC Sport and six Top Gear Live tickets from BBC Worldwide. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

BMW spokesman Mathias Schmidt said production would be halted at plants in Dingolfing, Regensburg and Munich. Schmidt said that some 7,000 vehicles would be affected, but that management was in talks with the employee council to ensure that &quot;this delayed production is made up for as soon as possible&quot;. He said the carmaker did not expect any losses and would try to ensure that car deliveries to customers were not delayed. Another Japanese manufacturer, laptop maker Fujitsu, cannot ship its latest models into Europe, but it expects that its stockpiles will last until flights resume.

With the continuing travel chaos caused by Iceland&apos;s volcanic eruptions, organisers were faced with the nightmare of fielding a severely diminished start list. The men&apos;s race was most under threat with the world&apos;s biggest names based in Kenya and Ethiopia, but organisers have managed to put alternative travel arrangements in place and chartered a private plane from Nairobi \u2013 with a stopover in Djibouti \u2013 to land in Barcelona. From there the party of east African runners, which includes last year&apos;s champion Sammy Wanjiru, the world champion Abel Kirui and the three-time world half-marathon champion Zersenay Tadese, will travel overland to London should the flight ban still be in operation. The women&apos;s race has also been affected with Britain&apos;s Mara Yamauchi, last year&apos;s impressive runner-up, caught up in the chaos. Yamauchi, who finished sixth at the Olympic Games in 2008, had the foresight to book a flight from her home in Tokyo into Madrid at the weekend, but then faced a two-day journey by road and rail with her coach and husband to reach London. The defending champion, Germany&apos;s Irina Mikitenko, will travel by car from her home in central Germany, but Deena Kastor of the US as well as several Japanese runners face an agonising wait to find out whether they will be able to fly into the UK in time. All of the runners involved in extended travel arrangements are likely to encounter increased fatigue in Sunday&apos;s race. That could potentially increase Britain&apos;s chances in the men&apos;s race \u2013 an event that has not been won by a Briton since 1993 \u2013 with Andrew Lemoncello, making his London marathon debut this year, and Dan Robinson, who finished 11th at the 2007 world championships, hoping to figure prominently.

How much the hours spent travelling instead of adhering to the strict regime that more commonly occurs tapering down for a marathon will impact on their performances is incalculable. Today, in London, even the athletes seemed uncertain. &quot;I&apos;m so tired,&quot; said the Olympic champion, and last year&apos;s London winner, Sammy Wanjiru. &quot;I&apos;m a little worried now [about the race] but after a good sleep I will start to look forward to it. Although training has gone well and I have prepared the best I can, I feel a little unsure about how I will do this time,&quot; he said. Wanjiru, along with his Kenyan compatriots \u2013 the world champion, Abel Kirui, and Duncan Kibet \u2013 arrived in London three days before the race because of the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud. The trio, along with 21 other East African athletes, were put on a private plane at a cost of \u00a3110,000 to organisers, on a journey that began in Nairobi and included stops in Asmara, Djibouti, Luxor and Madrid before arriving in London. &quot;The problem affected everybody but the organisers were very good. We used a jet to get from Kenya to get here, otherwise we wouldn&apos;t have been able to make it,&quot; said Wanjiru. The Kenyans have vowed to work as a team to bring about a potential seventh consecutive London marathon victory, with Kibet \u2013 who became the second fastest marathoner in history when he won the Rotterdam marathon last year \u2013 revealing that the trio plan to run together for 21.8 miles of the 26.2-mile course. Kibet broke his leg, aged 16, and was told by doctors that he would never walk \u2013 let alone run \u2013 again. Wanjiru is the favourite of the three to win, but his doubts over his performance may not be solely down to the long journey that has hampered his preparation. The 24-year\u2011old talked about a back injury that kept him from training in January. &quot;When I run I feel comfortable and happy, but I&apos;m unsure what will happen this time,&quot; he said. &quot;I stopped training for three weeks and couldn&apos;t do any speed work. But now I feel good and I&apos;ve been training very well.&quot; Wanjiru&apos;s victory last year set a course record in 2hr 5min 10sec, but the Kenyan says he wants to run faster. &quot;I can run faster than last year, 2:04 is possible. But I&apos;m not thinking about the world record, just the course record. There will be teamwork between us [Kenyans]. But if I don&apos;t win I think Tsegaye Kebede will, he&apos;s very strong and was second last year.&quot; The Ethiopian Kebede outlined how he was looking forward to taking on the Olympic champion. &quot;One can&apos;t run alone,&quot; said the 23-year-old, &quot;in order to win you must run with somebody. Wanjiru being there encourages me to push more.&quot; In the women&apos;s race Irina Mikitenko&apos;s journey from central Germany did not quite rival Briton Mara Yamauchi&apos;s six-day odyssey across the Atlantic and overland through Europe but the two \u2013 who last year finished in first and second place respectively \u2013 are set to duel again.

For those who enjoy lying around getting red-hot, there are the Paris-Plages from mid-July to mid-August, when stretches of the river Seine between the Pont Neuf and the Pont de Sully, and the Bassin de la Villette are transformed into oases of sun and sand. But for blue sky and balmy blooms, I prefer to take a leisurely stroll on the two-and-a-half mile Promenade Plant\u00e9e, which runs from the Bastille, along a former railway viaduct, Viaduc des Arts (now full of craft boutiques, galleries and workshops), to the Bois de Vincennes. If I have any energy after that, the Bois de Vincennes has a zoo, floral park and boating on the lake. It&apos;s also the ideal spot for a lazy picnic lunch. The Promenade Plant\u00e9e features in the 2004 movie Before Sunset, as does cosy Le Pure Caf\u00e9 (14, rue Jean Mac\u00e9) in the 11th arrondissement, my favourite untouristy spot to sit outdoors with a cold drink. In the best pavement cafe stakes, a close contender is Chez Prune on rue Beaurepaire, where &quot;bobo&quot; (bourgeois/bohemian) regulars rub elbows on the peaceful banks of the Canal Saint Martin, with its metallic Venetian-style footbridges. When I want to sit quietly and crack open a bottle of wine, I head for the Ar\u00e8nes de Luteces, the remains of a Greco-Roman amphitheatre, the oldest archaeological site in Paris, tucked away off rue Monge in the Latin Quarter. Last time I was there, on one side some old men were playing boules, and on the other a group of women were improvising an operatic lesbian version of Star Wars in French. Free theatre, in short. At Paris&apos;s prettiest cinema, La Pagode (57, rue de Babylone), you can enjoy a glass of champagne in a lush Japanese-style garden full of lilies and bamboo. The cinema itself is a late-19th-century Japanese palace with paintings, gilding, tapestries, stained glass and chandeliers. But if the temperatures are getting too much, cool off in the Ice Bar at L&apos;H\u00f4tel Kube (1-5 Passage Ruelle, in the 18th arrondissment). Here you can sip potent vodka in a refrigerated multi-coloured room at a numbing -10C (don&apos;t worry: sessions last just 30 minutes and parkas are provided.) In summer, Paris offers something for lovers of all sorts of music. On 21 June, the whole city thrums and booms from dusk to dawn at the unmissable (and free) F\u00eate de la Musique with multicultural ear candy at every bar, square and street corner, from lonesome crooners to world-class rock stars. The less-vaunted Paris Jazz Festival takes place every Saturday and Sunday in June and July, in the Park Floral, part of the Bois de Vincennes. This year, in addition to the main stage of jazz events, there&apos;ll be a &quot;garden of improvisations&quot; for more intimate recitals, musical landscaping and intuitive dancing. There&apos;s no denying the Gypsy jazz buzz in Paris right now. One atmospheric hot spot is La Chope des Puces (122, rue Rosiers, +33 1 4011 0249) in the suburb of Saint Ouen \u2013 if you haven&apos;t shopped till you drop at the massive nearby flea market. And on rue Boyer in the 20th arrondissement are two more other savvy concert venues with eclectic programming of contemporary music: La Bellevilloise (19-21, rue Boyer, +33 1 4636 0707) was formerly Paris&apos;s first workers&apos; co-operative; and La Maroquinerie (23, rue Boyer +33 1 4033 3505, lamaroquinerie.fr) was once a leather workshop. Both have charming terraces where you can enjoy cocktails and tapas. This summer I will be seeking out cabaret \u2013 red velvet and carved wood, glittering lights, bevelled mirrors and glorious ballrooms. Cabaret Sauvage on avenue Jean Jaur\u00e8s (+33 1 4209 1378, cabaretsauvage.com) hosts world music, electro, techno, hip-hop, jazz, folk, funk, rock and reggae. Bobino (14-20 rue de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9, +33 1 4327 2424), a sexy offbeat option in Montparnasse, features a dinner show and dancers, magicians and illusionists performing into the early hours. The repertoire of open-air La P\u00e9niche Op\u00e9ra (+33 1 5335 0777, penicheopera.com) ranges from contemporary and opera to chamber, comedy and cantatas \u2014 all performed on a barge on the quai de Loire \u2013 beside the Bassin de la Villette in the 19th. Chez G\u00e9g\u00e8ne (+33 1 4883 2943) a restaurant-cum-dancehall east of the city in Joinville le Pont on the banks of the river Marne, has a more rural feel: you can eat on an outdoor terrace and dance till 2am to trad bal-musette, frenetic rock or tango. For a dose of art, as well as the major exhibitions (Turner, Munch, Yves Saint-Laurent), the recently launched Centquatre gallery (104.fr) on rue Curial, also in the 19th, is artistry at its best: a bold and energetic space complete with installations, exhibitions and open studios, not to mention readings, performances, theatre and concerts. And what would Paris be without food? Don&apos;t miss the best open-air market near Bastille \u2013 the March\u00e9 d&apos;Aligre. Choco-Story on boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, a new museum tracing the 4,000-year history of cacao in words, images and flavours (yes, you do get to sample some locally made chocolate.) And on the roof of the Palais de Tokyo modern art museum on avenue du Pr\u00e9sident Wilson, is the culinary phenomenon that is Art-Home, a temporary restaurant where scrumptious experimental food is prepared by a master chef before guests&apos; eyes, if they can tear them away from the stunning views of the Eiffel Tower. \u2022 Return rail tickets from London St Pancras to Paris cost from \u00a369 with Eurostar Sarah Emily Miano is an American-born writer living in Paris.

No matter how hard I run, I always miss the boat. Or rather, the ballot. This Sunday&apos;s the Virgin London Marathon and, having dutifully applied for my lottery-style place in good time, I&apos;ve lost out for the fourth year in a row. But it&apos;s a wildly popular event and the annual applications of about 100,000 hopefuls are swamping the available places, which number about 32,000, composed of elite athletes, club runners, individual enthusiasts and fun runners and first-timers dressed in banana costumes, hippo suits, Santa outfits, clown regalia and, once, a full copper diving suit complete with globe-like helmet. The event is famous not only on the pro-athlete circuit but also in terms of the money it can raise for a range of excellent causes. When I&apos;m not doing it I watch the television coverage and I always cry when the first winners complete. Having missed out on London, I may turn my attention towards some really long events such as the Marathon Des Sables (multiple marathons in the desert) or the Nijmegen Marches (multiple marathons along Dutch mountains). Endurance events are addictive and, like DD Guttenplan, nothing \u2013 not even a cloud of volcanic ash obscuring the very skies in an apocalyptic display of Gaia&apos;s chagrin \u2013 quite beats the compulsion to do them or the feeling of bone-deep power and strength which they give. The buzz lasts for days. The speed at which marathons as far afield as Honolulu, the North Pole, Tokyo, the famous New York event in November, Chicago and Boston fill up is a testament to how many enthusiasts there are. Relatively recent distance events such as the MoonWalk and the Run to the Beat and London Parks half-marathons counteract, partly, the standard contention that we are a lazy species suffering an obesity crisis and will shortly disappear in a layer of abdominal flub and cheese-filled pizza crust. I&apos;m built like an Olympic athlete, complete with six-pack and proper delts (and I can fraudulently say that because you can&apos;t see me to verify it!), but appearance is no gauge of fitness. A few years ago, I found myself starting the race alongside Fauja Singh, the stick-thin 98-year-old man (then 93) famous for his marathon endurance. I thought to myself, with ageist arrogance, that at least I wouldn&apos;t be the very last person crossing the finish line. Sometime around mile six he gently overtook me, smiling and waving at his many supporters along the route, and with tiny, featherlight steps he drifted into the distance far ahead, breezing past us all. I never saw him again. What a legend. Still, being as slow as me means you have a lot of time to think. Here are a few things I&apos;ve learned. First of all, relax everything, slow down, keep your chin down and shoulders loose, listen to your body and enjoy yourself. Sounds obvious, but you&apos;d be amazed how many people shoot away from the start line, gurning and grunting, every muscle tense, only to find that by mile 10 they have a stitch and have pulled all their muscles. A marathon course is more than 26 miles long. Never rush the first third. Drink little and often and never, ever change your routine close to the race. No new foods, new trainers, new &quot;lucky&quot; vest, nothing. Do what suits your body type \u2013 some people are fuelled by brown rice and pasta and others (like me) find that carbs weigh them down and don&apos;t satisfy. If anyone offers you a sweet during the race, don&apos;t take it \u2013 it may not agree with you and you might have a little accident of the spontaneous evacuation variety. Fruit&apos;s fine. Don&apos;t pace or judge yourself according to the people around you \u2013 you don&apos;t know when they started, whether they&apos;re seasoned athletes or if, two miles down the road, they&apos;re going to stop dead and drop out. Don&apos;t be distracted by what&apos;s going on around you and follow your own plan in accordance with your training. I think sports competitiveness is laughable among us ordinary folk. Elite athletes are fatless, footloose and fast. They are a supreme breed. They are not lumpy, and they do this for a living. They don&apos;t just go down to their local gym after work \u2013 the do things like high-altitude training for six hours at a time. You will never, ever, ever be Abdelkader El Mouaziz, Paul Tergat or Haile Gebrselassie, chaps. And, ladies, we will never be Paula Radcliffe, Derartu Tulu or Gete Wami, more&apos;s the pity. If it&apos;s hot, as it&apos;s forecast to be this Sunday, wear as little as possible and limber up thoroughly. Overheating and dehydration are agony and too-heavy clothes can grate like heavy iron after a while. Keep drinking and ducking under the showers along the route. Afterwards, a proper warm-down will save your life. Don&apos;t crash out. Keep walking, keep moving and do proper deep, slow stretches, muscle group by muscle group, to break down the lactic acid you&apos;ve built up. Eat something bland and, if you buy a hot drink, let it cool down to just above body temperature, just in case your stomach&apos;s feeling delicate. Then admire your medal as it glints in the light. Good luck to everyone who&apos;s running in the London Marathon this year.

But it is the life journey of the 36-year-old, who began her career as a full-time athlete six years ago, that has been the more extraordinary. Since giving up her job at the British Embassy in Tokyo the Oxford-born runner, who now lives in Japan, has steadily improved her personal best from 2hr 39min 16sec, at her first competitive London Marathon in 2004, to 2:23:12 when she finished second in London last year. Along the way she has posted a sixth place at the Beijing Olympics \u2013 equalling the best performance by a British woman \u2013 and a Commonwealth Games bronze medal. Slowly, from such unlikely beginnings, Yamauchi has forged an identity as a British marathon runner to be mentioned in the same breath as Paula Radcliffe.

If other people ask me about her I&apos;ll reply but I try not to think about other athletes to be honest. &quot;I&apos;d love to race against her, she&apos;s a fantastic athlete,&quot; Yamauchi says when asked if she is disappointed that Radcliffe, who has announced a pause in her career for her second pregnancy, will not compete tomorrow. &quot;I&apos;ve raced her years ago, but not recently,&quot; she says, before acknowledging that &quot;years ago&quot; a race between herself and Radcliffe was a completely different proposition. &quot;A few years ago [in London] in 2005 I finished 10th and she won so the results then were a lot different to what they are now.&quot; Ian Stewart, Britain&apos;s head of endurance, says he sees more similarities than differences between the two women. &quot;Mara&apos;s very similar to Paula in the detailed way that she prepares for races. They put a huge amount of time and thought and effort into how they prepare. I think Mara&apos;s as good as anybody in the world in that regard, no question.&quot; A training injury last May prevented Yamauchi from competing at the World Championships, and a strong return at the full distance \u2013 she has won a half marathon in New York this year \u2013 could be significant. &quot;London&apos;s a huge race for Mara,&quot; Stewart says, &quot;and we would love her to win it. I&apos;m not a &apos;you&apos;ve got to run this time or that time&apos; because the weather is such a major factor. But the biggest thing is hopefully she&apos;ll win it this year, and if you look at her half marathon a few weeks ago she&apos;s in a position to do that. &quot;It&apos;s very important race in her career, but if it doesn&apos;t go as well as maybe we&apos;d hoped its not the end of the world. It&apos;s not the Olympics. You have to put it into perspective, 2012 has got to be a long term goal at the moment.&quot; And should that long-term goal materialise, how pleased would he be to field two world-class British marathon runners? &quot;It would be absolutely fantastic,&quot; Stewart says, &quot;if we can get Mara and Paula to the startline in London, and in great shape, then I don&apos;t see why we couldn&apos;t get both of them on the podium.&quot; What does Yamauchi think of her own Olympic medal chances? &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m aiming for,&quot; she says, beaming."}, {"sentences": ["Sumo Grand Champion set to bloom at Chelsea The AFP in Tokyo raised eyebrows last week when it quoted an un-named source revealing that the recently retired Sumo grand champion, Asashoryu, is set to pursue a new and somewhat unlikely career path with a plan to take part in next month&apos;s Chelsea Flower Show.", "Problems came to a head in February, when he retired following allegations he had attacked a man outside a Tokyo nightclub \u2013 an incident the wrestler&apos;s stable master said he could not remember, because he was too drunk."], "tags": ["Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-24T23:10:01Z", "title": "Vomit-gate swamps Philadelphia Phillies fans", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/25/philadelphia-phillies-vomit-baseball", "article": "Already saddled with a reputation for being, at best, boisterous and, at worse, boorish and violent, fans of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team have suffered another PR disaster over the past week, as one of their number is accused of deliberately vomiting over an off-duty police officer and his 11-year\u2011old daughter during a game. The Philadelphia Daily News, under the headline: &quot;Condemnation erupts over ballpark barf case&quot; reports how Matthew Clemmens allegedly &quot;cursed, spilled beer and even spat either on Michael Vangelo or his two daughters&quot; then: &quot;announced his intent to vomit, stuck fingers down his throat and directed the stream toward Vangelo and his younger daughter.&quot; He has since been dubbed &quot;Pukemon&quot;.

Fifa issued a warning of sanctions after a suit was filed in an Abuja High Court by Dr Sam Jaja over his disqualification from the Nigeria Premier League board elections. A former board member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Dr Jaja took legal action after opponents barred him from contesting the elections, and Fifa does not approve of football federations being in court. Fifa statutes require that all football matters should be settled outside the law courts, and NFF spokesman Ademola Olajire says they have been sent a statement explaining the governing body&apos;s position: &quot;We request the Nigeria Football Federation to ask for an immediate withdrawal of the claim and, in case of non-compliance by the claimant, to take sanction against him. We remind you that if the NFF does not comply ... that violation of obligations by any member may lead to sanctions.&quot; Olajire believes the threat of Nigeria being banned from football and being unable to compete in the World Cup is real. &quot;It is clear that one man&apos;s ambition is threatening the country&apos;s World Cup participation, as Fifa&apos;s sanction is usually in the form of suspension of a member association,&quot; he said. The national squad, which includes several Premier League players, is preparing to hold a training camp in England, and the NFF president, Sani Lulu, and coach Lars Lagerback are addressing dissatisfaction with the proposed Super Eagles&apos; base camp in Durban. Nigerian daily NEXT confirms that the chief executive officer of the 2010 organising Committee, Danny Jordaan, has agreed that Nigeria are free to change their base camp if unhappy. &quot;We have 46 base camps and Nigeria can choose whichever they want,&quot; he said.

The Mongolian-born Asashoryu (literally, Blue Dragon of the Morning) had a remarkable career, winning 25 Emperor&apos;s Cups, the third highest in the sport&apos;s 2,000-year history but, also, in a nation where champions are expected to be societal role models, earned a reputation as its bad boy. He has been accused of continuing a fight with an opponent in the communal bath, pulling the topknot of another and was the first Grand Champion to be suspended, having pulled out of a goodwill bout due to injury, only to be filmed playing in a charity football match days later. Problems came to a head in February, when he retired following allegations he had attacked a man outside a Tokyo nightclub \u2013 an incident the wrestler&apos;s stable master said he could not remember, because he was too drunk. Asashoryu will be at the Show with the renowned Japanese gardener Kazuyuki Ishihara, an old acquaintance with whom he &quot;agreed recently to work together at Chelsea&quot; because the former champion wanted to learn about gardening. The gardener will present his design &quot;Kazahana&quot;, which means &quot;a light snow flurry from a cloudless sky&quot; at the event in May with the Blue Dragon, who has taken to horticulture and south west London, because he &quot;has dreams of creating forests in Mongolia,&quot; says the source. Real making hay as Ronaldo sales pay offJust before kick-off at the Bernab\u00e9u last week, where Real Madrid went on to defeat Valencia and come within one point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga, the club announced it had just sold its one millionth Cristiano Ronaldo No9 shirt, notes Portugal&apos;s  A Bola. The club reveals it has now sold more than 1.2m shirts (at \u20ac40 each) in the Spanish capital and that, with millions more shirts and Cristiano memorabilia purchased worldwide, they are already on their way to recouping the \u00a380m transfer fee. After his unveiling at the Bernab\u00e9u, the club shops sold 2,000 shirts in two hours, with a further 300 reportedly stolen. Real say they have generated \u00a3100m in Ronaldo-related income already, and, although it is a gross total, the figures suggest that his six-year tenure at the club will more than cover the cost in merchandising alone \u2013 quite apart from how the player performs on the pitch. Intriguingly The Times of India also picked up on the story, choosing to emphasise that the figures were higher than those of David Beckham in his first season at the club."}, {"sentences": ["A four-day Tokyo trip, for instance, might earn you \u00a3700, but you only do that about once a year."], "tags": ["Pay", "Money", "Society", "Guardian Careers", "All sectors", "Salary", "Public sector"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-24T23:10:01Z", "title": "Why money doesn't buy happiness", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/apr/25/salary-happiness-jobs-richard-reeves", "article": "In all societies,&quot; wrote James Madison, a founding father of the United States, &quot;distinctions are various and unavoidable.&quot; Human beings have always been acutely conscious of status and its signifiers. In Sparta, places in the pecking order \u2013 for men, at least \u2013 were determined by success in mortal combat; in Georgian England, ranking was by gentility and learning. Today, the principal badge of status is money, and the things money visibly buys. Britons, like our American cousins, increasingly say we &quot;make&quot; a certain amount in salary, as if wages were a physical manifestation of labour. Even though most salaries are now paid electronically, the idea of the &quot;wage packet&quot; retains its grip on our imagination. I earn, therefore I am. Since the financial crash of 2008, the issue of pay and the value we assign to it has become particularly divisive. The salaries and bonuses of bankers, predictably, have come in for notable scorn. Giving evidence to a committee of MPs, Stephen Hester, the new boss of RBS \u2013 dubbed &quot;the best-paid civil servant in the land&quot;, given the nationalisation of the bank \u2013 said: &quot;If you ask my mother and father about my pay they&apos;d say it was too high\u2026 some people close to me have that view of bankers.&quot; Hester will earn almost \u00a310m over the next three years if the bank bounces back; his dad is a chemistry professor. The public anger has become so extreme that some executives have even seen the wisdom of refusing big pay rises or bonuses \u2013 or flat-out denying that they are worth the exorbitant fees they receive. Earlier this month Sir Norman Bettison, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire police, described his own \u00a3213k salary and pension package as excessive and blasted the futile efforts of the public sector to compete with private pay levels. As the former Shell boss, Jeroen van der Veer, conceded after stepping down last year with a pension pot of $34.2m: &quot;You have to realise: if I had been paid 50% more, I would not have done it better. If I had been paid 50% less, then I would not have done it worse.&quot; For most of us though, these figures are almost impossible to conceive or evaluate. According to the Office for National Statistics, in its 2009 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the average UK salary is \u00a325,816 (or \u00a328,270 for men and \u00a322,151 for women). But money is not everything. What really intrigues us is how much our boss is getting paid. Or the guy two desks away who spends all day on Facebook and then leaves on the dot of 5.30pm. Statistics consistently show that we care less about our actual pay level than we do about earning more than our colleagues and neighbours. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University, conducted a major study that revealed we would rather be the second-best-paid person in a firm or department than the second-worst-paid \u2013 even if, in the latter case, the salary is actually higher. Rank is what really matters, not cash. The individuals interviewed for this feature are mostly a little disgruntled with their work and how they are remunerated. Many of their complaints will have a familiar ring to them. The anonymous member of the BA cabin crew bemoans how the job has changed in the 14 years she has worked for the airline. Staff reductions mean she is highly unlikely to be promoted; budget constraints ensure that many of the perks she came to expect have been removed. &quot;I&apos;m less fulfilled than I used to be, because it&apos;s become a different job,&quot; she concludes. Dave Dowling, a postman for more than half his 45 years, tells a similar story: longer hours, heavier bags of mail and &quot;a poor reward for the type of responsibility we have&quot;. Both professions have been involved in controversial strikes over the past 12 months. The good and bad guys in these disputes have been far from clear-cut. Royal Mail claimed that the action undermined the postal industry at a time when mail volumes were already plummeting by almost 10% year-on-year. British Airways stood firm, pointing out that the average salary of its cabin crew, with bonuses and allowances, was nearly \u00a330,000, double that of Virgin Atlantic and a third more than easyJet. Members of parliament, meanwhile, have faced a different set of pressures. Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, was declared by the Telegraph as one of &quot;the saints&quot; in the expenses scandal, but has found her profession discredited in many eyes. She describes her salary, a whisper under \u00a365,000, as &quot;reasonable&quot;. So, how much do we need to earn to make us happy? Work by the Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman suggests that, above a certain point, a higher wage delivers little in terms of personal wellbeing \u2013 although low pay is not good for anyone. &quot;Money does not buy you experiential happiness, but a lack of money certainly buys you misery,&quot; he says. These findings are echoed by the burgeoning research literature on happiness, suggesting that once salaries break the \u00a340,000 a year mark, there are diminishing returns in terms of wellbeing. A study by the recruitment company Jobsite.co.uk found the average employee would be more than satisfied with a salary of about \u00a338,000 a year. Of course, this figure is still a third more than the current average, but it suggests there may be a point at which people recognise that &quot;making&quot; more money is, in itself, an empty enterprise. Professions that enjoy a high status, or involve plenty of human contact, seem to generate much higher levels of happiness. In the City and Guilds biannual survey of professions, hairdressers are consistently scored as the happiest workers in the UK, despite very modest financial rewards, because of strong social ties at work and good relations with clients. (The profile of the UK&apos;s happiest worker was a 60-plus female beauty therapist living in the northeast; the least content was a builder in his mid-forties from Northern Ireland.) Other jobs that involve providing a valued service \u2013 from doctors and childcare workers to accountants \u2013 result in happier workers. John Lewis is owned by its staff and is the only major company in the UK with the happiness of its staff as its founding mission. And job satisfaction rates are indeed high in the partnership, not because of the money, but because staff have a genuine stake in the future of the organisation. Groucho Marx once quipped, &quot;What makes wage slaves? Wages!&quot; But when the workers are the paymasters, too, the slaves have taken over the plantation. This is another sign that pay has become political again. In place of the pre-1997 concern with low pay, there is now an argument raging about fair pay. The Tories have pledged to enforce a 20:1 ratio between the best-paid and lowest-paid in any public organisation \u2013 a reaction to the fact that over the past two decades, the earnings ratio between the top and bottom 20% of employees has widened from 15:1 to 75:1. Labour introduced a one-off tax on City bonuses, and a new 50p top rate. With the minimum wage removing the most egregious examples of poverty pay, attention has turned to those at the top of the pile. Some Labour MPs are calling for a maximum wage commission. A fair day&apos;s pay for a fair day&apos;s work, once a rallying cry to raise salaries at the bottom, is now a mantra for those wanting to lower pay at the top. There is no escaping the status-sensitivity of human nature, or Madison&apos;s &quot;distinctions&quot; within human societies. Pay matters, in symbol as much as size, and will do so for the foreseeable future. But our attitudes to money are at a potential tipping point. The wage packet will always be weighed, but perhaps other factors \u2013 power, happiness, respect \u2013 will now be added to the balance. Fiona Johnson: Cabin Crew, 45, \u00a325,000  I am on \u00a319,000 basic. The difference comes from flying allowances, which depend on where your trips are to. A four-day Tokyo trip, for instance, might earn you \u00a3700, but you only do that about once a year. Most of what we do is to the United States, and a Stateside night stop earns you \u00a3100. It&apos;s a huge concern that I&apos;ll never earn any more. I&apos;ve got a degree, I&apos;m well educated, and when I started I was told categorically that within two years I&apos;d be made a purser \u2013 but BA has taken two pursers off each aircraft, so now they&apos;re overcrewed and I&apos;ll never be promoted. I absolutely can&apos;t survive on any less than I&apos;m on at the moment, which is what&apos;s in the offing. It&apos;s a monthly juggling act with bills, especially because my income varies so much each month. I&apos;m always on the edge of my massive overdraft and if you&apos;re ill or on leave you only have your basic pay \u2013 so no one can afford to be sick, and I didn&apos;t go on leave for years. I&apos;m a single mum; my child was five when I started working, and no nanny would fit into my irregular working pattern, so I had to rely on friends and family. You&apos;re not at home for the school play, or the Christmas lunch. On the plus side, my child is very well travelled. I&apos;m less fulfilled than I used to be because it&apos;s become a different job. You fly with different crew every time, but you used to get a bus to the terminal together, and after the flight you were allowed to buy some drink from the aircraft so the ride to your hotel was very sociable. They&apos;ve put a stop to everything like that, and there&apos;s not that ability to gel any more: everyone&apos;s much more isolated. They&apos;ve also cut down on the length of trips and the number of crew on board, so you&apos;re more tired when you get to a destination. You spend most of your days off asleep, or trying to sleep. Dave Dowling: Postman, 45, \u00a318,200 I have always enjoyed meeting people \u2013 on a regular post round you get to know some of them pretty well and make friendships, but there&apos;s a lot of pressure now to get the job done as quickly as possible. When I first started you used to have a single bag of mail and your delivery was two and a half hours long. Now you can get six or seven bags, and it takes three and a half hours. By the time you get home you&apos;re pretty tired. You start by sorting the mail at 6am and finish around 2pm. The bags are a maximum of 16kg \u2013 most postmen cram it in to try and get it finished \u2013 and the trolleys can have anything up to 80kg of mail in them. It&apos;s physically and mentally demanding: you&apos;ve got to be concentrating all the time. If I&apos;m out on delivery and I&apos;ve got a special delivery item and I was to lose that item I could lose my job. But we get a poor reward for the type of responsibility we have. If the average pay was just over \u00a320,000, I would think I&apos;m worth at least that. When I started, our pay used to be pegged to that of a police constable. I&apos;m not saying it should be today, but that&apos;s the change that&apos;s happened. There are very limited opportunities for a delivery worker to earn extra money \u2013 for instance, through overtime. The only thing you can move on to is the management grade. But you have to be a unique person to enjoy being a postman \u2013 to go out in all weathers and do the hours we do \u2013 and most of those like the outdoor lifestyle, and wouldn&apos;t want to go into management, even if they could. The vast majority of delivery workers are the main (or only) earners in their family. I&apos;ve been doing this job 25 years and I&apos;m the sole income for my wife and seven children. We cut our cloth accordingly, and where others might go on long holidays we know we won&apos;t be able to. It&apos;s increasingly hard as the children are moving up in school, because we don&apos;t want them to miss out on anything like music lessons, trips and the other things that will give them a rounded education. But I&apos;m proud of being a postman, because of the culture and the way people view postmen. Laura Aspinall: Social Worker, 24, \u00a328,000 The job wears you down. Sometimes the children are lucky to be alive by the time I&apos;m involved. It&apos;s a 37.5-hour week. You have to be realistic and make sure the caseload isn&apos;t more than you can manage. They&apos;re changing our hours to make us more flexible as there are families we can&apos;t see in the daytime and we do work quite a few late nights. That&apos;s a good thing, but I worry about the morale of the team when we&apos;re spending more time on our own and working from home. I started on \u00a319,000, and in the first week I was doing a child welfare investigation with another worker and looking at placing the child of a drug-addicted mother at birth. As I work frontline with children and in an impoverished part of the countrywhere there&apos;s a lot of risk involved, I get a supplement of \u00a3200 a month. But I still think we&apos;re underpaid. My great frustration is that I&apos;ve been told for a long while that I&apos;m good enough to progress to the next level, and I&apos;ve taken on tasks beyond my job role, but there&apos;s no recognition of that. I just have to wait until a post becomes available. I think that happens to quite a few people: from the team I started with, I&apos;m the only social worker left, and a lot of them have left due to issues of career support and progression. We do a tough, responsible job and if that was recognised it might keep us in the job longer. The general perceptions of social work are vague and detrimental. I wish there was a drama series like The Bill or Casualty that showed what we do, the battles we&apos;re faced with procedurally, bureaucratically and the rest, and that, actually, we do do our best. Lynne Featherstone: MP, 58, \u00a364,766 I work a seven-day week. There are no boundaries at all between my working and home life. It is an intrusive lifestyle, but you don&apos;t know how long you&apos;re going to be in it, so you give it everything. I&apos;m a workaholic. An average day might start at 6am when I check my emails, and finish at Westminster at 11.30pm. One of the most draining parts of the job is surgery; most casework can be done on the phone and by the time people get through to see me it&apos;s normally something very serious. It can be upsetting: sometimes everyone in the room is in tears. Things like the Baby P case are particularly stressful. When Victoria Climbi\u00e9 died I saw the Labour leadership get away with it. Eight years later, I thought &quot;I&apos;m damned if I&apos;m going to let them get away with it again.&quot; I was quick to put head above the parapet, determined to take action and raise the profile of the case, and that was stressful as I hadn&apos;t been used to that sort of media storm before. I have a reasonable salary. Compared with lots of people it&apos;s a jolly good salary, but compared with others it&apos;s not very good. I think it should be pegged to whatever an equivalent is in the private sector. I strongly believe that MPs shouldn&apos;t decide their own pay, that it&apos;s for others to judge. I live in London although I could have had a second home \u2013 it seemed to me completely ridiculous, and not a good use of public money, so I refused it. Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m a grass-roots campaigner, I see this job as a mission, not a right. I don&apos;t know how people have time to have outside interests \u2013 I certainly don&apos;t. &quot;Bob&quot; Hoskins: Royal Navy Rating, 28, \u00a330,000 I used to be an operator, sat on the radar. Now I&apos;m the man that fixes it. I&apos;ve done eight years&apos; service, I&apos;ve deployed to the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and next week I&apos;m going back to join my ship in the Gulf for anti-piracy operations. When you&apos;re on board it&apos;s quite cramped and it&apos;s deemed as unpleasant living, so you don&apos;t pay for accommodation at sea. But when you&apos;re based on shore you&apos;re charged a nominal fee of \u00a380 a month for a cabin which is in effect a hotel room. As it stands, I rent a flat in Portsmouth, which means I can go on leave at the end of the day to my home comforts. I joined up on \u00a310,000, which isn&apos;t a lot. I&apos;d been working for Halfords and I actually took a drop in pay because at basic training you have to pay for food and accommodation: about \u00a3220 a month. It doesn&apos;t leave you a lot, with a house and a child to maintain. It was 2002 when we were covering for the firefighters who were on strike, so I was expected to do their job, and then go to sea. Those early days were difficult. I often thought, &quot;I need to get promoted soon.&quot; It spurred me on. The pay grades have steadily increased since then. I now earn quite a respectable wage compared with other people. The armed forces&apos; pay review body has rewarded us well, and people are happy with the structure. We have a good pension scheme so I don&apos;t have to think about the future, within reason. It&apos;s a good lifestyle; the hardest part is leaving my children \u2013 you can be deployed for up to seven and a half months. But what I earn and how successful I am will put them through university. Sarah Aldous: Teacher, 30, \u00a336,000 The money definitely didn&apos;t entice me when I decided to train to be a teacher, but it didn&apos;t put me off as I knew it was what I wanted to do. The classic line about teachers is that we get a lot of holiday, but keeping up with lesson planning and marking can seem to be a round-the-clock job. Even after six years&apos; teaching I&apos;m unable to get all of my work done within the hours I&apos;m physically in school. I arrive at 7.30am and leave at 5.30pm and I take work home at weekends, so there&apos;s a feeling the holidays make up for our less-than-exorbitant salaries. The main way to increase your pay is by gaining seniority and just by keeping teaching. After six years you go &quot;through the threshold&quot; from the main pay scale to the upper pay scale. My concern would be to match teachers&apos; pay to that of other graduates, otherwise what incentive is there for a talented graduate to go into teaching? The pay mentioned in advertising campaigns is definitely misleading. Posters do a good job of portraying some of the positive aspects of the job \u2013 seeing the look on a child&apos;s face when they understand \u2013 but touting good pay as a reason to go into teaching is a little far-fetched. A couple of years ago I applied for a role at a private school. I didn&apos;t take the job partly because the salary was lower and the pension was a lot worse \u2013 the teachers&apos; pension plan is excellent. For me there are three main parts to a satisfying career: the money, the work and the people you work with. I have a great group of colleagues, I earn enough to live comfortably, and I love what I do."}, {"sentences": ["Earlier, Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei index jumped 2.3% to close at 11,165.79."], "tags": ["Carphone Warehouse", "Business", "UK Coal", "Redrow", "Greece", "European Union", "Eurozone crisis", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-26T07:27:33Z", "title": "FTSE boosted by Greek rescue efforts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/apr/26/greece-bailout-imf-ftse", "article": "Stock markets around the world have welcomed Greece&apos;s decision to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help, with shares rallying in Europe and Asia.

It&apos;s also been a busy morning for corporate news. Carphone Warehouse banished any lingering Monday morning blues in the City today with an upbeat trading update, and its third earnings upgrade in the last six months. The mobile phone retailer, which spun off its TalkTalk broadband business last month, said its partnership with US giant Best Buy had been more successful than it expected. Carphone expects to collect \u00a346m of profit from selling phones in Best Buy stores in America, up from \u00a38m a year ago. Chairman Charles Dunstone said Carphone&apos;s results for the 12 months to the end of March would beat expectations, and set the company up for another year of growth:   We have ended 2010 with another strong performance and given our third upgrade in six months. Best Buy Mobile US is out-performing even our expectations. Carphone Warehouse Europe continues to trade strongly with like-for-like revenue up 3.0% in the fourth quarter. Our full year results are ahead of expectations and our operating free cash flow is well ahead and represents a transformational improvement on the prior year.   The top-line prediction is that Carphone will deliver earnings per share of between 8p and 8.4p for the last year, up from 4p a year ago. Carphone is due to open its first Best Buy &apos;Big Box&apos; store in the UK on Friday. In other news this morning UK Coal has fallen deeper into the red, with a pre-tax loss of \u00a3129.1m (compared with a \u00a315.6m loss a year ago). It blamed a fall in coal prices, combined with production problems at some of its mines. Chairman David Jones admitted the last year had been very taxing, leaving the group with net debt of \u00a3181.9m. UK Coal plans to cut its borrowings by selling some of its 43,500 acres of agricultural land. In contrast, materials science company Cookson has rushed out its interim management statement because profits for the last six months are significantly higher than expected. We also have some M&amp;A activity. US firm Emerson has launched a bid for British firm Chloride, to create &quot;a leader in the global uninterruptible power supply market&quot;.

Chloride&apos;s shares jumped 41% to 296p when trading began, suggesting that Emerson&apos;s initial bid will not be enough. John Menzies has become the latest company to report losing money because of the volcanic ash cloud. The newspaper distribution company said that the closure of European airspace had a &quot;material impact&quot; on its aviation division, and probably cost it \u00a32.5m. Housebuilder Redrow has predicted that it will return to profitability this year, after seeing solid trading since the start of 2010:  We have been encouraged by sales activity since the start of the calendar year with sales rates per outlet comfortably ahead of the same period last year.

For a fortunate minority, the delays have meant welcome extra time to enjoy different local cuisines \u2013 since my flight got cancelled last week I&apos;ve eaten plates of belly pork with crispy skin that would give Felicity Cloake&apos;s perfect pork crackling a run for its money, and tasted the unique flavour of river fish fresh rolls on the Mekong delta. But for others - stranded in airports whose halogen-lit hotplates belie their countries&apos; rich cuisine, or stuck in holiday destinations where the exotic food has suddenly lost its sparkle - really just longing for a pork pie or a pizza, it will have meant something less inviting. If you&apos;ve found yourself with some extra unplanned mealtimes in unfamiliar surroundings, which side of the divide have you found yourself on? I am one such nomad, which is why I find myself in Hong Kong airport, now en route to Paris (and then on to London via Eurostar a mere six days later than planned), sinking my teeth into a char siu bun and burning my mouth on some Shanghainese noodles. It&apos;s not a bad experience \u2013 the bun is fluffy and light and filled with that irresistible sweet salty pork, and the noodles are fine. But then, this is Hong Kong \u2013 where even airport food is verging on delicious \u2013 and I&apos;m one of the lucky ones. I know that some of my fellow strandees will not be faced with such appetising options.      Pho ingredients, Cathay Pacific Lounge, Ho Chi Minh airport. Photograph: Rosie Birkett    In Hanoi airport on an earlier leg of my travels, it was a different story altogether. The only food options were the Vietnamese version of the pot noodle \u2013 MSG-packed bastardisations of pho (the country&apos;s famous noodle soup dish) which smelled like fetid school canteens - or some stale-looking baguettes from a glass cabinet not unused to the company of flies. It&apos;s these sort of situations that face travellers with that age-old dilemma: eat now and chance a stomach upset or abstain and risk going hungry for hours and hours to come. It&apos;s a tough call, especially when you know that the next morsel you&apos;re likely to eat is going to be reheated in mid-air and served to you in a foil-covered punnet. But food in transit isn&apos;t always nightmarish \u2013 for those well-placed travellers who may stumble upon a cracking local restaurant, decent airport kitchen or food stall while they wait, food can be the best solace available. In the fading moments of a holiday or in the face of a heinous delay, there is little that softens the blow quite like a really good meal and a bottle of something to wash it down with. I remember a terrible journey back from Australia via Japan a few years ago, which had been delayed for about four hours on the ground, resulting in most passengers taking rather too much advantage of the free bar and turning up in Tokyo with a stinking hangover. I&apos;d never had Japanese food before and I didn&apos;t know what to order, but the woman I&apos;d been sitting next to on the flight told me about miso soup, which I subsequently ordered. I still remember those first soothing slurps of the satisfying, savoury soup and the miraculously restoring effect it had on this haggard passenger. It was so cleansing and wholesome, and it&apos;s one of the best airport meals I&apos;ve ever had. Were you caught up in the volcanic ash fallout or have you been stranded on a nightmare journey in the past? Which foods did you find yourself eating and were they memorable for the right or wrong reasons?"}, {"sentences": ["To do so, Gavin teamed up with a researcher from Sophia University in Tokyo to interview members of Japan&apos;s Match.com site about their experiences."], "tags": ["Research", "Higher education", "Online dating", "University of Bath", "Education", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-26T16:00:01Z", "title": "Research into online dating", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/apr/26/online-dating-research", "article": "Online dating used to be a bit, well, embarrassing. Browsing love-match sites was something to be done late at night, at home, when no one could see. You had to watch out for people posting fake photos with malevolent aims. And if you actually found love online, you&apos;d probably lie about meeting in a pub. But no longer. The internet love industry has gone mainstream. And now the academics have got involved. While Britain&apos;s lecturers and professors have probably been joining the likes of eHarmony and Match.com for years, now they are analysing their contents. Dr Jeff Gavin, a psychology lecturer at the University of Bath, has researched the social science behind the sites. His study centres on computer-mediated communication (CMC) \u2013 how we talk and relate to people through computers and the internet. &quot;A lot of theories of CMC begin with the premise that online communication \u2013 especially when it&apos;s text-based, like email or chat \u2013 is missing important social cues,&quot; Gavin explains. &quot;But theorists have recently highlighted the fact that people have developed lots of different ways to overcome the limitations of CMC, using other cues to gain information; for example, thinking about people&apos;s email addresses, spelling, and how quickly, and when, they respond to messages. We also tend to ask more questions online, and give more intimate answers, than when communicating face-to-face. So we make up for the &apos;missing&apos; information like facial expressions.&quot; Gavin wanted to find out more about how people develop relationships online, so he decided to compare the experiences of members of UK and Japanese online dating sites. The two cultures presented interesting contrasts because in Japan, he says, social context plays a much bigger role in communication. &quot;Japanese people tend to express themselves more with implicit things like body language, and silence, and social cues. Being too explicit or upfront can actually lead to negative impressions. By contrast, communication in the west is more dependent on content \u2013 we express ourselves explicitly through what we say. Around the world, online dating is based on the western model of communicating, so I wanted to explore how Japanese daters overcome that,&quot; he explains. To do so, Gavin teamed up with a researcher from Sophia University in Tokyo to interview members of Japan&apos;s Match.com site about their experiences. He then compared the results with studies of similar sites in the UK. The findings reveal an intricate minefield of location-specific online etiquette. &quot;I found that Japanese online daters overcome the lack of social information in CMC by developing their own cues, for example dropping formal language means intimacy is developing between two people messaging on the site, but dropping it too soon is regarded as a sign of social incompetence, and a turn-off,&quot; Gavin explains. &quot;The Japanese participants also said the sites gave them the opportunity to transgress social norms, especially things like approaching multiple strangers and suddenly discontinuing communication, which didn&apos;t crop up as much with UK participants.&quot; Although we associate Japanese culture with being very technically savvy, Gavin&apos;s research showed that the Brits are ahead when it comes to online dating. &quot;Japanese dating sites are about five years behind the UK, US and Australia,&quot; he says. &quot;Japanese people use the internet very differently to the British, a lot of homes don&apos;t have computers or phone lines, and there&apos;s a far greater emphasis on using mobiles to access the internet. That means people tend to surf dating sites in public places like on the train, which has helped them become socially acceptable. Also, the sites tend to have fewer photos, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s due to less of an emphasis on looks \u2013 it&apos;s simply that more pictures don&apos;t fit on phone screens.&quot; In the UK, where internet dating has now been around for more than 10 years, Gavin says the days of secretly logging on to an account are also over. &quot;In all the research I&apos;ve done with online dating users in the UK, I&apos;ve heard barely any mention of anyone feeling that there is any stigma attached,&quot; he says. &quot;There used to be a lot of horror stories, like people building up very intense relationships online, then moving countries to meet their online partner, only to discover they had lied about what they looked like. I don&apos;t think that ever happened in huge numbers, but it has certainly declined now. People invest a lot of time and money in online relationships, and there&apos;s an expectation that you&apos;re going to meet up quite early on, so there&apos;s not a lot of point in lying. Also, younger people have grown up with the internet as a normal part of life, so on- and offline distinctions are less clear cut.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t mean today&apos;s online daters don&apos;t carry out any character embellishments in their profiles. &quot;It&apos;s natural that people want to paint themselves in the best light, so most tend to describe themselves in a positive way, and upload flattering photos,&quot; Gavin says. &quot;But I think that&apos;s just like making an effort before going to a nightclub. When you&apos;re on the pull \u2013 be it online or in a club, most people try to look their best. It may not be the way you look first thing in the morning, but it&apos;s not dishonest.&quot; And what about advice on the perfect profile description? Alas, Gavin says he hasn&apos;t looked into that yet. But he does point out the importance of relationship-hunters realising the role that the various websites have in shaping social interaction. &quot;Online daters need to be aware that different dating sites construct relationships differently,&quot; he says. &quot;Some aim at matching personality, they assume a core, &apos;true&apos; self that can be accessed via a personality questionnaire. Others assume a more fluid self, and put the key to a successful relationship at matching lifestyle factors. &quot;These differences are reflected in the profile templates, instructions to members and the structure of the site. So my advice would be to look at the sites carefully, including their success stories and user tips, and find one that emphasises the qualities that you think are important in a successful relationship.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["That looks a little further away; we do need to bounce back next season.&quot; Kagami, according to his representative, George Synan, is president of a family company in Tokyo, Maruka Trading, whose business is making toys for Disney.", "&quot;I am a director of a Maruka property company,&quot; he said, speaking openly to the Guardian from his Tokyo office.", "&quot;I am paid on commission, 2009 was probably the worst year on record for Tokyo property, so I didn&apos;t make money."], "tags": ["Plymouth Argyle", "Manchester United", "The Glazer family", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-27T23:10:02Z", "title": "Sir Roy Gardner's return has painted Plymouth Argyle into a tricky corner | David Conn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/apr/28/roy-gardner-plymouth-manchester-united", "article": "Plymouth Argyle sailed into this season buoyed by the arrival as an investor of Sir Roy Gardner, the former Manchester United chairman, an increased 38% stake bought by a Japanese investor, Yasuaki Kagami, and a vision of boundless ambition. The Gardner regime branded the future a &quot;New World&quot; for Argyle, to transform the West Country club into &quot;a global and local partnership with football at its heart&quot;, and into the Premier League within five years. In December it hailed as vindication the FA&apos;s decision to select Plymouth as a venue if the 2018 World Cup comes here \u2013 it was a status bestowed shortly before a winding-up petition arrived at Argyle from Her Majesty&apos;s Revenue and Customs. That, a transfer embargo and, last week, relegation from the Championship via a 2\u20110 home defeat to Newcastle United, never quite figured in the brochure. The fans are gloom-laden. Many do not buy Gardner&apos;s grand plan, which will see Home Park shortly transferred to a holding company owned by Gardner, his partner Keith Todd and Kagami. They then intend to expand the stadium to 45,000 (Argyle&apos;s gates in the Championship average 10,396 this season) and develop commercially the land around it. Some argue the regime is too absentee, fixated on property profits, not the basics of running a stalwart Football League club. Gardner, who describes himself as very involved although he rarely travels to matches because he lives a long way from Plymouth, rejects that. &quot;I&apos;m very disappointed with relegation,&quot; he said, &quot;but the framework of our five-year plan is still there: we aspire to be a Premier League club. That looks a little further away; we do need to bounce back next season.&quot; Kagami, according to his representative, George Synan, is president of a family company in Tokyo, Maruka Trading, whose business is making toys for Disney. In April 2008, Kagami paid \u00a3500,000 for a 5% stake from each of four local Plymouth directors, \u00a32m in total. The plan was for Kagami to invest in the club and develop football links between Plymouth and Japan, but truly significant money has not yet arrived. Phillip Gill, a former director who last summer sold his remaining 18% stake to Kagami for \u00a3650,000, had become disillusioned, accusing the board of not looking sufficiently far for an investor beyond Kagami, who was introduced by a local businessman, Tony Campbell, an old colleague of Synan&apos;s. Campbell, now the club&apos;s chief operating officer, represents the Kagami interest at Home Park. Gill argues that in 2008\u201109 players were signed by Paul Sturrock, in his second managerial stint, on long, expensive contracts because of the expected investment from Kagami, which did not arrive that season. The striker Emile Mpenza, signed as a free agent from Manchester City on a salary understood to be \u00a3500,000 a year, left a year later having played only three full league games. &quot;I&apos;m more angry than upset at relegation,&quot; Gill fumed. &quot;It was predictable two years ago.&quot; Synan and Gardner explained the paucity of investment by pointing to the economic downturn. Synan was affected personally, too, having to rely on a loan from Maruka to make ends meet, according to a document his lawyers filed in August 2009 in a personal dispute being heard by the Osaka district court. &quot;I am a director of a Maruka property company,&quot; he said, speaking openly to the Guardian from his Tokyo office. &quot;I am paid on commission, 2009 was probably the worst year on record for Tokyo property, so I didn&apos;t make money. The companies also had issues in 2009. It was a difficult year.&quot; Argyle&apos;s accounts, recently published for the year ended 31 May 2009, revealed that the club spent 87% of their \u00a38.6m turnover on a \u00a37.5m wage bill. The three Plymouth-based directors and Kagami had loaned a total of \u00a31.4m, with Kagami&apos;s \u00a3256,000 significantly lower than the \u00a3775,000 stumped up by a local businessman, Tony Wrathall. Despite that overspending, Argyle finished 21st last season. Then Gardner and Todd arrived, with Kagami upping his stake, giving their partnership 51%. Gardner says he was missing football, having been Manchester United&apos;s chairman for three &quot;outstanding&quot; years until the 2005 takeover by the Glazer family, which he opposed. Yet after declaring their ambitions, Argyle notched two points from their first nine games and set sail for League One. The winding-up petition issued against the club in January was, Gardner said: &quot;An unfortunate issue, a short-term funding issue which can affect all clubs.&quot; Argyle paid the debt owed to HMRC and Wrathall is said to have loaned further money, although Gardner declined to confirm that. He and Todd lent money too, in December; he declined to say how much that was for. Last month, with Argyle on the cusp of relegation, the club announced that Home Park will be transferred to the holding company owned by Gardner, Todd and Kagami. Many fans are uneasy and such separations of clubs from their grounds are also viewed with discomfort within the Football League, whose executives have seen too many asset-stripping attempts down the years. Gardner, however, argues that the transfer is &quot;essential&quot; because the stand-alone property company will be better able to raise money for the developments, which will benefit the club. The price paid to the club is stated as \u00a37.5m but Gardner said no cash will go to the club \u2013 who bought the freehold for \u00a32.7m three years ago and will now pay rent to play there. The \u00a37.5m will go to paying off the club&apos;s debts including the money owed to directors, who will convert their loans into shares. &quot;The club is not getting a lump sum of cash. It will reduce the indebtedness between the football club and investors,&quot; he said. Describing World Cup bid status as &quot;a very great story&quot;, Gardner explained the plan to develop Home Park into a 45,000-seat stadium with an arena next it. &quot;It is an excellent site,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be the O2 Arena of the south-west.&quot; Not all are captivated. Peter Jones, the former vice-chairman who spoke at the March funeral of Michael Foot, former Argyle fan and director, and leader of the Labour party, said this week: &quot;There is a huge gap between the global-brand idea and the reality of building a successful club. I fear Argyle becoming owned by absentee owners, more interested in the property development than football.&quot; Gardner, though, and Synan, both reject that. &quot;We could make a profit if the development is successful,&quot; Gardner acknowledged. &quot;But profit will need to be ploughed into the football club, because a successful stadium needs the football club to do well.&quot; He and Todd are, he said, about to buy out Wrathall and the two other Plymouth-based directors, and Kagami is also committed to injecting further funds. &quot;Other people can come in and invest,&quot; Gardner said. &quot;They will be taking a risk. And if they make a profit, that is their reward for the risk.&quot; A Home fit for kings Sir Roy Gardner has built his vision for Plymouth Argyle around England&apos;s bid for the city to host matches at the 2018 World Cup finals. &quot;We came to the club in July 2009 because we had a vision to bring Premier League football to Plymouth,&quot; Gardner, below, said, &quot;and we had an idea to create a sports and leisure destination around Home Park. That idea was crystallised when the board decided to bid to become a World Cup city.&quot; Of all the venues announced by the FA&apos;s 2018 bid team last December, including the surprise choice of Milton Keynes, Plymouth has the most to do to get the stadium up to the standards necessary for staging World Cup matches. Home Park must be converted from a 19,500\u2011seat to a 45,000-seat stadium, according to the plans Gardner is drawing up. It would be financed by the development around the ground, including a hotel, shops, student accommodation and an arena for concerts and other indoor events. Beyond a few World Cup group games in eight years&apos; time \u2013 should England be awarded the finals \u2013 the viability of the stadium will depend on the non-football activities, as Argyle&apos;s average attendance in the Championship was around 10,000."}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo, the Nikkei index has tumbled 2.4% overnight, shedding 269.27 points to 10,943.39 points."], "tags": ["Financial crisis", "Market turmoil", "Business", "Greece", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "European Union", "Eurozone crisis", "Financial sector", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-28T06:11:10Z", "title": "Europe's financial crisis: as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2010/apr/28/greece-financial-crisis", "article": " 7.00am: Kalimera! That&apos;s &apos;Good morning&apos; in Greek, although it&apos;s probably not a phrase you&apos;d hear much in Athens today as Greece comes to terms with yesterday&apos;s alarming developments.  To quickly recap, the \u20ac45bn IMF/EU rescue plan for Greece hit major problems yesterday when Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s downgraded Greek debt to junk bond status. With Germany dragging its feet over supporting the bailout, there are fears that Greece may default on billions of euros of loans. But that&apos;s just the start. Portugal is under fire, having also been downgraded by the ratings agency. The talk in the City is of a &apos;race to default&apos;, with indebted nations scrambling to restructure their debt piles. And what would that do for the Euro? This phase of the financial crisis is going to last for months, but today will be a critical day - so we&apos;ll be blogging the latest developments and reaction for the next few hours here. Let us know what you think below.  7.17am: The Asian stock markets have taken the Greek junk bond downgrade badly. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index has tumbled 2.4% overnight, shedding 269.27 points to 10,943.39 points. Exporters such as Canon were particularly hammered as investors bailed out of shares. And in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has dropped 1.26%. This comes after a heavy selloff on Wall Street, where the Dow lost 1.9% or 213 points to 10,991.99.  London was the first market to react to S&amp;P&apos;s blow, suffering its biggest fall of the year with a 150 point plunge to 5603. Spread betters we&apos;ve contacted this morning are anticipating further falls, but probably around 20 points while traders weigh up the situation. As Ben Potter of IG Markets explained:  Further modest losses are expected in Europe at the open but it&apos;s going to be a case of watching to see if traders can now hold their nerve amidst some reasonable earnings data or whether this is indeed the start of the next correction.   7.27am: My Reuters terminal is flashing that Greece&apos;s financial regulator has just banned short selling on the Athens stock market until June 28. This will prevent traders from selling shares they don&apos;t own, with the intention of buying them back cheaper in the future. This appears to cover all listed companies, and follows yesterday&apos;s 6% drop on the main Athens index. In a brief statement, the Capital Market Commission said it took the decision &quot;having considered the extraordinary conditions in the Greek market&quot;. Greek banks have been under the cosh in recent days, losing an average of 9% yesterday. You may remember that the Financial Services Authority brought in a similar ban in the UK in September 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in an attempt to protect British banks from attack. The move, which just covered financial stocks, had some success, but couldn&apos;t prevent the partial nationalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds a few months later.  7.35am: A quick look at the currency markets, and the euro is trying to clamber back off the mat after hitting a one-year low yesterday. The European single currency is trading around $1.319 as I type. Against sterling, one euro is currently worth 86.5p.  7.42am: What&apos;s the mood in Greece? Financial TV channel Bloomberg just went to their Athens correspondent, who declared that: &quot;There really is a sense of fear and apprehension here, even bordering on panic.&quot; That should do wonders for nerves in the City this morning ahead of the start of trading.  7.47am: Those of a delicate disposition should probably avoid this article from Reuters star blogger Felix Salmon. If your nerves are steel-tipped, though, plunge in.  Salmon has elegently blogged the highlights of a panel discussion in Los Angeles yesterday afternoon. This included noted economist Nouriel Roubini, who illustrated just why he earned the nickname Dr Doom. According to Roubini, Greece is simply incapable of cutting its spending by enough to make a serious debt in ite debt. That makes a default inevitable, along with ejection from the euro, at which point Spain is hauled into the crisis. As Salmon reports:      Nouriel&apos;s base case, then, is Argentina 2001: after all, Greece has a much higher debt-to-GDP ratio, much higher deficit-to-GDP ratio, and much higher current-account deficit than Argentina had back then. And if that&apos;s the base case, there&apos;s no way that Greek debt should be trading anywhere near its current levels. Of course, this being Nouriel, it goes downhill from there: if Greece is worse than Argentina, he says, then Spain is worse than Greece. Its housing bubble and bust has left the banking sector much weaker than Greece&apos;s; its unemployment situation, especially with the under-30 crowd, is much worse than Greece&apos;s; and the cost of any Spain bailout would be so much more enormous than the cost of a Greek bailout as to be almost unthinkable. The only thing that Spain has going for it is that it isn&apos;t quite at the edge of the abyss yet; if it gets its political act together and implements tough fiscal and structural reforms now, it can save itself. But clearly no one saw that happening, given Spain&apos;s political history over the past 20 years. Hmmm - huge national debt, a deflated housing bubble, a battered banking sector, high unemployment, calls for tough reform going undeeded at the crucial moment. Does this sound like a certain other country to you?  8.12am: Looks like London traders got most of their panic out of the way yesterday. The FTSE 100 is down just 7 points in the first few minutes of trading at 5596 points, shaving a bit more of the nation&apos;s pension pots after yesterday&apos;s 150-point fall. Across Europe, though, the picture is darker. Portugal&apos;s leading stock index dropped 5.3% at the open, as investors reacted badly to S&amp;P&apos;s decision to cut its credit rating by two notches. This is front page news on Portugal&apos;s newspapers, with one tabloid raging that the country is under attack by speculators. Spain&apos;s IBEX 35 index fell by 1% at the start of trading, reflecting concerns that this crisis could head West from Athens. Worth remembering that last week, the IMF warned that the banking sector would be badly hit by a crisis in the sovereign debt markets. The biggest fallers in London today are the banks, with RBS losing almost 4% to 53.8p and Lloyds Banking Group down 2.6% at 66.4p. Not good news for the taxpayer, which was just getting used to making a (paper) profit on its investments in these nationalised banks. We&apos;re probably still just in the black at the prices, though. Our banking correspondent Jill Treanor reminds me that Lloyds said yesterday that its exposure to Greece was &apos;minimal&apos;.  8.50am: Sorry for the outage there - just crushing a small technical gremlin. We&apos;re getting some good analyst comment on the latest developments in Greece. Here&apos;s Gary Jenkins from Evolution Securities:  The \u20ac40-45bn bail out package that has so far been talked about is widely seen as being too small as it only covers Greece&apos;s funding needs up till January 2011 although the FT reports today that the IMF may be prepared to increase the size of their portion by some \u20ac10bn. Obviously the provision of liquidity is vital for Greece in the short term, and the more they are provided with the longer they have to make the necessary fiscal adjustments. But its still debt that needs to be repaid, and there appears to be growing doubts that Greece will be able to avoid some kind of debt restructuring.  My view is that they should be given an amount to get them through the next 3 months, and in that time the IMF carry out a thorough investigation of the Greek numbers to clarify exactly what the budget deficit is and how much realistically Greece will need to borrow over the next couple of years. At least that might allow for an orderly restructuring, if deemed necessary, rather than a complete market meltdown.  At the same time the EU might want to circle the wagons around Portugal, as to lose one sovereign would be unfortunate, but to lose two looks like carelessness\u2026  City veteran David Buik of BGC Partners has also opined:  A very good friend of mine reminded me very succinctly and cogently that the Euro only works if all countries give up financial sovereignty and pool resources for common taxes, budgets and social security. If these boxes are not all ticked, the whole philosophy and ethos of a united Europe crumbles in to dust. It is called make up your mind. Greece will need help for at least 2 more years plus an increased amount of funding. If Greece defaults gargantuan losses could be incurred. Greece is the catalyst, Portugal has been downgraded and who follows \u2013 Spain and Italy? Though not in the EU, the UK, with its stubborn refusal to deal with its mountain of debt, looks very vulnerable.   8.58am: The most important action today is going to take place in Germany today. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the IMF, is in Berlin today to try to persuade parliamentarians to support the bailout. We&apos;re expecting high-level talks, including a meeting with Germany&apos;s finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble. Schaeuble has said previously that Germany will not let Greece fail, although the German government is demanding tough conditions. There&apos;s also a rumour that German leader Angela Merkel will meet with Strauss-Kahn and the president of the ECB today. This is helping to maintain optimism in the markets, although the FTSE 100 is now down 21 points at 5581. The German public, though, remain wary of rescuing the Greeks. One headline this morning declared that &quot;We don&apos;t want to pay for Greek luxury pensions.&quot; With an election looming next month, Merkel may find it hard to ignore such feelings.  9.02am: The crisis is also becoming a theme in the UK election campaign. Peter Mandelson just told this morning&apos;s Labour press conference that the Greek situation &quot;highlights the fragility of the European, and the global, economic climate.&quot; He also insisted that the UK economy was much stronger than Greece&apos;s. David Miliband has also taken a pop at Conservative leader David Cameron over the issue. The foreign secretary accused Cameron of &apos;economic illiteracy&apos; after pointing out that both country&apos;s face rocketing borrowing requirements:      I think the way David Cameron is talking about Greece and Britain in the same breath is economic illiteracy. We have a deficit reduction plan to halve the deficit in four years. That&apos;s absolutely on the table and it&apos;s clear for markets and for voters to see. The credibility we have is based on the published plans we have. Britain ran up a debt of \u00a3163bn in the last year, which is around 11% of GDP. Greece&apos;s national debt was more than 13% of its GDP, although there is concern that its data may not be reliable.  9.15am: Scratch what we said at 8.12am about the City taking the Greek crisis in its stride. In the last few minutes shares have fallen sharply in London, where the FTSE 100 is now down by 66 points at 5536. That&apos;s a 216 point fall since S&amp;P downgraded Greece&apos;s credit rating yesterday afternoon.     Live blog: Nick Fletcher    As my colleague Nick Fletcher reports here, the banks are the biggest fallers, with RBS tumbling up to 7%, Lloyds down by 6.5% and Barclays off 4%. Across Europe share prices are in retreat, with Germany&apos;s DAX index down 1% and the French CAC losing 1.2%. It&apos;s also turning into a very bad day for Portugal, where the leading index is down almost 6%. And the pound is wobbling, down below $1.52 against the dollar as I type.  This just piles more pressure on Europe&apos;s politicians, ahead of the showdown talks in Berlin. Traders are looking for the IMF and the European Central Bank to make progress on the details of a bailout for Greece, and reassurance that more countries won&apos;t be dragged into the mess. Koen De Leus, economist at KBC Securities, told Reuters that the escalating Greek crisis is the key issue on the financial markets today.  The chances of a default by the Greek government are increasing not by the day but by the hour. If the IMF and European governments don&apos;t come up with something quickly, then I see the market going down further quite rapidly. Investors are starting to react emotionally. In the current environment, it&apos;s very difficult to impress with better-than-expected earnings.        9.33am: But every crisis is also an opportunity...to crack a few gags. Harry Wallop of the Daily Telegraph is retweeting the best jokes on Twitter (no squinting at a Reuters terminal for @hwallop). Here&apos;s a few: @callummay: I&apos;d like to remind journos of opportunity to use the old &quot;making a Drachma out of a crisis&quot; + &quot;come Acropolis&quot; headlines @adamblenford: @callummay Surely there&apos;s mileage in &apos;Losing their marbles&apos; as well? @nicstevenson beware of Greeks bearing gilts? The Liberal Democrat press office also enjoy a good chortle: @LibDemPress: @hwallop The four horsemen of the Acropolis?      Vince Cable is taking a more serious line, though. The Lib Deb Treasury spokesman is quoted as warning that Britain will face the same problems as Greece unless the UK deficit is tackled by the next government.  9.45am: We&apos;re now getting prices from the bond markets, and it&apos;s looking like blood on the floor for Greece. The yield on Greek two-year bonds has just blown apart to a scarcely believable 38%. It&apos;s inconcevable that a country could refinance itself at that level of interest rate, so it indicates that only the gutsiest speculators feel that medium-term Greek debt is worth holding onto. As a comparison, the yield on this debt was just 1.3% last November, and still available at just over 5% at the start of this month.  Greek credit default swaps have just hit a new all-time high as well, with the insurance on five-year government bonds hitting 883.8 basis points. That&apos;s an alltime high. There&apos;s another key measure that everyone in power, and across the City, will be watching and that is the gap between the yield on ten-year Greek government bonds and the German equivalent. That spread just hit its highest level since January 1995, at 995 basis points. Three weeks ago, investors were rushing to sell Greek debt when that spread hit 440 basis points.  10.05am: Chancellor Alistair Darling has now spoken out, calling on the Eurozone to &apos;urgently&apos; sort out the Greek bailout before the situation spirals out of control. Darling told LBC Radio this morning he spoke to his European counterparts last night to express his views:      They know that they have got to sort it out. They have promised money, and what I would say is they need to make that money available as soon as possible. If we can sort out the problems in Greece quickly, then that will make people more confident. Darling, of course, knows all about the need to maintain public confidence during a crisis, having helped steer the UK through the near-collapse of the entire banking sector in the autumn of 2008 when the cash machines came close to running dry.  10.25am: More details are emerging about the meetings between the heads of the European Central Bank and the IMF, and Angela Merkel&apos;s government in Berlin today.      Live blog: Kate Connolly    Kate Connolly, our correspondent in Germany, says that Jean-Claude Trichet and Dominque Strauss-Kahn will put German politicians under pressure to agree the bailout by insisting that the rescue package is &quot;a necessity&quot; rather than just a friendly act. Merkel is due to give a statement at 14.45pm GMT after the talks finish, so we should know by then how this pitch went down. But as I mentioned before, the German public will need some convincing. Banner headlines in today&apos;s newspapers include &quot;You Greeks are getting nothing from us!&quot;, and &quot;We Fear for our money&quot;. Senior members of the ECB appear to be conducting a rapid-fire exercise to get Germany onside. Executive board member Juergen Stark told an audience in Berlin that action is needed now. Stark also claimed that Greece is an isolated case, and that it would be wrong to think that Portugal is in the same mess. And Axel Weber, one of the ECB&apos;s senior policymakers, has insisted that the bailout is meant to ensure financial stability across the Eurozone rather than just patch up Greece&apos;s self-inflicted wounds. Weber also piled on the pressure, saying that while a widespread credit crunch in Germany is unlikely it &quot;cannot be ruled out.&quot;  10.47am: Another statistic to underline the scale of the problems facing Greece - the credit default swap on its five-year government bonds has now reached 911.6 basis points. That means it costs more to insure Greek debt today than that of any other country (Venezuela, at 836 basis points, has just been shunted aside). Bloomberg&apos;s David Tweed gets a virtual round of applause for this gem of a quote from a (sadly) unnamed official, who compared Greece&apos;s woes to &quot;the Ebola virus&quot;, saying they need to be rapidly eradicated. SEE UPDATE 11.51am update Sky&apos;s Tim Marshall has also predicted that the PIIGS* (his words, not mine!) are off to get slaughtered, with Britain possibly following.      Instability in Europe is hardly conducive to the recovery of the British economy which has its own massive budget deficit. So these PIIGS may go to market, and this British non piggy may go &apos;We we we are part of this!&apos; all the way home. * - Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain  11.00am: More news from Berlin - Trichet and Strauss-Kahn will give a press conference at 12.30 GMT to update the world on their talks with the German government. This seems to have brought some calm to the markets, with the FTSE 100 now down 30 points at 5573. Traders may be calculating that these big cheeses must have something positive to tell us. The pound keeps falling, though, to around $1.5173. I&apos;ve been speaking to Richard Turner, currency dealer at UK Forex. He explained that people are taking all their risky trades off the table before the crisis blows up.  Turner speaks to corporate customers every day, and reports that many are trying to &quot;lock&quot; themselves into the prevailing currency rates today. With the general election looming, there is a lot of fear out there.  11.13am: Our banking expert, Jill Treanor, has been crunching the latest data from the Bank for International Settlements to try and work out how much the Greeks owe to overseas lenders:      The data runs to the end of 2009 and shows that about $240bn (\u00a3158bn) is owed overseas. France and Germany have the biggest exposures of $75bn and $45bn respectively. The UK is owed $15bn and the US $17bn.  You can see the data yourself on the BIS website.  11.21am: You may remember that a few months ago we reported that two rightwing German politicians had insisted that Greece sells its precious art works and historic buildings as the price for a rescue.      German politicians suggested Greece could sell off its islands. Photograph: Corbis    Josef Schlarmann and Frank Schaeffler even suggested that Athens could throw a couple of Aegean islands into the pot too.      Well, thanks to the magic of Twitter, they now have an offer: @chriskoski Dear Greece, I am willing to pay up to twenty American dollars, in hard cash, for one or more of your islands. (No minotaurs, please.) Do I hear $30?  11.28am: The Greece crisis continues to feature on today&apos;s campaigning circuit. This is from our election live blog:      David Cameron is in Ed Balls&apos; consituency (Morley and Outwood), doing a Q&amp;A with workers at the Wakefield Coca-Cola plant. He has just made his own assessment of the Greek debt crisis. He said that if he had not been for the Tories opposing entry into the euro, British taxpayers would now be spending money bailing out Greece. And I&apos;m seeing on my Reuters terminal that Alistair Darling is repeating his warning that there is &quot;no time to lose&quot; for the IMF and ECB to solve the problems.  11.51am: We&apos;ve got the full details of the &quot;Ebola&quot; quote I mentioned earlier. One correction, we do have the identity of the speaker, and it&apos;s a big hitter - OECD director general Angel Gurria. Over to Bloomberg:      &quot;It&apos;s not a question of the danger of contagion; contagion has already happened,&quot; Gurria said in an interview with Bloomberg television in Berlin today. &quot;This is like Ebola. When you realize you have it you have to cut your leg off in order to survive.&quot; You can watch David Tweed&apos;s full interview with Gurria here. This is just the kind of talk that gets FT Alphaville reaching for their tin hats. Alphaville has also flagged up a rumour going round the City that a \u20ac90bn rescue package might be announced in Berlin this afternoon. This has helped to pull shares back from those early lows (FTSE 100 now down just 20 points at 5583). In other news, Ladbrokes has cut the odds on Greece being booted out of the eurozone before the end of 2010 to 13/8. To be honest, that&apos;s only a small change from yesterday&apos;s odds of 7/4 on the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; quitting the single currency. But perhaps more surprisingly, Ladbrokes is only prepared to give 3/1 odds on Portugal quitting the euro before the start of 2011.....  12.31pm: With the FTSE 100 now breaking into positive territory (must be that rumour of the \u20ac90bn package being readied), it&apos;s time for a quick recap of events so far and the schedule for the rest of the day.      \u2022 After falling early, world stock markets have erased most of their losses\u2022 But the yield on Greek bonds has soared, and it is now more expensive to insure Greek government debt than any other country&apos;s (10.47am)\u2022 German politicians are meeting with the heads of the IMF and the ECB shortly (10.25am)\u2022 The OECD&apos;s director general has said the crisis needs to be dealt with like the Ebola virus (11.51am)\u2022 Alistair Darling has urged his fellow European finance ministers to hurry up (10.05am) \u2022 City insiders are speculating that a \u20ac90bn rescue package for Greece might be announced today (11.51am) Looking ahead....  Jean-Claude Trichet of the EBC and Dominic Strauss-Kahn of the IMF should give an update at 12.30pm GMT (so just under an hour&apos;s time), although timing may be flexible Angela Merkel is scheduled to hold her own press conference at 14.45 GMT. Wall Street trading begins at 9.30am EST / 2.30 PM BST. The futures market is indicating that shares will rally somewhat following yesterday&apos;s heavy losses, with a 36-point rally being predicted on the Dow Jones index.  12.42pm: As this latest panic was caused by Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s decision to downgrade Greece to junk bond status, we thought it would be useful to show a full list of S&amp;P&apos;s credit ratings. S&amp;P&apos;s ratings cover 123 nations. Having been cut to BB+, the highest of the non-investment grades, the Hellenic Republic is in the same group as the Panama, Egypt and Colombia. Of course, there are various degrees of junk. Right at the bottom of the pile is Equador with a CCC+ rating. Eighteen countries have the honour of a triple-A credit rating. Of these just one, the UK, is on negative credit watch. The others are all seen as stable. But according to Simon Hayes of Barclays Capital, there&apos;s little risk of Britain being downgraded:      Although there remains a question mark over the UK&apos;s sovereign rating we do not expect a downgrade. S&amp;P and Fitch have expressed some concern about the current government plans for fiscal consolidation, but we expect the next government to tighten policy by a little more than is currently projected. Given the broad consensus across the political parties about the need to reduce the public deficit, and the closeness of the main parties&apos; stated consolidation plans, we do not believe that the election outcome will materially change the broad outlook for public borrowing and debt.  1.06pm: Several hours ago, YeeofLittleFaith posted in the comments below that Greece should &quot;tell S&amp;P to bugger off&quot;. 233 fellow readers (and counting) agree. But do you think Germany should yield and support the bailout? We&apos;ve set up a poll where you can have your say - here.  1.47pm: Interesting news from Lisbon, where leaders across the political spectrum have joined forces in an attempt to reassure the financial markets, after its rating was downgraded by S&amp;P yesterday. Prime minister Jose Socrates met with Pedro Passos Coelho, the head of the main opposition earlier today. The pair just announced that they&apos;ve agreed to bring forward some austerity measures that had been scheduled for 2011. Socrates, who runs the Socialist party, said they were responding to &quot;a speculative attack on the euro and Portugese debt.&quot; Passos Coelho, who heads the centre-right Social Democrats, said he was pleased that Socrates had indicated a willingness to consider &quot;additional austerity measures&quot;  2.05pm: We&apos;re keeping a firm eye on Berlin (the other one is being distracted by Gordon Brown&apos;s little local difficulty in Rochdale) for any signs of progress in the bailout talks. There&apos;s no sign of the Trichet/Strauss-Kahn press conference we were expecting, but it appears that the package will - as the City was starting to suspect - be increased. Reuters is flashing that German MP Juergen Trittin, head of the Greens, is briefing journalists that the total package could be as big as \u20ac100bn-\u20ac120bn. The French PM has also come out and said that the existing \u20ac30bn package on offer from the EU should be implemented immediately. This is exciting the financial markets, sending the euro rallying against the dollar, and up above 87p against the pound. Greek bonds have also benefitted - the spread between Greek and German 10 year government bonds is back around 830 basis points. That&apos;s unacceptably high, but better than the 1,000bps spread we saw earlier today. The FTSE 100 is also gaining, now up 32 points at 5632. More details when we get &apos;em....  2.34pm: Deep breaths, one and all. Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the ECB, has just poured cold water on those rumours that a \u20ac120bn rescue plan for Greece has been agreed. He&apos;s saying that it&apos;s &quot;Important that we have talks going on......I am confident that we will see a good conclusion.&quot; (emphasis mine). In other words, negotiations continue..... German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also told a press conference that the German government wants to reach an agreement &quot;quickly&quot;. This could mean reaching an agreement with groups in the German parliament by Friday, and a new law passed next Monday. The FTSE 100 (our local barometer of investor sentiment) has slipped back to 5614, a 10 point rise on the day. Over on Wall Street the trading bell has just been rung, and the Dow Jones index is up 27 points in early trading at 11019 (it takes the Dow around 15 minutes to get properly up to speed).....  2.42pm: The press conference with Trichet and Strauss-Kahn is now well underway in Berlin. The key news seems to be that we don&apos;t have an agreement yet, but htat we might get one soon: Strauss-Kahn also declined to comment on the speculation that the Greek rescue package is being increased to \u20ac120bn. Here are some of the key points via Reuters: Trichet first:      I am making a working assumption that we&apos;ll have a very good end of this negotiation. It depends on us and it depends on the government of Greece.  I make the working assumption that when this green light is given, depending on the programme itself, then we have an absolute necessity to decide very rapidly. It depends on the decision making process in the IMF and in Europe. That is why the fast decision of the German parliament is so important. And some words from Strauss-Kahn:      It was a useful meeting. As you know the IMF has been discussing with the EU Commission for a week. Of course it&apos;s difficult because what is being done by the Greek government and the Greek people is very difficult. The international community is here to help them so that they can return to normalcy. What is at stake today is the economic situation of Greece. but it&apos;s more than that. it&apos;s theconfidence that&apos;s at stake. That&apos;s why we need to act swiftly and strongly. It is a loan and will be repaid in time. It&apos;s not grants. It&apos;s loans. If all this goes together rapidly, I&apos;m very confident that the problem will be fixed. But if we don&apos;t fix it in Greece it may have a lot of consequences on the EU.  3.29pm: We seem to have reached a bit of a pause, ahead of Angela Merkel&apos;s press conference (which was scheduled for 14:45 GMT, so in about 15 minutes time). Hopefully she isn&apos;t being distracted by live coverage of a closed door in Rochdale. So let&apos;s look at the markets, which are also waiting for events. FTSE 100 is up 9 points at 5612, the Dow Jones is up 23 points at 11015, but the German DAX and French CAC markets are both down around 1% - reflecting the uncertainty over how Greece will impact on the eurozone. The markets are also showing a little bit more confidence in Greece&apos;s ability to repay its debts, with the credit default swap on the five-year Greek bond now down at 700-710 basis points. And the yield on the two-year Greek bond is back around 16% - still absurdly high, but better than the 38% briefly recorded this morning.  4.14pm: Here we go... Angela Merkel&apos;s press conference has begun in Berlin. The German chancellor is appearing with Dominic Strauss-Kahn - in a show of unity at this time of turbulence? The top line is that we don&apos;t have a deal yet. But like Strauss-Kahn and Trichet earlier, Merkel is talking tough about the need to act quickly.      Negotiations with Greece must be accelerated. I hope they can be concluded in the coming days. Merkel also suggests that a lot of the blame for the current crisis can be laid at the door of previous European politicians for allowing Greece into the eurozone in the first place:      In 2000 we had a situation when we were confronted with the question of whether Greece should be able to join the eurozone. It turned [out] that the decision may not have been scrutinised closely enough. And that appears to be the sum of her views. No mention of quite how much might be pumped into Greece - Germany, of course, will have to pay a significant slice of any EU package. Also no hint about whether Greece will have to restructure its existing loans. Analysts believe that Greek bondholders face a severe &apos;haircut&apos; of perhaps 40%.  4.30pm: Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s strikes again! This time Spain is its target. S&amp;P has just downgraded Spain&apos;s credit rating from AA+ to AA (two rungs away from the AAA top rating), with a Negative outlook. This blow came just moments before the end of trading in London. Some traders managed to fire sell orders through, so the FTSE100 is now down by 16.91 points at 5586. The euro is really feeling the pain, though, hitting a new one-year low of $1.313 against the dollar. S&amp;P said it had decided to downgrade Spain&apos;s credit rating by one notch because it believes its economy will suffer &quot;a more protracted period of sluggish growth than previously expected.&quot; In another signal that it is the ratings agency and the bond markets who are calling the shots, S&amp;P said it might revise Spain&apos;s outlook to Stable if its government &quot;meets or exceeds fiscal objectives in 2010 and 2011&quot;. Don&apos;t forget we have a full list of world credit ratings here (which we will be updating sharpish!)  4.54pm: The Spanish downgrade really does ratchet up the pressure on the European Union. Spain&apos;s stock market has just closed 3% lower, and financial companies across Europe were hit by a late wave of selling. This is certainly bad news for Britain&apos;s banks. According to research from Credit Suisse, the UK banking sector has around \u00a375bn of exposure to Spanish debt. Most of it is held by Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, while Lloyds is said to have &apos;negligible&apos; exposure. David Buik of BGC Partners was the first City figure to comment:      The longer the EU and the IMF vacillate and remain indecisive, the greater chance of some implosion! GCSE economics! Wake up guys and smell the coffee! The pound has also hit a new low for the day, touching $1.5146. It&apos;s lost nearly a cent and a half since dawn.....  5.03pm: We&apos;re also hearing from America that Barack Obama is concerned about the Euro debt crisis - and this was before Spain&apos;s credit rating was cut by S&amp;P. According to Reuters,White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters on Air Force One today that the US president is watching affairs closely:      This is something that is of great concern to the president and we&apos;re monitoring it very closely...[The US Treasury is] in close contact with folks in Europe about the issue.  5.22pm: Spain&apos;s economic minister has tried to reassure the markets, and the Spanish people of course, following S&amp;P&apos;s decision to downgrade the country&apos;s credit rating. Jose Manuel Campa said that Spain&apos;s plans to cut its deficit are &apos;unchanged&apos;.      &quot;The important thing right now is to underpin measures to establish a stable medium- to long-term growth pattern, which is the basic aim, because in fact the revision does not cast doubt on our deficit consolitation plan.&quot; Spain&apos;s 2009 deficit (the amount it had to borrow to balance the books last year) came in at 11.2% of GDP (similar to the UK, and significantly less than Greece&apos;s 13.6%). It hopes to cut the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2013. S&amp;P&apos;s own report explains that it cut Spain&apos;s rating because it believes the country&apos;s &quot;real GDP growth&quot; will average just 0.7% over the next six years. Worth remembering that Alistair Darling&apos;s forecasts are based on some pretty healthy economic growth for the UK, including around 3.25% in 2011. Miss that, and tackling the UK deficit gets even harder.....  5.43pm: Back on Greece, and this note from Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities is worth a read. It was written just before S&amp;P cut Spain&apos;s rating, but the logic is unchanged:      If the rumour is true that the IMF / EU is about to arrange a 3 year \u20ac120bn bail out package then clearly that is very good news for Greece, and indeed other Euro sovereigns as they would also have been unable to tap the market if the bond carnage had continued much longer.  After months of inaction the imminent collapse of [the Greek] government&apos;s ability to borrow has seemingly resulted in the EU /IMF pulling Paulson&apos;s bazooka out of the pocket in order to show the market that they are serious about saving Greece from default and stabilising bond yields. Of course the devil will be in the detail and we should not forget that this will still be debt, not some kind of gift, which the Greeks will have to repay at some stage.  However, the provision of liquidity for such a period of time should give Greece the opportunity to step out of the spotlight and try and repair their fiscal position over the medium term. It might be churlish to say that if the EU has stepped in 3 months ago they would not have had to lend much more than \u20ac30bn and they would have got much the same result with the benefit of a much lower starting point of yields. Maybe leaving the decision to the last minute was to gather political support but it has been a dangerous game to play. Now we await further official detail but it would be a huge shock if any rescue package fell apart at this stage.  6.24pm: Angela Merkel has been answering more questions at a Berlin press conference. But rather than focusing on today&apos;s meetings with the EU and IMF, the German chancellor has spoken about the need to rebuild Europe&apos;s economy.  She told reporters she was is dissatisfied with progress toward new global trade policy agreements, and argued that the G20 group of industrial and developing nations need to agree broad, meaningful financial regulations. Merkel also said that:  We agreed today that the exit from state support measures - so-called exit strategies - need to be co-ordinated as much as possible.  Merkel, of course, is under fire for her handling of the whole Greek crisis. As Evolution&apos;s Gary Jenkins pointed out (see 5.43pm post), if Germany had agreed the bailout a bit faster we might not be looking at a \u20ac120bn package. Over on Comment is free, Benjamin Dierks warns that Merkel&apos;s gamble of pandering to Germans&apos; fears over a Greek bailout could backfire. Here&apos;s a flavour:      Merkel simply reacted to anti-Greek prejudices apparently shared by great numbers in Germany these days, strongly supported by Germany&apos;s biggest tabloid, Bild. &quot;You Greeks are getting nothing from us,&quot; headlines say. When young policymakers of Merkel&apos;s Christian Democrat and Liberal coalition in a newspaper article asked Greece to sell a few of their islands to solve the problem, it was only the beginning of a series of rather unhelpful proposals.  7.10pm: One more interesting comment from Merkel:      I think the handling of the Greece case shows that everyone knows we cannot allow the same situation with countries as with Lehman Brothers."}, {"sentences": ["Menzies Campbell One of the few whose political career eclipsed his sprinting achievements, he stopped running for Britain after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and started running for the Liberals, later the Lib Dems."], "tags": ["Manny Pacquiao", "Philippines", "Boxing", "Lord Coe", "Sir Menzies Campbell", "Sport", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-04-28T11:41:03Z", "title": "Manny Pacquaio will need to box clever", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/28/manny-pacquaio-sportsmen-politics", "article": "Manny beware.

Attending last month&apos;s nuclear summit in Washington, Hatoyama&apos;s officials lobbied hard for a one-on-one meeting between their man and Barack Obama. The request was brusquely rebuffed. Instead the Japanese prime minister had to settle for a rushed 10 minutes sitting next to Obama at dinner, making his points while his host consulted the menu. In Tokyo, his treatment was described as humiliating. More extraordinary still, according to US press accounts, Obama bluntly informed Hatoyama that he was &quot;running out of time&quot; to settle the dispute over relocation of a US Marine Corps base at Futenma, on Okinawa, and asked him to his face whether he could be trusted. Japanese officials were reportedly so affronted by Obama&apos;s rudeness that they did not distribute the usual written record of the exchanges. It got worse. Hatoyama&apos;s presumption in appearing to challenge US security interests, and Obama&apos;s rough handling of him, led Washington Post gossip columnist Al Kamen to label him the summit&apos;s &quot;biggest loser&quot;. Kamen said Obama administration officials had ridiculed the Japanese leader as &quot;increasingly loopy&quot;. This in turn provoked a media frenzy in Japan, as translators tried to establish exactly how insulting &quot;loopy&quot; really was. A top aide to Hatoyama criticised the term as &quot;somewhat impolite&quot;. But then, to everyone&apos;s amazement, Hatoyama went to the Diet (parliament) and suggested, self-deprecatingly, that the description may be accurate. &quot;As the Washington Post says, I may certainly be a foolish prime minister,&quot; he said, before going on to admit that he could have handled the Futenma base issue sooner and better. Hatoyama&apos;s Democratic party won in a landslide last August, ending 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the conservative Liberal Democrats who by and large submitted unquestioningly to Washington&apos;s will. His ideas about giving Japan a more independent voice in the world, of loosening the American harness, were actually quite modest and mostly unlikely to be implemented. But far from respecting the voters&apos; verdict, the US responded with bullying, name-calling, arm-twisting and exaggerated warnings about the consequences for Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, culminating in the banquet snub. Now Hatoyama&apos;s self-criticism suggests he may not last much longer. Given his relatively more provocative views on nuclear disarmament, closer British ties with a united Europe, and the importance of upholding human rights, even in &quot;war on terror&quot; conflict zones, &quot;prime minister&quot; Clegg could be assured of a yet rougher, Kinnock-esque reception in Washington \u2013 though even brasher Americans may hesitate to suggest the elected leader of their closest military ally was off his nut. Clegg may also wonder, in such circumstances, how long he could hold on to power. Hatoyama must certainly be wondering himself. The growing perception among Japanese voters that he is weakly bowing to US demands on Futenma, reinforced by his apologetic talk in Okinawa today about the need for compromise, has greatly undermined him. A majority believes he should resign if he loses the Futenma fight or misses his self-imposed deadline of the end of May for settling it. In the latest poll, only nine months after he swept to victory, his approval rating is down to 21%. Some analysts say he is playing for time, hoping to fudge the issue until after July&apos;s upper house parliamentary elections. Some suggest he may be replaced. Factors other than US pressure have contributed to Hatoyama&apos;s plight, including Japan&apos;s government debt problems (bigger even than Britain&apos;s) and a &quot;money politics&quot; sleaze scandal. But at the same time, Obama&apos;s hardball tactics could backfire. With the LDP opposition in disarray, the Democrats are likely to be in power for some years to come. Resentment of America, fed by sympathy for the fierce opposition of many Okinawans to the overbearing 49,000-strong US presence there, could actually solidify and spread if Japan is humiliated. And China will surely welcome, and encourage, fractures in the US-Japan alliance. As president, Obama has gained a reputation, fairly or unfairly, for disregarding America&apos;s friends while coddling its enemies, for appeasing upstart dictators while alienating old allies. Hatoyama&apos;s crusade against Japan&apos;s &quot;old politics&quot; looks like being one casualty. If he were to take office, Clegg would also encounter formidable US hostility to some of his ideas. He may do well to consult Tokyo&apos;s thwarted change-maker before venturing across the Atlantic."}, {"sentences": ["Whatever, it&apos;s a slick urban racer with power-ups, more than 50 licensed vehicles and 30 worldwide locations, including glamorous cities like Barcelona, Tokyo, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as, well, not so glamorous settings.", "Brighton&apos;s seafront is wonderfully recreated, all ornate Victorian architecture and wide open promenades, while Tokyo has its neon-drenched skyscrapers and the San Francisco &quot;Sausalito&quot; circuit takes in a jaunt along the beach with the Golden Gate Bridge glowing in the distance."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "PlayStation", "PC", "Games consoles"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-06T08:00:03Z", "title": "Blur: hands-on with Activision's rocket-powered racer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/may/05/blur-bizarre-creations-activision", "article": "Six months might not be a lifetime in game development, but it can certainly make a hell of a difference. At the end of last year, Blur was practically finished. Liverpool-based studio Bizarre Creations could have handed the game over to its new publisher, Activision, and then watched as it hit the shelves for an always desirable Christmas release.  But the development team wasn&apos;t happy. The game didn&apos;t feel right, the balance wasn&apos;t there. It looked to them like a seven out of 10. That wasn&apos;t going to be good enough. This isn&apos;t just PR puff \u2013 I know Bizarre Creations of old. I came here in 2000, while they were creating the agenda-setting Dreamcast driving sim, Metropolis Street Racer. I watched as the MD of the studio Martin Chudley, sat hunched over a PC keyboard late into the night, obsessively tweaking a minor element of the handling engine. The result was a benchmark title that would now be considered alongside Gran Turismo if it had been on PlayStation 2 rather than Sega&apos;s doomed console. So perhaps recognising this culture of perfectionism rather than panic, Activision gave the team a deadline extension. Six months later, it seems like this was a good call. Blur, as it stands today, could be one of the most enjoyable driving games of the year \u2013 it might even be to this generation what Burnout was in the PlayStation 2 era: a disruptive moment of off-message genius.On paper, it&apos;s an easy game to sum up. &quot;Mario Kart meets Need for Speed&quot; will do it, or the more catchy &quot;Wipeout meets Burnout&quot;. Whatever, it&apos;s a slick urban racer with power-ups, more than 50 licensed vehicles and 30 worldwide locations, including glamorous cities like Barcelona, Tokyo, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as, well, not so glamorous settings. Like Hackney. And for the first few minutes, it is a rather weird experience \u2013 here are accurately modelled super cars like the Audi R8 and Mustang GTR Concept, racing over glowing pick-up icons and firing missiles. But then, very quickly, you remember that brilliant driving games don&apos;t have to adhere to slavish realism. The highways of California don&apos;t really look the way they do in Outrun, and nothing on this Earth resembles the world conjured into existence by Mario Kart. But they are among the greatest racers ever created, engineered during an era when driving games were the mainstream genre. And importantly, the power-ups aren&apos;t just there for the sake of it, as a USP to stick on the back of the box. They&apos;re there to enhance the racing experience. As lead designer Gareth Wilson explains: &quot;In the beginning, we were just trying to identify what was good about racing games. And it&apos;s overtaking. So the first stage of the design was, well, lets push the number of cars on the track up to 20. It made a difference but it still wasn&apos;t exciting enough. And that&apos;s when the power ups came in. The goal with them is to make players change position more often, so you get that constant battling. That&apos;s really why they&apos;re there. It&apos;s not like we suddenly went, &apos;we must make a power-up racing game&apos;.&quot; This sense of integration is clear from the selection on offer, and how they work in the game. There are eight items to pick up throughout a race, providing a range of defensive and offensive options. Shunt fires a homing projectile at the car immediately in front; Barge sends out a wave of energy that hits all the cars around you; Shock drops three domes of disruptive power right in front of the leading driver; and Bolt fires three projectiles along your line of sight, like a car-mounted railgun. Then you have mines to drop, a shield that protects you from damage for several seconds, and, of course, a nitro boost. Finally, when there&apos;s smoke pouring from your engine and shards of metal hanging off your chassis, the Repair power-up patches things up nicely. It&apos;s not an enormous range, but each power-up has a variety of uses, adding significant tactical depth. For example, Barge will knock-out incoming power-ups as well as repel nearby cars, whereas holding down on the left analogue stick while firing a nitro will put on the air brakes, crushing any car that hits you from behind. Importantly, none of the options provide an insta-kill like the shells in Mario Kart \u2013 they can all be avoided.  Also, players can store up to three pick-ups in slots visible behind the car, toggling between them using the left bumper button, before hitting X to fire one off. This opens up a frenzied duelling mechanic, with drivers trading attacks and parries as they scorch through the circuit.      Blur video game    The instinctive scissor, paper, stone interplay feels a heck of a lot like Street Fighter \u2013 a reference that Wilson is more than happy to recognise: &quot;I&apos;m so glad you said that! This is an interesting one because Paul Kirby, the lead gameplay programmer, came back from GDC last year and was raving about this Street Fighter presentation that was all about counters. They showed a video of two Japanese guys fighting at a tournament and it was just counter, counter, counter \u2013 they virtually did no damage to each other. At the end, it timed out, and one of them had done one hit in the whole round! That was one of the things that really pushed us with the power-ups \u2013 to make it feel like counters and strategy. The power-ups went through tons of iteration, but the thing that really changed was the evasion stuff \u2013 the idea that every power-up can be blocked or avoided. And that really came out after Kirbs returned from that Street Fighter talk.&quot; For a weapons-based road brawler, the handling model is sublime \u2013 a rakish combination of PGR&apos;s rigorous physics detailing, with an intuitive and forgiving arcade feel. When the Dodge Viper&apos;s wheels slip out from beneath you on the dirt roads of the Mojave Desert, it feels super-authentic. But at the same time, you can happily flick your back end off rails and other roadside objects without sending your car into a dramatic race-ending death spin. And of course, when you&apos;re hit from behind by an explosive charge, you car lifts into the air, somersaults, then lands and continues the race. We&apos;re not in Project Gotham anymore. Balancing all this will be the key to Blur&apos;s success. What they don&apos;t want is idiots using the track barriers to grind round every bend at top speed, never implementing a single skilful cornering manoeuvre. &quot;We&apos;ve fiddled the physics a bit,&quot; Wilson admits. &quot;To make the game feel good, we make the cars bounce off things \u2013 it&apos;s the restitution value if you want to get technical \u2013 it&apos;s higher than it should be so they bounce more than they would in the real world. But if a player is grinding around the walls like a log flume, we turn down the restitution value, which effectively makes the wall become sticky. The longer you touch it, the more speed you lose.&quot; But at the same time, no penalty or slight misjudgement ever takes you out of the race for more than a few fleeting seconds, there&apos;s always a chance to catch up. &quot;I think people get turned off by the unforgiving nature of most racing games,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;Project Gotham was terrible for this \u2013 it was its curse and its blessing, but if you didn&apos;t do your first corner very well, that was it really. You&apos;d pause and replay. It was a replay racer. Trials HD is a bit like that: it&apos;s great, but it&apos;s great for a certain group of people. Classics like Sega Rally, Daytona, Outrun, anyone could play those. My dad couldn&apos;t play PGR, but he could play Blur.&quot; Visually, the game is as slick, detailed and crammed with scenic props as you&apos;d expect from a product arriving several years into the current hardware cycle. In urban areas, the intricately realised buildings crowd in on you, occasionally opening out to offer glimpses of familiar landmarks. Brighton&apos;s seafront is wonderfully recreated, all ornate Victorian architecture and wide open promenades, while Tokyo has its neon-drenched skyscrapers and the San Francisco &quot;Sausalito&quot; circuit takes in a jaunt along the beach with the Golden Gate Bridge glowing in the distance. On offroad tracks, meanwhile, the endless scrublands merge with the looming cloudy sky, creating an unexpectedly moody setting for a knockabout weapons-based racer.  The single-player career mode pits you against a series of nine &quot;bosses&quot;, each of whom offers a selection of driving events, ranging from straightforward street racers to arena-based destruction derbies. As Wilson explains: &quot;Khan, one of the guys you met early on is a precise but quite cautious driver, so all of his chapter is structured around technically demanding tracks, which aren&apos;t as power-up based. Drake, however, drives around in a big Hummer and he&apos;s all about destruction and beating the crap out of other drivers. For all of those events, we tune the AI to be cautious or aggressive, to pick up certain power-ups, to take certain racing lines.&quot; Each chapter ends with a one-on-one race against the relevant boss \u2013 win this, and you get their car, plus a vehicle mod, which is exclusive to the single-player mode. The structure is deliberately sympathetic to non-petrol heads. You only have to come in the top three to complete a stage, and you can progress to the next chapter without taking on the boss character if you prefer. Compete stylishly and successfully and you also start to attract fans, which essentially work as the game&apos;s in-game currency: the more you get the more cars you unlock. You start with Class D models \u2013 the Focus RS or Chevrolet Camaro, for example \u2013 and work your way up to Class A, where you&apos;ll find the likes of the Koenigsegg CCX-R and Viper GTSR. It&apos;s also possible to upgrade and customise each model, as well as opening different versions depending on your allegiances to drift, tuner or other racing subcultures. Throughout the career mode, Bizarre Creations has retained a nice sense of social competition. Before each race, the menu screen shows a leaderboard of your friends&apos; best times and, as in Need for Speed Shift, you&apos;re able to select one pal as a rival, who you then set out to beat in every event. More innovative, though, is the clever Friend Challenges option. If you perform spectacularly well in a career race, you can then use the Xbox Live messaging service to issue a challenge to a mate, letting them know the circuit, car and time, and giving them the chance to beat your performance \u2013 you can even add an insulting message to the challenge, though this may backfire if they ace the track and smash your record. Interestingly, you don&apos;t need a Gold account to deliver and receive these challenges, and you&apos;re also able to accept challenges based around vehicles and circuits that you haven&apos;t yet unlocked, giving you a sneak preview of what&apos;s to come. Players can even boast about achievements and issue challenges via Twitter and another soon-to-be-announced social networking partner, allowing some cross-platform rivalries to develop between Xbox 360, PC and PS3 owners. As you&apos;d expect from the makers of PGR, one of the first racing games to get to grips with the Xbox Live era, the multiplayer functionality is, to say the least, epic. For a start there&apos;s a huge range of modes from basic circuit races, to the arena-based deathmatch-style mayhem of Motor Mash, to Team Racing, which lets you drop off power-ups for your stablemates adding yet more tactical range. Project Gotham fans may also appreciate the Hardcore Racing option, which turns off all the power-ups and ramps up the damage \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s effectively PGR for free,&quot; says Wilson. And of course, players will be able to generate their own custom events, tweaking damage, respawn timings, handicaps, AI and power-up selection to their specific requirements. An online Community area will regularly take the most popular settings to create playlists of specialised events. There are also plenty of little extras, some of which owe a debt to Modern Warfare. Players are able to take on in-game challenges to attract extra fans, ranging from wrecking three cars to performing 10 nitro jumps or soaring over 120m through the air. Plus, at the end of every race, there&apos;s a variety of &quot;awards&quot; handed out to players based on their performance \u2013 stuff like fastest lap, most cars wrecked and one named &quot;Squirrel&quot;, for the player who picks up and the most power-ups. Most significant though, is the massive Mod Shop, which can be gradually unlocked by earning fans and ranking up through the game. This section offers a range of cool perks classed into three categories: offensive, defensive and the more vague &quot;game-changing&quot;. Players can carry three at any one time and there&apos;s stuff like fast re-spawns, Magnet, which pulls in power-ups from further away, and Decoy Drops \u2013 mines disguised as power-ups.  More dramatic, are the likes of &quot;Silent Running&quot; which renders your car invisible (until you fire a power-up or take damage), and the amusing &apos;Last Gasp&apos;, which Wilson explains: &quot;when you go to zero health, instead of dying, your car becomes this big bomb \u2013 it starts rattling and shaking and anytime up to ten seconds after reaching zero health, you can press A and the car explodes damaging everyone nearby. It&apos;s quite tactical in Motor Mash because you can wreck a lot of cars with it, but it&apos;s really just fun.&quot; Add in the fact that many tracks have multiple routes, as well as ramps, chasms and myriad obstacles, and you have an extraordinary combination of lighting fast tactical driving (and, my God, it&apos;s fast) and laugh-out-loud combat. It is, of course, going up against the similarly dynamic Split/Second, with its high concept environmental destruction, but at this stage Blur feels like the weightier, more lasting option. The team is already planning a wealth of DLC as well as fresh multiplayer tweaks and other extras, so we can expect a thriving online scene; little wonder the recent multiplayer beta attracted hundreds of thousands of gamers. In short, this game looks to be where the true joy of old skool arcade racing collides with the social, cross-platform functionality of the 21st century console. It is controlled insanity, it doesn&apos;t make any sense. But it doesn&apos;t matter. I think I&apos;ve seen the future of mainstream racing games \u2013 it&apos;s blurry."}, {"sentences": ["Nintendo shares closed down 3.3% in Tokyo before the results were announced."], "tags": ["Technology sector", "Nintendo", "Business", "Technology", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-06T11:23:00Z", "title": "Nintendo hit by global gaming downturn and rivals' renaissance", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/06/nintendo-hit-by-global-gaming-downturn", "article": "Nintendo has suffered its first fall in annual profits for six years after sales were hit by drastic price cuts, a strong yen and a downturn in the global gaming market. The world&apos;s biggest maker of video game machines today said its net profit fell 18% to \u00a5228.6bn (\u00a31.6bn) in the year through to the end of March, from a \u00a5279bn profit the previous year. Annual sales fell 22% to \u00a51.4 trillion. The firm, which has been locked in battle with rivals Sony and Microsoft, and more recently Apple, for a decisive stake in the global gaming industry, said operating profit had fallen 36% to \u00a5356.5bn in the 12 months to the end of March. It said it expected sales to fall 2.4% this year to \u00a51.4tn and for earnings to slide 12.5% to \u00a5200bn. Huge global demand for its Wii and DS consoles had helped lift Nintendo to three straight years of record profits through to March last year, but it has suffered from a revival in competition from Microsoft and Sony, as well as new and more sophisticated game applications for the iPhone and iPad. Nintendo said it expects to sell 18m Wii consoles this year compared with more than 20m last year, but it forecast DS sales to rise to 30m from just over 27m in 2009. Sales received a boost during the Christmas shopping season after Nintendo reduced the price of the Wii in Japan from \u00a525,000 to \u00a520,000 and by a similar amount in the US. 3D hopes It hopes to capitalize on the shift to three-dimensional home entertainment with the release by the end of next March of a 3D handheld console that does not require special glasses. The firm is expected to give more details of the machine at this summer&apos;s E3 show in Los Angeles. Nintendo will have been buoyed by robust demand for its DS series, which now includes a version with a larger screen. Worldwide, the firm behind the Pokemon and Super Mario characters has sold almost 129m DS consoles, outstripping sales of its Game Boy series, which appeared in 1989. Sales of the Wii home-use console are more of a concern, however, with Nintendo pinning its hopes for a sales revival on the introduction of a heart-rate tracker, or &quot;vitality sensor&quot;, for the Wii later this year. It faces fresh competition from upcoming 3D versions of games for Microsoft&apos;s Xbox 360 and Sony&apos;s PlayStation 3, although those will require gamers to wear 3D glasses. By pitching its products to casual gamers put off by the more complex software packages available for other machines, Nintendo has overtaken Sony to produce the most popular consoles on the market. The Wii, with its motion-sensitive wands, was credited with creating a new generation of gamers through games that could be quickly understood by young children, their parents and grandparents. The challenge for its president, Satoru Iwata, will be to repeat that sales feat with the new 3D version of the DS, analysts said. Nintendo shares closed down 3.3% in Tokyo before the results were announced. Its shares have easily outperformed the Nikkei average, gaining 39.1% so far this year."}, {"sentences": ["The work was hardly performed again until the conductor Gerd Albrecht persuaded the composer to allow the text to be translated back into Japanese, with the vocal lines adjusted accordingly, for a performance in Tokyo in 2003."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-06T21:15:01Z", "title": "Henze: Gogo no Eiko | Classical review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/henze-gogo-no-eiko-albrecht", "article": "Hans Werner Henze&apos;s opera, based on Yukio Mishima&apos;s novella Gogo No Eiko (usually translated as The Sailor Who Fell from Grace With the Sea), was first performed in 1990, under the title Das Verratene Meer (The Treacherous Ocean). It was not a success: the German libretto was clunky, its dramatic pacing inconsistent. The work was hardly performed again until the conductor Gerd Albrecht persuaded the composer to allow the text to be translated back into Japanese, with the vocal lines adjusted accordingly, for a performance in Tokyo in 2003. Henze was so encouraged by the new lease of life for his score that he composed more than 30 minutes&apos; extra music for it; most operatic reworkings shorten the original, but this revision is longer. The curious thing is that it seems to work. I only heard the original Verratene Meer once, at the Berlin premiere 20 years ago, when its shortcomings were only too obvious, but this recording, taken from the concert performance of\u00a0Gogo No Eiko at the Salzburg festival in 2006, reveals an often rapturously beautiful score in which the story of a young widow, Fusako, who falls in love with a merchant navy officer, Ryuji, is intertwined with that of her son, who belongs to a violent teenage gang who murder the seaman. It&apos;s a slightly queasy mix of eroticism and violence, but what&apos;s striking about the score now is the tact and subtlety with which Henze presents it.

Sotheby&apos;s announced over the weekend that it will sell Self-portrait With a Palette, painted by Edouard Manet in 1878, at its next London auction of impressionist and modern art. It comes in a year when the auction record for any work of art has been broken twice, first for a Giacometti Walking Man sculpture in London in February \u2013 sold for \u00a365m ($104.3m) \u2013 and then last week Picasso&apos;s Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, which went for $106.4m in New York. Super-rich art collectors are, it seems, prepared to spend enormous amounts of money for the right works, and the Manet can be expected to attract huge bids. Charles Moffett, a Sotheby&apos;s executive vice-president who curated an important Manet exhibition in Paris and New York in 1993, called it &quot;not only the greatest Manet portrait in private hands, but also one of the very greatest self-portraits in the entire canon of art history&quot;. The only other Manet self-portrait is in the Bridgestone Museum of Art in Tokyo. That is a full-length portrayal, while the Cohen Manet is half-bodied. Cohen began collecting art 10 years ago. His adviser Sandy Heller told the New York Times: &quot;It was one of Steve&apos;s first purchases. Now it&apos;s time for the painting to live another life.&quot; Aside from the possibility of it making a huge amount of money \u2013 it&apos;s value has been conservatively estimated at \u00a320m-\u00a330m \u2013 its sale could also reflect Cohen&apos;s changing tastes. He has moved swiftly from impressionists to modern artists including Damien Hirst and Marc Quinn, one of whose frozen blood heads greets visitors to the headquarters of Cohen&apos;s hedge fund, SAC Capital. The importance of the Manet can perhaps be seen by looking at the roster of previous owners which include Auguste Pellerin \u2013 a margarine magnate who amassed one of the most important art collections of his time \u2013 and then noted collectors the Marquise de Ganay, Jakob Goldschmidt and Wall Street investor John Loeb. Sotheby&apos;s co-chairman of impressionist and modern art, Melanie Clore, said: &quot;At a time when there is such enormous demand for museum quality paintings by the Impressionist masters, it is exciting to bring this extremely rare painting to auction.&quot; It will be sold in June, one lot in a month of sales that will be watched keenly by art market observers. Sotheby&apos;s rival Christie&apos;s has already announced that it will sell Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos;s Picasso \u2013 Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto, or The Absinthe Drinker \u2013 which at \u00a330m-\u00a340m has been given the biggest ever pre-sale estimate for a work auctioned in Europe."}, {"sentences": ["Put your own house in order.&quot; The response, slow in coming but staggering in its implications, surfaced after the Tokyo markets opened."], "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Euro", "Market turmoil", "European Union", "Financial crisis", "European Central Bank", "World news", "Business", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-10T18:23:46Z", "title": "Euro strikes back with biggest gamble in its 11-year history", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/10/euro-debt-crisis-rescue-package", "article": "At half past two this morning, teams of EU number crunchers staggered out of an ugly pink granite building in Brussels after 12 hours of mind-numbing argument over bond spreads, yields, special purpose vehicles, secondary market interventions and contingency liabilities. As EU finance ministers yawned and sought a bed, one had been whisked off to hospital \u2013 Germany&apos;s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Another, Jacek Rostowski, the Polish finance minister, needed an emergency dentist after a screaming match left him missing a crown on a tooth. Many were in a foul mood. Others quietly celebrated. The dry language of the three documents they agreed concealed the biggest decisions taken in the EU in years. Hobbled by lacklustre leadership, eternally sunk in narcissistic navel-gazing, the EU suddenly rose to the occasion. Europe was striking back. At 2.45am, Elena Salgado, Spain&apos;s finance minister, and Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for monetary affairs, emerged red-eyed to announce a euro rescue package worth up to \u20ac750bn, nearly a trillion US dollars. Jaws dropped. The currency&apos;s fate hung in the balance. What began seven months ago as an incipient crisis in the Balkans over Greece&apos;s sovereign debt was spreading along the shores of the Mediterranean. The gamblers on the markets jabbed at Portugal and Spain, trained their sights on Ireland and Italy, and tested the political will of Europe&apos;s leaders to defend their common currency. For weeks they were warned and found wanting. Last week at a Brussels lunch, Joe Biden, the US vice-president, privately voiced alarm to the heads of the European commission and the European council. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, also privately warned EU government leaders. When those leaders dined at an emergency summit in Brussels on Friday evening, Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, told them: &quot;Don&apos;t tell me what I have to do. Put your own house in order.&quot; The response, slow in coming but staggering in its implications, surfaced after the Tokyo markets opened. Salgado beamed. There was more. Trichet had been listening on Friday and the financial hair shirts at the ECB in Frankfurt were dumping the habits of 11 years to hoover up dodgy debt from fiscally incontinent Club Med governments. &quot;For instance, a decision has been taken to intervene in the secondary markets of government securities,&quot; said Rehn, masking the bombshell with masterly understatement. &quot;Yes we can,&quot; bragged an EU diplomat. When the Monday markets got going, European stocks surged and the euro made its biggest gains in 18 months. For the first time since the Greek crisis erupted to expose the basic frailties and contradictions of the great experiment in monetary union, Europe was ahead of the game. Bruised and battered Brussels was smiling again. &quot;It shows that they&apos;re serious, despite all the squabbling,&quot; said Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform. The deal allows the European commission to dole out \u20ac60bn in credit to troubled eurozone governments quickly, within 48 hours, as a first line of defence against the predators on the markets. That is buttressed by a plan by the 16 governments of the eurozone to raise \u20ac440bn in loans and loan guarantees to bail out stricken member states. Then the IMF is to stump up another \u20ac250bn. Plus the central banks, gritting their teeth, will bow to pressure to buy up government bonds from the markets since they are not allowed to buy directly from the governments. All of this meant that this was probably the biggest day for the euro since it was born 11 years ago. But the impact of the package goes far beyond the currency and the parlous state of European public finances. Behind the mammoth bet that Europe placed early this morning lies a titanic political struggle over what kind of union this should be and how the European economy is run. It is a contest of contrasting visions that has been running for 15 years, since before the launch of monetary union, but which has been raging since the start of the year, triggered by the need for drastic measures to contain the Greek contagion. At its most basic, this is a Franco-German clash over the means and ends of economic, financial, and fiscal policy in Europe, specifically in the eurozone. The Germans are sticklers for rigour, peer pressure and discipline, against coming to the aid of the stragglers, devoted to absolute independence for the central bank whose brief is confined to ensuring the stability of the currency and guarding against inflation. The French push a more political, expansive approach, arguing the euro rules be geared to economic growth and jobs, tighter co-ordination of national policies, and greater harmonisation of, for example, tax and spending policies. The Germans won in the 1990s when the euro rule book was being written. But yesterday&apos;s game changer was a French script. In the fighting of the past several months, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has won most of the battles, but has lost this particular war. Berlin dictated the terms for the \u20ac110bn euro Greek bailout agreed last week, but had to bow to the bailout itself, which it did not want. Ditto at the weekend. The eurozone&apos;s new \u20ac750bn security blanket comes with lots of German strings attached (the details, the mechanisms, the decision procedures, the IMF involvement are all based on the Greek template). But Berlin foots the biggest bill and the currency crisis has exposed seething anti-European grievances in the EU&apos;s most indispensable country. &quot;They&apos;ve torn up the euro no-bailout clause and the rule that the European Central Bank should not finance government deficits,&quot; said Daniel Gros, a German economist who heads the Brussels Centre for European Policy Studies. &quot;The ECB has lost its independence.&quot; The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the authoritative voice of Germany&apos;s conservative elite, complained: &quot;All the principles of the currency union have been sacrificed \u2026 All the stability rules are being broken to save the euro. How can that work out well? This presages the fate of the euro as a soft currency and the failure of monetary union.&quot; Germans&apos; savings and private pensions were doomed, it added. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, by contrast, cannot contain his glee. At the summit of eurozone leaders that ended early on Saturday, setting up today&apos;s mega bailout, Sarkozy saluted the onward march of French-inspired &quot;economic governance&quot; across Europe. About 95% of what was decided, he boasted, was made in France. Merkel sloped off into the night with barely a word. It has been a wretched week for the German leader. On Friday, before coming to Brussels, she pressed the Bundestag to stump up more than \u20ac22bn in credits for Greece. Tomorrow she returns to the podium to hector the Reichstag into agreeing another \u20ac120bn to save the euro. In between, only seven months into her second term, she slumped to a disastrous defeat on Sunday in the biggest election in Germany this year. She is accused of dithering. The shock decision to mobilise hundreds of billions of euros does nothing to fix the fundamental malaise plaguing Europe \u2013 the vast macro-economic imbalances within the eurozone. But the package takes the pressure off, removes the short-term likelihood of sovereign debt default in southern Europe, buys time for struggling countries to get their acts together, and for Brussels, Berlin, and Paris to enact new policies. In every crisis, a big opportunity, they like to say in Brussels. That invariably means &quot;more Europe&quot;. But the disillusion in Germany and the bad blood between Berlin and Paris could also signal a slow-motion process of disengagement and alienation at the union&apos;s heart. That leaves Europe limping. &quot;All this has highlighted the strains between Berlin and Paris,&quot; said Grant. &quot;The big loser is the Franco-German relationship.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It is a movie shot entirely from the POV of a dead drug-dealer as his soul floats above Tokyo \u2013 where the cops have shot him dead \u2013 and watches over his sister."], "tags": ["Cannes film festival", "Film", "Culture", "World cinema", "Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "Cannes 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-11T09:53:02Z", "title": "The Cannes film festival in my head | Peter Bradshaw", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/may/11/cannes-film-festival", "article": "Here we are in Cannes, the day before the official opening: the Tuesday Lull. It&apos;s the calm before the storm, which, traditionally, is not all that calm. The red carpet is still being hammered into place and the Grand Palais prepared by grey-suited officials bustling about everywhere. Last year, my friend Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times told me he saw a Cannes local walk down the Croisette, survey the scene and loudly sigh: &quot;Les conneries commencent \u2026&quot; (&quot;The bullshit begins \u2026&quot;). For journalists covering the festival, this is a time for savouring all the possibilities of movie experience that must surely be available in the next 10 days, before you&apos;re suddenly plunged straight into it, and there never seems to be enough time, and always seems to be one other great new film that you somehow can&apos;t get to see. I blogged last year on the idea that Cannes&apos;s love of Hollywood stars has a kind of pre-history in its pre-war love of English milords. Any psychogeographers in town might care to use this downtime to wander over to the Palais building, and ponder the fact that this stands on the site of the old Cannes casino, where in the 1930s those young English aristocratic revellers Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden won a huge amount of money by betting on the number 17 at roulette. According to Churchill&apos;s biographer Sir Max Hastings, the number became an optimistic talisman for them in the dark days of 1940. &quot;About time number 17 turned up, isn&apos;t it?&quot; Churchill said to Eden, after digesting the news of the BEF&apos;s defeat in France.  For me, there is one sound that powerfully conjures up the Cannes film festival: the sound of the guy who sells Lib\u00e9ration outside the Palais every morning in what is usually the burning sun, crying: &quot;Lib\u00e9! Lib\u00e9! Lib\u00e9! Demandez le monde!&quot; Like the first cuckoo in spring, his voice signals the start of Cannes. But today is always a bit of a lull. So to fill it, I have decided to create my own imaginary, non-existent film festival, taking place only in my head, which I have tentatively called No Cannes Do, consisting of those films which, over the decade I&apos;ve been reporting from Cannes, have been a huge deal here at le festival, but were somehow not released theatrically in the UK. The British filmgoer is perpetually bombarded with dreary mediocre fare, or out-and-out dross \u2013 and yet, mysteriously, some really fascinating Cannes films, genuinely brilliant or bizarre, never make it over the Channel. So here is my official competition list for the inaugural 2010 No Cannes Do festival. La Soledad (or Solitary Fragments, directed by Jaime Rosales) Rosales&apos;s creepy serial-killer drama The Hours of the Day was a big Cannes hit in 2003, and this followup, in Un Certain Regard in 2007, was passionately admired. It picks apart the fragmented lives of women devastated by the Madrid terrorist bomb, and the intricacy and intelligence of Rosales&apos;s directing is a marvel. Why, oh why, did no one want to distribute it in the UK?  En Jouant &quot;Dans la Compagnie des Hommes&quot; (or Playing &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, Arnaud Desplechin) Deplechin&apos;s Christmas Tale and his Kings and Queen got a UK release, but not this, in Un Certain Regard in 2003, despite the British connection. It is a loose, experimental version of Edward Bond&apos;s 1996 play In the Company of Men (nothing to do with the Neil LaBute movie), about an arms manufacturer, set in a dystopian future. The movie is bizarre, fragmented, challenging \u2013 not a masterpiece, but glinting with life and ideas. And Now \u2026 Ladies and Gentlemen (Claude Lelouch) This thoroughly silly and bizarre romantic dramedy-thriller-farce by Lelouch closed the 2002 festival and was simply never heard of again \u2013 although Jonathan Romney of the Independent On Sunday mischievously suggested he might try to get it into the French section of the London film festival. It stars Jeremy Irons, but even hardcore Jeremy Irons fans have mostly never heard of it. Irons plays a jaded criminal mastermind and jewel thief who sets out on a solo round-the-world sailing trip to forget his ennui, and finds love in Morocco. It has a so-bad-it&apos;s-good reputation with the few who have seen it, but I remember this film with affection, chiefly for the gobsmacking moment when Irons&apos;s character \u2013 that master of disguise \u2013 appears in drag as an old lady.  La Moustache (Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re)  Vincent Lindon and Emmanuelle Devos star in this elegant, witty squib about marriage, relationships and intimacy; it was in Directors&apos; Fortnight in 2005. Lindon plays a married man who, on a whim, one day shaves off his moustache. Not only does his wife not notice, but insists he didn&apos;t have a moustache, and an increasingly frantic Lindon can&apos;t find any photos to prove that he did. When we spend so much time with someone, do they become invisible to us? How well do we know our spouses, or ourselves? Milyang (or Secret Sunshine, Lee Chang-dong) Lee&apos;s new film Poetry is in competition this year \u2013 but here is a fascinating and rather shocking film, in the 2007 competition, which never got a British release. A woman goes through unthinkable agony when her child is abducted and killed; her profound Christian faith compels her to visit the convicted killer in prison in order to forgive him and find peace. A highly-strung, highly-charged film. &apos;R Xmas (Abel Ferrara) Abel Ferrara, that crazed auteur, gets mixed reviews for his work these days, despite a revival of interest following the Herzog remake of his Bad Lieutenant. But Cannes has always stayed loyal to Ferrara, and doggedly finds room for his films. Here is a representative example \u2013 it was in Un Certain Regard in 2001 and from there pretty much vanished. Yet, like so many of Ferrara&apos;s films, it had a kind of radioactive grittiness and quotidian horror. A criminal couple achieve an upper-middle-class level of wealth through drug dealing \u2013 but when the husband is kidnapped, his wife must scrape the cash together for the ransom and wonders about the life they have chosen. Kinatay (or Butchery, Brillante Mendoza) At Cannes last year, all the talk was of Lars von Trier&apos;s Antichrist, and how shocking it was. Yet this, from the same lineup, was more shocking. There is no prospect of it getting a UK release \u2013 although it was shown at the London film festival later in the year \u2013 and part of me is profoundly relieved. It really is horrifying. And yet the horror is not gratuitous, and there is a point to it. A young police recruit in Manila is getting married, and needs money. An older colleague tells him about an off-the-record &quot;job&quot;: a group of cops are going to rob and savagely murder a prostitute who has been failing to pay them their &quot;cut&quot; \u2013 partly to terrify the other prostitutes, but partly, Mendoza implies, out of sheer uniformed misogyny and male hate. And why do they need so many guys? To spread the guilt, to implicate as many officers as possible, to bond, and to assist in the closing of ranks, if there is ever any sort of inquiry. A truly horrible film in many ways, and yet seriously intentioned and powerfully made. Ce Jour-L\u00e0 (or That Day, Raoul Ruiz)  Ruiz is one of the world&apos;s most distinctive, perhaps eccentric film-makers \u2013 certainly prolific, and most admired for his version of the last volume of Proust&apos;s In Search of Lost Time: Time Regained. Here is a real oddity from Cannes 2003, about a beautiful heiress, played by Elsa Zylberstein, whose family attempt to kill her for her money, a plot they intend to carry out by letting loose a psychopathic killer in her house, and encouraging him to believe God wants Zylberstein dead. A bizarre, elegant black comedy which British audiences never saw. Pity. The Brown Bunny (Vincent Gallo) Here is the movie which got Vincent Gallo virtually jeered off the Croisette: a crazily self-indulgent and self-important movie selected for the Cannes competition in 2003, in which Gallo stars, writes, directs, produces \u2013 everything. A road movie of sorts, it features Gallo as Bud, a motorcycle racer heading to California to compete once more, and tortured by his past. It was much mocked at the time, and became legendary as the Cannes turkey to end all Cannes turkeys. I have to admit I joined in the derision, but in retrospect, The Brown Bunny had a certain something. If it failed in a big way, that&apos;s because it aimed for something big. Maybe now is the time to revive The Brown Bunny and give it another chance. Enter the Void (Gaspar No\u00e9)  I simply can&apos;t believe that this film, one of the most visually stunning at Cannes 2009, still hasn&apos;t got a UK release. What&apos;s the matter with everyone? Like Kubrick&apos;s 2001, which it very candidly admires, this outrageous head-trip has to be experienced at least once on the big screen, and the Cannes Grand Palais supplied the biggest. It is a movie shot entirely from the POV of a dead drug-dealer as his soul floats above Tokyo \u2013 where the cops have shot him dead \u2013 and watches over his sister. Surely it will get a UK release any day now? Of course, most of these are available on DVD \u2013 except for the No\u00e9, the Deplechin and the Mendoza. But in each case it&apos;s strange to think that a full UK release never happened."}, {"sentences": ["And on a visit to Tokyo, chief executive James Gorman told a press conference: &quot;We&apos;ve not been contacted by the justice department about any transactions that were raised in the WSJ article and we have no knowledge whatsoever of a justice department investigation.&quot; Despite the bank&apos;s denial of knowledge, anxiety has been mounting on Wall Street at the prospect of Goldman Sachs&apos;s legal and ethical woes turning into a contagion across the financial services industry."], "tags": ["Morgan Stanley", "Banking", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Goldman Sachs", "Securities and Exchange Commission", "Business", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-12T16:34:28Z", "title": "Morgan Stanley may be next target of US prosecutors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/12/morgan-stanley-inquiry-claim", "article": "The Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley was struggling to shore up investor confidence today amid fears that it could follow Goldman Sachs into the firing line of US prosecutors who are reportedly investigating two $200m (\u00a3134m) mortgage derivative deals known as the &quot;dead president&quot; transactions. Morgan Stanley&apos;s shares slumped by 4% in early trading on the New York stock exchange after the Wall Street Journal named the bank as a target for a criminal investigation into controversial tactics adopted by firms to bet on a slump in home loans at the beginning of the global financial crisis. Prosecutors are said to looking at packages of mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 named after two 19th century US presidents \u2013 James Buchanan and Andrew Jackson. Morgan Stanley was involved in designing the two synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) sold to investors. The bank&apos;s trading desk is said to have sometimes taken &quot;short&quot; positions on them, betting they would fall in value. Although there is nothing wrong with betting against such securities, banks are under pressure to show that they told clients about the roles played by all the participants in these complex deals. Morgan Stanley did not market the CDOs \u2013 they were underwritten and sold by Citigroup and UBS. The dead president transactions are of a similar type to a Goldman Sachs CDO, Abacus, that is at the centre of a $1bn fraud prosecution launched last month by the US securities and exchange commission. An SEC investigation into a range of Wall Street mortgage deals has been under way since last year and the US justice department, which prosecutes criminal cases, is liaising closely with the regulatory agency. Morgan Stanley issued a formal statement denying any knowledge of a criminal inquiry. And on a visit to Tokyo, chief executive James Gorman told a press conference: &quot;We&apos;ve not been contacted by the justice department about any transactions that were raised in the WSJ article and we have no knowledge whatsoever of a justice department investigation.&quot; Despite the bank&apos;s denial of knowledge, anxiety has been mounting on Wall Street at the prospect of Goldman Sachs&apos;s legal and ethical woes turning into a contagion across the financial services industry. Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement lawyer at Washington law firm Shulman Rogers, said: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be shocked to hear of any parallel criminal investigation into every major investment banking firm involved in sub-prime mortgages.&quot; However, he cautioned that the prospects for full-blown criminal charges remained cloudy, and that cases would be tough to prove: &quot;To expect these things to morph into criminal charges is a long shot because of the complexity of these securities and the level of internal scrutiny these organisations brought to bear on the creation of these instruments.&quot; Although its traders&apos; bets against the dead president CDOs were profitable, Morgan Stanley as a whole lost heavily on the collapse of the US home loans market in 2007 and 2008. In late 2007, the bank&apos;s co-president Zoe Cruz, then known as the most powerful woman on Wall Street, was ousted, taking the blame for losses of $3.7bn on mortgage-backed securities over a two-month period. The conduct of Wall Street firms in constructing mortgage derivatives has spurred a congressional investigation. Hauled before a committee on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, Goldman&apos;s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, came under sustained attack for purportedly allowing his traders to bet against the bank&apos;s own clients. One Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, likened the practice to living in &quot;the La-La Land of ledger entries&quot; under &quot;less oversight than a pit boss in Las Vegas&quot;. Morgan Stanley, which employs 61,000 people in 37 countries, suffered a severe wobble in the weeks following Lehman Brothers&apos; demise in September 2008, as shareholders worried about its losses on the capital markets. The firm was obliged to raise $9bn from Japan&apos;s Mitsubishi to shore up finances after share price collapse of 60% over a five-day period. Along with every other big US bank, the firm accepted bailout money from the US treasury. It paid back its $10bn of taxpayer funding, with interest, in June."}, {"sentences": ["It will give him something to occupy himself during those long, lonely times when Dave is in Tokyo, or Brussels."], "tags": ["Politics", "General election 2010", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Nick Clegg", "David Cameron", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-13T06:00:04Z", "title": "After whirlwind romance, the big day", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/sketch-cameron-clegg-press-conference", "article": "&quot;This is what the new politics looks like,&quot; said Nick Clegg as he stood in the sun-drenched garden of 10 Downing Street.

There were trees in the bright green colours of early summer, a trimmed lawn, the happy couple in their smartest clothes. All it needed was a marquee, a band, and a table for the presents. All the guests marvelled at how happy they looked. And they have so much in common. The groom is from Eton and Oxford. The groom is from Westminster and Cambridge. They handed round copies of the pre-nup, or &quot;coalition agreements reached document&quot; as they call it. Earlier they had posed on the steps of No 10. They might have been conjoined twins.

It was going to usher in the new politics, in which the national interest was more important than party interest. It was a historic, seismic shift! And so quick. By contrast, St Paul spent years changing his mind. Apparently it had nothing to do with the electoral arithmetic. It was all to do with inspiration. &quot;We did both have a choice,&quot; said the prime minister. &quot;We looked at minority government, and we thought: this is so uninspiring!&quot; He was asked how he felt the morning after the night before, hooked up to someone he barely knew and had barely spoken to. As with so many whirlwind romances, the thrill was still electric. &quot;I woke up thinking: &apos;This is so much better than the alternative.&apos; I had a great sense of inspiration and excitement.&quot; Now they would be two teams trying to form one strong team. &quot;Perhaps we&apos;ll share a car, to save petrol!&quot; It&apos;s one of those truisms that are actually true \u2013 two can live as cheaply as one.

Nick gave him a big happy smile. &quot;And I&apos;m looking forward to answering questions from Harriet Harman.&quot; This may have been sarcastic, or possibly not \u2013 I expect Chelsea are looking forward to Portsmouth this weekend. They&apos;ll be sharing accommodation, of course. &quot;There&apos;s a corridor connecting No 10 with where I am, but I don&apos;t yet know where I am,&quot; the deputy prime minister said. That was existential angst. He&apos;ll be told, soon enough. It got more metaphysical. &quot;This will succeed through its success,&quot; said Cameron. Chew on that one. Inevitably there was a bad fairy, who pointed out: &quot;When you were asked what was your favourite joke, you said &apos;Nick Clegg&apos;.&quot; &quot;Did you?&quot; asked Clegg. &quot;I&apos;m afraid I did,&quot; the prime minister replied. &quot;Well, I&apos;m off,&quot; said Clegg, but with a merry smile.

The French president bounded out of the emergency summit of European leaders and on to a specially made-for-TV stage. The tensions were palpable, the theatrics mesmerising. It was well past midnight and the leaders, charged with saving the euro, were getting nowhere fast after a fine Friday supper. Greece might be saved. But Portugal? Ireland? Spain? Even Italy? Assorted weary diplomats and eurocrats in the corridors of the unlovely Justus Lipsius building in Brussels were predicting an all-nighter when the text messages started pinging and the closed-circuit TV screens flashed the message: &quot;Sarkozy press conference&quot;. The summit was over. It was 12.30am. Sarkozy and his entourage swept into the French delegation&apos;s media room, which had been given a makeover \u2013 fancy lighting, a big blue backdrop with a special summit logo behind the president, the 16 flags of the eurozone countries. Sarkozy claimed the political leadership of the 16 members, announced a defining victory against the markets and the &quot;speculators&quot; wrecking the currency. The metaphors were all martial. Europe was at war. He would not give away his &quot;lines of defence&quot;. But by the time the markets opened on Monday morning, the enemy would have learned its lessons and beat a retreat. In the previous hour upstairs at the summit, Sarkozy had thrown a wobbly. &quot;It was really a drama,&quot; said an experienced European diplomat. &quot;A very abrupt end to a summit \u2013 because Sarkozy said he had had enough and really forced Merkel to face her responsibility.&quot; A European Commission official added: &quot;He was shouting and bawling. The Germans were being very difficult, and not only the Germans. It was a big fight between Sarkozy and Merkel.&quot; A French finance ministry official said: &quot;Our beloved and fearless leader loves this kind of situation. It may have been that he was a little forceful, and I think that he would have been right to be, because it was a serious situation in there.&quot; Deadly serious. Merkel said this week that the crisis triggered initially by Greece&apos;s debt problems had called the EU&apos;s future into question \u2013 that the EU was facing its biggest challenge since 1990, the collapse of communism and the unification of Germany. According to senior Spanish government officials quoted by Spain&apos;s El Pais, Sarkozy called Merkel&apos;s bluff on what, 48 hours later, turned into a massive financial package that has rewritten the way the single currency functions and changed the European Union in fundamental ways that may take years to play out. &quot;If at a time like this, with all that is happening, Europe is not capable of a united response, then the euro makes no sense,&quot; Sarkozy told the eurozone leaders, according to El Paistoday. It quoted the Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, as telling his colleagues this week that Sarkozy threatened to quit Europe&apos;s monetary union. &quot;Sarkozy went as far as banging his fist on the table and threatening to leave the euro,&quot; one unnamed Zapatero colleague told the paper. &quot;That obliged Angel Merkel to bend and reach an agreement.&quot; The French had Spain, Italy, Portugal and the European Commission lined up behind them. On the other side stood Germany, ranged alongside the Dutch, the Austrians and the Finns, all quietly hoping Merkel would prevail. The leaders&apos; after-dinner debate signalled that Europe was in the throes of an existential crisis, according to diplomats and officials familiar with the proceedings. &quot;This discussion touched on the very sinews of the state,&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;It was a fundamental discussion about sovereignty, about the role of the member state, about what the EU is for, the role and power of the European Commission,&quot; said a second diplomat. Sarkozy claimed the outcome as a famous victory. In fact, he had bought himself some time, with the leaders agreeing to convene an emergency session of the EU&apos;s 27 finance ministers the next day to agree the fine print. By 2.15am on Monday, the deal was done: a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3639bn) safety net for the single currency, made up of three elements \u2013 a fast-track fund run by the European Commission, a much larger system of loans and loan guarantees from the 16 eurozone governments, with the International Monetary Fund putting up one euro for every two from the Europeans. Europe was opting for shock and awe. Repeatedly in the past two weeks, Merkel has declared that &quot;politics has to reassert primacy over the financial markets&quot;. This was the attempt. But a decisive factor in swaying the argument may have come not from Berlin, Paris, or Brussels, but from Washington. Since their first summit on the Greek crisis on 11 February, the Europeans had been prevaricating, agonising, and quarrelling. Prompt action in an emergency is not the strongest suit of a union of 27 governments. Washington was frustrated. &quot;The Americans were complaining that there was no credibility in the way the Europeans take decisions,&quot; said one diplomat. By last week, Washington had had enough as the crisis threatened to spiral out of control. In Brussels and Madrid, Joe Biden, the US vice-president, privately told European leaders to get their act together. A few hours before the Sarkozy show on 7 May, Timothy Geithner, the US treasury secretary, pressed European finance ministers for a big decision and promised help from the US Federal Reserve or central bank. Then last Sunday, President Barack Obama went on the phone to Sarkozy and Merkel. &quot;The \u20ac750bn fund was the idea of the Americans, who insisted on the need to mobilise massive money to impress the markets and to stop bleeding confidence. That was their concrete message,&quot; said a diplomat. Tellingly, the White House confirmed that Merkel, not Sarkozy, was the main obstacle to a decision staggering in its scale and ambition. Obama and Sarkozy &quot;agreed&quot; on the need for urgent action, while Obama and Merkel &quot;discussed&quot; the need for urgent action. By early on Monday, the finance ministers were rushing to meet Sarkozy&apos;s promise that the huge rescue package would be ready by the times the markets opened in the far east. They missed the deadline for Australia and New Zealand. Outline agreement had been reached on the European fund of \u20ac500bn. But who would control it? The Germans insisted it had to be national governments, not the European Commission. They won that argument and Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, pushed for a rapid conclusion before the Tokyo traders switched on their computer screens. As argument continued over how to label the rescue, the Dutch conjured a new concept that kept everyone happy \u2013 a &quot;special purposes vehicle&quot;. The deal was done. France had won. Germany had lost. &quot;This was supposed to be a German euro. It&apos;s turned into a French euro,&quot; complained a German expert. By Wednesday, with the implications of Europe&apos;s giant leap in the dark beginning to dawn, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, went further. Seeking to build on last weekend&apos;s breakthrough, he proposed even stronger measures to shore up the euro. The safety net agreed, despite German hostility, is temporary \u2013 for three years. Barroso said it should be permanent. He wanted member states&apos; budgets to be &quot;peer reviewed&quot; by his boffins and European finance ministries before they went before national parliaments. A direct assault on national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy, complained many. Barroso&apos;s argument was for full-fledged harmonisation of tax and spending policies among the countries sharing the currency, otherwise the euro had no future. &quot;Let&apos;s be clear. You can&apos;t have a monetary union without having an economic union,&quot; he said. &quot;Member states should have the courage to say whether they want an economic union or not. And if they don&apos;t, it&apos;s better to forget monetary union altogether.&quot; And in Aachen the next day, Merkel started talking about &quot;the pound, the deutschmark, the franc, and the drachma&quot;. It sounded almost nostalgic for the old, simpler days of Germans&apos; love affair with their national currency, though her speech was to advertise her credentials as a fervent European. Last Monday, following the most momentous weekend in Brussels for years, the euro rallied on the markets. By yesterday, however, it was back at its lowest point against the dollar in 18 months and leading German bankers were warning German taxpayers they would probably not get back the billions they were &quot;lending&quot; Greece. Sarkozy&apos;s famous victory is less than final \u2013 and he might yet regret his showdown with a chancellor of Germany. Additional reporting by Giles Tremlett in Madrid and Lizzy Davies in Paris Could France really quit?Not without bringing the whole project crashing down. Technically it can quit and reinvent the franc, below, in the same way Greece could leave and start paying for things with drachmas. But the 16-member eurozone would struggle to survive if one of its two main economies pulled out. Germany alone would have to underpin the finances of Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Austria, which have all borrowed heavily from lenders who are nervous they might not get their money back. How would it cope?France It would find life difficult: it has low growth and high levels of debt. Sarkozy has kept his head down over the past year with only the occasional speech delivering the message that France is pootling along fine. However, below the surface, its banks are struggling: Credit Agricole, one of Europe&apos;s largest, is high on the list of troubled institutions, having bought all kinds of loans related to the sub-prime crash and a lot of Greek bonds. Then there are measures like labour productivity growth, which is lower than the UK&apos;s over the 12 years from 1997 to 2009. It is lLow productivity and growth that is the crux of the issue and France is in much the same position as other European nations, including Britain. Investors ask how it will grow its way out of the crisis when demand in Europe is flat and its goods cost too much to sell in other parts of the world. Would the economy be affected by life outside the euro What would happen to its economy?Like Britain, France would probably find its currency devalued against the euro. That helps cut the debt burden, because it would be valued in the new currency, which is suddenly worth less. But import costs would go up; and, much more importantly, without German protection, financial markets would get nervous and the cost of interest payments on its debt would rise. What about the Germans? Angela Merkel has denied the French threatened to quit. Her advisers believe the story of Sarkozy&apos;s table-thumping, sourced to figures in the Spanish government, is more likely to come from the mouths of rumour-mongering hedge funds that have placed bets on the collapse of the euro. Yet it could be that her nose is out of joint because she wants to be the first to quit. Certainly there is a strong sense inside Germany that it should stop bailing out profligate southern European nations. Rumours abound \u2013 probably put about by hedge funds \u2013 that Merkel is printing deutschmarks in preparation for a split. Would that help them? German banks hold billions of euros of Greek debt. Around half the mortgage loans raised by Spanish construction companies to build flats on the Costas were funded by German banks. Spaniards and Greeks buy Audis and VWs by the truckload. In short, the German economy is inextricably linked to Europe. The savings of ordinary Germans are invested in things that are now worth much less than they were: much of their cash was behind property speculation in Greece, Ireland and Spain. Without German loans, a property boom would not have happened. Most economists argue the euro countries need to stand together or they will fall apart \u2013 and fall a long way.

Just take a hands-on approach to your food", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/16/jay-rayner-cutlery-hands", "article": "I am yet to meet a meal that absolutely demanded a trip to the cutlery drawer. It&apos;s amazing what you can do to a risotto by scooping with the middle and index finger, and the only thing that stops me lifting up a bowl of soup to my lips is the appalled stares of others. When I&apos;m alone, the spoon can go hang. That&apos;s the reality. I suspect I am meant to confess to my hands-on relationship with my dinner; instead I want to boast about it. I accept that, in this, I am a terrible father. I spend enormous amounts of credit from the parental authority bank, lecturing my boys on the uses of cutlery while, at the same time, watching my own hands slip unbidden across the table towards the remains of the roast chicken, determined to rip off the parson&apos;s nose. If I was a fraud I might tell you that my suspicion of cutlery is born of an acute palate and a disdain for the way the metallic taste interferes with the flavour of what I&apos;m eating. Even I accept this is bollocks. Try licking a clean knife from the cutlery drawer. What does it taste of? It tastes of cold. In truth I suspect it&apos;s all down to a killer combination of greed and self-obsession. When I eat with my hands I am closer to my food. I am inside my dinner. I am playing out some ancient need to hunt and gather, albeit on a very small scale \u2013 roughly 12 inches across. See that man in the picture at the top of this column? If the words &quot;missing link&quot; and &quot;Cro-Magnon&quot; have ever skittered across your mind, it will all begin to make a fetid kind of sense. Spare ribs, with which I have had a long and intense relationship, are a no-brainer where hands are concerned; if ever I see someone using a knife and fork on a spare rib I instinctively know that, were we ever to talk \u2013 about anything at all \u2013 it would end with me wanting to punch them. Our whole approach to the world, to life, to the really important things like lunch, will be so completely different that it couldn&apos;t be otherwise. Obviously it&apos;s the same with chicken. And lamb chops. And sausages. And asparagus. And crab, and wild mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in butter to a bronzed crispness, and the best kinds of salad, and mussels and clams and paella. Ooh! The crispy bits at the bottom. One of the most delightful discoveries, on a trip to Tokyo, was that sushi was actually meant to be eaten with the hands rather than chopsticks, a complex manoeuvre involving rolling it on to its back with the index finger then placing it, fish-side down on the tongue, with middle finger and thumb. Sushi suddenly made sense. Hell, it looks like finger food. And if it looks like finger food\u2026 Do I think eating with one&apos;s hands is sexy? Nah. That&apos;s a fallback for lousy novelists, who have, driven by imagination deficit, mistaken food as a metaphor for sensuality when really it&apos;s just dinner. I can&apos;t imagine anyone finding thumbs that smell of gravy a turn-on (though if you do, you know where to find me). That said, I have always thought the sexiest thing in the world is unbridled enthusiasm, and the hands-on approach bawls that noisily. This, at least, is what I tell myself as I brush the eating irons to one side and prepare to get up to my armpits in what I&apos;m eating.

I first came to Cannes in 1996 with my movie Kids&apos; Return, and I was shocked by the brashness of it \u2013 the showing off. There were Hollywood movies being advertised on huge billboards; it was a very, very showbiz\u00a0atmosphere. Now, my memories of Cannes consist of two things: interviews and the red carpet. I don&apos;t have much time to do anything else. It&apos;s always interviews, interviews, interviews, official screenings, interviews . . . and then back to Tokyo. Kids&apos; Return was in the directors&apos; fortnight \u2013 that&apos;s a very much smaller part of the festival than the main competition. Later, when I presented my film Kikujiro in the main competition, it was played at the Palais [the main cinema], and I realised that this was what the Cannes experience was supposed to be like. It wasn&apos;t nerve-racking. A\u00a0couple of years earlier, I had received the best film award in Venice with Hana-Bi, and now I felt that I didn&apos;t really have to worry about winning. For me, being in the competition doesn&apos;t feel like a competitive thing\u00a0at all. My new film, Outrage, is a yakuza\u00a0movie. It&apos;s been a while since I\u00a0made a movie like it; it took years to accumulate enough ideas about how to depict fighting scenes and violence. I was very conscious about portraying the violent scenes in a way that I haven&apos;t tried before \u2013 I\u00a0wanted to choreograph theses scenes in an original way. The scene in which I hit\u00a0the yakuza under the jaw, while he&apos;s sticking out his tongue, was inspired by something from my childhood.

Okay, so the research has been carried out by Popcap, a social gaming publisher that has something of a vested interested in the market, but nevertheless, the figures are reasonably interesting.  Based on a survey of more than 1,500 adults, the company discovered that more than a quarter of Brits aged between 16-24 are playing mobile games rather than reading to pass the time on journeys.

I think we need to test this with some anecdotal evidence: on your commute to work this morning, how many people were playing games?

It may also sound the death-knell for a business model that placed quick profits and rapid expansion above all else. Almost three years after Nova, Japan&apos;s biggest eikaiwa, or English conversation school chain, went bust, Geos filed for bankruptcy with debts of about $81m. It immediately closed 99 schools employing 483 people, with G.communications, a Nagoya-based chain, acquiring the 230 remaining branches. Students at the closed schools were told they would not receive tuition rebates but would be allowed to transfer to other schools or learn online with the money they had already paid. Few were surprised that Geos, founded in 1973, met the same fate as Nova, but that did little to mollify students unable to transfer to other schools or teachers uneasy about the new working conditions at G.com. Geos reportedly started finding new buyers for its overseas schools as soon as the depth of its financial crisis became clear. It operated schools in several other countries, including the UK, US, France and Canada, and in January closed all eight of its schools in Australia, leaving 2,300 students unable to receive refunds and 390 staff without jobs. While disaffected teachers and students consider their options, the eikaiwa sector is left reeling from its second high-profile failure in three years. The once booming industry, its image already tarnished by Nova&apos;s sudden collapse, is grappling with falls in student numbers and an inability to adapt to a more sophisticated market. Geos, like Nova, fell victim to its unshakeable belief in an over-ambitious business model that depended on persuading students to part with huge sums of cash up front and investing it in advertising and new schools. But the current climate is a long way from the eikaiwa heyday when Nova operated about 900 branches and Geos about 500.Enrollment in foreign-language schools in Japan plummeted from 826,858 students in February 2006 to 335,604 this year, according to the ministry of economy, trade and industry. About 40,000 students attended Geos schools in September 2008, but the number had fallen by more than 3,000 by the time the company collapsed, according to Teikoku Data Bank. It had become trapped in a cycle of falling student numbers and the revenues needed to fund aggressive TV commercials.&quot;It was clear that things weren&apos;t going well for Geos,&quot; said Dennis Tesolat, general secretary of the General Union, an Osaka-based organisation that represents mainly language teachers. &quot;They were paying high rents to build schools near train stations in rural areas where people tend to use cars. Geos was expanding without knowing what it was doing.&quot; Tesolat acknowledged that the school had moved quickly to reach a deal with G.com and prevent the widespread panic that followed Nova&apos;s collapse, but said the industry&apos;s future remained cloudy. &quot;The market has changed because students have options that weren&apos;t open to them before. &quot;In the old days you had to go to an eikaiwa, but students no longer believe that you have to hand over $10,000 to a school. They can take lessons online, there are free materials on the internet. Being with a native English speaker is not seen as the only way to fluency.&quot; The industry is now on the brink of a potentially painful period of restructuring that could lead to the emergence of a more cautious breed of schools that focus more on career development and teaching than on expansion and advertising. &quot;The schools that devise a way to keep good teachers for a relatively long time will win in the end,&quot; said Tesolat.Industry insiders agree that the Geos debacle should bring an end to the time-honoured practice of persuading students to hand over large sums of money, often borrowed from consumer loans firms, for long-term contracts. &quot;Eikaiwa is an education industry, but it is also a business so you have to grow in a healthy manner and look after your employees and students,&quot; said Dean Rogers, owner of the Dean Morgan chain of language schools. &quot;The 100% prepaid package, financed by loans, is not the right way to do it.&quot; Surprisingly perhaps, Rogers believes now is a &quot;great time&quot; to be in the industry, particularly for smaller chains that offer more manageable deals to students and have no interest in empire building. &quot;The market is already out there and you don&apos;t need to be a rocket scientist to make it work. This is a crisis for the larger schools because their brand image has been tarnished.&quot; The fate of Geos and Nova may also force prospective teachers to reconsider a short-term career in the eikaiwa industry.While classes at surviving Geos schools have resumed under their new owners, some teachers shunned the offer of provisional three-month contracts with G.com. &quot;The contract was very vague,&quot; said Tuan Hong, an ex-Geos teacher from Britain who is looking for a new job. &quot;To me it looked like a diplomatic way of putting people out of a job.&quot; The 29-year-old, who had taught for Geos in Tokyo for more than three years, said the school had long ago lost sight of its responsibilities to students and teachers. &quot;Our priority as teachers was to sell, whether it was books, calculators or new contracts. We were treated more like salespeople than teachers. If Geos had concentrated more on the product than on sales, then it might still be around today.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I am designing beards for my customers that are considered acceptable in the company workplace,&quot; Minoru Fujii, a member of Hige [beard] Club, a Tokyo beard advocacy group comprising mainly barbers, told Kyodo News."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Beauty", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-20T12:05:50Z", "title": "Japanese bureaucrats face up to the clean-cut look", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/20/japan-isesaki-beard-ban", "article": "In feudal Japan, a beard was considered a symbol of power or a declaration of belligerent intent but bureaucrats in one town could find themselves sent to the bathroom, razor in hand, for sporting even the suggestion of a five o&apos;clock shadow.

Seoul yesterday promised resolute measures against Pyongyang, but is wary of escalating the situation. &quot;Since this case is very serious and has grave importance, we cannot afford to have the slightest mistake and will be very prudent in all response measures we take,&quot; Lee said. South Korean investigators, working with experts from several other countries, said there was overwhelming evidence that a torpedo fired from one of the North&apos;s submarines caused the blast that destroyed the Cheonan as it patrolled a disputed Yellow Sea border. The North denies any involvement in the 26 March disaster. It repeated its warnings of war today and said it was prepared to tear up all agreements with its neighbour. &quot;From this time on, we will regard the situation as a phase of war and will be responding resolutely to all problems in North-South relations,&quot; the committee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland said. &quot;If the South puppet group comes out with &apos;response&apos; and &apos;retaliation&apos;, we will respond strongly with ruthless punishment including the total shutdown of North-South ties, abrogation of the North-South agreement on non-aggression and abolition of all North-South co-operation projects.&quot; Separately, a North Korean naval spokesman, Colonel Pak In Ho, told the broadcaster APTN that the report&apos;s evidence was faked. Pyongyang has said it will send its own team to investigate the incident, but an unnamed defence ministry source, quoted by the South&apos;s Yonhap news agency, said Seoul would not permit such a trip. The issue, along with Iran&apos;s nuclear position, is expected to dominate Clinton&apos;s agenda. Associated Press reported today that Seoul was pushing the Obama administration to put North Korea back on a terrorism blacklist. But while the US government has condemned the March attack, a state department spokesman, PJ Crowley, noted: &quot;Terrorism normally involves acts of violence against innocent civilians.&quot; Although many expect Seoul to take the matter to the United Nations security council, experts say it would struggle to win new sanctions there. More likely would be a condemnation of the attack. &quot;Clearly this was a serious provocation by North Korea and there will definitely be consequences because of what North Korea has done,&quot; Crowley said. But China, Pyongyang&apos;s key ally and a permanent member of the security council, has described the incident only as &quot;unfortunate&quot; and urged all parties to show restraint. The 1950-53 war ended with an armistice, but the two Koreas never signed a peace treaty. Yonhap reported that the UN command&apos;s military armistice commission would investigate whether the North had violated the terms of the agreement to suspend hostilities."}, {"sentences": ["Washington and Tokyo have yet to reach agreement on the planned relocation of Futenma, a sprawling airbase located in a heavily populated city on Okinawa, an island 1,000 miles south of the capital which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops based in Japan.", "&quot;We both seek an arrangement that is operationally viable and politically sustainable,&quot; Clinton told reporters in Tokyo at the start of a three-nation tour of Asia."], "tags": ["Japan", "US foreign policy", "US military", "US news", "World news", "South Korea", "China", "Taiwan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-21T14:20:14Z", "title": "US and Japan strive to meet deadline for Okinawa airbase decision", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/21/us-japan-airbase-okinawa-relocation", "article": "The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, today reassured Japan that a simmering feud over the future of a US marine base would not affect the countries&apos; &quot;rock solid&quot; 50-year-old alliance at a time of heightened tensions in north-east Asia. Washington and Tokyo have yet to reach agreement on the planned relocation of Futenma, a sprawling airbase located in a heavily populated city on Okinawa, an island 1,000 miles south of the capital which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops based in Japan. &quot;We both seek an arrangement that is operationally viable and politically sustainable,&quot; Clinton told reporters in Tokyo at the start of a three-nation tour of Asia. &quot;The goal of our governments remains unchanged: we want to maintain the security of Japan and the stability of the region.&quot; Yukio Hatoyama, Japan&apos;s prime minister, who has given himself until the end of the month to devise a solution, angered the Obama White House by suggesting he would ditch an earlier agreement to build a replacement for the base off the island&apos;s remote north coast. The same deal would see 8,000 US marines and their families move to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014. Hatoyama had hoped to move the base off the island altogether, but has been unable to reach agreement with potential host communities in other parts of Japan. Clinton said the two countries would continue to seek agreement by the 31 May deadline. &quot;We have committed to redoubling our efforts to meet the deadline that has been announced by the Japanese government,&quot; she said after meeting Japan&apos;s foreign minister, Katsuya Okada. Bilateral talks over the future of Futenma, home to 2,000 marines, were sparked by public outrage following the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen in 1995. While many Okinawans oppose the military presence, Washington insists that the island is ideally located should the US need to intervene in conflicts on the Korean peninsula or between China and Taiwan. Japan has been diplomatically wrongfooted by the sinking in March of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy ship, in which 46 sailors died, and evidence that a North Korean torpedo was to blame. Mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula have lent weight to the US-Japan security alliance and made it more likely that Hatoyama will bow to the White House&apos;s wishes over Futenma. Okada appeared to concede as much: &quot;I want to explain frankly to the Japanese people that the presence of US troops in Japan is indispensable to Japan&apos;s security and to the peace and stability of the region in the current security environment.&quot; Referring to the Cheonan sinking, he added: &quot;We need to be aware this could happen to us. There is no guarantee it won&apos;t happen to Japan.&quot; Hatoyama, meanwhile, has seen support for his administration plummet amid mounting criticism of his handling of the Futenma relocation. Having vowed during last summer&apos;s general election to move the base off Okinawa, he recently angered local people when he conceded it would be impossible to fulfil his promise. Media reports this week suggested that Hatoyama was preparing to accept a tweaked version of the 2006 plan, which would require building a new offshore runway, a move opposed by locals and environmentalists. Some analysts believe his Democratic party could lose the support of a leftwing coalition partner over the issue and risk losing control of the upper house before elections for the chamber in July. Even if he survives until then, a very poor performance at the polls could force Hatoyama&apos;s resignation, less than a year after his party swept into power after a landslide defeat of the once-dominant Liberal Democratic party."}, {"sentences": ["Clinton, who is due to arrive in Beijing on Sunday for a three-day visit, said on a stop-over in Tokyo that North Korea will face consequences."], "tags": ["Hillary Clinton", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Obama administration", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-21T17:37:23Z", "title": "Hillary Clinton warns of 'consequences' for North Korea over sinking of ship", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/21/clinton-north-korea-ship-censure", "article": "The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, will explore options for censuring North Korea over the sinking of a South Korean warship with the Chinese government early next week. Clinton, who is due to arrive in Beijing on Sunday for a three-day visit, said on a stop-over in Tokyo that North Korea will face consequences. She added: &quot;We cannot allow this attack on South Korea to go unanswered by the international community,&quot; The options available to the US and South Korea are limited, especially as the Chinese are reluctant to join in any action against their ally North Korea. Beijing has described the incident only as unfortunate and urged all parties to show restraint. The South Korean Yonhap news agency reported, citing South Korean government sources, that Seoul may close sea routes that allow North Korean ships through its waters to save costs. North Korea, which denies one of its submarines fired a torpedo at the corvette, said again that it would regard any punitive action as an act of war. Tension on the Korean peninsula grew this week after an international investigation team blamed North Korea for the sinking of the Cheonan with 46 lives. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, is due to announce in a televised address on Monday what actions his government will take. Clinton is unlikely to set out a US response until after his address and after she has spoken to the Chinese. She is to visit Seoul on Wednesday for further talks about how to respond. In her talks with the Chinese, Clinton will be hampered by the fact that she needs their backing over North Korea, but also for sanctions against Iran and a deal on readjusting the Chinese currency. The likeliest action is a US-led push for a condemnatory statement from the UN security council where China wields a veto. Other options include imposing more sanctions against North Korea, though almost every conceivable one is in place, transferring more US military equipment to South Korea or joint US-South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea, where the sinking took place. Josh Rogin, writing on the Foreign Policy website, said: &quot;Clinton will need China to at least not forswear UN action: a Chinese abstention on any security council resolution would be good enough. But it will be tough for Clinton to pressure China into any specific course of action, mainly because the US hasn&apos;t decided what action it is advocating in the first place.&quot; Any action against North Korea is fraught with risk. Two years ago, the UN condemned North Korea over a missile launch. North Korea responded by launching a second one. The South Korean cabinet held an emergency session today and discussed preparations against any North Korean retaliatory actions, including cyber-terrorism. The South Korean president sounded cautious about escalating the crisis. &quot;Since this case is very serious and has grave importance, we cannot afford to have the slightest mistake and will be very prudent in all response measures we take,&quot; Lee said. The North said it was prepared to tear up all agreements with its neighbour. &quot;From this time on, we will regard the situation as a phase of war and will be responding resolutely to all problems in North-South relations,&quot; the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said. &quot;If the South puppet group comes out with &apos;response&apos; and &apos;retaliation&apos; we will respond strongly with ruthless punishment including the total shutdown of North-South ties, abrogation of the North-South agreement on non-aggression and abolition of all North-South co-operation projects.&quot; Separately, a North Korean naval spokesman, Colonel Pak In Ho, told the broadcaster APTN that the report&apos;s evidence was faked.

Its name is the Hongmuwu (Red Wood) Tea House, and it sits in the wooded hills above Taipei, its sudden tranquillity contrasting with the earnest urban bustle below. A soothing tonic for the worn of mind and spirit. Seated on a shaded wooden chair beside a tinkling fountain that fed pools flickering with orange and silver carp, I watched Hongmuwu&apos;s jolly proprietress initiate afternoon tea with smiles and signs. First, she poured boiling water into a large, brown, earthenware teapot with a bamboo handle. The pot was already primed with the famous, locally grown tie guan yin tea. This first infusion was poured off and more water was added. Then a second teapot came into play, round china cups were warmed and, after the requisite brewing period, the contents were transferred again, this time into a small jug. All this was done swiftly and deftly. Small bowls of sugared cashews, dried mango and sweet tea plums appeared on the table. As at last the dark, light-tasting liquid was poured out, great beams of sunshine lanced down into the valleys below. The city&apos;s glass and steel glistened from afar. Tea was served. Tie guan yin, the best known Chinese oolong tea, can be translated as &quot;iron goddess of mercy&quot;, an appropriate name given that the most-fun way to reach the Hongmuwu Tea House high in the wooded hills above Taipei, is via a 4km cable-car ride that tops 300m at its highest point. Gondolas carrying up to eight people climb from the Jingmei river basin near Taipei Zoo station in a half-hour ride over treetops and gulleys to Maokong station. Numerous tea houses, temples, gardens and walking trails are then within easy reach. Floating on the outer edge of Asia, looking west towards Red China and east into the blue Pacific, Taiwan has many ways of lifting the spirits. Beyond its shores, the island is known for its unresolved, peaceful stand-off with Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot; \u2013 the dispute dates back to the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war. It boasts a democratically elected government, a robust devotion to capitalism, and a cutting-edge, hi-tech export-led economy that has rendered &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot; a globally recognisable marque. It has world-class healthcare, an impressive high-speed rail network, and ambitions to become an Asian transport hub. Today, a gradual improvement in relations between Taiwan and its giant neighbour is producing beneficial spin-offs, direct and indirect. Chinese tourism to Taiwan is booming. Bilateral trade and investment are growing. And in March, Taiwan-based China Airlines launched the first non-stop flight to Taiwan from the UK, with a new thrice-weekly service from Heathrow. Downtown Taipei is a busy, modern-looking city that combines the energetic feel of Tokyo with an American-style grid system. But there is a lot more beneath the glitz. There is the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a truly monumental, permanent tribute to the founding father of the Republic of China (Taiwan&apos;s official name). Among the displays are photographs of the great man with Churchill, Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Nixon. His 50s armoured Cadillac is preserved in all its glory, as is the Order of the Bath, presented to him by British admirers. The National Palace Museum is home to the crown jewels of imperial China, brought to Taiwan from the mainland by Chiang&apos;s fleeing nationalists. I found it a place of great beauty, art and abounding treasure \u2013 a bit like the Tower of London, the National Gallery and the V&amp;A rolled into one. Taipei 101, until recently the world&apos;s tallest building, should not be missed: its elevators, travelling at about 60km/h are the fastest in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. At the top is a giant, suspended damper, designed to compensate for unwanted movement caused by earthquakes (the last big one was in 1999). And a walk on Taipei&apos;s wild side is incomplete without a visit to the Night Market in Shinlin district. Pig blood cakes, stinking tofu, coconut dough rolls, oyster omelettes, meat and spring onion steamed dumplings, and bitter melon juice drinks are some of the myriad delicacies (and staples) on sale amid much noisy chatter and startlingly low prices. Once sated, the itinerant gaijin (foreign) gourmet can try his luck at fairground shooting ranges or lose her shirt at mah jong. But when city life begins to pall, Taiwan offers something else, something more that is sometimes amazing. A cheap, 35-minute domestic flight south and east to Hualien county, then a short drive into the Taroko national park, brought me into the heart of the spectacular Taroko gorge. Mile after mile of narrow, twisting road tracks the tumbling, aquamarine waters of the Liwu river as it descends from a host of snow-capped mountains, including one of Taiwan&apos;s highest, Mount Nanhu, at 3,742m. The rock here is sheer marble, massive, glistening and immovable \u2013 until an imperceptible tremor sends sharp shards crashing to the road. Signs warn, with good reason, &quot;Do Not Linger&quot;. Hard hats are de rigueur. The national park offers numerous walking trails, and the gorge is home to a wide range of plants, mammals, over-sized butterflies and birds, including tiny swallows that have colonised the many caves along the trail. The road runs through tunnels cut at great human cost by Chiang&apos;s demobilised soldiers. It follows a route developed by the Japanese imperial army during its pre-1945 occupation of Taiwan. But the Japanese were interlopers here, too. Historically speaking, this land belonged to the indigenous Taroko (Truku) people, a Pacific islander race, now dispossessed like so many of their kind. At the Buluowan recreation area, roughly half-way up the gorge, their cultural heritage, or what&apos;s left of it, can be seen in reception area displays and for sale in handicraft shops. Buluowan, meaning &quot;echo&quot;, is a magical place, a natural river terrace surrounded by the almost vertical heavily wooded cliffs that the Taroko made their home. Like Taiwan&apos;s other aboriginal tribes, they have mostly lost their birthright. But high in this enchanted gorge, their spirits linger, defying the signs. The magical feel of the region was continued in the serene environs of the Silks Place hotel, high in the Taroko gorge, a haven of inimitable calm, soft carpets, luxurious massage, hushed dining and elegantly minimalist Japanese-style rooms. As I lay there with the screen doors drawn back, listening to the susurrating rush of the mountain stream, thinking randomly of the day&apos;s Buddhist temples and shaven monks, monkeys, hawks and incense, of lost dynasties of tattooed head-hunters chased out of their land, sleep came easily, an escape within an escape. South and west from Taipei the vistas are dramatically different. One hour on the high-speed train to Taichung, then an hour&apos;s drive into the mountains, away from the industrialised, built-up coastal strip, brought me, round a final bend, to a memorable sight: the shimmering waters of famous Sun Moon Lake, a small, hidden sea in the heart of Taiwan, a secret Xanadu encircled by mountains. This also is a place of trails and walking tours, cycle rides and boat trips, hotels and souvenir shops. But in aboriginal lore it is a holy place, too. This is where Chiang Kai-shek, by then an old man and dun dictatin&apos;, sat and contemplated all his works, like a latter-day Kubla Khan, listening for ancestral voices prophesying war. Sun Moon Lake is where Chiang&apos;s personal stately pleasure dome, now transformed into the ultra-luxurious Lalu hotel, is situated. The hotel is worth the journey by itself. Its exquisite three-room suites with their shuttered balconies, its unbroken views across the lake to far-off pagodas and misted hills, its polished Burmese teak floors, its fishponds, lilies, and Japanese bonsai, its terraced restaurants and spas and, most of all, its modest, self-effacing architectural style combine to produce an almost transformative experience (at a price). Lapping gently in the early morning air, shaded by newly greening frangipani trees and red hibiscus blossom, the blue-green, over-spilling waters of the Lalu&apos;s long outdoor pool seem to merge seamlessly with lake and sky. For a moment, it was as if I was floating free, man and nature made one. Of course, it is a trick of the eye, a conceit of the heart. Or is it? As ever, Taiwan is more than it seems."}, {"sentences": ["He tells me about the band&apos;s old van (a decommissioned riot squad vehicle with &quot;stab-proof&quot; tyres) and how he had to get rid of his first drummer when the tub-thumper&apos;s ruinous liking for cocaine derailed a huge show in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Electronic music", "Dance music", "Indie", "Crystal Castles"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-21T23:09:02Z", "title": "Crystal Castles sparkle with or without The Brain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/22/crystal-castles-guardian-interview", "article": "Here&apos;s something you won&apos;t read every day: Ethan Kath from Crystal Castles is an extremely nice chap. If you&apos;ve ever read anything about the world&apos;s new favourite Toronto-born electro duo, Kath is always \u2013 but always \u2013 presented as a grumpy, uncommunicative, passive-aggressive arse. If &quot;new rave&quot; brought them to our attention, Crystal Castles have long since outlasted it. Masters of what has become known as 8-Bit, or Chiptune, Crystal Castles build brilliant records from sounds you might find down the back of a games console. To date, nearly 8 million have watched five different Crystal Castles videos on YouTube; this is a band so of the moment they&apos;ve been on the soundtrack to Skins more often than a squeaking bedspring. They are this generation&apos;s chemical brother and sister. Anyway, there&apos;s nothing even slightly grumpy or uncommunicative about the 28-year-old in a black hoodie and skinny jeans I meet in the banana-yellow offices of a 1,000-capacity nightclub in an unattractive suburb of Milan. He apologises for his hair being odd lengths (apparently Castles screamer Alice Glass cuts it when he&apos;s not looking). He tells me about the livestock and lack of windows on his grandfather&apos;s farm in Calabria (the southern-most &quot;toe&quot; in the Italian &quot;boot&quot;). He tells me about the band&apos;s old van (a decommissioned riot squad vehicle with &quot;stab-proof&quot; tyres) and how he had to get rid of his first drummer when the tub-thumper&apos;s ruinous liking for cocaine derailed a huge show in Tokyo. He tells me about how many links to illegal downloads of his new record there are on Twitter. He tells me about how those links all lead to a version of the album that includes the wrong edit of future single, Celestica. He has a lot to say for himself, all of it interesting, and each story is delivered with the same engaging, garrulous enthusiasm. When he offers to nip out and chase up Glass \u2013 she&apos;s having a shower, having just woken up at 6.30pm \u2013 I think to myself what a pleasure it is to meet him. So Glass appears, hair still wet, beaming smile, couldn&apos;t be more charming, and we sit down for the interview. Then something sort of hilarious happens. Ethan Kath slips into character and becomes &quot;Ethan Kath out of Crystal Castles&quot;, someone who is, oh dear, quite capable of being a grumpy, uncommunicative, passive-aggressive arse. I lob an easy one at him to start. Tell me about The Brain, I say, referring to the battered flight-case full of wounded, half-dead keyboards and old mobile phones that, apparently, provide a lot of the noise and vocal samples that the band use on stage.     Crystal Castles first album cover.    &quot;There&apos;s no such thing,&quot; he replies with a face like a four-year-old who&apos;s just been denied a lollipop. And we&apos;re off! &quot;Maybe the crew call it that,&quot; he says, &quot;but I don&apos;t. I&apos;m not emotionally attached to any gear.&quot; So if it all got burnt you wouldn&apos;t care? &quot;There are music shops in every city in the world,&quot; offers the man who has built a (well-deserved) mythology on the uniqueness of his sounds and is famous for his hatred of preset technology. &quot;It&apos;s no big deal.&quot; In an attempt to tease Friendly Ethan back out of the woodwork I go for the least contentious question imaginable. Do your fans react differently in different parts of the world, I smile? &quot;No,&quot; he says, staring. &quot;Everywhere hates us the same.&quot; Except, of course, they don&apos;t. Outside this venue there are hundreds of young (and not-so-young) fans gathered hours before the doors open, and that&apos;s because Crystal Castles&apos; new album \u2013 called, like their first, Crystal Castles \u2013 is a wonderful record that rides the noise/pop knife edge as well as anyone in the world. Kath is a songwriter and producer of rare talent, someone who can write songs like Celestica or Year Of Silence that are so brilliantly melodic, so grippingly immediate, so joyously pop, that were they on the new Kylie Minogue album you would throw your hat into the air with the slightly edgy electro pleasure of it all. But he can also write Doe Deer or Birds, pieces that are furious, experimental and abrasive. I Am Made Of Chalk sounds like he&apos;s shredded a VHS copy of infamous video-nasty I Spit On Your Grave and randomly stuck the bits back together with home-made adhesive. It is both brilliant and terrible. Kath is taking chances, and we are lucky to have him. He may, in fact, be the planet&apos;s funniest hipster. I certainly found him highly entertaining, I just didn&apos;t see the point of the sudden grump attack. When Kath and Glass talk about how they came together as Crystal Castles in the summer of 2005 the room actually comes alive. &quot;She was getting high all summer,&quot; Kath laughs. &quot;I found her on the street; she was higher than anyone I&apos;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; It&apos;s worth pointing out that, at the time, he was in a band with a heroin addict. As a child Glass had been a real loner: someone who sat in the corner of her room and wrote &quot;cheesy&quot; poetry, who ran away from home at 14. When she began recording with Kath she was just 17, had shaved off half of her hair and completed her look with a filthy eye-patch. &apos;We have no ambition. There are 3,000 bands that deserve this more than we do&apos; &quot;This punk guy had the infection first,&quot; she smiles. &quot;He then went around dabbing his germ-stained finger in everyone else&apos;s eye. I had it for three months.&quot; Kath says she was so high that when he wanted to talk to her about the songs they&apos;d recorded together Glass would just say, &quot;Call me!&quot; and make the phone-to-the-ear movement despite the fact that neither of them had a phone. They still don&apos;t, apparently. Glass was living with a squeegee merchant called Rosa who had a house in downtown Toronto and split the rent between 20 people at $100 a month. &quot;There were a lot of drug punks there,&quot; she says. &quot;They&apos;d do really shitty things like heat up metal coat hangers and brand their skulls \u2026 &quot; It seems like everything&apos;s back on course, so I mention that what I really like about the record is how it goes noisy one, pop one, noisy one, pop one. That&apos;s great sequencing! Silence. I move my feet to allow a huge ball of tumbleweed to blow past. &quot;Maybe,&quot; says Glass, eventually. &quot;I don&apos;t hear them as noise or pop,&quot; Kath says. &quot;All I hear is one bleak feeling that lasts an hour.&quot; Indeed. But Year Of Silence is a big, bright brilliant pop song, I say. It doesn&apos;t sound particularly &quot;bleak&quot;. Interestingly, this may be the exact point where the ghost-like presence of Nice Ethan rises up from his mortal frame and boards a transatlantic flight back to Toronto. &quot;That&apos;s actually insulting,&quot; he groans. &quot;That&apos;s the opposite of what I was going for. I&apos;m not trying to write pop songs at all. Year Of Silence was something I imagined hearing at some shitty, small goth club.&quot;     Crystal Castles second album cover.    The duo are playing all over Europe on a pre-release tour for the new album, which is coming out on the same label Snow Patrol are signed to. They&apos;ve played an NME tour sponsored by Topman and they&apos;re appearing at the Radio 1 Big Weekend. Are these really the decisions of an unambitious band? &quot;Yeah,&quot; mutters Glass. &quot;Of course,&quot; says Kath. &quot;Because we have no ambition, yet we are in this position. There are 3,000 bands that deserve this more than we do.&quot; No there aren&apos;t. &quot;You don&apos;t need ambition to play a show,&quot; says Glass. &quot;There&apos;s not a lot of effort needed \u2026 &quot; Two hours later and the venue&apos;s full to bursting with goths, metalheads, indie kids, ravers and whatever the Italian equivalent of mainstream, gig-happy teens are called. Crystal Castles&apos; live show is a masterpiece of dark beauty. Lit by a pair of brutal strobes they stick to the big-room tunes. Glass twists and dives and crawls along the stage hugging a loose strobe to her belly. She is utterly captivating. Kath stands to her right, behind what looks like it might be The Brain (except, of course, that doesn&apos;t exist), alternately punching out notes and beats, then strapping on a guitar. Crystal Castles are awesomely concise and effective, a rolling noise that will destroy all competition at any festival this summer. A couple of days later I email Kath to find out if his rather taciturn interview persona is actually all part of some larger Crystal Castles gameplan. A self-preservation technique perhaps? A perfectly charming email pings back within the hour. &quot;There is no other person,&quot; he writes. &quot;We&apos;re quite shy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Her experience as a presenter began when she spent her university summers as a tour guide in Washington D.C., and developed further when she stepped onstage as a stand-up and improvisational comedian in Tokyo and Singapore."], "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "Careers advice", "Forums"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-24T10:10:06Z", "title": "Live Q&A: Improving your presentation skills", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/live-q-a-improving-your-presentation-skills", "article": "You shuffle your cue cards and clear your throat.

Hatoyama said he would honour a 2006 agreement with the US to move Futenma base from its current location in an overcrowded city to an offshore site in a less populated part of Okinawa, despite strong local opposition. After six months of searching for a new site in other parts of Japan, Hatoyama conceded that the Korean crisis, sparked by the March sinking of a South Korean naval vessel blamed on a North Korean torpedo, had underlined the importance of the US military presence. &quot;I decided that it is of utmost importance that we place the Japan-US relationship on a solid footing of mutual trust, considering the situation on the Korean peninsula and in Asia,&quot; he said. &quot;I apologise from the bottom of my heart for the confusion I have caused the people of Okinawa.&quot; The US had refused to budge from its insistence that the base, home to 2,000 marines, should stay on Okinawa, which it regards as the best location for troops who could be sent to intervene in a conflict on the Korean peninsula or between China and Taiwan. Under the agreement, 8,000 US troops on Okinawa will be moved to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, commended Hatoyama and described his change of heart as difficult but correct. In an attempt to calm the anger among Okinawan residents, Hatoyama said attempts would be made to lessen the environmental impact of the offshore base. But local leaders described his volte-face as a betrayal. The mayor of Nago, the coastal town that will host the new base, described the plan as &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;. &quot;I cannot help feeling angry as this is a betrayal of the people of Nago and Okinawa,&quot; Susumu Inamine told Hatoyama in a meeting yesterday. Despite the agreement between Tokyo and Washington, some analysts believe the plan could still fail amid growing opposition on the island, which hosts about half of the 50,000 US troops in Japan. Minoru Morita, a veteran political commentator, said Hatoyama&apos;s mishandling of the relocation had exposed his Democratic party as naive. &quot;The Okinawan people are outraged,&quot; he said. &quot;They feel Hatoyama betrayed them. The Democrats didn&apos;t think through what they could change and what they couldn&apos;t change. The base issue is an international agreement. They are ignorant and irrational.&quot; Hatoyama could pay a heavy political price for his perceived lack of leadership. The Social Democrats, a minor left-wing party, have threatened to leave his coalition government, while voters are expected to punish him in upper house elections in July."}, {"sentences": ["Britons are &quot;a very experimental race&quot;, added Player-Bishop, especially those who had undergone toilet epiphanies in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Gadgets", "UK news", "Technology"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-25T21:50:35Z", "title": "Toto - we're not on normal toilets any more", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/25/toto-toilets-launch", "article": " A quiet and achingly stylish hygiene revolution kicked off in the bowels of a shop in east London today, where rows of futuristic white pods crouched patiently, hoping to attract the attention of passing buttocks. The pods \u2013 some functionally square, others gently contoured like the bills of tubby ducks \u2013 are among the most luxurious, modern and expensive toilet units in the world. Beneath their seamless exteriors, the machines conceal an arsenal of intimate hoses, sudden dryers and invisible deodorisers that make most loos seem like medieval long-drops. Together with elegantly minimalist basins and baths big enough to launch fighter jets off, they make up some of the stock of the new Toto store in Clerkenwell, central London. Although the Japanese sanitary ware company is big at home, and in Asia and the US, it is almost unknown in the UK, where many harbour ancient suspicions about highly automated toilets. But Toto believes all that will change with the establishment of its first British outpost. &quot;People tend to think Britons don&apos;t want to experiment, but they do,&quot; said the firm&apos;s UK general manager, Jill Player-Bishop, sweeping her hand towards the pristine bowl of an all singing, all dancing Italian-designed loo competitively priced at \u00a32,500. Britons are &quot;a very experimental race&quot;, added Player-Bishop, especially those who had undergone toilet epiphanies in Tokyo. &quot;Once people have tried them,&quot; she said, the gleam of the evangelist in her eye, &quot;they&apos;ll wonder why they never tried them before.&quot; For the uninitiated, trying one of Toto&apos;s hi-tech Washlet loos can be an experience as odd as straddling a car wash and as nerve-racking as attempting to befoul a tame Dalek. But once you get past the scary control panel \u2013 &quot;rear cleanse/front cleanse/wand cleansing (not what you think)/seat temperature&quot; \u2013 it is undeniably refreshing. The only drawback is the price: a top-of-the-range Washlet will set you back \u00a38,000. Little wonder, then, that Koji Nakano, president of Toto Europe, said the company was positioning itself to be &quot;the first choice of the professional person in the UK&quot;. In Japan, where Toto controls 60-70% of the market, society is apparently subject to a kind of lavatorial apartheid. The journalist and publisher Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, who hosted a symposium on clean technology as part of today&apos;s launch, explained there were two kinds of people in Japan: the Washlet haves and the Washlet have nots. &quot;It&apos;s at the point where if you know someone who doesn&apos;t have a Washlet, or you go to a restaurant that doesn&apos;t have one, it seems odd,&quot; he said. &quot;[It&apos;s] like the rest of the world is unwashed.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Speaking in Tokyo, he said the Federal Reserve&apos;s dollar swap lines with other major central banks, which were reinstated when the Greek debt crisis escalated, played an important role in stabilising markets, but that the Fed did not want to provide a permanent funding cushion."], "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Timothy Geithner", "Economics", "Market turmoil", "Global economy", "Business", "World news", "Europe"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-26T14:53:00Z", "title": "US treasury secretary pushes for action on European debt crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/26/us-treasury-secretary-debt-crisis", "article": "US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner flew to Europe today to push for joint action to tackle the ongoing European debt crisis.

Somewhat presciently, given the coalition government&apos;s promise of legislation to regulate the use of CCTV, the scariness and scale of surveillance features heavily in Voyeurism, which opens to the public on Friday. The exhibition suggests that, as a society, we have always been voyeurs \u2013 it is just that technology now makes it so much easier. &quot;The exhibition is meant to be a critical look at the issues that surround voyeurism and surveillance,&quot; said Simon Baker, Tate&apos;s recently appointed photography curator. &quot;We are raising questions about boundaries, about technology. There are serious moral questions about who&apos;s looking, how they&apos;re looking and why they&apos;re looking.&quot; In essence, it is a photography exhibition which raises the question of whether photography is actually a good thing, and includes work by well-known figures including Brassa\u00ef, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Lee Miller, Guy Bourdin, Nan Goldin and Robert Mapplethorpe. The show ranges from images that are straightforwardly voyeuristic, such as Helmut Newton fashion shots, to much more challenging work such as the US photojournalist Susan Meiselas&apos;s Carnival Strippers series, in which she photographs leering men in an audience watching strippers. &quot;It is posing a question about the politics of spectatorship,&quot; said Baker. There are also celebrity stalking and paparazzi shots, including snaps of Richard Burton and Liz Taylor canoodling in their swimming costumes and a tearful Paris Hilton on her way to court, and images by Alison Jackson, the photographer who uses lookalikes to comic effect. Newspaper coverage of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales is also included. One of the most difficult rooms contains journalistic images of death and violence and some people will undoubtedly whistle through the room, upset by awful images of suicide, execution and lynching. It includes images such as Tom Howard&apos;s electrocution of Ruth Snyder, from 1928, and Eddie Adams&apos; haunting photograph of a Viet Cong officer being executed in 1968. The show has been created and curated by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art \u2013 to where it will transfer in the autumn \u2013 but the Tate has tweaked it here and there for London. Curators would have liked to show Kohei Yoshiyuki&apos;s 1971 series, The Park, as it was originally shown in Japan: in a dark room with visitors having to use torches. The images were taken at night with an infrared camera and show straight couples having sex in Tokyo parks and gay men cruising for sex \u2013 all the time surrounded by others looking on, gawping. Since individual torches would be too much for a mass audience they are, instead, displayed in a dark, spotlit corridor. The appointment last September of Baker as Tate&apos;s first curator of photography reflects the organisation&apos;s increasing commitment to the medium, he said. &quot;The idea also is that photography is taken more seriously within our acquisition policy, that we bring more photography into the collection and that we show more of it,&quot; Baker said. That also meant buying more of what could be termed &quot;straight&quot;, rather than conceptual, photography and photojournalism. &quot;There is that whole argument from the 1980s about collecting photographs from artists not art from photographers \u2013 that&apos;s really a redundant distinction.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The battle between Japan and anti-whaling activists will be played out in a Tokyo courtroom today with the start of the trial of Peter Bethune, who was arrested after clambering aboard a Japanese whaling ship earlier this year.", "He has been held at Tokyo detention centre ever since."], "tags": ["Whaling", "World news", "Japan", "New Zealand", "Australia news", "Activism", "Conservation", "Endangered species", "Environment", "Marine life", "Oceans", "Wildlife", "Whales", "Asia Pacific", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-26T23:32:26Z", "title": "Anti-whaling activist has 'no regrets' as his trial begins in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/27/sea-shepherd-whaling-activist-court-tokyo", "article": "The battle between Japan and anti-whaling activists will be played out in a Tokyo courtroom today with the start of the trial of Peter Bethune, who was arrested after clambering aboard a Japanese whaling ship earlier this year. Bethune, of the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group, faces five charges: trespass, assault, illegal possession of a knife, destruction of property and obstruction of business. These crimes carry a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Dan Harris, a Sea Shepherd lawyer who visited Bethune in detention yesterday, said the activist was &quot;unbelievably well. He&apos;s in really good spirits, very healthy and excited about having the opportunity to explain himself to the world.&quot; Harris said prosecutors were expected to demand a jail sentence of between two and a half and three years. &quot;We are far more optimistic,&quot; he said. &quot;Our focus is on getting Pete out of Japan as quickly as possible. &quot;He is very proud of his role in reducing the whale catch and spreading the word about what is really happening in the Southern Ocean. He feels that whatever sentence he gets, it will have been worth it. He has no regrets.&quot; A verdict is expected on 10 June, with sentencing up to four weeks later, Harris said. Bethune, a 45-year-old New Zealander, was arrested after jumping on to the Shonan Maru 2 in February to protest against the sinking the previous month of the Ady Gil, Sea Shepherd&apos;s powerboat. The boat, which Bethune skippered, was sliced in two during a collision with the Japanese vessel and later sank. Sea Shepherd had been using the Ady Gil to pursue and harass the whaling fleet during its annual &quot;research&quot; whaling expedition to the Antarctic. The group regards Bethune as a political prisoner. &quot;We are taking the trial very seriously and have confidence in the Japanese system to act fairly and send Pete home,&quot; said Jeff Hansen, Sea Shepherd&apos;s director for Australia. &quot;It is horrendous what he&apos;s been through, so we hope Japan comes to its senses and exercises good judgment.&quot; Under cover of darkness, Bethune leaped on to the harpoon boat from a jetski in an attempt to carry out a citizen&apos;s arrest of the captain and present him with a $3m (\u00a32.08m) bill for the loss of the powerboat. He was held on board and arrested on 12 March when the ship returned to Japan. He has been held at Tokyo detention centre ever since. In an interview with New Zealand&apos;s Sunday Star-Times, Bethune said he stood &quot;a 95% chance&quot; of being convicted and serving a long prison term. He said he had been escorted by more than 100 security guards when he was taken back to the Shonan Maru 2 to re-enact the boarding: &quot;I had a hood over me, like I&apos;m a psychopathic killer. It was bizarre.&quot; Hansen urged Australia and New Zealand to increase pressure on Japan to end its culls in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary and to secure Bethune&apos;s release. &quot;I don&apos;t think either government has done nearly enough for Pete,&quot; he said. &quot;The Australian government promised two years ago to stop the whale hunts, yet we still have volunteers like Pete putting their lives on the line. Recent years have been marked by dangerous clashes on the high seas between whalers armed with water cannon and Sea Shepherd members, whose tactics include hurling parcels of rancid butter on to the decks of whaling ships. Japan claims Bethune was part of a butyric acid attack that left one whaler with burns to his face. It has also issued an international warrant for the arrest of Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd&apos;s founder, for endangering the lives of whaling crews by masterminding attacks on their ships. Watson described Bethune as a &quot;prisoner of war&quot;, and demanded that the captain of the Shonan Maru 2 be questioned over the Ady Gil sinking. The trial opens as the International Whaling Commission prepares to meet in Morocco to discuss a controversial proposal that would allow Japan, Norway and Iceland to hunt a limited number of whales commercially in return for reducing their catch over the next decade. The 1986 ban on commercial whaling allows Japan to kill whales for &quot;lethal research&quot; and sell the meat on the open market. The leader of the whaling fleet blamed harassment by Sea Shepherd activists after his crew returned last month with about half its target catch of 935 whales."}, {"sentences": ["Peter Bethune, an environmental activist who boarded a Japanese whaling ship earlier this year, denied assaulting a member of the whaling crew at the start of a trial in Tokyo today but admitted to four other charges.", "Dressed in a black suit and white shirt and flanked by security guards, Bethune told the Tokyo district court he had had &quot;good reason&quot; to leap aboard the Shonan Maru 2 from a jet ski in February.", "He has been held at a Tokyo detention centre ever since."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Conservation", "Environment", "Oceans", "Endangered species", "Marine life", "Activism", "Wildlife", "New Zealand", "World news", "Whales", "Asia Pacific", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-27T09:36:16Z", "title": "Anti-whaling activist's trial opens in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/27/anti-whaling-activist-trial-japan", "article": "Peter Bethune, an environmental activist who boarded a Japanese whaling ship earlier this year, denied assaulting a member of the whaling crew at the start of a trial in Tokyo today but admitted to four other charges.

If found guilty Bethune, a member of the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group, could face up to 15 years in prison. Dressed in a black suit and white shirt and flanked by security guards, Bethune told the Tokyo district court he had had &quot;good reason&quot; to leap aboard the Shonan Maru 2 from a jet ski in February. He had intended to carry out a citizen&apos;s arrest of the ship&apos;s captain and to present him with a $3m (\u00a32m) bill for the loss of the Ady Gil, Bethune&apos;s high-speed powerboat, which had been ripped in half in a collision with the Shonan Maru 2 the previous month. Bethune was detained aboard the ship and arrested on 12 March as soon as it returned to Japan. He has been held at a Tokyo detention centre ever since. Prosecutors claim Bethune and other Sea Shepherd activists had hurled glass bottles containing butyric acid \u2013 rancid butter \u2013 at whalers, leaving one with burns to his face. &quot;I admit that I boarded the Shonan Maru 2, but I believe I had good reason to do so,&quot; Bethune said. &quot;I admit that I fired the butyric acid, but there were additional circumstances that we will discuss in court.&quot; Sea Shepherd claims the whaler was injured when his pepper spray blew back in his face. Further hearings will take place tomorrow and Monday, and a verdict is expected next month. The trial opened amid tight security inside and outside the courtroom. About 20 ultra-nationalists called for Bethune to be found guilty and held up banners accusing the &quot;white people&quot; of the international anti-whaling movement of racism. One read: &quot;Don&apos;t fuck with the Japanese.&quot; Others carried derogatory comments about Bethune. Shuhei Nishimura, who led the protest, said Bethune deserved a custodial sentence &quot;or else he will act like a wild wolf in the fields and plot another terrorist attack against Japan. To avoid this, we must punish him severely.&quot; Bethune was led into court in handcuffs and with a rope tied around his waist, although both were removed when he took his seat. He smiled when prosecutors showed a photograph of him on a protest boat and described him as a &quot;trademark skinhead&quot;. Japanese whaling officials routinely refer to Sea Shepherd members as &quot;terrorists&quot; and said harassment by the group had forced the fleet to return to port last month with only half its intended catch of 935 whales. Although the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986, Japan is permitted to slaughter whales in the name of &quot;research&quot;. Japan&apos;s aggressive pursuit of anti-whaling activists comes amid mounting condemnation of its annual culls in the Antarctic, particularly from Australia and New Zealand. Two Greenpeace members are also standing trial on theft charges after intercepting a package of whale meat to prove allegations of embezzlement by Japanese whalers. Toru Suzuki and Junichi Sato face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. A verdict is expected later this year. Bethune&apos;s trial opened as the IWC prepared to meet in Morocco to discuss a controversial proposal that would allow Japan, Iceland and Norway to resume commercial whaling in return for reducing their catch over the next decade.

It had shed 1.5% after the FT report but hit a session high of $1.2342 this morning, 1.4% higher on the day, and later traded at $1.2262. However the euro fell to an 11-month low against the pound. Sterling rallied against other major currencies today on the back of rumours that Prudential&apos;s takeover of AIA might be cancelled. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said stock markets were bouncing back after the Chinese comments. &quot;Markets may still be seeing some support from yesterday&apos;s US numbers,&quot; he added. New US home sales reached a two-year high and durable goods orders surged in April, adding to other evidence that the recovery in the world&apos;s largest economy is picking up. Looking ahead, Bowman said: &quot;We are likely to see continued volatility. There are still huge amounts of uncertainty. The European situation refuses to go away.

Certainly after such a positive first-quarter earnings season, it seems rather premature to write equities off, particularly as they continue in many cases to deliver decent yields, way in excess of what is available in the street from alternative assets.

He was one of the first professional Japanese actors active in London in the 1970s and enjoyed something of a monopoly on roles until he starred alongside a\u00a0fellow countryman, Togo Igawa, in The Man Who Shot Christmas (1984). Eiji spent most of his adult life in Britain. He always seemed relieved to have left his home country but was also perplexed by British culture. A natural comedian, he thought he was a misfit and constructed an endlessly playful persona for himself. He was born in Tokyo shortly after the second world war, a time when poor provisions and facilities meant that many babies died. Eiji was one of four children born to Ryoichi and Yasuko Kusuhara. Their first son died at three days old. Eiji was a weak, sickly baby and his parents waited to see if he would survive before they registered his birth. When Eiji was nine, his sister, Ikue, was\u00a0part of a teenage suicide pact with her boyfriend. Eiji was brought up in Hokkaido, where his father had a jewellery shop. He went to Iwamizawa East high school in Hokkaido before going on to study acting at Tama Art University in Tokyo. After graduation, he was a member of\u00a0the Neo Literature Theatre company and then joined the Tokyo Kid Brothers. This company, formed by Yutaka Higashi in 1968, was part of the underground theatre movement and the style of rock music used in its shows was profoundly anti-establishment. I first met Eiji in 1972 when the Kid Brothers brought their show The Moon Is East, the Sun Is West to London. The show appropriated western music culture with a maniacal energy and felt both familiar yet utterly strange. It\u00a0was based on a 16th-century Chinese adventure story about a monk travelling to India looking for enlightenment. The show opened at the Oval House theatre in Kennington, then moved to the Royal Court and the Hampstead theatre. Eiji subsequently joined Stomu Yamashta&apos;s Red Buddha Theatre for The\u00a0Man from the East, a physical theatre show depicting episodes from Japanese life, ancient and modern, real\u00a0and fantastic, with accompaniment from Yamashta and an ensemble playing electronic and traditional instruments. This popular show originated in Paris, played for a month at the Roundhouse in London, then toured Europe and the\u00a0US. In 1975 Eiji returned to Britain and joined my avant-garde theatre group, Lumiere &amp; Son. He appeared in The Sleeping Quarters of Sophia, a play about split personalities, and delivered a succession of disciplined but eccentric performances for the company over the next 10 years. He was serious and focused in rehearsal, yet could be constructively unpredictable in performance. In Dogs (1976), Eiji played Edgar, a hapless immigrant entrapped by a murderous couple who are in thrall to Sadean aristocrats. The part required a comic but cowed quality that contrasted strongly with the violence Eiji summoned in Indications Leading to ... (1975), a tale of detection in which the detectives enacted the roles of both perpetrator and prosecutor. In 1977, he was in the Royal Shakespeare Company&apos;s production of Privates On Parade by Peter Nichols, playing a spying communist servant. He worked for several other companies, including Oxford Playhouse, Bristol Old Vic, Yellow Earth, Polka Theatre and Amazonia, and was one of the founder members of Ichiza Theatre Company. His last stage performance was in 2007, in Hisashi Inoue&apos;s comedy masterpiece of Japanese postwar drama, The Face of\u00a0Jizo, at the Arcola in east London. The\u00a0play comprised conversations between a young woman who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the ghost of her father. The play shows the daughter&apos;s anguish that she survived but her father did not. On television Eiji appeared in Doctor Who, Inspector Morse and in 17 episodes of the much-praised BBC series Tenko. Set in 1942 in an internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island, Tenko dramatised the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women captured after the fall of Singapore. During the 1990s, Eiji was a regular presenter on two Japanese TV programmes, Hello London and Living in England, in which his idiosyncratic, comic personality was given free rein. He had vast experience as a voiceover artist in both Japanese and English in film, TV, commercials and radio. He was the voice of the evil genius Dr Kamikazi in the animated TV series Robotboy and was particularly well known for his wild co-narration in the cult TV classic, Banzai, which invited viewers to place their bets on bizarre challenges, such as how long Mr Shake Hands Man would maintain a handshake with a procession of bemused celebrities. Eiji&apos;s enthusiastic commentary highlighted the programme&apos;s wackiness. His film credits included small roles in The Elephant Man, Eyes Wide Shut and Topsy-Turvy, as well as many student films in which he appeared without taking a fee. He is survived by his wife, the designer Kyoko Wainai, whom he married in 1992, and his brother, Yuji. \u2022 Eiji Kusuhara, actor, born 2 January 1947; died 23 April 2010"}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo press was impressed."], "tags": ["South Korea", "World Cup 2010", "World Cup 2010 Group B", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-27T23:05:19Z", "title": "Park Ji-sung hopes World Cup can help unite a divided Korea | John Duerden", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/28/park-ji-sung-south-korea", "article": "Park Ji-sung is on South Korean television often. Catching up with his Manchester United exploits on the national news is a Monday evening tradition in Seoul for those who missed the live action. He also does his fair share of commercials especially in the build up to the World Cup, a topic that is second only to North Korea in the news these days. In a recent advert for an energy company, a young boy plays Park Ji-sung in the 2002 World Cup match against Portugal while the man who scored the goal that booked the co-hosts&apos; place in the second round is in a suit acting the role of the manager, Guus Hiddink. As the captain, mentor and best player of a South Korea team under considerable pressure from the nation this summer, it is probably the only job the midfielder has not yet performed for the\u00a0squad. Playing for Manchester United, in his words &quot;the best club in the world&quot;, brings fame, fortune and, especially when he returns home, huge expectation \u2013 &quot;He is the king of Korea,&quot; exclaimed his amazed team-mate Patrice Evra upon witnessing the return of Park to his homeland last summer. Park takes it all in his stride. &quot;Of course, I&apos;m just a person; I feel pressure from outside and all the expectations. But I am happy because when I was young I wanted to be a national team player and now everyone expects me to show more. I am very happy.&quot; This is his third World Cup but there is an extra twist in the shape of North Korea. Park played a big part in helping the Chollima qualify by scoring against Iran in June 2009, to ensure that North Korea needed just to draw in Saudi Arabia to reach South Africa. After the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea achieved their result, some of their players publicly thanked the southern captain. It was a happy reminder of how football can unite, especially with tensions high after Seoul publicly accused Pyongyang of sinking the South Korean corvette the Cheonan in the Yellow Sea in March with the loss of 46 sailors. Among other measures such as the cessation of trade, the Seoul government announced that it would soon resume broadcasting noisy anti-Kim Jong-il propaganda over the border. Pyongyang quickly promised to destroy the loudspeakers. That border is so close to Paju National Football Centre where Park trains with the team that if you laid all the seven pristine pitches end-to-end, they would almost reach North Korea. These are troubled times but there is genuine pride in the south that the peninsula is sending two teams to South Africa. There is also curiosity as to how the northern team will fare in a difficult group containing Brazil, Ivory Coast and Portugal. &quot;It will be interesting,&quot; Park says. &quot;I will watch the North Korean games. North Korea and South Korea speak the same language and actually we are the same country. It&apos;s the first time when both teams go to the World Cup. Their group is very tough but North Korea is a difficult team to beat and difficult to score against as they showed in qualification. I want to see how they deal with the best teams in the world. &quot;Everyone expects that North Korea can&apos;t go to the second round but they can make something different in their group because I think that they will not lose three games. Maybe they can get a point or some points and make the other teams struggle to get to the second round.&quot; Nobody can predict the future when it comes to North Korea but perhaps football can succeed where politics has failed. The leader of South Korea&apos;s 2022 World Cup bid, the former South Korean foreign minister Han Sung-joo, has talked of allowing Pyongyang to stage a couple of games, citing &quot;ping-pong diplomacy&quot; as a model that Park also supports. &quot;Football can produce something more than we expect and maybe we can get closer to North Korea through the World Cup,&quot; Park says. &quot;Football can make things different and football can make change around the world. I hope football can do something for Korea. I know how big a tournament the World Cup is and we have experience of the 2002 World Cup. When it was held here, the atmosphere was fantastic, it was like a festival. We noticed at the first game when we went to the stadium and we saw all the people in the red shirts, the atmosphere was like nothing we had ever seen, and after we saw the news and the fans on the street, it was unbelievable.&quot; Next month South Korea are desperate to make the last 16 for the first time in seven attempts overseas. Four points weren&apos;t enough in 2006. Park wasn&apos;t quite fit then but now is a different story. &quot;Our goal is the second round. At the 2002 World Cup we reached the semi-finals but at other World Cups we couldn&apos;t get through the group stage so, first, we want to go to the second round.&quot; The 2006 coach, Dick Advocaat, said recently that the 2010 version of South Korea is better than the one he took to Germany and they look to be the Asian Confederation&apos;s strongest challengers. With such players as Bolton Wanderers winger Lee Chung-yong, Ki Sung-yong of Celtic and Monaco&apos;s Park Chu-young in attack, South Korea have a strong and youthful spine, assuming that the central defence, long considered to be the team&apos;s achilles heel but one that has looked more solid of late, can hold firm. It did so on May 24 as Park starred and scored the first goal in a 2-0 win at the home of fierce rivals Japan. The Tokyo press was impressed. The Daily Yomiuri called him a class apart, Japanese television called him Asia&apos;s number one player. More chances come to prove that with friendly games against Belarus and Spain in Austria before the team flies south. &quot;Spain are one of the best teams in the world,&quot; says Park. &quot;Everyone is talking about Spain and if they can win the World Cup so it will be a good test for us, to see how we do against the best teams and we just try 100% and we can know our weak points and strong points. That could give us more confidence in South Africa.&quot; They will need it to face a certain Lionel Messi. &quot;You can&apos;t stop just one player; you have to stop the entire team. Argentina are strong particularly in the forward line \u2013 Carlos Tevez showed this season what he can do, Higua\u00edn, Ag\u00fcerro, Messi ...It&apos;s not just one player, we focus on every player and we play as a team and not as individuals.&quot; Park is the one Korean who has shared the pitch with such stars on a regular basis. Since his move to Manchester United in July 2005 he has proved the doubters, who claimed he was signed for commercial reasons, wrong by becoming a valued member of the Old Trafford set-up. He came close to a fourth Premier League medal this month. &quot;It was disappointing at the end because we lost the championship [to Chelsea]. If we had won, we would have made history with four years in a row. We were quite low in the dressing room. Everyone knew it would be difficult because Chelsea played Wigan but we tried our best because in football, you never know what happens but it was out of our hands. But the season has passed and now we are just looking forward to next season.&quot; Before that, of course, is what could be his final World Cup. &quot;I haven&apos;t decided the date but in 2014 my age will be 33. It is good for the national team if the young players grow up quickly and it may be that I can&apos;t start with the national team. That&apos;s why I think this World Cup is my last.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 28 May 2010.

Hosted by Louisa Cameron from Inkling Creative and produced by Adam Bourne design, the night&apos;s aim was to showcase the people behind the webpages. Introducing the event, Cameron said:   &quot;At the end of the say, we&apos;re all creatives \u2013 let&apos;s get people from behind their computer screens.&quot;      Julian Skyes talking about Hoffi design at PechaKucha Cardiff Photograph: Hannah Waldram/guardian.co.uk    Last night&apos;s speakers included Julian Sykes from Hoffi, who kicked off the evening by talking about how to manage the amount of design in your life \u2013 with a little plug for thinkARK&apos;s empty shop project on 2-3 July in Castle Arcade.  Carl Morris enraptured the audience by talking about Sleeveface \u2013 an idea which cannot fail to inspire and is worth checking out here. Peter Cox from Cardiff Civic Society gave a compelling insight to how Cardiff is changing and what elements have been lost along its development. He said:  &quot;Cardiff&apos;s growth has been both sudden and exponential. The city of 1891 is barely recognisable as apparently unstoppable expansion consumes whole communities.&quot;  Cox praised the design of Chapter Arts Centre, where the event took place, for being inclusive, community focused and putting society at the heart of the building.

Australia&apos;s environment minister, Peter Garrett, said the decision proved his country&apos;s commitment to &quot;bring to an end Japan&apos;s programme of so-called scientific whaling&quot;. Japan kills just under 1,000 mainly minke whales in the Antarctic every year, using a provision in the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling that allows it to conduct &quot;lethal research&quot; into the mammals. The meat from the hunts is sold in restaurants and supermarkets. The Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, has come under pressure to honour a 2007 election pledge to ban whaling in an area the country considers a whale sanctuary. Japan does not recognise the sanctuary and insists its whaling fleet operates in international waters. Rudd&apos;s critics had accused him of reneging on his promise for fear of angering Japan, which is Australia&apos;s second biggest export market. The Australian foreign minister, Stephen Smith, said the International Whaling Commission&apos;s failure to find a diplomatic solution had left the government with no choice. &quot;The Australian government has not taken this decision lightly,&quot; he said. But recent statements by whaling countries in the commission have provided Australia with little cause for hope that our serious commitment to conservation of the world&apos;s whales will be reflected in any potential IWC compromise agreement.&quot; Although both countries were quick to characterise the forthcoming legal battle as a dispute between friends, Japan&apos;s agriculture minister, Hirotaka Akamatsu, described the announcement as &quot;extremely regrettable&quot;, and insisted that the scientific hunts were permitted by international law. The announcement comes as the IWC prepares to meet in Morocco in an attempt to resolve long-standing differences between pro- and anti-whaling nations. The body will discuss a controversial proposal that would allow Japan, Iceland and Norway to resume commercial whaling, provided they observe strict quotas that will be reduced over the next decade. Australia has yet to reveal details of the case it plans to make in the Hague, but experts said it could argue that Japan kills far too many whales than is necessary to conduct scientific research. It may also try to convince the court that Japan could study whales without killing them, and that the open sale of whale meat constitutes a violation of the 25-year-old ban on commercial whaling. New Zealand, a vocal opponent of whaling, said it would continue to negotiate with Japan, but did not rule out joining Australia in court should diplomatic efforts fail. Japan&apos;s whaling programme is coming under increased scrutiny at home with the start yesterday of the trial of Peter Bethune, a member of the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group. Bethune, a 45-year-old New Zealander, was arrested after boarding the Shonan Maru 2 whaling ship to protest against the February sinking of the group&apos;s high-tech powerboat, the Ady Gil, following a collision with the Japanese vessel the previous month. Yesterday Bethune pleaded guilty to four charges, including trespassing and obstruction of business, but denied the most serious charge of assault relating to clashes between the whalers and Sea Shepherd in February. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. The alleged victim of the assault, Takashi Kominami, today told the Tokyo district court how he had sustained injuries to his face from a bottle containing rancid butter that prosecutors say was thrown by Bethune. &quot;I heard voices saying &apos;Yoo-hoo!&apos; from the [Sea Shepherd] boat. I tried to turn towards the boat but my vision became blurred, my eyes hurt and I could hardly open them,&quot; he said. Kominami said Bethune should be &quot;severely punished&quot; for the alleged attack: &quot;I am angry. But I don&apos;t think he feels any remorse at all.&quot; He admitted, however, that he had not actually seen Bethune launch the bottle that struck him. A further hearing will be held on Monday, and a verdict is expected next month."}, {"sentences": ["Nobody thought that Tokyo would strike.", "Mutaguchi sat at his lush command centre hundreds of miles distant, eating his fill, summoning geishas \u2013 and telling his emperor and superiors in Tokyo that all would be well, that Sato was just making difficulties."], "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Second world war", "Hay festival"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-28T23:06:17Z", "title": "Road of Bones by Fergal Keane | Book review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/fergal-keane-road-of-bones", "article": "It was already a road of death in 1942, as thousands of British, Indians and fellow travellers fled Rangoon, hounded by bandits, after the Japanese took Burma. It was a road of carnage in March 1944, as 15,000 men from the 31st Infantry Division of Japan&apos;s Imperial Army marched up it, bent on taking Kohima, the gateway to India, and then bearing down on the crucial allied supply centre at Dimapur. And it was a road of bones \u2013 unburied bodies piled high, carcasses stripped clean by animals \u2013 as the famished, exhausted remnants of this mighty invasion force staggered back to Burma and ultimate surrender. Most of the big battles of the second world war have been analysed to exhaustion. But the siege of Kohima, a sleepy little hill town on the peripheries of the Raj, a nowhere-in-particular place that nobody bothered to protect until it was almost too late, has been all but forgotten. This is an epic story of the unfamiliar, which begins with benevolent deputy district commissioners playing tennis, as young lady anthropologists from Roedean study native art nearby. It goes on to reveal the tennis court strewn with corpses, while one of the anthropologists, Ursula Graham Bower, leads a band of Naga fighters through the forests to harry the Japanese. These are not cartoon heroics, though. Fergal Keane operates masterfully on three levels, setting this, the last military stand of British empire, in a far wider campaign context (and confirming Bill Slim&apos;s reputation as the best wartime general the British had). He views much of the conflict through the eyes of those, on both sides, who fought until they dropped: their personal testimony \u2013 Japanese as well as British \u2013 is still vivid, compelling and terrifying. And he doesn&apos;t suffer the fools who made grave mistakes gladly. Burma 1942 wasn&apos;t Whitehall&apos;s or Churchill&apos;s finest hour. Rangoon&apos;s white rulers, wastrel and racist, were allowed to play on heedlessly while the threat of Japan&apos;s 15th Army grew. Nobody thought that Tokyo would strike. Everybody was wrong. Nobody thought, after Pearl Harbor changed every equation, that General Mutaguchi&apos;s troops would try to push into India through the steep, wild Naga hills. Wrong again. British and Indian forces which might have held the Kohima pass were not reinforced but pulled out at the last minute. Defending the town, the road and the hillsides above it was left to, at most, 1,500 men, a rag-tag force of signallers, sappers, mule-drivers and a few hardened infantry. This random compote of Indian army, British and mixed regiments had neither cohesion nor \u2013 in some cases \u2013 much enthusiasm for battle. When the Japanese attacked, some fought with extreme bravery, but others ran away. At least a few hundred men from the Royal West Kent regiment returned to shore up Kohima&apos;s defences. Then the Japanese, short of air cover, ammunition and \u2013 most crippling of all \u2013 food supplies, began to lose hundreds of men in despairing charges against the town (and across that tennis court). Though the casualties grew and grew, the West Kents and the 1st Assams dug in, fighting yard by yard in a way that made Slim, at his HQ far away, remember Flanders fields. And then, painfully slowly, more relief columns inched up the road from Dimapur, lifted the siege and began \u2013 with still more blood, still more desperation \u2013 to clear the Japanese troops from the hills. It&apos;s some of the smaller, emotional details of this account that strike hardest. The leeches accompanying every march, the lice that infect open wounds, the mud and guts, the almost berserk heroism as Corporal John Harman VC storms two Japanese machine gun nests, the count of the dead day after day on that damned tennis court. Keane catches both shrinking revulsion and astounding courage to brilliant effect because he so often puts people first, because he knows that this all-consuming encounter could only look in on itself as the battle crawled from trench to trench through days and weeks without sleep. There wasn&apos;t a wider world in Kohima then: just more broken bodies in the ad hoc hospital, more broken minds slipping away into the forests of the night. On the outside, conventional history still operates. British generals doze too long and react too slowly. Top brass play politics more assiduously than the politicians. Messages, when they get through, go unread or are lost. The Nagas, faithful followers of the Union flag and dogged foes of Nehru&apos;s pending hegemony, are ditched without compunction when it&apos;s all over (and are today consigned to still more freedom-fighting against Bangladesh). The Americans, not very keen on imperialism of any kind themselves, don&apos;t do special relations in this conflict. But perhaps Keane&apos;s most memorable insights come on the Japanese side of this account. General Sato, the commander of the 31st, doubted the strategy of his superior, Mutaguchi, and he was right. The Kohima assault was a folly that, inexorably, hastened the 15th Army&apos;s collapse in Burma. There was terrible sickness, appalling dysentery; there was a hunger that could never be appeased and a supply chain that could never be repaired. Mutaguchi sat at his lush command centre hundreds of miles distant, eating his fill, summoning geishas \u2013 and telling his emperor and superiors in Tokyo that all would be well, that Sato was just making difficulties. Some difficulties! Of the 15,000 who marched on Kohima, more than half never came home. The bones along the final road belonged to them. Those who did make it back to Rangoon were traumatised and weak. It was a defeat that made continuing Japanese resistance futile. It was the little war that should have ended the great war in the Far East. Yet still there was pride, inflexibility, loyalty, disbelief; and still there was Hiroshima. I found myself, on one or two pages towards the close, caught in a choking emotion. The evidence is meticulously gathered and the writing so powerful that it turns a book about a battle into a book about human beings, their existence, their end. Keane&apos;s Kohima is more than one episode among many, more even than an account of how two differing empires fell apart. It is a book about life in death.

Smaller than a matchbox, often as small as the joint of my little-finger, these Japanese ivory, bone and wooden carvings are hard explosions of exactitude. You roll them in your hands and find the carver has added a joke: the tail of a disappearing rat, a deliquescent plum fallen from a basket. Some of the netsuke are studies in running movement, so that your fingers move along a surface of uncoiling rope or spilt water. Others have small, congested movements that knot your touch: a girl in a wooden bath, a vortex of clam shells. Some do both, surprising you: an intricately ruffled dragon leans against a simple rock. You work your fingers round the smoothness and stoniness of the ivory to meet this sudden density of dragon. There is often a supplementary pleasure in finding where the signature of the carver is placed, on the sole of a sandal, the end of a branch, the thorax of a hornet. When I look at these marks I think of the moves you make when you sign your name in Japan \u2013 the sweep of the brush into the ink, the first, plosive moment of contact, the return to the ink stone \u2013 and wonder at how you could develop such a distinctive signature using the fine metal tools of the netsuke maker. I have 264 netsuke: street vendors, beggars and monks, rat catchers, dogs, lovers, a woman and an octopus, an elderly lady on an elderly horse, a witch trapped in a temple bell, a persimmon about to split, a hare with amber eyes. It is a very big collection of very small objects. I pick one up and turn it round in my fingers, weigh it in the palm of my hand. If it is wood, chestnut or elm, it is even lighter than the ivory. You see the patina more easily on these wooden ones: there is a faint shine on the spine of the brindled wolf and on the tumbling acrobats locked in their embrace. The ivory ones come in\u00a0shades of cream, every colour, in fact but white. A few have inlaid eyes of amber or horn. Some of the older ones are slightly worn away: the haunch of the faun resting on leaves has lost its markings. There is a slight split, an almost imperceptible fault line on the cicada. Who dropped it? Where and when? I first saw them lit-up at night in a long vitrine in the sitting-room of my great-uncle Iggie, in his apartment looking out over Tokyo. I was 17 and had come to Japan to spend a summer making pots. I was halfway through my two-year apprenticeship to a rather severe English potter. Iggie and Jiro, his Japanese friend in the adjoining apartment, looked after me, bought me some smarter clothes from one of the department stores in the Ginza, took me to the theatre and gave me my first whisky sours in the bar at the Imperial Hotel. He would say that these ivories were the reason he had come to Japan, an inheritance from Vienna and Paris. He had brought them home. When Iggie died I stood in the temple on the outskirts of Tokyo where he was to be buried and after the sutras had been chanted and he had received his kaimyo, the Buddhist name that would help him through the next life, I said the Kaddish for the Baron Ignace Leon von Ephrussi, fashion designer, soldier, banker, &quot;long-term resident of Tokyo&quot;, the last of a dynasty. And afterwards, back in the apartment, Jiro picked up his brush and wrote and sealed a document to say that when he had gone, I should look after this collection. So I was to be next. But what was I looking after? What had come with this inheritance? I knew the outlines of the story. The collection had been bought in Paris by a cousin of my great-great-grandfathers called Charles Ephrussi, an art critic and a passionate supporter of the Impressionists. Charles is there at the very back of Renoir&apos;s Luncheon of the Boating Party, an unlikely figure among the louche crowd, dressed in black with a slightly tilted top hat. You can just see a rufus haze of beard. He is deep in conversation with his secretary, the young poet Jules Laforgue. Charles had given the collection of netsuke \u2013 and the grand black lacquer vitrine with deep velvet shelves and a mirrored back which housed them \u2013 as a wedding-present to my great-great grandfather Viktor when he married a beautiful young socialite. This extravagant gift arrived in the vast Palais Ephrussi on the Ringstrasse in Vienna just as the new century was about to begin. And they survived a very complicated century, coming back to Japan in a battered attach\u00e9 case with my great-uncle Iggie. And I know that the Ephrussi family were almost unimaginably rich \u2013 rich even among their circle of Jewish bankers. Originally from Odessa, they had cornered the trade in grain, and by the 1860s were known as &quot;Les Roi des Bl\u00e9s&quot;, the Kings of Grain, their coat-of-arms a proud little sailing ship on a stormy sea. But what concerned me was how to navigate my way through this parade of sepia memories, the gilt and marble blur of lost houses, estates, a golden-dinner service, balls and racehorses, flunkeys. These objects seemed too specific to be co-opted into a narrative of loss, annoyingly melancholic. I have a strong aversion to nostalgia for a past that isn&apos;t yours. And the thought of yet another posh Mitteleuropa memoir set to Strauss, cross-generational misery-lit, made me slightly sick. I was anxious because what I&apos;d been given with these netsuke was far, far more interesting than a generic set of anecdotes. I&apos;d been given objects with memories. I&apos;d been given part of a story, a few echoes, a sense of untold narratives. And this challenge: anecdotalise this odd collection for the rest of your life. Or work it out. I make things for my living. This means that how objects are handled and where they are placed is a question that has been at the heart of my life for 30 years. But it also means that I am endlessly letting objects go. My porcelain vessels get wrapped in tissue, and then in bubble-wrap, and are crated up and lifted into the backs of vans, and I sign a piece of paper and they are gone. They are off into the world of commodities to be sold, collected, handed on, given. And so I have a strong sense of the story-telling around how objects get handed on. I am giving you this because I love you. Because it was given to me. Because I bought it somewhere special. Because you will care for it. Because it will complicate your life. Because it will make someone else envious. There is no easy story in legacy. What is remembered and what is forgotten? There can be a chain of forgetting, the rubbing away of previous ownership as much as the slow accretion of stories. What is being passed on to me with these small Japanese objects? I want to know what the relationship has been between this wooden thing that I am rolling between my fingers \u2013 hard and tricky and Japanese \u2013 and where it has been. I want to be able to walk round each room it has been placed in, to know what pictures were on the walls and how the light falls from the windows. And I want to know whose hands it has been in and what they felt about it and thought about it. If they thought about it. I dislike anthropomorphising objects, but I want to know what it has witnessed, whether I can talk of the memory of objects. This was the challenge. Find the places where the collection had been- in Paris, Vienna and Tokyo, and try to find out what it might have meant to open the vitrine of netsuke and reach in and pick one out and roll it in your hands. Find the secret history of touch. I had memories of conversations with my grandmother and great-uncle, a slim file of letters and photographs from my father: the family archive held in a Somerfield plastic bag. I knew where they had lived. It seemed scant evidence to go on. So I go and stand outside Charles Ephrussi&apos;s first house in Paris, the Hotel Ephrussi on a hill of golden, neo-classical mansions, and look up at the windows to the rooms where he held his salons. Up there, hanging alongside the rich burgundy embroideries he had bought in Italy, were his new Degas and Monet and Renoir paintings. This was where the netsuke collection first lived, its first resting-place in the heart of passionate talk about what art could mean. It was also his study. This is where Charles wrote passionately about the need to look at paintings and sculpture \u2013 and then look again. And this is where Charles, Jewish, charming and social, a collector, art historian and editor, entertained and encouraged Proust. Charles becomes one of the models for Charles Swann. So I find that I am writing a book about memory haunted by Proust. And then I have to leave my Parisian archives and go to Vienna, and I walk past the Palais Ephrussi which seems to take up an absurd amount of skyline on the Ringstrasse, with its caryatids and urns and towers. The Palais belonged to a parade of make-believe buildings \u2013 a Potemkin city of paste-board and plaster, according to the fierce social critic Adolf Loos. This fairytale palace of gilded ceilings, a statue of Apollo in the courtyard, corridors full of paintings, marble and malachite, was also the family home of my fabulously-dressed great-grandmother, my bibliophilic great-grandfather and their four children. The netsuke were relegated to the dressing room, a room in the charge of her maid Anna. This is where I should be able to write about the frissons of fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna, Mahler, Klimt and the Secession. But in this implacable palais this kind of modernity was kept firmly at bay, just as the great oak doors on to the Ring were closed to the anti-semitic brawling from the university opposite. Here I find the strange refractions of the dislike of this rich family into books \u2013 the novelist Joseph Roth makes Ephrussi a rich jeweller in The Spider&apos;s Web: &quot;lank and tall, and always [wearing] black, with a high collared coat which just revealed a black silk stock pinned by a pearl the size of a hazelnut&quot;. His wife, the beautiful Frau Efrussi, is &quot;a lady: Jewish: but a lady&quot;. And here in Vienna I have to deal with other kinds of archive. Not just the wills and inventories but the lists in the Israelitische Kultursgemeinde in Vienna, each member of the Jewish community recorded over 200 years. And here I find the bank details, the lists of objects requisitioned by the Gestapo, comments by Viennese art-historians debating the merits of family pictures, the arguments over which should be sent to Berlin for Hitler to look over. It is here in Vienna that I begin to uncover the extraordinary story of what happened to the netsuke during the war, the story of Anna&apos;s smuggling of the collection to safety, one piece at a time, in her pockets. Finally I am back in Japan, trying to make sense of a collection of netsuke to a postwar world of deprivation. This is the Tokyo my great-uncle Iggie moved to in 1947 \u2013 a city so poor that there was talk of takenoko, where you sell first one layer of your possessions, then another, like an onion skin, just to survive. What did these carvings \u2013 owned by a westerner \u2013 mean now? Why I thought researching this history would take an autumn I do not know. After three years I begin to see how you can derail your life, return to an archive for another week, find a need to walk along a particular street in Paris to check a journey time. I wonder if I should go to every museum that houses one of Charles&apos;s pictures, or to the villages in Japan where the netsuke of the rat catchers was carved 200 years ago. I seem to be spending too long in cemeteries trying to find the graves of relatives. My files of notes get longer and longer. I spend a winter reading anti-semitic tracts, a month studying Charles&apos; essays on D\u00fcrer. I start to be a bore about the Viennese fashion for furs before the Great War. But my questions condense. What did these small things mean? Why does touch matter? And what survives? \u2022\u00a0Edmund de Waal is at the Guardian Hay festival on Sunday 30 May."}, {"sentences": ["After visiting with the American task force in 1947, Richie settled in Tokyo and became fascinated by Japanese cinema."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "Cannes film festival"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-29T23:01:04Z", "title": "Trailer Trash", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/30/trailer-trash-jason-solomons", "article": "Eclipse of the tattooed lady Maybe you caught the National Movie Awards on prime-time ITV last week? Most of us in the film world \u2013 as opposed to movies, that is \u2013 didn&apos;t even know it was happening and it certainly made Cannes look somewhat snobby. They had a starry list of attendees, from Chris Rock to the Harry Potter cast to Tom Cruise. My favourite category was the most-awaited movie of the summer award, which The Twilight Saga: Eclipse won ahead of some other movies which, you know, people are really, really looking forward to. I wonder why, though, they didn&apos;t show a clip from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo in the breakthrough category? Is it because they didn&apos;t like those ugly subtitles getting in the way? The award was won by The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife, which isn&apos;t very breakthrough at all, unless you go back in time to when Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams weren&apos;t already hugely famous. Of course, the NMA is a big studio love-in, voted for &quot;by the fans&quot; and all that and, sadly, it&apos;s probably more representative of film culture in the UK than Baftas, Bifas and critics&apos; awards, but in the future can we please find a spot in there to show that there is life on British screens from outside Hollywood? From Cannes to Japan Having won the Palme d&apos;Or last week with Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul (below) visited London to open his haunting installation Phantoms of Nabua at BFI Gallery on the Southbank. Due to the unrest in Thailand, he was finding it hard to get a visa, but, he said, that when you win the Palme d&apos;Or, suddenly doors that used to be closed seem magically to swing open. He&apos;s off to Japan next, he tells me, to make a documentary portrait of film scholar Donald Richie. After visiting with the American task force in 1947, Richie settled in Tokyo and became fascinated by Japanese cinema. He met Japanese film master Yasujiro Ozu and undertook to promote his films in the west. He then did the same for Akira Kurosawa and Kenji Mizoguchi before curating film seasons at New York&apos;s Moma and writing the definitive A Hundred Years of Japanese Film. &quot;The film will look at how he bridged the two cultures and why the east was so fascinating for him,&quot; said Apichatpong. &quot;But it won&apos;t be like a normal documentary. I don&apos;t know how to do that.&quot; Coming to a screen near you\u2026 Films from Cannes I hear are definitely getting UK distribution: Le Quattro Volte (a dialogue-free Italian film about goats); Cristi Puiu&apos;s three-hour Aurora and, hooray, Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s Film Socialisme and, of course, Uncle Boonmee\u2026"}, {"sentences": ["Over green tea in the ground floor restaurant in the Kanagawa Science Park, a hotel in Kawasaki just outside Tokyo where Jong plays his club football, it is hard to stop the 26-year-old talking."], "tags": ["North Korea", "World Cup 2010 Group G", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-29T23:07:03Z", "title": "Jong Tae-se is North Korea's answer to Wayne Rooney", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/30/jong-tae-se-north-korea-wayne-rooney", "article": "The North Korean football team has taken off its veil,&quot; wrote the Seoul media after their northern neighbours drew 2-2 with Greece in a World Cup warm-up in Switzerland on Tuesday. For the next few weeks the face that is revealed to the world, at least as far as football fans are concerned, will for a change not be that of a short, bespectacled dictator. The Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, will be upstaged by &quot;the People&apos;s Rooney&quot;, Jong Tae-se, a steely-eyed footballer full of passion, ambition, power and not a little humour: a popular goalscorer who, if he has his way, will soon be playing in the Premier League. Jong is already a star in east Asia. He took the 2008 East Asian Championship by storm in China; is one of the top strikers in Japan&apos;s J-League; has appeared in television adverts alongside Manchester United&apos;s Park Ji-sung in South Korea; and, most unusually in the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, where supporters do little more than clap at football matches, has had his name chanted by 80,000 fans at Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang. Now he is ready to take on the world. Jong&apos;s two sumptuous strikes against Greece \u2013 the first a 25-yard shot that crashed in off the bar, the second a fierce strike from a tight angle after a burst of acceleration past a defender \u2013 may even have caused a few frowns in the training camps of World Cup Group G opponents Brazil, Ivory Coast and Portugal. Over green tea in the ground floor restaurant in the Kanagawa Science Park, a hotel in Kawasaki just outside Tokyo where Jong plays his club football, it is hard to stop the 26-year-old talking. In his deep, rich voice, he announces: &quot;I want to score a goal a game at the World Cup, one goal a game, that is my target.&quot; And then? &quot;I want to play in England.&quot; It would complete an unusual journey. Jong was born, raised and still lives in Japan. There were reports in Seoul that his parents were South Korean but the player denies that this is the case and he appeared on the cover of South Korea&apos;s FourFourTwo magazine in 2008 above the headline: &quot;I am not South Korean&quot;. Once he entered the pro-northern education system that operates in Japan&apos;s large Korean community, there was only one team he was going to play for. &quot;I was born as a North Korean and went to a North Korean school just like many people in Japan do and many of my friends did. My mother is from North Korea. My father was brought up in Japan and went to a Japanese school but despite that he thought of himself as North Korean and I do, too.&quot; Midfielder Ahn Yong-hak is another Japan-based North Korea international. Such players, who earn about \u00a34,000 a week, go to Pyongyang on football-related visits only. Their team-mates earn a minimal state allowance and play for clubs such as the army outfit 25 April and Amroggang, one that has produced seven &quot;heroes of the republic&quot; in athletics and football. There is no professional football north of the 38th parallel, where matches draw sparse crowds. There are no divides in the DPRK dressing room, however. &quot;I am not the first North Korean player to be based in Japan and the other players have always been really nice to me. They just wanted to know information about Japan and the J-League \u2026 It was really impressive the way the players welcomed me and the way the North Korean government and people treated me.&quot; Politics is the one issue that Jong will not talk about, on or off the record. Another no-no, though he enthused about it when the recorder was switched off, was the trial he undertook at a Premier League club earlier this year. He will not name the club, but says he realised he was not quite good enough. He believes he can improve, however, and at the World Cup millions of fans around the world will get to see for themselves as he has the chance to compare himself to the best around. He has been nicknamed Inminui Rooney \u2013 the People&apos;s Rooney \u2013 because of his aggressive and hard-working style and stocky build, but he thinks that it is not the best moniker. &quot;I don&apos;t dislike being compared to Rooney, he is one of the greatest strikers in the world so it is a big honour, but my style of play is different to his. My benchmark is Didier\u00a0Drogba. &quot;I want to play in England. When I was at high school, Italy&apos;s Serie A was the most popular league but with the help of cable television, I started watching English football and I really enjoyed the stadiums, the atmosphere and the passion. Years ago, I used to train wearing a Blackburn Rovers shirt.&quot; Was this a common sight? &quot;I don&apos;t think so,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;In Japan, there were not many people wearing Blackburn shirts. I just went to the shop and bought one because I\u00a0liked\u00a0it.&quot; He may get close to the real thing after the summer. The last North Koreans to play in England famously defeated Italy on their way to a thrilling quarter-final with Portugal in the 1966 World Cup, in which the Asians took a 3-0 lead before losing 5-3. &quot;We know the history of course,&quot; Jong says. &quot;It will be tough to repeat it but we will give everything. Our technique is not better than the likes of South Korea and Japan but in terms of mentality and physicality, we are better than any other in Asia. Nobody really expects us to do much at the World Cup and there will be little criticism even if we lose all the games. If we win, that will be beyond our wildest dreams.&quot; Despite the presence of Drogba in the Ivory Coast team, Jong is more excited about the opening game on 15 June. &quot;I am looking forward to facing all three teams, especially Brazil with their history and football tradition. It will be a great experience to play such a team.&quot; It will be a far cry from the 2007 preliminary qualifier against Mongolia \u2013 the first step on a long road to South Africa. Later came four games against South Korea. When the two teams lined up before an emotional match in Shanghai (the match was moved from Pyongyang as North Korea refused to fly the southern flag or play their anthem) tears rolled down the striker&apos;s cheek. On the back of a solid defence and a quick counterattack, North Korea finished second in a tough final group containing Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea. &quot;We never really thought about qualification before the final round but game by game we improved a lot and we were able to stop our opponents from playing to their strengths,&quot; Jong says. &quot;I was very happy as qualification progressed because my team-mates were getting better and better.&quot; Claiming the runners-up spot was a tense affair. By the final day, South Korea had already won the group and were taking on Iran in Seoul. An away win would have left North Korea needing a victory in Saudi Arabia. That was on the cards as Iran were leading until Park equalised with nine minutes remaining. It meant that, thousands of miles to the west and a few hours later, North Korea needed only a draw in Riyadh. Jong watched the Seoul match in his hotel room in the Saudi capital as he tried to relax before the game. &quot;Park Ji-sung gave us the best-ever assist. He gave us a great chance. It was so exciting. I was with Ahn Yong-hak and we were hugging each other and jumping up and down when Park Ji-sung scored. We knew that we only needed a draw and I had faith that we could do the job in Saudi Arabia. We play defensively and I knew that few strikers can easily penetrate our defence.&quot; They held out for a goalless draw. &quot;At the final whistle, I was so happy and so excited. I cried for a long time. When we went back to our hotel, we intended to go out for a drink and have a good time but all of us were really tired. We just had dinner and went to bed. &quot;Many of the team went back to Pyongyang and had a great reception. I couldn&apos;t go but as you can imagine as North Korea hasn&apos;t qualified for the World Cup since 1966 then everyone there was so happy when we qualified, so excited.&quot; It was a triumph for the coach, Kim Jong-hun. Little is known about him, other than that he is gruff, likes to wear trenchcoats, and does not take kindly to journalists who refer to his team as North Korea rather than DPRK. His players speak highly of him but the team&apos;s biggest problem, like the coach&apos;s, is a lack of international experience. In the past, friendlies have been as few and far between as visitors to Pyongyang. Nigeria were due to go there in April but backed out when it became apparent that they were expected to bear the costs themselves. The team have not been idle, however, and at least from a football perspective, North Korea are internationalising at breakneck speed with trips to Africa, South America and Europe in recent months. It has not all gone smoothly. A game with Chile was cancelled because of an earthquake in the South American country in February, a game in China was scrapped after food poisoning, and a training camp in Zimbabwe was called off after locals protested about Korea&apos;s planned visit because, back in the early 1980s, North Korea helped to train a Zimbabwean army brigade that slaughtered at least 20,000 Ndebele people in the part of the country where the team were due to train. There is still support from elsewhere, however. Few fans, if any, from the nation itself are expected to go to South Africa but a number from the Korean community in Japan will travel and the Beijing office of the North Korean Sports Committee has given 1,000 tickets to Chinese fans. There is also a Beijing-based international fan group, DPR Korea Football Supporters Association, organised by two Englishmen, who will send 300 fans to cheer the team from all over the world. With South Korea sending just a few hundred Red Devils, due to the cost, distance and fears about security \u2013 widely reported in east Asia \u2013 the North could actually be better supported than their neighbours. But Jong hopes that the 2002 semi-finalists perform well in South Africa and he even has a regular column that appears in the Seoul media. It still continues despite the increase in tension between the two countries. On 24 May, South Korea publicly accused Pyongyang of having sunk the Cheonan, a navy corvette, in the Yellow Sea in March. Forty-six young sailors lost their lives. The chairman of South Korea&apos;s bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Han Sung-joo, a former foreign minister, remains keen to have North Korea involved in the tournament if possible. Jong certainly hopes that it is. &quot;If the World Cup comes to Pyongyang it would be beyond our wildest dreams. The people are already excited about the World Cup in South Africa, having a World Cup on home soil would be something else. It was impressive watching South Korea reach the last four back in 2002 and if North Korea has home advantage then we could perform well also. &quot;It may not be easy politically to be united but sport can unite people. If there are games in South Korea and North Korea, then that can contribute to peace on the Korean peninsula.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 1 June 2010."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;But might England&apos;s plan &apos;B&apos; of giving the ball to the opposition and hoping they score for them seem a bit flawed?&quot; &quot;I had a bet going with a Japanese friend here who was unusually unpatriotic, in that every Japanese goal meant a free beer for me,&quot; writes Humphry in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Friendlies", "England", "Japan", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-05-30T10:45:25Z", "title": "Football: England v Japan - as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/30/football-england-japan-friendly", "article": " Good afternoon everybody: Somebody else was supposed to be writing this report but they&apos;ve cried off sick, so I&apos;m stepping up to the plate. Apologies in advance if my knowledge of the Japan national football team isn&apos;t all it should be. Team news from the news wires: David James is handed his first England start for 13 months in England&apos;s final World Cup warm-up international with Japan in Graz. The Portsmouth goalkeeper last featured in Fabio Capello&apos;s starting 11 for the World Cup qualifier with Ukraine at Wembley in April 2009. His only action for his country since then was when he replaced the red-carded Robert Green in the return meeting with Ukraine in Dnipro in October. James and three Chelsea players - Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and John Terry - return after being rested for the win over Mexico after their involvement in the FA Cup final. Tom Huddlestone, as confirmed yesterday by England coach Fabio Capello, is given his first start in a bid to make a late claim to be part of the final squad of 23 for South Africa. The Tottenham midfielder had previously been used as a substitute against Brazil in Doha and against Mexico.  England: David James, Glen Johnson, Ashley Cole, Tom Huddlestone, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Theo Walcott, Frank Lampard, Darren Bent, Wayne Rooney, Aaron Lennon. Japan: Seigo Narazaki, Atsuto Uchida, Yuji Nakazawa, Tulio Tanake, Yuto Nagatomo, Junichi Inamoto, Makoto Hasebe, Shunsuke Nakamura, Keisuke Honda, Daisuke Matsui, Shinji Okazaki.  A hastily researched/plagiarised &quot;bit&quot; about England&apos;s opponents: Japan are in Group E at the World Cup, where they&apos;ll play the Netherlands, Denmark and Cameroon. They qualified for South Africa 2010 with a 1-0 win over the mighty Uzbekistan last June. Eight of their starting line-up ply their trade in the J-League, with Makoto Hasebe (Wolfsburg), Daisuke Matsui (Grenoble) and Keisuke Honda (CSKA Moscow) being the three who take foreign coin. English and Scottish readers will of course be familiar with Junichi Inamoto (ex-Arsenal, Fulham, West Brom and Cardiff) and Shunsuke Nakamura (ex-Celtic).  Not long now: The teams emerge from the tunnel in the APC Arena in Graz, with England wearing red shirts and socks, with white shorts; Japan&apos;s are kitted out in all blue.  1 min: Japan kick off, playing from left to right. According to Fabio Capello, there are three places in his 23-man squad up for grabs today, so peripheral players like Darren Bent, Tom Huddlestone and Aaron Lennon will be very eager to impress.  2 min: On the edge of the final third, Darren Bent leaps highest to flick a long ball from Tom Huddlestone into the path of Wayne Rooney, galloping through the centre. He&apos;s forced right and wide and instead of trying a shot from a narrow angle, he squares the ball for ... nobody. Seigo Narazaki in the Japan goal gets an early touch.  4 min: Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but I think this is the first time Lennon and Theo Walcott have lined up in the same England team. With Tom Huddlestone quarter-backing the ball out to such pacey wingers, Darren Bent and Wayne Rooney could fill their boots this afternoon.  5 min: &quot;So considering Ireland probably aren&apos;t going to make this World Cup who will you be supporting?&quot; asks Gerry Scott. &quot;And who will your money be on?&quot; Probably aren&apos;t going to make it? You sound cautiously optimistic that they might still have a chance. God bless your optimism. Should Ireland fail in their efforts to make it to South Africa, I&apos;ll be supporting Diego Maradona&apos;s comedy Argentina outfit. My money - all \u00a315 of it - is on Germany at 16-1. It&apos;s a bet I placed with little confidence, but I thought it was a good price.  GOAL! England 0-1 Japan (Tulio 7)  How do you like them apples, eh? England&apos;s defneders decide to take an afternoon nap during a corner and are punished by Japan&apos;s centre-back Tulio Tanaka. The ball was pulled back low and hard to Tanaka by Yasuhito Endo.The centre-half had stolen a march on Glen Johnson and swept a low drive in at the near post with a first-time effort from 15 yards. Capello will be furious with that slack marking. To make matters worse, Ashley Cole was standing on the post, presumably to assure himself of a good view of the ball as it fizzed past him on its way in.  9 min: England are all over the place here - a byword for haplessness. Okazaki evades John Terry and sends a curler high and wide of David James&apos;s right upright.  11 min: Glen Johnson is having a shocker here. Under no pressure whatsoever, he attempts to ping a cross-field pass to John Terry, but ends up shanking the ball into Row Z.  14 min: Japan attack again, with full-back Yuto Nagatomo galloping up the left flank. Johnson intervenes, conceding a throw-in.  15 min: Japan win a corner, this time from the left. It&apos;s whipped in to the near post, ricochets off a defender and bounces across the penalty area. With assorted England defenders waiting for somebody else to deal with it, Tulio Tanaka pounces and tries another shot, which is cannons off Rio Ferdinand.  17 min: Tom Huddlestone is penalised for a foul on Okazaki, who goes down injured. The ball&apos;s kicked out of play to allow the physio on to treat him. He&apos;ll live.  18 min: Aaron Lennon misses a great opportunity to draw England level after being put clean through on goal by a marvellous weighted pass from Wayne Rooney. England&apos;s three-pronged attack converged on the Japan back four, with Rooney in the centre. He waited and waited before threading a pass to Lennon between full-back and central defender. The Spurs winger shot straight at the goalkeeper.  21 min: England win a free-kick on the right flank, which Frank Lampard swings into the miser. The ball takes a deflection off a Japanese head and goes out for a corner, which is wasted.  23 min: England were dismal in the first half of their recent friendly against Mexico, but are even worse here. This performance is truly shocking. Sloppy passing, terrible defending and a prevailing air of lethargy ... they&apos;re unlikely to get away with this kind of nonsense in South Africa.  25 min: England win a free-kick about 40 yards from the Japanese goal and Japanese goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki doesn&apos;t bother organising a wall. Frank Lampard tries his luck and the goalkeeper spills the ball into the path of one of his own defenders, who puts it out for a corner.  27 min: From the corner, Frank Lampard flashes the corner across the edge of the penalty area, where Darren Bent had shaken off his marker and jumped highest. His bullet-header is well off course and sails off in the direction of the corner flag.  28 min: England win a free-kick in the left channel, about 30 yards from the Japan goal. This time Narazaki assembles a wall, which does its job well.  29 min: Playing alone up front, Japan striker Okazaki is giving John Terry and Rio Ferdinand plenty to think about. He&apos;s making plenty of well timed, mazy, jinking runs in his efforts to latch on to the long raking passes being sent his way from midfield.  30 min: From just inside his own half, Rio Ferdinand plays a long, 45-yard pass into the Japan penalty area. Goalscorer Tanaka heads the ball straight up in the air, prompting his goalkeeper and Darren Bent to contest the dropping ball. Bent wins the header bravely, but can&apos;t steer his effort on target. Wide.  33 min: With Theo Walcott patrolling the right wing and Aaron Lennon on the left, you&apos;d have expected a lot more from England than they&apos;re showing here. They&apos;ve improved a bit in the last 10 minutes, but the manner in which they&apos;re wasting possession is pitiable. Even Rooney&apos;s caught the bug - pinging a pass intended for Tom Huddlestone straight to the feet of Yuto Nagatomo.  35 min: Matt Stratford has mailed to let me know I&apos;ve been doing Japan goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki an injustice - he&apos;s not playing because his understudy is being given a run out. &quot;The Japan keeper is Kawashima, not Narazaki (who was in goal against Korea last week though),&quot; writes Matt. Apologies for the error - the team-sheet I purloined from a rival website appears to be wrong.  38 min: Rooney&apos;s playing in a withdrawn role in behind Darren Bent this afternoon, a position in which you might expect him to thrive. But with the exception of his marvellous pass to Lennon earlier, he&apos;s not been playing at all well.  39 min: Just to prove me wrong, Rooney performs yogic heroics in an attempt to divert a wayward Tom Huddlestone shot from distance into the Japan goal. The ball flashes wide of the left upright.  40 min: Japan win a free-kick on the left flank, which Tanaka fizzes across the face of goal. The unmarked Okazaki arrives too late to poke the ball home and it sails wide. Observer columnist David James admonishes his sleepy defenders with a loud &quot;For fuck&apos;s sake!!!&quot;  42 min: I hope Observer columnist David James doesn&apos;t kiss his mum with that potty mouth.  43 min: Theo Walcott springs to life, turning left-back Yuto Nagatomo inside out before drilling a low, hard cross a little too close to Mr Kawashima in the Japan goal.  Half-time: After a pitiful first half effort, England&apos;s players traipse off for a well-earned rollocking from their manager. Not a single one of them can claim to have played well against a Japan side that is hard-working and well organised, but nothing special.  Half-time analysis: &quot;Worst three players of the first half?&quot; writes Kevin Hunter. &quot;My choice, in reverse order, would be Ashley Cole, Theo Walcott and Glenn Johnson. Special mention to Huddlestone and Bent - on another day they&apos;d have done enough to make the list.&quot; I couldn&apos;t disagree with much of that, although I think you&apos;re being a bit harsh on Bent, as he hasn&apos;t had much service and has at least been trying. I&apos;m going to nominate John Barnes, because I&apos;ve just him reprising his World In Motion rap in the shameful new Mars advert. Judging by the gut on him, I&apos;d say he got paid in Mars bars. Where&apos;s the dignity? Carl Smith writes: &quot;The current US edition of Esquire described the England team as &apos;stoic and fatalistic to the point of self defeat&apos;. I would describe them as spoilt and flattered to the point of self delusion. The well-rehearsed post-match &apos;we can play much better&apos; argument is wearing a bit thin.&quot; &quot;I watched Japan get absolutely dominated by a well-organised South Korea side on Monday night,&quot; writes Matt Stratford. &quot;The commentators were trashing the lot of them for appearing not to care. The England boys must have thought this would have been a walk in the park.&quot; Interestingly, Japan were 15-1 to win this match - a ludicrous price fuelled by ignorance, stupidity and jingoism, I suspect.  Second half: Mass England substitutions: Joe Hart, Jamie Carragher, Joe Cole, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Steven Gerrard on, David James, Glen Johnson, Tom Huddlestone, Theo Walcott and Darren Bent off.  46 min: I think England are lining up for the second half with Aaron Lennon on the right wing, Shaun Wright-Phillips on the left and Joe Cole playing in behind Wayne Rooney. Gerrard&apos;s slotted in to the centre of midfield in place of Huddlestone and Joe Hart - unsurprisingly - has gone in goal.  48 min: Steven Gerrard brings a smart save out of Kawashima with a long-range rasper.  49 min: &quot;Will an unfavourable result against plucky little Japan shock people into realising they&apos;ve all been duped by all those &apos;Maybe, just maybe&apos; adverts?&quot; asks Taylor Hanton, before answering his own question. &quot;Maybe, just maybe. But probably not.&quot;  50 min: Japan win a free-kick just inside the England half, for some misdemeanaour on the part of Frank Lampard.  51 min: Keisukle Honda brings an excellent fingertip save out of Joe Hart with a fizzing drive from distance, which the goalkeeper is forced to tip over the crossbar. The goalkeeper gets no credit for his excellent save, as the referee signals for a goal-kick. Don&apos;t worry, Joe. I saw it, even if Fabio Capello and the ref didn&apos;t.  53 min: England corner, which Steven Gerrard whips in to the near post. Joe Cole tries to get the flick on, but is outmuscled by two defenders.  55 min: Frank Lampard wins a free-kick for England on the edge of the penalty area on the left-hand side. He takes it himself and shoots the ball into the wall, where Honda - he has a great engine - blocks it with a raised arm. That&apos;s a penalty for England.  55 min: LAMPARD MISSES FROM THE SPOT! For the second time in a row, Lampard misses from 12 yards. He tried to place the ball in the bottom left-hand corner, but Japan goalkeeper Kawashima guessed correctly and saved well. I suppose if Lampard wanted to put a positive spin on things, he could argue that it&apos;s an improvement on his recent FA Cup final effort against Portsmouth, which he put wide.  59 min: &quot;The John Barnes advert was bad, yes, but what about the utterly surreal Ladbrokes ad with Ian Wright-Wright-Wright and Chris Kamara cavorting around in what appears to be make-up copied from A Clockwork Orange?&quot; asks Rachel Clifton. &quot;I&apos;m still reeling.&quot; I missed that one, Rachel, I&apos;m pleased to say.  60 min: Steven Gerrard sends Wayne Rooney on his way with a well-timed defence-splitting through-ball. The linesman flags, incorrectly, for offside.  61 min: There&apos;s a bit of a lull, after an entertaining screaming match between the two managers on the touchline. Fabio Capello took exception to one of the Japan players going down as if he&apos;d just been shot after getting a bit of a hand-off in the face from Jamie Carragher.  64 min: Wayne Rooney has a pop from 25 yards, the ball bounces in front of Kawashima in the Japan goal, but he saves well.  65 min: There&apos;s a pause while John Terry receives treatment after picking up a knock. &quot;He&apos;s not a man who goes down easily,&quot; says ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley, who clearly doesn&apos;t read the tabloids.  66 min: Japan substitute striker Morimoto, who has just replaced Okazaki, brings a marvellous save out of Joe Hart after more slapstick defending. England failed to clear a ball that dropped into their penalty area, allowing Moramoto all the time and space he needed to control the ball, turn and shoot from 15 yards. Hart&apos;s reflex save was excellent.  68 min: More great goalkeeping, this time from Kawashima. Wayne Rooney looked to have levelled the score with a speculative curler from distance that was heading straight for the top right-hand corner until the Japan keeper clawed it away with the fingertips of his right hand.  69 min: Japan have just brought on another substitute - Matsui - who I had down as part of their original starting line-up. My preperation for this match was shabby, to say the least, even by my own low standards. Again, my apologies.  GOAL! England 1-1 Japan (Tanaka og 71)  Tulio Tanaka scores his second of the match - steering a Joe Cole cross from the right past his own goalkeeper with an unstoppable diving header. That&apos;s two belters he&apos;s scored now.  76 min: Apologies for the delay in bringing you news of that goal - I&apos;d typed a large tract of flowery, descriptive text which vanished into thin air when I tried to launch it on the interweb.  76 min: Aaron Lennon makes way for Emile Heskey and England switch to 4-4-2, with Joe Cole moving across to the right. Due in no small part to Cole&apos;s contribution since coming on at half-time, England have been vastly improved in this second half. I think leaving him at home would be a huge mistake on the part of Fabio Capello.  80 min: Emile Heskey wins a free-kick wide on the right, deep in Japan territory. Gerrard curls the ball across the face of the penalty area and Japan clear.  81 min: Good play by England, who go close to taking the lead. Gerrard cut in along the edge of the penalty area, gave to Rooney and darted forward to pick up the return pass. He attempt to bring the ball around Kawashima, but the goalkeeper got down to smother it at his feet.  GOAL! England 2-1 Japan (Nakazawa og 82) That&apos;s just comical - I thought Tanaka had got his hat-trick there, but it was his fellow centre-half Yuji Nakazawa who sliced the cross past the unfortunate Kawashima this time, with Ashley Cole providing the assist.  86 min: There&apos;s a thunder storm raging over the stadium in Graz at the moment and the rain is bucketing down. The pitch is getting very slippery as a result and assorted players are having difficulty staying on their feet.  88 min: Japan win a free-kick about 35 yards from the England goal, which Honda sends motoring over the bar.  89 min: That&apos;s a sensational miss from Emile Heskey, who somehow contrives not to score from two yards out, with the ball hovering in front of his face practically imploring him to head it past Kawashima. The Aston Villa striker closed his eyes, swung his head and managed to make no contact with it whatsoever. I am honestly not exaggerating when I say that I would have been gutted not to have scored having been presented with an opportunity that gilt-edged. Heskey was unmarked, the goal was gaping and the cross was inch-perfect from Steven Gerrard.  90+1 min: Seriously. What is Emile Heskey for?  90+3 min: Steven Gerrard seems to have picked up a knock and is hobbling around gingerly. As England have used all 45 of their substitutes, he can&apos;t be replaced, but it doesn&apos;t matter because the referee is going to blow for full time any second now.  Full time: Peep! Peep! Peep! It&apos;s all over. Despite not scoring any goals, England pull off a fairly unconvincing 2-1 win over game Japan. Their first half performance was dreadful, but they made some effort to redeem themselves in the second period. Eye-catchers? Wayne Rooney, Joe Cole and Joe Hart, who looks very assured in goal despite his international inexperience and should - in my humble opinion - be England&apos;s No1.

Wen made the comments at a trilateral regional summit meeting with Japanese and South Korean leaders that was meant to focus on economic issues. Inevitably, the controversy over the sinking of the South&apos;s warship last month took centre stage at the talks. Seoul blames Pyongyang for destroying its warship, the Cheonan, with a torpedo but the North has denied any involvement. South Korea has said it intends to take the issue to the United Nations security council. It is pushing Beijing for support because, as North Korea&apos;s main ally and a permanent member of the council, China could use its veto to block a resolution or a statement. China says it is still assessing the evidence on the March sinking, in which 46 sailors died. Addressing a closing news conference at the summit in Seogwipo, South Korea, Wen said: &quot;The urgent task for the moment is to properly handle the serious impact caused by the Cheonan incident, gradually defuse tensions over it and avoid possible conflicts.&quot; Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said he doubted whether the security council would take up the issue. &quot;Wen Jiabao&apos;s speech today gave no practical measures in dealing with the Cheonan incident,&quot; he said. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, said the three leaders would continue discussing the issue. According to an aide, Lee told his guests: &quot;We are not afraid of war, but nor do we want one. We have no intention of fighting a war.&quot; At a separate briefing, Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, said: &quot;China was cautious because it does not want North Korea to lash out.&quot; Wen has flown to Tokyo for a three-day visit, where officials are expected to press him again to support action over the Cheonan. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, north-east Asia project director for the International Crisis Group, said that even if China backed security council action, it might not prove effective. &quot;We have seen plenty of cases in which external pressure has not worked on North Korea,&quot; she said. Tens of thousands of people packed Pyongyang&apos;s main square today for a rally condemning Seoul and Washington. They clapped and pumped their fists in the air. Associated Press reported that they carried a huge portrait of the country&apos;s leader and shouted anti-South Korean slogans. &quot;Because of the South Korean war-loving, mad puppets and American invaders, the North and South relationship is being driven to a catastrophe,&quot; Choi Yong Rim, secretary of the North Korean Workers party in Pyongyang, told the rally. The North has organised such rallies during previous international disputes. Relations are at a 12-year low on the peninsula, with the South suspending trade and taking other tough measures towards the North after an investigation blamed it for the sinking, and the North retaliating by announcing it would sever all ties. South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported that the military had put off plans to drop propaganda leaflets in the North. It cited an unnamed official and said plans for loudspeaker broadcasts across the border would probably be put on hold too. The South had announced it would resume psychological warfare after a six-year break. It has already begun radio broadcasts and plans to install loudspeakers in the heavily fortified border area, although Pyongyang had warned that it would fire at any such equipment. &quot;Leaflet distribution had been put off due to weather conditions but we have now decided to put it on hold for the time being, considering the political situation,&quot; the official said."}, {"sentences": ["At an April concert in Tokyo, the pop star said she had trouble breathing."], "tags": ["Lady Gaga", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Michael Jackson", "Health & wellbeing"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-02T09:32:30Z", "title": "Lady Gaga tests 'borderline positive' for lupus", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/02/lady-gaga-tested-lupus", "article": "Lady Gaga has &quot;tested borderline positive&quot; for lupus, she revealed this week.

Today&apos;s announcement by Yukio Hatoyama that he will resign after just eight months in the job has some looking back dewy-eyed to the days when their country was led by a man with staying power: Junichiro Koizumi, who lasted five years. Since he retired in 2006, the prime minister&apos;s workplace \u2013 the Kantei \u2013 has been occupied by three Liberal Democratic party [LDP] leaders and Hatoyama, who swept into office last September promising to change the face of the nation&apos;s politics. Plus ca change, and all that. In some ways the upheaval of the past four years is a sign of a political culture in maturation: in harsh economic times, politicians embroiled in money scandals \u2013 as Hatoyama has been \u2013 are finding it harder to mollify voters with a much lower tolerance for sleaze. But the Nagatacho merry-go-round is also a reminder of the poor quality of Japan&apos;s senior politicians, a staggering number of whom are drawn from political clans who regard national leadership as a birthright. Forget the greasy pole of political ascent; Japan has a surfeit of silver spoons. Some analysts have speculated that Hatoyama was simply waiting for the right moment to leave a job he had quickly grown to loathe. He, like his three immediate predecessors Abe, Fukuda and Aso \u2013 hereditary politicians all \u2013 became prime minister almost by default, and relinquished power with all the genuine grief, at least in public, of a student bidding farewell to his supermarket shelf-stacking duties. &quot;Hatoyama is typical of the breed of hereditary politicians who take it for granted that they will become leader,&quot; said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. &quot;Most of them have been indecisive because they never developed the ruthlessness you need to win a power struggle.

But having limped through eight months of vacillation at the hands of a man with high political office in his genes, Japan can rightly regard its new prime minister as a genuine outsider. Naoto Kan, who today replaced Yukio Hatoyama as leader of the ruling Democratic party, graduated from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and cut his political teeth on the great environmental campaigns of the 70s. After three unsuccessful candidacies, he won a place in parliament in 1980, representing a Tokyo seat as a member of the now disbanded United Social Democratic party. Although he lacks Junichiro Koizumi&apos;s striking appearance and, less regrettably, Hatoyama&apos;s taste in gaudy shirts, the 63-year-old Kan has made much of his relatively humble beginnings as \u2013 in his words \u2013 &quot;a salaryman&apos;s son with no special connections&quot;.

Kan is said by colleagues to be the antithesis of Hatoyama. He has earned a reputation as a sharp debater who at times struggles to keep a lid on his temper. That said, a long-standing friend of Kan&apos;s told the Guardian he expected the new PM to allow his pragmatic side to come to the fore as leader. He is a familiar figure to Japanese voters, having twice led the Democrats after years of flirting with several smaller parties. Kan burnished his populist image in 1996 when, as health minister under a Liberal Democratic-led coalition, he exposed bureaucrats who had attempted to cover up the use of HIV-tainted blood products among Japan&apos;s haemophiliacs. He cannot claim to have had a blameless career, however. In 2004, he resigned as Democratic party leader after admitting he had failed to pay state pension premiums, even though voters were being urged to pay into the system.

He immediately promised to &quot;rebuild the country&quot; as it confronts economic stagnation, mounting public debt and regional instability. The leadership election was called after the resignation on Wednesday of Yukio Hatoyama, following his humiliating climbdown over the location of a US airbase and his failure to stamp out sleaze in his own party. Kan, 63, vowed to rebuild Japan&apos;s battered public finances, foster growth and promote regional stability amid growing fears about Chinese military power and tensions on the Korean peninsula. &quot;My task is to rebuild this nation,&quot; said Kan, who was later confirmed as prime minister in the Democrat-dominated lower house. He said he would wait until early next week to name a cabinet. With key upper house elections due next month, Kan implored party members to re-engage with the voters, who elected them by a landslide last August ending more than 50 years of almost uninterrupted rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic party. &quot;What I want to tell voters in the upper house election is that our reforms are becoming more concrete,&quot; he said this evening. &quot;The hopes voters had for the Democratic party will not end up as a mere dream. They will be realised. That is what I want people to know.&quot; Earlier, he told party members that they must unite ahead of the upper house poll. &quot;We will work together as one in the face of the tough political situation ... and fight as a united force. Our first priority is to regain the trust of the people.&quot; Kan offered placatory words to the US, whose intransigence over the relocation of the marine corps&apos; Futenma airbase was a major factor in his predecessor&apos;s downfall. During last year&apos;s election campaign, Hatoyama had promised to move the base off Okinawa but, under pressure from the White House, was forced to accept an original agreement to move it from its city centre location to a more remote site on the island&apos;s north coast. Kan described relations with the US as &quot;vital&quot;, but said he would forge ahead with plans to create an east Asian community modelled on the EU. &quot;While the US-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of our diplomacy, we must also work for the prosperity of the Asian region,&quot; he said. Asia is the region leading global growth ... we can have relations with China, India, Vietnam and other developing countries in which we complement each other in technology and economic structuring.&quot; He repeated Hatoyama&apos;s pledge to cut Japan&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions by 25% over the next 10 years compared to 1990 levels. Analysts said Kan&apos;s immediate focus should be Japan&apos;s stuttering economy. An export-led recovery is under way thanks to demand in China, but Japan is battling deflation and unemployment, and a public debt that, according to some estimates, is around 200% of GDP. As Hatoyama&apos;s finance minister, Kan favoured a weaker yen and pressured Japan&apos;s central bank to take a more active role in fighting deflation. Unlike his predecessor, he has not ruled out what would doubtlessly be an unpopular rise in the consumption [sales] tax to meet ballooning health and welfare costs. &quot;Kan taking office will be good for a weaker yen but he is considering raising the consumption tax, which will have a negative impact on the stock market,&quot; said Yoshikiyo Shimamine, chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. &quot;If he fully advocates fiscal reform over a growth strategy, it would be difficult for the government to secure funds for some of the party&apos;s policies, such as allowances for families with children.&quot; The political turmoil of the last few days has heightened investor anxiety over whether the new government will delay its plans, due out later this month, to rein in public debt and encourage growth. After Hatoyama&apos;s resignation, just eight months after taking office, the Democrats are hoping that Kan&apos;s arrival will herald a period of stability and boost their flagging fortunes in time for the upper house elections. Although the party has a large majority in the more powerful lower house, significant losses next month will force it to court smaller parties if it wants to maintain a majority in the second chamber and push through key legislation. New poll figures suggested the departure of Hatoyama, and his scandal-tainted secretary general, Ichiro Ozawa, had already lifted the party&apos;s fortunes. A poll conducted on Wednesday by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper found that support for the Democrats had increased to 29%, up 9 points from last weekend, but still well down on the 70% they enjoyed last September."}, {"sentences": ["Ohno presented his first solo performance, Jellyfish Dance, in Tokyo in 1949.", "A gifted athlete, he attended Japan Athletic College, in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Dance", "Japan", "Culture", "Music", "Antony and the Johnsons"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-07T17:40:45Z", "title": "Kazuo Ohno obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/07/kazuo-ohno-obituary", "article": "Kazuo Ohno, who has died aged 103, was one of the pioneers of butoh, Japan&apos;s striking contribution to contemporary dance. Butoh, which incorporated elements of existentialism, surrealism, German expressionism, kabuki theatre and eastern spiritual thought, was a reaction in part to the horrors of the second world war. In 1938, Ohno had been drafted into the Japanese army as an intelligence officer. He spent nine years in China and New Guinea, and was held for two years as a prisoner of war. Ohno presented his first solo performance, Jellyfish Dance, in Tokyo in 1949. The performance was thought to be a meditation on the burials at sea that he had observed on board a vessel bearing captives to be repatriated to Japan. The young artist Tatsumi Hijikata was hypnotised by Ohno&apos;s performance that night, and their destinies became entwined. With Ohno as his muse, Hijikata spent the next several years developing Ankoku Butoh-ha \u2013 &quot;the dance of utter darkness&quot;. Using memories of maternal love and the archetype of the divine child as the basis for much of his tender expression, Ohno frequently reduced his audience to tears. Traversing the stage in a hypnotic reverie, he would gesture skyward with his long, curling hands. He was a masterful and exacting improviser, and performed in schools, gardens and hospitals, as well as avant-garde institutions around the world. Ohno was born in Hakodate, Hokkaido; his father was a fisherman and his mother a musician. A gifted athlete, he attended Japan Athletic College, in Tokyo. His life changed in 1926 when, while still a student, he attended a performance by the Argentinian flamenco dancer Antonia Merc\u00e9, known as &quot;the Queen of the Castanets&quot;. Soon after, he began to study with the modern-dance pioneers Baku Ishii and Takaya Eguchi. Upon completion of his studies, Ohno began teaching physical education in a private Christian school in Yokohama. Under the influence of the school&apos;s headteacher, he converted to the Baptist faith in 1930. Its influence would later become apparent in his work. He married Chie Nakagawa in 1933; they would have two sons, Yoshito and Yukito. From 1960 onwards, Hijikata directed a host of solo performances featuring Ohno. The first, Divine, was a tribute to the dying transvestite prostitute from Jean Genet&apos;s subversive 1943 novel Our Lady of the Flowers. From the beginning, Ohno was yin to Hijikata&apos;s yang. While some butoh dancers later came to embody an almost impenetrable stoicism, and others grotesque horror, Ohno expressed something more ethereal, feminine and ecstatic in his reveries. Ohno shed all social constructs in pursuit of essence, believing that &quot;form comes by itself&quot; wherever there is spiritual presence. His revelations of love, pain and ghostly innocence were conveyed with the intuition of a great elder. His first piece to gain international attention was Admiring La Argentina in 1977, directed by Hijikata, in which he paid a dreamlike homage to Merc\u00e9. The production won the Dance Critics&apos; Circle award in Japan. Ohno frequently danced with his son Yoshito, and they performed together in works such as My Mother, Water Lilies and The Dead Sea. As a teenager in 1987, I stumbled across an image of Ohno on a peeling poster in the streets of Angers in north-west France. Captivated by this mysterious portrait, I placed the picture above my bed, where it has remained to this day. As I discovered more about the artist and his work, Ohno&apos;s dance and philosophy became a source of great inspiration to me. In 2009, I featured a portrait of him on the cover of my album The Crying Light. Earlier this year, I visited the Kazuo Ohno dance studio in Yokohama, established some 60 years ago, and collaborated with Yoshito on a performance celebrating his father&apos;s life and work. At Ohno&apos;s bedside, I witnessed a surprising vitality and sensed an almost invisible movement reverberating through his elderly frame. As he lay there, his window open to reveal a cherry blossom tree and a view of Mount Fuji, I realised that Ohno had developed a creative process that was a byproduct of his spiritual practice. Yoshito told me during my visit to the studio that they aspired to total freedom in their dance, and that it emerged from a place of universal love. Kazuo&apos;s last international performance was Requiem for the 20th Century, at the Japan Society in New York in 1999. His 101st birthday was marked by the Japan Society with a butoh festival including performances by Yoshito and an array of younger dancers. Ohno&apos;s appearances grew less frequent as he became increasingly immobile, although he continued to make gestures from his wheelchair, interacting with some invisible spirit with his hands. Once hospitalised, he continued to dance with his eyes and, at the last, with his breath. &quot;Even upon taking leave of my flesh and bones,&quot; he wrote in the book Workshop Words, &quot;I want to continue dancing as a ghost.&quot; He is survived by Yoshito and Yukito, and by his brother and two sisters.

Named best documentary feature at this year&apos;s Oscars, The Cove struggled to find a distributor in Japan following protests by Taiji fishermen, who complained that it contained inaccuracies and that they had been filmed without permission. In an attempt to placate opponents, Unplugged blurred the faces of dolphin hunters in the Japanese version, which is due for domestic release on 26 June. But threats of noisy street protests and unspecified &quot;acts of sabotage&quot; prompted two cinemas in Tokyo and one in Osaka to cancel the screenings. The cinemas had received a flood of angry phone calls from ultra-rightwing activists, who also demonstrated outside Unplugged&apos;s Tokyo office. &quot;The work intentionally distorts Japanese people&apos;s food culture, and showing this will hurt many people&apos;s feelings,&quot; one of the protest groups, the Society to Seek the Restoration of Sovereignty, said. The move could force 23 other cinemas around the country to reconsider plans to show the film this summer. Takeshi Kato of Unplugged said: &quot;The Cove is absolutely not an anti-Japanese film. I believe a deep and constructive debate is needed about the content of the film.&quot; The former dolphin trainer-turned environmental campaigner Ric O&apos;Barry, who appears in The Cove, said the Japanese public should be given the opportunity to judge the film for themselves. &quot;It&apos;s not right that a small minority of extremists could take this right away from them,&quot; said O&apos;Barry, a former trainer for the TV series Flipper. &quot;To do so is a clear threat to democracy.&quot; The prospect that The Cove will be kept off Japanese big screens prompted more than 50 film directors and journalists to condemn rightwing intimidation. &quot;This is a film that has been widely shown abroad. If the work, which is about Japan, cannot be shown in Japan, it only underlines the weakness of the freedom of speech in Japan,&quot; they said in a statement. The film, directed by Louie Psihoyos, follows attempts by conservationists to record the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, a fishing town on Japan&apos;s Pacific coast. The Cove&apos;s makers used hidden cameras to record the cull, which is carried out in a secluded cove that gave the film its name.

He devoted the last decades of his life to numerous disability charities. In the intervening years, he achieved distinction as a civil servant, becoming permanent secretary at the Department of Transport. From 1940 onwards, Baldwin was at work as a decoder in &quot;Rm 25, Mil Sec, Hut 4, Block F&quot; at Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire. To keep abreast of the activities of the European allies, Tokyo&apos;s military attaches were sent to Berlin, Rome, Lisbon, Vienna, Stockholm and, after the occupation of Paris, Vichy. All were equipped with a cipher system, the Japanese Military Attache (JMA) code, thought to be impenetrable. The code was based on a book, or &quot;key&quot;, containing pages of lines and columns of randomly chosen letters, and a second random alphabetical mesh known to cryptographers as a Vigen\u00e8re square. In Hut 4, this was called the &quot;square&quot;. For diplomats using this cipher system to send intelligence back to Tokyo, it was a tedious business. The attache had first to turn his kanji script into alphabetic &quot;words&quot;, then use the keybook to convert the resulting sequence of letters into a second sequence and then, using the &quot;square&quot;, transpose those letters yet again. This put the message in the equivalent of one locked box inside another. A cryptanalyst seeking to read it needed to find the key to both. So secure was the JMA code that the two boxes were inside a third. This was a three-letter sequence, itself encoded, and buried in every Morse transmission. This revealed on which page and line of the key the coded messages began. Attaches were told to start every message at a different place in the key but, happily for Baldwin and his colleagues, Tokyo&apos;s man at Vichy was lazy. He inserted the same short sequence of letters in the same place in his messages for several months. This repetition, once found by the cryptanalysts, gave them an opening. Using a mix of logic and imagination, they began to break open the attaches&apos; code. Further progress was made in 1943, when Baldwin had the idea that all messages might include a second indicator telling where in the key they ended. Baldwin later said that the JMA team at Bletchley &quot;provided unbroken access&quot; to the code &quot;through the war years until the exit of the attaches as the fall of Hitler became imminent&quot;. Baldwin, whose father worked for Sun Alliance, was born in London and brought up in Beckenham, Kent. His family were dedicated Christians and Baldwin was a churchgoer all his life. He attended Clare House school, in Beckenham, and the City of London school, and took a first in classics from Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He moved to Whitehall and the Treasury and, from 1966 to 1967, was principal private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, James Callaghan, during Harold Wilson&apos;s administration. His final post was as permanent secretary in the Department of Transport from 1976 to 1982. There he detached transport from the prime minister Ted Heath&apos;s monster Department of the Environment and, under the transport secretary William Rodgers, produced the bus-friendly 1977 white paper. A man of modesty and charm, Baldwin had a rare flair for remembering faces, names and personal details; his mind was analytical and his instincts were collegiate. Preparing a white paper, he experimented with brainstorming sessions, where ministers found themselves debating policy choices with officials, scientists and academics. Faced with the consequences of the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, he redirected his department&apos;s energies towards the privatisation of nationalised industries. For all this he was made KCB in 1977. He threw himself into the cause of making public transport accessible to disabled people. When the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) was set up, he was its first chair. He later chaired a range of other charities devoted to disabled drivers, air ambulances and dogs for the deaf. It was said of him that, if he had a failing, it was his inability, when asked to help a faltering charity, to say no. At DPTAC, his achievement was to turn a vociferous lobby for disabled travellers into their official voice, known for its quiet reason and practical action. Dial-a-ride minibuses in rural districts, London&apos;s wheelchair-accessible black cabs, kneeling buses and spacious lavatories on trains are all aspects of the revolution ushered in by the 1985 Transport Act and monitored by DPTAC. In 1951, Baldwin married Margaret Moar. She and two sons survive him. \u2022 Peter Robert Baldwin, civil servant, born 10 November 1922; died 9 May 2010"}, {"sentences": ["Elsewhere, two very different architectural studios \u2013 one from Tokyo, the other from Stavanger in Norway \u2013 show how computer-aided design and construction can be used to craft new forms of building, combining the most sophisticated man-made and the rawest natural materials."], "tags": ["V&A", "Exhibitions", "Installation", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Museums", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-09T20:30:59Z", "title": "1:1 with the V&A's Small Spaces", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/09/architects-build-small-spaces-victoria-albert", "article": "Finding a fairytale Japanese teahouse sprouting from wooden stilts in a corridor of the Victoria and Albert museum is an unexpected yet curiously apposite experience. Unexpected, because this bewitching structure is one of seven brand-new, imaginative and full-scale buildings installed through the museum&apos;s galleries this week; and apposite because this glorious Victorian pantechnicon is so jammed with curiosities that Terunobu Fujimori&apos;s Beetle&apos;s House looks almost part of the furniture. It&apos;s not immediately obvious, but there is a powerful thread animating and holding together these seven buildings, commissioned by the V&amp;A&apos;s curator of designs, Abraham Thomas. The thread is made of what I&apos;d call resistance \u2013 architectural resistance to the ever-growing world of buildings that look as\u00a0if they have been designed by computers and built by robots. Like Fujimori&apos;s teahouse, each building has been designed both as an escape from the world of one-dimensional, globalised architecture, and as a means of expressing what can be done with a paucity of materials and a wealth of imagination. These are not mere installations but solid buildings (you can walk into and through them), placed within the museum in a way that enhances their architectural host and its kaleidoscopic collections. From the top of a timber book tower, for example, named The Ark and designed by Rintala Eggertsson Architects (a Finnish-Icelandic team based in Oslo), you look across a wall of books and the frame of the tower itself into the hushed reading room of the National Art Library. Even better is a plaster cast of an ad-hoc living space in Mumbai, squeezed between a warehouse and the architects&apos; office (Studio Mumbai). Walk in, look out through the chutes and slits that pass for windows, and a cast of Michelangelo&apos;s David stares you in the face. It&apos;s an odd conjunction, and yet this beautifully cast house, with its shadowy, shoulder-high alleys, narrow stairs, shrine for contemplation, sleeping platforms and internal courtyard wrapped around a plaster-cast tree, is at home amid the V&amp;A&apos;s haunting Victorian reproductions of Renaissance marvels. No architect had a hand in the original Mumbai building, and yet an empathetic local firm has been inspired by its improvised architecture. And there is much to be learned from it: the way its narrow, shady corridors open on to a courtyard where the dazzling Mumbai sunshine is cooled by the canopy of a tree. While poor in terms of electrical and mechanical services, a house like\u00a0this has more soul and beauty \u2013 accidental as well as deliberate \u2013 than almost any new home in a modern British cul-de-sac. Sadly, the original Mumbai house has been demolished, but its genial spirit now lives on alongside Michelangelo&apos;s David. Bijoy Jain, who founded Studio Mumbai in 1995 after studying in St Louis, Missouri and working in Los Angeles, has said he is confounded by the mysteries of modern India. He is fighting his own architectural resistance movement against an India in which, as he says, local people\u00a0are trained to speak in faux-British accents in call centres, while highly trained structural engineers email drawings to overseas contractors to realise expensive buildings (some of them designed by British architects) on the cheap. He designs modern Indian buildings. Like all seven architects contributing to this show, he believes in working with his hands as well as his mind and eyes. Elsewhere, two very different architectural studios \u2013 one from Tokyo, the other from Stavanger in Norway \u2013 show how computer-aided design and construction can be used to craft new forms of building, combining the most sophisticated man-made and the rawest natural materials. Sou Fujimoto&apos;s Inside/Outside Tree, growing from a landing outside the museum&apos;s architecture gallery, is a transparent shelter built entirely of sheets of acrylic polygons, held together by white plastic cable ties. Designed with the help of a computer, the structure is based on that of a stylised tree cut from an imaginary cube. If this sounds a little arcane, the result is enjoyably ethereal \u2013 especially when the afternoon sun floods through the high windows behind and sets the structure aglow. Out in the museum&apos;s John Madejski Garden, Helen &amp; Hard Architects (based in Stavanger) have created a building named Ratatosk, after Ratatoskr, a mythological Nordic squirrel. This is made from ash trees that have been split apart and then milled by a computer-driven machine. This curious forest building is currently an empty shelter, but it would make another fine teahouse. Small Spaces is a modest but inventive exhibition with a powerful message about the importance of nurturing local architecture, whether working with traditional materials or the very latest technologies. Architecture should be led by imagination and skill rather than by slick imagery and marketing. Clearly, those of us who believe this have a long fight on our collective hands, but in the design and making of the V&amp;A&apos;s seven small buildings, we have at least the beginnings of the necessary ammunition. When this show closes at the end of the summer, I hope the museum keeps these buildings in its capacious fold. The curators haven&apos;t yet made up their minds. But even when they become historic curiosities, these buildings will have something worthwhile to tell us."}, {"sentences": ["Short for &quot;kigurumi&quot; or &quot;costumed animal character&quot;, these Japanese dress-up suits are regularly spotted on teens around Tokyo and are now available in the UK, from kigu.co.uk (from \u00a334.99), or \u00a350 for a Care Bear version on asos.com."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Festivals", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-13T19:00:38Z", "title": "How to dress as a kangaroo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/13/dress-as-kangaroo-animal-costumes", "article": "Meet the Kigu.

Here&apos;s an item from the Telegraph:  In a letter to George Osborne, the outspoken Mayor has urged the Chancellor to commit in the emergency budget on June 22 to the principle of Tax Increment Financing to stimulate investment. Such financing allows local authorities to fund projects through higher future business rates. Mr Johnson said using TIF techniques would &quot;have the potential to help regenerate Battersea Power Station&quot; and its surroundings, creating 20,000 to 25,000 jobs and develop at least 16,000 new homes. Calling for greater fiscal freedom, the Mayor said that London receives 95% of its current income from central government whereas in New York and Tokyo the figure is less than 10pc. &quot;The case for the capital to have greater fiscal independence...should now be investigated thoroughly,&quot; Mr Johnson said. &quot;Fiscal devolution would create a stronger link between taxation and democratic representation, enable greater scrutiny, and would enable London to pay more of its own way in an era of financial constraint.&quot;  The context for this is not only the Con-Lib spending cuts and the coming emergency budget but a London Assembly plenary on Wednesday at which Mayor Johnson&apos;s economic development director Anthony Browne and (according to this preview) chief of staff Sir Simon Milton - who many think provides much of what substance there is behind the public relations-dominated front of the Johnson mayoralty - will be asked about possible changes to the powers of the Mayor and the Assembly.  Boris first publicly advocated Tax Increment Financing last November and Transport for London, which he chairs, did so in March, so I doubt the chancellor will be much surprised to have received Boris&apos;s letter. Wednesday&apos;s plenary may also provide some clues about how far and how fast the new government is providing the Mayor with the additional powers in other areas the Conservatives promised in the election run-up, most notably in the vital area of housing.

This has already provoked a sharp response from Ken supporter Lord Toby Harris.

Now, as Japan pushes to overturn the 24-year ban on commercial whaling, the former whaler has come forward with allegations of widespread criminality among the men with whom he spent months in the freezing waters of the Antarctic. Sent every winter to slaughter the mammals for research that Japan says is vital to our understanding of whale populations, the crewmen are instead seizing and selling prized cuts of meat to earn extra cash and, in at least one case, earn many more times their annual salary, says the whaler-turned-whistleblower. He refers to himself only as &quot;Kujira-san&quot; (Mr Whale), a precaution necessitated by a genuine fear for his safety. But the personal risks will be worthwhile, he says, if it means the world learns the truth about the dark side of Japan&apos;s whaling industry. &quot;Even before we arrived in the Antarctic Ocean,&quot; he says of a recent expedition, &quot;the more experienced whalers would talk about taking whale meat home to sell. It was an open secret. Even officials from the Institute of Cetacean Research [a quasi-governmental body that organises Japan&apos;s whaling programme] on the ship knew what was happening, but they turned a blind eye to it.&quot; Kujira, who worked aboard the Nisshin Maru mother ship, saw crew members helping themselves to prime cuts of whale meat and packing them into boxes they would mark with doodles or pseudonyms so they could identify them when the vessel reached port. &quot;They never wrote their real names on the boxes,&quot; he said. Some whalers would take home between five and 10 boxes, he said, while one secured as many as 40 boxes of prime meat that fetches \u00a520,000 (about \u00a3148) a kilo when sold legally. One crew member built a house with the profits from illicitly sold whale meat, he said. &quot;Another used the money he earned to buy a car,&quot; he said. &quot;They were careful to select only the best cuts, like the meat near the tail fin. I never dared challenge them.&quot; Kujira paints an unpleasant picture of life at sea, although he is reluctant to divulge details for fear of revealing his identity. Newcomers are badly treated by more experienced whalers, fuelled by a machismo culture that is disappearing from other parts of the fishing industry. &quot;The treatment of junior crew has improved a lot elsewhere over the last 40 years,&quot; he said. &quot;But the industry seems to be trapped in time.&quot; He contradicted Japan&apos;s claims that the industry, which reportedly required government subsidies of almost $12m in 2008-09, is highly efficient. The fleet would sometimes catch more whales than necessary, he said, strip them of their most expensive parts and throw what was left overboard. &quot;I didn&apos;t think of the embezzlement at first. I just couldn&apos;t stand the waste. A lot of meat was being thrown away because we kept catching whales even after we&apos;d reached our daily quota. I decided I had to tell someone what was happening.&quot; Oddly, perhaps, for someone with his professional background, he sought help from Greenpeace. In 2008, the organisation launched a secret investigation into embezzlement by the crew of the Nisshin Maru, during which two activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, intercepted a box containing 23kg of whale meat \u2013 worth about \u00a5350,000 \u2013 at a warehouse in Japan that they later presented as evidence. After initially agreeing to act on their claims, prosecutors dropped the case and instead, Sato and Suzuki were arrested and charged with theft and trespassing. Last week, prosecutors demanded an 18-month prison sentence for the &quot;Tokyo Two&quot;, who were held without charge for 23 days and interrogated while strapped to chairs without their lawyers present. A ruling is expected in the next few months. Kujira&apos;s allegations come as the International Whaling Commission [IWC] prepares to meet next week in Morocco to discuss a proposal that could end the moratorium on commercial whaling in return for whaling nations agreeing to smaller quotas. In the run up to the meeting, Japan has reverted to its preferred tactic of using aid to sway small islands and even landlocked nations to vote with it in the 88-member body. Under the IWC moratorium, Japan is permitted to catch just under 1,000 whales \u2013 mainly minke \u2013 in the name of scientific research. Meat from the cull is sold on the open market and the profits used to fund future whaling expeditions. Japan denies allegations of vote-buying, but has acknowledged that it invests heavily in the fishing industries of some IWC allies, and pays the expenses of delegates from poorer countries. Kujira says Greenpeace&apos;s investigation has forced whaling crews to change their ways. &quot;I heard from my sources that the theft of whale meat has stopped because of the media attention. But dozens of younger crewmen have left the fleet because they can no longer steal whale meat. They only joined the fleet because they knew they could make lots of money at the end of each trip. It was the only perk of a very tough job. The older whalers are just hanging on for their pensions.&quot; The Institute of Cetacean Research has insisted that crew members take home only small quantities of whale meat as a reward for spending months working in some of the world&apos;s most inhospitable waters. Kujira is trying to generate interest among Japan&apos;s media, which are reluctant to criticise the country&apos;s research culls while it defends itself against mounting international criticism of the annual slaughter. Although he no longer works for the fleet, Kujira adds that he will continue to campaign behind the scenes, at great risk to his own safety, until the Japanese public learn the truth about the industry: &quot;I dread to think what the other whalers would do to me if they knew who I was. They could do anything they wanted to me. I would be living in fear of my life.&quot; A whale tale The International Whaling Commission (IWC) is bitterly divided over Japan&apos;s research whaling programme. The country slaughters about 950 mainly minke whales every year in the name of scientific research, but critics say the culls are commercial whaling in disguise, since the meat is sold on the open market. Under a proposal submitted by IWC chairman Cristian Maquieira, Japan would be permitted to resume commercial whaling for 10 years, but would have to adhere to strict quotas &quot;significantly lower&quot; than current ones. One estimate says the move could spare more than 5,000 whales over the next decade. Two other whaling nations, Iceland and Norway, would also be able to take part in the experiment. The three nations have killed 35,000 whales since the IWC ban went into effect in 1986. They would have to agree to other conditions, such as the presence of observers on ships, DNA registers of slaughtered whales and market sampling to detect illegal whaling. Campaigners fear the proposal could lead to a return to large-scale commercial whaling and say the IWC should be forcing whaling nations to end the culls altogether. There are large numbers of minke whales in the north Atlantic and western north Pacific, but the proposal would also permit limited catches of fin and sei whales, both listed as endangered. The move is under discussion and would require the support by 75% of the IWC&apos;s 88 members to pass. Despite allegations of vote buying, Japan is currently some way short of acquiring the votes it needs."}, {"sentences": ["She had a recurring role as Noriko in a trilogy of Ozu films: Late Spring (1949), Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1954), the first of which was reworked as Late Autumn (1960).", "Of these, it is Tokyo Story \u2013 routinely hailed as one of the best films ever made \u2013 that can never be forgotten once seen, and Setsuko Hara&apos;s exquisite performance is surely a vital part of what makes this film Ozu&apos;s masterpiece.", "On Thursday, the day of this remarkable performer&apos;s 90th birthday, we could do worse than watch Tokyo Story once again."], "tags": ["Film", "Yasujiro Ozu", "Japan", "Culture", "Tokyo Story"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-16T13:49:08Z", "title": "The heart-wrenching performance of Setsuko Hara, Ozu's quiet muse | Peter Bradshaw", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/jun/16/setsuko-hara-birthday-tokyo-story", "article": "This Thursday sees the 90th birthday of one of the greatest stars in cinema history, and yet it will pass off quietly. Such has been her profound reticence that even this very brief blog, noticing the fact, seems impertinent. Setsuko Hara is the actor who was unforgettable in key films by Yasujiro Ozu, as well as work by Mikio Naruse and Akira Kurosawa in a career lasting over 30 years, but foreswore the acting profession in 1963. By this time she had become an icon in Japan, sometimes called the &quot;Eternal Virgin&quot;. Her retirement may have been connected with the death of Ozu, with whom she will forever be associated, but since then she has refused to elaborate or give interviews. In an age when actors solemnly tell newspapers and celeb magazines how very very &quot;private&quot; they are, Hara&apos;s withdrawal from the limelight has been positively Garbo-like. She had a recurring role as Noriko in a trilogy of Ozu films: Late Spring (1949), Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1954), the first of which was reworked as Late Autumn (1960). Of these, it is Tokyo Story \u2013 routinely hailed as one of the best films ever made \u2013 that can never be forgotten once seen, and Setsuko Hara&apos;s exquisite performance is surely a vital part of what makes this film Ozu&apos;s masterpiece. It is about an elderly married couple who make the tough journey to the big city to visit their busy grown-up children, only to find that they have no time for their parents, and the only person who does is their daughter-in-law Noriko, played by Hara. She is the widow of the son who is still listed missing presumed killed in the second world war. This vulnerable old couple are the only link she has to her husband: they are the only people it makes sense for her to love, and she appears to be the only person who loves them. Her desperately polite smile, her dignity and the quiver of heartbreak in her voice are absolutely captivating. I defy anyone to watch this film and not feel simply overwhelmed with a kind of love for Hara \u2013 however absurd that may sound. She plays another widow in Late Autumn, and the sense of loneliness is different: she has a daughter of marriageable age who still lives with her; some old friends of her late husband are trying to matchmake for the daughter, apparently as a pretext for pairing off Hara&apos;s character with one of them.

With his wife, Madeline Gins, he designed houses and public spaces that were supposed to help stop us from ageing. His death, at the age of 73, is a flaw in his philosophy of transhumanism, or\u00a0reversible destiny. &quot;This mortality thing is bad news,&quot; Gins said after he died, adding that she would now increase her efforts to prove that &quot;ageing can be outlawed&quot;.     Shusaku Arakawa     For Arakawa and Gins, the ideal form of a house was one that kept residents in a &quot;perpetually tentative relationship with their surroundings&quot;. The more our homes challenge us, architecturally, the more likely we are to stay young, grappling with their complexities and, in the case of Arakawa and Gins&apos;s flats and houses, their sheer oddity \u2013 even perversity. Their most extreme design, the Bioscleave house (2008), in East Hampton, Long Island, New York, took eight years to build and cost the couple $2m of their own money. Before this colourful and bewildering home was finished, Arakawa and Gins lost the small fortune that they had accumulated since the early 1960s. They had invested money through Bernard Madoff, the American conman they had met at an art exhibition in New York, and the resulting loss led them to close their office in Manhattan. The Bioscleave house boasted at least three dozen shades of\u00a0paint. The\u00a0building features sloping floors in\u00a0the guise of\u00a0cartoon-like sand dunes, windows placed where no window is normally placed, level changes aimed at\u00a0conveying a feeling of being in two places at once, no doors, no privacy, curiously shaped rooms and any number of other surrealist tricks. The house was designed to keep residents and visitors on their toes \u2013 they are hard pushed to even remain vertical. A number of floor-to-ceiling poles were provided, which can be grasped if the inevitable sense of\u00a0disorientation gets a bit too much. These curious devices were intended to stimulate us in ways conventional homes do not. A state of comfort, according to Arakawa and Gins, creates anxiety because, although cosseting, it can only ever be finite \u2013 and thus shortens rather than prolongs life. Arakawa rarely used his first name. He was born in Nagoya, studied maths and medicine at the University of Tokyo and attended Musashino art school in Tokyo, where he made surrealist prints. He set off for New York in 1961 with, he claimed, just $14 and the artist Marcel Duchamp&apos;s phone number in his pockets. He took a course at Brooklyn Museum art school where, in 1962, he met and married Gins, a fellow student. In 1987 they started the Containers of\u00a0Mind Foundation together, which later evolved into the Architectural Body Research Foundation. These were the hard-to-place philosophical stepping-stones of their lifelong attempt to create buildings that would enable us to defy death. They began to paint a series of 83 large paintings on the theme of the mechanism of meaning which were exhibited around the world and, over the years, paid for Arakawa and Gins&apos; architectural experiments. To date, these are a project for a city of reversible destiny on 75 acres of Tokyo wasteland (it never happened); the Bioscleave house; and nine reversible destiny lofts in Mitaka, Tokyo, completed in 2005 at\u00a0a\u00a0total cost of around $6m. The reversible destiny lofts boast colourful rooms in the form of cylinders, cubes and spheres and are known for being interesting and challenging, rather than comfortable, to live in. They are dedicated to the memory of Helen Keller, the American author and political activist who lost her sight and hearing as a child. Keller was a role model for Arakawa and Gins because by relearning how to communicate, she somehow proved that reversible destiny was possible. The pair believed that the ideal residents of their homes should, following the same principle, be blank slates so that their experience of architecture was continually novel. In this way, explained Arakawa, they would forget that they had to die. Arakawa had exhibitions of his work around the world, including at the Angela Flowers Gallery in London, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Galerie Maeght in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also wrote poetry, animated by such thought-provoking sentiments as &quot;when I am away from you, I feel like a\u00a0watermelon seed&quot;, and\u00a0&quot;he is elegant between his toes&quot;. He published several tantalising books with Gins, notably The Mechanism of\u00a0Meaning (1971), Reversible Destiny: We Have Decided Not to Die (1997) and Making Dying Illegal (2006). Gins survives him. \u2022 Shusaku Arakawa, artist and architect, born 6 July 1936; died 18 May 2010"}, {"sentences": ["The Blue Planet Prize, sponsored by the Asahi Glass Foundation, will be presented on 26 October in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Environment", "James Hansen", "Science", "Climate change"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-17T14:42:26Z", "title": "UK government's environment adviser wins major international green award", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/17/bob-watson-wins-blue-planet-prize", "article": "One of the government&apos;s leading science and environment advisers today won a prestigious international green award, the Blue Planet Prize. Professor Bob Watson, science adviser to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, was one of two people chosen for the annual award. This year&apos;s other winner is James Hansen, director of at Nasa&apos;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, an outspoken advocate of global action to tackle climate change. In a written statement, the prize board of directors said Watson won the award principally for his work leading a team of scientists which provided scientific evidence of the ozone hole, leading to an international agreement to halt the problem; and as chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from 1997 to 2002, where he oversaw the third of the massive five-yearly assessment reports of climate science, impacts and solutions. Currently Watson is also vice-chairman of the organisation which last week persuaded more than 80 world governments to vote to set up an equivalent international body the IPCC to tackle the growing destruction of biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. &quot;The amount of contribution he has made to policy-making by national governments and international frameworks \u2013 a necessity and the foundation for the conservation of the global environment \u2013 is tremendous,&quot; added the statement. Caroline Spelman, secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said: &quot;His work on ozone depletion and climate change have helped to bring about major changes in the way we see our impact on the natural world. As Defra&apos;s chief scientific adviser, Bob&apos;s expertise is a real asset and he continues to play an invaluable role by ensuring our environmental policies are based on sound scientific evidence.&quot; Watson said: &quot;I have been fortunate to have worked with many of the world&apos;s best scientists on issues such as stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change, and more recently biodiversity loss and sustainable agriculture. These issues are not only environmental issues, but of importance to poverty alleviation, economic development and human security.&quot; Previous winners include leading campaigners such as Lester Brown, James Lovelock and Amory Lovins, scientists such as the biologist Paul Ehrlich and Lord May, former president of the Royal Socieity, and Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian prime minister and head of the World Commission on Environment and Development, which popularised the idea of sustainable development.

Against the marble- floored, chandelier-lit lobby of Paris&apos; Hotel\u00a0Crillon, his choice of dress \u2013 jeans, trainers and black sweatshirt rolled up to the elbows \u2013 seems even more defiantly un-French. Who needs chic when you&apos;ve got Hollywood? But, comfortingly familiar though the aura is, this is not the Lambert who became a star in Highlander in 1986, all tousled blond mane and piercingly blue eyes. His hair is now sleek, kempt and grey. He peers through spectacles \u2013 his myopia is so severe he often has to act without being able to see very much. If the changes in his appearance are marked, however, they are nothing compared to the revelation that is Lambert&apos;s latest professional move. The man who, for much of the 80s and 90s, was typecast as the hero of futuristic action movies \u2013 and saw his oeuvre increasingly peppered with straight-to-video duds and financial flops \u2013 has been given the kiss of approval by Claire Denis, one of France&apos;s most respected directors. He is no longer Christopher Lambert, star of blockbusters, critical savagings and gloriously bad accents; he is Christophe, scion of French cinema, and the arthouse is his home. &quot;I wanted to do different movies. I wanted to do deeper movies,&quot; the 53-year-old actor says. &quot;More human movies based on human feelings.&quot; In Denis&apos;s latest film, the haunting White Material, Lambert plays a white farmer on an African coffee plantation who, in contrast to his stubbornly oblivious ex-wife (Isabelle Huppert), realises the family must abandon the land before civil war forces them out or kills them. The world may marvel at this combination of actor and director, and no one is more surprised than Lambert himself. &quot;I was very happy because, you know, coming from action thrillers, sci-fi and everything \u2013 in some ways I&apos;m the kind of opposite actor that Claire would choose to be part of her movie,&quot; he says. She has never given him any indication of why she picked him, he says, telling him only that she had been watching him as an actor &quot;for many, many years&quot;. Therein, perhaps, lies the key to this cinematic coup. For while we in English language audiences know Lambert almost entirely as a bargain-bin action name, he more or less deserted that market around five years ago. And while the more unkind among us might suggest it was a move made more out of necessity than free will (films such as Fortress II, Adrenalin: Fear the Rush and three weak Highlander sequels had done little for his reputation), he is adamant it was a decision based purely on a desire to return to a European way of movie-making. &quot;That&apos;s what I needed to go back to \u2013 to do something really together. Not just being part of a factory or part of a machine,&quot; he says. &quot;And that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m not going to do an action movie again, or a thriller again, or a science fiction movie. It&apos;s just I needed as an actor to go back to smaller things, and after 60 or 70 movies at least you have bought yourself the luxury of being able to choose what you wanna do. That&apos;s all.&quot; It didn&apos;t take Lambert long to choose Denis&apos;s script, co-written with last year&apos;s Goncourt prize-winner Marie Ndiaye, a French-Senegalese author whose words conjure up the same sensuality as the director&apos;s images. In White Material, his character, Andr\u00e9, is a counter to the blindness of Huppert&apos;s Maria; Andr\u00e9 is a realist who knows the game is up. In his determination to acquiesce, he is a disorientating blend of heroism and \u2013 in Maria&apos;s eyes \u2013 cowardice. He believes the power of the film lies in its exploration of\u00a0the legacy of colonisation. &quot;For me, they&apos;re sitting on a ticking bomb because you cannot take everything from a country\u00a0without giving something back,&quot; he says. &quot;At some point you&apos;re bound to have a problem.&quot; Lambert&apos;s performance has been praised by the French critics, and marks his greatest level of approval by the Parisian cinematic establishment since the mid-80s, when he starred opposite Catherine Deneuve in Elie Chouraqui&apos;s Paroles et Musique, and\u00a0won a C\u00e9sar for his role in Luc Besson&apos;s Subway. But, given that he all but abandoned the French movie scene for Hollywood, he is aware\u00a0that many of his compatriots regard\u00a0him with a certain snobbisme. Not that he cares. &quot;I&apos;m not in the loop of that type of cinema first of all, of any kind of cinema,&quot; he says. &quot;I was like\u00a0that when I was at theatre school. I wasn&apos;t part of a\u00a0group, I was part of myself and that was a choice.&quot; If he is to be an in-betweener, and never be fully integrated into either Hollywood or French cinema, at least Lambert was used to the life before he even became an actor. He was born in the US, the son of a French diplomat, and raised in Geneva, moving to Paris as a rebellious adolescent. Nowadays he lives &quot;mostly on an airplane&quot;\u00a0and he can&apos;t stay anywhere longer than a few months. He has a &quot;main residence&quot; in Switzerland, a winery in Provence and a 16-year-old daughter \u2013 from his marriage to 1980s screen siren Diane Lane \u2013 in Los Angeles. To complete the exotic blend, for the past three-and-a-half years he has been in a relationship with one of France&apos;s best-loved actors, Sophie Marceau. (She directed and appeared alongside him in the 2007 thriller La Disparue de Deauville, and romance blossomed afterwards.) It is in Europe, then, that he now spends most of his time, and, while English-speaking audiences may reel at his new, quasi-cerebral image, he insists little has changed. &quot;I was always trying, even in pure action movies, to find what was sensitive about the character more than the pure action,&quot; he says. &quot;When I read Highlander, what interested me was the romance, the pain that this guy was carrying, not being able to die and looking around him at all the people he loved going before him.&quot; Ah, Highlander. Twenty-four years after it opened (and a decade after it bid a final farewell with Endgame, which itself came after the execrable Highlander II: The Quickening and the only marginally better Highlander III: The Final Dimension), Lambert is still greeted in the street\u00a0as his character, Connor MacLeod. And, while he has no plans to go back \u2013 &quot;four was enough&quot; \u2013 he says the possibility\u00a0of his\u00a0appearing as a cameo (a &quot;wink to the audience&quot;) in a mooted remake has\u00a0been discussed. Highlander, he says, was &quot;ahead of its time&quot; visually, and is\u00a0surviving by being passed down through\u00a0the generations. Ever loyal to the\u00a0film and its legendary Queen soundtrack, he even went to see We Will Rock You in London last year. Does it irritate him that any interview he does or any conversation he\u00a0has with a fan inevitably comes back to\u00a0a part he first played over two decades ago? Does he feel haunted? &quot;No,&quot; he says,\u00a0firmly. &quot;It&apos;s like, would people like\u00a0Clint Eastwood be upset because they\u00a0talk about Dirty Harry? Or Mel Gibson\u00a0because they talk about Mad Max\u00a0or Harrison Ford because they talk about Indiana Jones? I think in some ways\u00a0it&apos;s\u00a0good to have at least one thing for\u00a0which you could be really immortal, you\u00a0know?&quot; White Material is released on 2 July. Trash trumpers: When action stars go legit  Sylvester Stallone in Cop Land Stallone made his name pounding flesh in Rocky in 1976, and kicking ass in 1982&apos;s First Blood, but he&apos;s always yearned to be something more than a gormless action-jackson. Hence his regular appearances in furrowed-brow dramas such as FIST, and lame comedies such as Stop or My Mom Will Shoot. Cop Land, in which he plays the hearing-impaired sheriff of a small town home to corrupt New York cops, is easily his finest performance. Sadly, he&apos;s unlikely to be remembered for it. Jean Claude Van Damme in JCVD A karate black belt with a sideline in ballet, the &quot;muscles from Brussels&quot; ploughed a single-minded furrow in the 80s and 90s: titles include Bloodsport, Kickboxer and Street Fighter. He tried to raise his game in 1994 with the self-explanatory fantasy Timecop, but finally went all post-modern two years back with JCVD, an alarmingly self-referential film about an action star whose career is in ruins and who tells the audience at length about his drug and relationship problems. Dolph Lundgren in Johnny Mnemonic Lundgren was an &quot;amphibious marine&quot; in the Swedish military; that makes him a million times harder than a cream-puff like Schwarzenegger, and perfect for inheriting all the lumbering thug roles Arnie was too busy to do after T2.

It has inspired popular manga titles and films, and expert reviews of closely guarded recipes adorn countless magazines, books and blogs. Michelin may have declared Tokyo the greatest food city on earth last year, but you won&apos;t find a single \u00e9toile above the entrances to the thousands of restaurants serving Japan&apos;s de facto national dish: ramen. The noodle-broth combination, usually topped with vegetables, a hardboiled egg and chashu pork, originates from China but became a source of sustenance in postwar Japan. These days it is the food of the time-poor office worker, the student who demands satiation for their meagre yen, and, increasingly, for foreign visitors eager to forage deeper into Japan&apos;s culinary treasury \u2013 and all for about 700 yen (\u00a35.20) a bowl. The Japanese archipelago has inspired myriad variations, from the spindly noodles in miso broth in Hokkaido in the north, to a thicker version immersed in a pork-based soup in Kyushu in the south-west. Aficionados insist that as much dedication goes into the perfect bowl of noodles as into a multiple-course kaiseki banquet, yet ramen, unlike its more illustrious counterpart, thrives on its street credibility. Not even the queues that snake their way towards the entrance of Ramen Jiro, a legendary ramen chain, can deter ravenous Tokyoites. In return for their patience, Jiro patrons are rewarded with huge bowls of chewy noodles suspended in fatty broth and adorned with hunks of pork. The only concessions to nutritional balance are the sliced cabbage and bean sprouts. At Jiro&apos;s testosterone-charged counters, the ability to finish a gargantuan serving is as much a test of masculinity as gastronomic endurance. As Ramen Tokyo, an American blogger who has visited 350 ramen shops, warns: &quot;Ramen Jiro is certainly not for those who are health conscious, and those of weaker constitutions can feel a bit queasy after eating there for the first time, especially if they force themselves to finish the whole bowl.&quot; But the sheer number of ramen outlets means there are ample opportunities for those of us without abdomens of iron for induction into the cult of the noodle. According to the most exhaustive guide, Ramen Database, Japan is home to around 20,000 dedicated restaurants, about 5,000 of them in Tokyo. Many of the best are reviewed on English-language blogs maintained by foreigners, such as Ramenate, Ramen Adventures and this online tribute to all things ramen. At the Shin Yokohama Ramen Museum, Chinese and Taiwanese tourists hop between noodle stalls from several Japanese regions, all set in a re-creation of Tokyo in 1958, the year Momofuku Ando invented instant noodles and turned Japan into nation of amateur ramen chefs. Ramen&apos;s growing international appeal lies in its accessibility to the uninitiated. While a visit to an exclusive Japanese restaurant can be a nerve-wracking study in culinary etiquette, the ramen joint is the natural home of a more free-spirited epicurean. The rules are simple: slurp the noodles with gusto, gulp the leftover soup straight from the bowl, wipe your perspiring brow and earn the respect of your fellow converts. Its maverick overtones have secured ramen an important place in Japanese popular culture: it is no accident that the frustrated hero of the popular manga Ramen Discovery Legend escapes the drudgery of his salaryman existence by running a noodle stall by night. The dish looms large in Juzo Itami&apos;s 1985 &quot;noodle-western&quot; Tampopo, and in Ramen Girl, a 2008 film in which Brittany Murphy plays an American stranded in Tokyo who becomes a ramen chef under the tutelage of a strict, but benevolent, master. &quot;Ramen has no past,&quot; says Andy Raskin, the author of The Noodle King and I, in which he describes how Ando, a self-styled philosopher as well as noodle inventor, became his posthumous mentor. &quot;If sushi occupies a position in Japan&apos;s food hierarchy akin to that of haute French in the west, then ramen&apos;s culinary status hovers somewhere around the prestige of a sloppy joe. &quot;Unlike sushi or other traditional foods, there is no manual. So as a chef, you have to find your own way. As a result, there are so many variations and schools of thought. To me, that&apos;s what makes it fun and special.&quot; Ivan Orkin, a New Yorker who runs a successful ramen restaurant in the Tokyo suburbs, agrees he would have struggled to make a living from any other dish. His customers, he says, &quot;are more open to the idea of an American cooking for them because ramen is a maverick cuisine. It&apos;s the only Japanese cuisine that doesn&apos;t have a rulebook. People who are otherwise uptight let their hair down when they eat a bowl of ramen.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["All those car, travel and jewellery companies could no longer justify taking space in a publication that didn&apos;t deal directly with their core constituencies (just because you like reading about sushi, it doesn&apos;t mean you want to drive to Tokyo wearing diamonds)."], "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Anthony Bourdain", "Fergus Henderson"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-18T23:06:06Z", "title": "Food writing moves from kitchen to bookshelf", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/19/anthony-bourdain-food-writing", "article": "It is 10 years since Anthony Bourdain&apos;s Kitchen Confidential rocked into town and gave food writing such a hard slap that it has never quite known which end to stand on ever since. Bourdain&apos;s account of life as a professional chef in New York City made midweek service at Les Halles or the Supper Club sound like going on tour with the Rolling Stones circa 1972. In exquisitely dirty prose he described a life of constant high pressure, meaty sweats, singed fingers and drunken all-night come-downs with his crew of semi desperados. Kitchen Confidential blew the idea that there was anything refined or effete about cooking for a living, and gave its entranced readers the kind of insider information that made them feel as though they had been initiated into the coolest gang on earth. Now, a decade on, Bourdain has published Medium Raw. There have actually been five books in between, but this one is branded as the official follow-up to Kitchen Confidential. There is something identifiably different about it, though. It is not just the tone \u2013 Bourdain is in his 50s now, off drugs and a first-time father, so some of the piratical swagger has been burnt off, although the language remains as rococo as ever. It is more that the landscape into which Bourdain is launching his sequel has changed entirely. Whereas Kitchen Confidential was free to slash and burn its way through literary territory that felt relatively static, even stuck, Medium Raw is obliged to pick its way carefully through a richly variegated and much expanded genre. Food writing has evolved its own elaborate ecosystem, bristling with sub-genres, starting points, cross-currents and trip wires. For Bourdain to repeat his trick of 2000 and storm in, steak knives rattling, would not look so much heroic now as simply ignorant. In Medium Raw, then, Bourdain is obliged to insert himself into a crowded field, carefully feeling out his position and defining himself as much by what he is not as by what he is. He is not, he makes clear, Eric Schlosser or Michael Pollan, two campaigning writers (authors respectively of Fast Food Nation and In Defence of Food) whose recent work he admires but whose handle on the science and politics of agribusiness is a million miles from his own blood-and-guts approach. He is not Marco Pierre White, a man who anticipated his foul-mouthed persona but who nevertheless received Michelin stars that Bourdain could never aspire to (by his own admission, he has never been more than just good enough to work as a line chef in second-tier restaurants). He is not Jamie Oliver, about whose cooking he remains tactfully mute, but whose commitment to doing the &quot;harder thing&quot; he finds admirable. &quot;Most chefs I know, were they where Jamie is on the Success-O-Meter? They&apos;d be holed up at a Four Seasons somewhere, shades drawn, watching four tranny hookers snort cocaine off each other.&quot; But most significant of all is the fact that Bourdain is no longer a professional chef but a professional food writer. Ever since hanging up his whites following the global (he calls it &quot;freaky&quot;) success of Kitchen Confidential, he has made his living outside the bloody chamber that is the restaurant kitchen. Thus Medium Raw&apos;s subject matter is no longer the discipline of twice-daily service (and yes the religious parallels have been noted), but its ersatz reconstructions in the various foodie television shows on which Bourdain is now a regular celebrity participant. His beefs no longer concern light-fingered colleagues \u2013 &quot;don&apos;t touch my dick, don&apos;t touch my knife&quot; \u2013 or his personal hatred of vegetarians, but instead centre on the idiocy of the Food Network or the nullity that is Rachael Ray (a wildly successful middle-of-the-road American TV cook who is mercifully unknown in the UK). Instead of riffing on a lavish, career-hobbling multi-drug habit, Bourdain&apos;s main dilemma now is whether or not he should endorse a rubbish restaurant in return for $40,000 a month. (In the end he decides not to, but not before torturing himself \u2013 and us \u2013 with the fact that the only thing stopping him is a narcissistic desire to believe himself &quot;above all that&quot;). Medium Raw is not so much written in a minor key \u2013 it is as ferociously rude as anything Bourdain has done before \u2013 as written at one remove from the thing that made him who and what he is. As Bourdain admits, by letting the world in on his love affair with cooking, he managed to kill the thing he loved the most. Still, if Bourdain is working out his issues about what it means to be a food writer, plenty of others, Britons as well as Americans, are ready to seize the moment with relish. Indeed, we are currently experiencing a bit of a food writing renaissance, with the genre occupying the kind of sunny uplands that travel writing did 30 years ago. Back in the late 1970s a clutch of young men \u2013 Chatwin, Raban, Theroux \u2013 reanimated the dusty travelogue with high style, strong narrative presence and a box of tricks to match any literary novelist. For the next 15 years travel writing offered a viable freelance career for writers who couldn&apos;t do fiction, weren&apos;t academics, but felt themselves to be something more than journalists. Suddenly everyone was at it. Newly expanded Sunday supplements provided outlets for shorter pieces from intellectuals who, while not primarily travel writers, had something they wanted to say about far away places, much as Julian Barnes or Simon Schama today might turn in an elegant piece about food as a kind of holiday from their usual writing selves. Of course there were plenty of travel writers before Chatwin and his gang pitched up (Thesiger, Stark, Douglas, for starters), just as there were excellent food writers before the current crop. Indeed, postwar Britain was stiff with experts paid to tell other people how and what to eat, the best of whom you can sample in the new Guild of Food Writers anthology, How the British Fell in Love with Food (Simon &amp; Schuster). Marguerite Patten, Robert Carrier, Elizabeths David and Luard, and Jane Grigson all nudged the genre into new and slightly different shapes. David, Luard and Grigson in particular wrote like greedy angels. The late Egon Ronay, meanwhile, bossed Britain&apos;s restaurants into aiming higher than they ever thought possible. Even Constance Spry, who should really have gone to hell for inventing coronation chicken in 1953, was basically a force for good. (In Sue Shephard&apos;s new biography, The Surprising Life of Constance Spry, published by Macmillan, Spry turns out to have been almost as wild as Bourdain, numbering a cross-dressing lesbian among her many adventures.) Still, what all these writers had at the core of their practice was the production of recipes. No matter how sparkily delivered \u2013 and Fanny Cradock could be pretty sparkly \u2013 their books and accompanying television programmes were essentially rebranded home ec lessons. No surprise, then, that when food writing started to take off again in the mid-1990s, it was still predicated on the recipe book, albeit glamorously packaged as the River Caf\u00e9 Cook Book or Nigella&apos;s How to Eat. Since then the realisation has spread that food writing is about much more than recipes. Instead of being simply the fuel we put in our mouths, it is now understood as our culture&apos;s \u2013 all cultures&apos; \u2013 connective tissue. Rolled up in a feast or a snack, a Sunday roast or a piece of sashimi is a story of history, geography, memory and time just waiting to be unpicked. Writers who might once have worried that showing an interest in food suggested they were either effete gourmandisers or vying for Delia&apos;s crown now stake a proud claim for the subject&apos;s centrality. And since food is as universal as breath, it is hardly surprising that it has insinuated itself into every aspect of the literary imagination. These days you will find food wherever you look on the bookshelf \u2013 in memoir, biography, popular science, academic anthropology, post-colonial studies and, of course, in travel writing. Indeed, so varied now are its domains that very often you have to squint to recognise any family resemblance at all. One of the most popular of these new foodie forms is memoir. Mostly written by cookery writers as opposed to professional chefs, food memoirs typically season the story of a fractured childhood with recipes from a much-missed home. So in last year&apos;s Risotto with Nettles (Chatto &amp; Windus) the doyenne of British-Italian food writers, Anna Del Conte, tells of a prosperous middle-class girlhood in Milan blown apart by the second world war. Trips to fancy restaurants are replaced by foraging in the countryside as young Anna learns to eat (and survive) like a peasant. The book is sprinkled, too, with recipes that chart her unbelieving first few years in postwar England, a culture which still thought that olive oil was something you bought from the chemist to treat earache. Equally telling, and part of a further sub-genre of British-Asian food memoir, is Yasmin Alibhai-Brown&apos;s The Settler&apos;s Cookbook (Portobello). Here the political journalist plots the multiple dislocations of her Ugandan-Indian family in the 19th and 20th centuries through the foods they inherited, adapted and chowed down in great greedy gulps. The recipes she includes illustrate what academics call &quot;hybridity&quot; and everyone describes as a glorious mash-up: &quot;roast red spicy spuds&quot;, &quot;carrot halva&quot; and shepherd&apos;s pie with a dash of chilli. Alibhai-Brown has made a point of clinging to her home (wherever that might be) comforts, but for an account of what happens when you attempt to remodel your cultural identity by rejecting its iconic dishes, try Yasmin Hai&apos;s zesty The Making of Mr Hai&apos;s Daughter (Virago). Growing up in 1970s Wembley, Hai and her schoolfriends, the daughters of middle-class British Pakistanis, try to out-English each other by declaring to whoever is listening that they never eat curry at home. Ironically, given that memoir is a form predicated on the value of individual experience, many of these books \u2013 and there are hundreds published annually in the States that never make it over here \u2013 tend over time to take on a generic quality. There&apos;s always a granny in them, one who makes daily trips to the market before bustling home to toil over a dish that had been handed down as a precious secret through the maternal line. But what, say, if you had a gran whose idea of nurture was to rummage in the freezer and cut you off a hank of arctic roll before tottering back to watch the wrestling on the telly? For those kind of food memories, the patron saint remains Nigel Slater. In Toast (HarperPerennial), Slater told of a childhood no less busted than that of Del Conte or Alibhai-Brown, but one that took place in 60s Wolverhampton rather than prewar Europe or 50s Uganda. Instead of home-made pasta and fruit lovingly plucked from the orchard, Slater told gleeful stories of Angel Delight and Rolos bought from the Spa shop. Sensing he was on to something (there are, after all, more of us in Britain whose culinary heritage involves Wall&apos;s neapolitan ice-cream than homemade bread), Slater followed this up with the brilliant Eating for England, which didn&apos;t even pretend to bother with proper chapters, but instead formed itself out of little riffs on those food items which collapse time in a suck, crunch or slurp \u2013 Spangles, KitKats and Heinz tomato ketchup. Given the success of Eating for England, it was perhaps a little cheeky of Simon Majumdar to call his new book Eating for Britain (John Murray). Although the premise is a good one \u2013 a road trip to try out the regional specialities of British food undertaken by a writer who is partly British-Asian, the execution is not quite sharp enough to compete with those recent classics of the genre, British Regional Food (Quadrille) by Mark Hix and The Taste of Britain (HarperCollins) by Laura Mason and Catherine Brown, which really know their onions. And, by the way, if it&apos;s simply recipes using regional ingredients that you&apos;re after, then you still can&apos;t beat Nose to Tail Eating (Bloomsbury) from Bourdain&apos;s culinary hero, Fergus Henderson. (So passionately does Bourdain feel about Henderson that in Medium Raw he solemnly damns to hell the former New York Magazine food critic Gael Greene for once slightly getting the man&apos;s name wrong.) Memory may seem to be a guarantor of memoir&apos;s authenticity, but when pressed into service for a more general kind of food history, it can be become as slippery as an eel. The genre as a whole is shot through with the most damaging nostalgia for a golden age of eating that never quite was. Take Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall&apos;s The Ministry of Food: Thrifty Ways to Feed Your Family Today (Hodder &amp; Stoughton), which is predicated on the idea that the food the nation ate during its finest hour in 1939-45 is somehow the food we should all be eating now. The book is a delight of retro graphic design, culled from a trip to the Imperial War Museum&apos;s archives. But is anyone, really, about to make their family eat Spam fritters? And while &quot;kidneys in red wine&quot; certainly sounds tastier, was this really what plucky British families set themselves up with before a night of fire-watching in Bethnal Green? More palatable, perhaps, is the decision taken by Waverley Books to reprint The Glasgow Cookery Book. The\u00a0book, initially published 100 years ago as the textbook of the Glasgow College of Domestic Science, has been updated here for modern use. As a result, it is still possible to discern (and\u00a0enjoy) its original architecture of pot roast, haggis and dundee cake without feeling as if you are being asked to take part in a slightly out-of-focus historical reconstruction. Still, the cream of the crop of the recent historical reprints remains The Complete Indian Housekeeper and Cook (OUP) by Flora Annie Steel and Grace Gardiner. Originally published in 1888, it aimed to do for memsahibs what Mrs Beeton had done for their stay-at-home sisters. Steel and Gardiner were both married to members of the Indian civil service. The book provides, as do all household management guides, a window not on how women lived, but on how they desperately wished that they did. Steel and Gardiner preach a severe counsel of perfection, one that involves teaching your native cook to rustle up fish quenelles and how to treat the bites of &quot;mad, or even doubtful dogs&quot;. Their mission, to create a domestic space that was forever Wiltshire, throws a bright light on the larger project of which they were part, that of running the British empire. All these new titles may suggest that food writing is flourishing. And so, in one sense, it is. But while new and reissued books seem to be doing well in difficult times, the same is not true of newspaper and periodical food journalism. Amid much lamentation, Cond\u00e9 Nast took the decision to close Gourmet magazine last autumn. A bible of the elite American table for the past 70 years, Gourmet was a place for elegant, informed writing about high-end home and restaurant dining. Its editor, Ruth Reichl, formerly restaurant critic of the New York Times, blamed a steep fall-off in advertising revenue. All those car, travel and jewellery companies could no longer justify taking space in a publication that didn&apos;t deal directly with their core constituencies (just because you like reading about sushi, it doesn&apos;t mean you want to drive to Tokyo wearing diamonds). While Reichl&apos;s analysis is doubtless mostly correct, commentators have been quick to see Gourmet&apos;s demise as part of a broader shift. Expertise and even prestige are increasingly passing from paid journalists to food bloggers, who combine a deep and committed knowledge of their subject with almost non-existent start-up costs. In every city in the world (and, perhaps more pertinently, in the countryside, too) you will find an articulate commentariat able to respond nimbly to both local and international conversations about food production and consumption. Their responses and suggestions range from locating the best coffee beans in Sunderland to the effect of the Icelandic volcano dust on the import of cheap veg from Kenya. There are wit and invention here too. The recent Oscar-winning film Julie and Julia is based on a blog written by New Yorker Julie Powell as she attempted to cook her way through Julia Child&apos;s classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It is hard to see how Powell&apos;s quirky project would ever have found page space in an American food magazine, let alone in the hallowed (and strictly rationed) pages of Gourmet. It is this opening up of what might be called a pro-am space in food writing that likewise accounts for the new buoyancy of smaller and more specialist journals dedicated to the subject. While Gourmet may have floundered under its insatiable need for advertising dollars, periodicals such as Gastronomica in the US and Petits Propos Culinaires (PPC) in the UK are doing wonderfully well. Not exactly academic journals (although Gastronomica is published by the University of California Press), publications such as these provide a space in which original scholarship and elegant writing can meet on equal terms (usually, you have to plump for one or the other). Here you will find an article by a university-based anthropologist trotting companionably alongside a piece by a professional chef, travel journalist or poet. The current issue of PPC, for instance, ponders &quot;Court-bouillon, an early attestation in Anglo-Norman French?&quot; while not being too grand to ask anxiously &quot;Is slurping uncouth?&quot; It is customary to end an article such as this by pointing out that, despite the exponential increase in books, blogs and journals dedicated to food, we now cook less than we ever did. We are, say the doomsayers, a generation of food voyeurs, porno-dependent quick-fixers who snack on crisps (quite possibly of the &quot;artisanal&quot;, hand-crafted kind) while virtual-feasting on pictures of Nigella&apos;s store cupboard. Even Bourdain, who usually says the opposite of everyone else, agrees that it is a crying shame that children aren&apos;t automatically taught to cook in America&apos;s school system. All this is laudable, but slightly misses the point. Food writing is a literary activity, built upon words, sentences and paragraphs rather than flour, butter and eggs. It may refer to the kitchen and the dining room, but it is forged in the library and the study. Someone who reads Hemingway is not assumed to spend their weekends fishing or fighting bulls. A devotion to Agatha Christie does not require you to be either a fiendishly clever murderer or a detective. Even an &quot;armchair traveller&quot; who laps up travelogues by Michael Palin or Jonathan Dimbleby while never stirring further than Southwold is an object of benign contemplation rather than sharp rebuke. And so it must be with food writing. You can appreciate its delicious qualities without feeling the least need to pick up a wooden spoon and have a go yourself. (The recipes included in all those food memoirs are surely for illustrative purposes only.) Food writing is writing full stop, and the best of it does what good writing always does, which is to create an alternative world to the one you currently inhabit. Anything else is gravy.

Some films, however, are so locked into their own little world, so perfectly and unwaveringly delivered, that you&apos;d be hard-pressed to date them with any accuracy. This near-forgotten classic from Shohei Imamura (better known for Pigs &amp; Battleships and the incredible 1979 serial killer film Vengeance Is Mine) slides easily into the latter category. Released to mass bafflement and public indifference in 1968 after an indulgent 18-month production schedule, it looks and feels as if it could have been made any time within the past five decades. Set on a fictional island near Okinawa, the tale concerns a Tokyo engineer sent to oversee the construction of a well for a sugar mill. His encounters with a shamed local family provide a story that touches on both farce and allegory. Imamura&apos;s style owes little to any outside influence: his sequences are punctuated with lengthy diversions into the natural world, as the people bicker with sea slugs, starfish go about their business, a pig is eaten by a shark etc. The soundtrack too takes some equally bold moves, conspiring to create a cryptic and poetic film unlike others before or since.

The following morning, the ominous drone of vuvuzelas echoed down the streets of Tokyo&apos;s notoriously cramped neighbourhoods as recaps filled the airwaves. The Sankei Shimbun newspaper reported that package tours to watch the remainder of the tournament in South Africa were in demand. While the game isn&apos;t viewed with the same tepid interest as it is in the United States, football in Japan, as on the other side of the Pacific, plays second fiddle to baseball. &quot;The international games are interesting, but to be honest I don&apos;t really watch the J-League [Japan&apos;s professional league],&quot; said one fan, dressed in a replica shirt, as he and his girlfriend \u2013 who hesitantly admitted she rarely paid attention to football\u2014went to watch the match against Holland on Saturday night. Despite apathy towards the domestic games, World Cup fever seems to have caught on among some unlikely viewers.

While the cover of the sports magazine Number had declared Japan&apos;s victory over Cameroon a &quot;miracle&quot;, the Dutch were clearly a different proposition. &quot;Miracles can happen once, but not twice,&quot; said Kota Baba, a waiter at a beer hall, even as he stood watching Serbia pull off an unexpected win over Germany the day before Japan were to play Holland. And it was in that spirit that people flooded into bars and pubs on Saturday evening dressed in Japan&apos;s colours \u2013 many wearing the former Japan international Hidetoshi Nakata&apos;s No7 shirt from World Cups past \u2013 to cheer on their cautiously optimistic heroes. Samurai Blue Park, a temporary event space run by the Japan FA, was packed to the gills, having sold out its 1,000 seats for the first time during the tournament. In the end, the result was all too predictable, as Wesley Sneijder secured victory for the Dutch. But Japan&apos;s fans were in a forgiving mood. Many praised the team&apos;s willingness to attack and were upbeat about Japan&apos;s performance against a side that stands 41 places higher in the Fifa rankings. Though the domestic high from the Cameroon match has worn off, many remain hopeful that Japan will revel in their underdog status and advance to the knockout stage with a win over Denmark on Thursday.

Under its &quot;new fleet&quot; strategy BA will bring in newly hired crew at its main Heathrow airport base on lower pay and different conditions to their colleagues. The airline expects to install 1,250 crew in the first wave of the recruitment drive, representing around 10% of the current workforce. &quot;The recruitment of future cabin crew on more competitive terms and conditions is an essential part of reducing our costs,&quot; said BA. The airline explained that crew would earn an average wage in line with BA&apos;s Gatwick flight attendants, who are paid approximately \u00a318,300 per year. At Heathrow, the average is \u00a335,000, according to BA, but Unite argues that crew recruited over the past decade earn less than half that at BA&apos;s main base. Unite also argued that new fleet recruits would earn less once pensions and national insurance contributions are stripped out. &quot;It is common knowledge that our Heathrow cabin crew costs are way out of line with our competitors and much more than our cabin crew costs at Gatwick,&quot; said the airline. &quot;We can no longer afford this cost difference.&quot; Since March, BA cabin crew have staged 22 days of strikes in an increasingly bitter and drawn-out row over pay and working conditions. Unite reacted angrily to the recruitment drive, which could see the fleet flying from the autumn. The union is set to ballot cabin crew for the third time in seven months on Tuesday, over the use of auxiliary crew on flights and the removal of staff travel perks from flight attendants who joined a wave of strikes in March. &quot;The company&apos;s decision to press ahead with recruitment of the new fleet before reaching agreement with the existing workforce is another imposition by BA,&quot; said Unite. Tony Woodley, Unite&apos;s joint general secretary, added: &quot;This will do nothing to persuade cabin crew that BA management is looking to resolve the dispute, and nothing to dissuade our members from voting for further industrial action.&quot; Unite is not opposing the new fleet concept and is barred under European law from launching a pre-emptive strike over the proposal. Although BA has discussed launching new fleet on less lucrative long-haul routes for current crew, such as Nairobi and Denver. However, Unite is concerned that the new fleet will ultimately take over routes that offer the most generous travel allowances, such as London to Tokyo and London to Sydney. The union is also demanding that the new recruits are mixed in with present crew, but BA is adamant that they will fly on separate planes. BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, has warned that some long-haul routes will become unprofitable if BA does not cut cabin crew costs. Unite&apos;s main cabin crew branch, Bassa, warned members in an email that the new fleet strategy would result in routes being gradually transferred away from the existing fleet. &quot;This is why your union has been unable to reach agreement for so long. &quot;What union wants an agreement that essentially is the beginning of the end for all its members?&quot; BA has denied that new fleet is a threat to employees and said crew can retain their current terms and conditions."}, {"sentences": ["Yet Seoul, Tokyo and the west are unhappy at Beijing&apos;s reluctance to ascribe blame for the warship&apos;s sinking, and the vast amounts of energy and aid it still supplies to the North."], "tags": ["North Korea", "China", "South Korea", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-24T23:05:14Z", "title": "Korean war: 'There's still the evidence to show it was American imperialism'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/25/korean-war-american-imperialism-veterans", "article": "     In the West it is the forgotten war, but to Xiang Chaoshan the 60-year-old conflict lives long in the memory \u2013 and its causes are clear. Just a few arches of the bridge that once straddled the Yalu river, linking north-eastern China&apos;s Dandong to neighbouring North Korea, remain as a stark and deliberate reminder of the US raids that enraged him as a young man. &quot;That&apos;s still the evidence to show it was an evil war \u2013 it was imperialism \u2026 if it was not a war of invasion, why did they bomb our bridge?&quot; asked the 78-year-old Chinese veteran. Today marks the 60th anniversary of the Korean war, which began when the North invaded across the 38th parallel. But in Dandong the museum commemorates The War Against American Aggression and To Defend Korea. Across the border in the North it is the War of Fatherland Liberation, which started with earlier incursions by Southern troops, instigated by American imperialists. With cold war tensions running high, escalation was perhaps inevitable once North Korean troops crossed the line in 1950: both the US and China believed they had to check the other&apos;s power. Beijing warned it would intervene if US-dominated UN forces pushed back past the 38th parallel, towards China. &quot;At the time we had a saying about our relations with North Korea: &apos;If the lips are gone the teeth will feel the cold,&apos;&quot; said Wang Xinshan, another veteran of the conflict. By 1952 Chinese soldiers outnumbered their allies by three to one; hundreds of thousands are thought to have died in the conflict. The repercussions are still playing out in the region. The war cemented an alliance that sustains Pyongyang in the face of widespread vilification, and created a powerful emotional bond. &quot;Most Chinese have been immersed in an almost morbidly sentimental connection with the North,&quot; said Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Peking University. For veterans, those links are particularly potent. &quot;I didn&apos;t cry when my parents died but when I think of those who died in the war my tears roll down,&quot; said Xiang, recalling his comrades. When a Southern warship sank this spring, killing 46 sailors, international experts concluded the North torpedoed it. But Xiang backs Pyongyang&apos;s denials. &quot;People shouldn&apos;t bully North Korea any more,&quot; he said. Inside the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea, such perceptions are far sharper. To the outside world, the fact that technically the North and South are still at war \u2013 because no peace treaty followed the armistice \u2013 is a historical curiosity. To the North, it is the principle around which life is organised. &quot;They have structured their huge military and much of the society as a fighting machine determined, someday, to win this war (or at least hold off the South and the Americans),&quot; says Professor Bruce Cumings, whose new book The Korean War: A History is published this month. Go to the Shanghai Expo and the North&apos;s pavilion shows footage of the war. Open a maths book and calculations feature heroic patriots battling American invaders. &quot;The regime pays a great deal of attention to the topic of the Korean war because it justifies its own legitimacy, helps mobilise the masses around the top leader, and provides the pattern for people&apos;s self-sacrificing behaviour in economic life,&quot; said Dr Leonid Petrov, a Korea expert at the University of Sydney. Xiang and other veterans blame the war for the North&apos;s economic struggles, which have left millions reliant on food aid. Yet he acknowledges that its own choices have played a part too. The Chinese government seems baffled by the hermit kingdom&apos;s refusal to adopt their own, prosperous path of economic reform and opening. At Dandong the surviving Friendship Bridge now appears as loaded symbolically as the bombed crossing beside it: on the Chinese side, lights burn bright, but darkness falls abruptly halfway across. Energy is a scarce resource on the far shore. Wang, who returned to the North to visit the graves of dead comrades recently, thought its problems echoed those of China&apos;s past and was troubled by the rigid grip on information and expression. &quot;In China there have been huge changes; you can speak out or even criticise and it won&apos;t be a problem if you are not deliberately destructive. But in North Korea I could sense people were very cautious in words and manner.&quot; Like the veterans, Beijing has become more critical of its ally over the years. It has established an economically valuable relationship with the South, pressed Pyongyang harder in private and publicly attacked its nuclear tests. Yet Seoul, Tokyo and the west are unhappy at Beijing&apos;s reluctance to ascribe blame for the warship&apos;s sinking, and the vast amounts of energy and aid it still supplies to the North. Experts say Beijing is not convinced that pressure can force the North into line and, more importantly, fears the collapse of its neighbour. It dreads instability, an influx of refugees, and \u2013 potentially \u2013 the expansion of US influence to its doorstep. &quot;It&apos;s not nostalgia only,&quot; says Zhu Feng, the international relations expert, that means most Chinese are reluctant to see the end of a state where they shed so much blood."}, {"sentences": ["But this has been fiercely opposed by lawmakers from New York, including the city&apos;s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who warned against &quot;punitive&quot; laws that could put Wall Street at a disadvantage to London, Tokyo and other financial hubs."], "tags": ["Financial crisis", "Barack Obama", "Hedge funds", "Investing", "Banking", "G20", "Private equity"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T16:12:06Z", "title": "US Congress thrashes out financial reform deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/25/us-congress-financial-reform-regulation", "article": "After a marathon 20-hour session of rancorous negotiations, US lawmakers struck a final deal in Congress today on sweeping reforms of financial regulation, including tighter rules on Wall Street derivatives trading and a ban on banks trading with billions of dollars of their own capital. Shortly after 5.30am, a cross-party committee of 43 members of Congress arrived at a compromise combining elements of draft bills passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The agreement is expected to be approved by both chambers, allowing President Barack Obama to sign it into law before a deadline of 4 July. The deal, which ends months of bitter wrangling, includes the so-called Volcker rule, championed by the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, which prohibits banks from gambling with their own money through &quot;proprietary trading&quot;. This measure also restricts banks&apos; investments in risky hedge funds and private equity funds to 3% of their capital. Under the agreement, a new consumer financial protection agency will be established to protect the public from predatory marketing and unfair &quot;small print&quot;. Shareholders will get a British-style vote on senior executives&apos; remuneration. Regulators are also granted authority to seize and wind down troubled banks in a controlled fashion, in a change intended to end any perception that firms can be &quot;too big to fail&quot;. Speaking in Washington before setting out for the G20 summit in Toronto, Obama described the reforms as the &quot;toughest financial regulations since the ones we created in the aftermath of the Great Depression&quot;. He said the deal included 90% of the measures his administration had initially proposed and expressed optimism that the changes would avert future financial crises: &quot;We&apos;ve all seen what happens when there&apos;s inadequate oversight and insufficient transparency on Wall Street.&quot; Among the most contentious parts of the bill are tighter rules on derivatives. A Democratic senator, Blanche Lincoln, had pushed for a sweeping ban on dealing in derivatives by banks backed with federal insurance for customers&apos; deposits. But this has been fiercely opposed by lawmakers from New York, including the city&apos;s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who warned against &quot;punitive&quot; laws that could put Wall Street at a disadvantage to London, Tokyo and other financial hubs. In a compromise, the congressional package allows banks to use some types of derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps, providing deals are on transparent exchanges and are for devices that hedge against risk. But firms would be required to hive off units trading the riskiest types of financial instruments into separately capitalised businesses. Christopher Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the senate finance committee, declared that it was a &quot;tremendous day&quot; that set &quot;clear rules of the road for the financial industry to prevent a repeat of the financial collapse&quot;. But Republican critics predicted that government meddling would have unintended consequences, and the US Chamber of Commerce complained that it would add &quot;new regulatory agencies to an already antiquated system&quot; to expand a &quot;bloated, inefficient bureaucracy&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Shanghai seems to be emulating the consumer sex industry of Tokyo; the hostess bar scene is reminiscent of Japan at the height of its &quot;bubble economy&quot;.", "By one estimate, the average carbon dioxide emissions of its residents have already overtaken those in Tokyo, New York and London."], "tags": ["China", "World news", "Environment", "Society", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T23:02:32Z", "title": "China: The next superconsumer?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/26/shanghai-china-superconsumer-big-business", "article": "The resident of 550 Huaihai Road in Shanghai is a rather unusual migrant. Born in Wisconsin on 9\u00a0March 1959, Barbara Millicent Roberts is the world&apos;s most famous supermodel. She drives a Corvette convertible, owns a dream home with a pool, parties with jocks and adores shopping. In the US,\u00a0she was a\u00a0prom queen and a role model. In\u00a0China, she is emerging as an ambassador for consumer culture. Better known as Barbie, this 30cm-tall icon was first sold in China in the early 1990s, but it was not until 2009 that she was given her own home in the retail heartland of Shanghai. Mattel,\u00a0the world&apos;s biggest toy company, marked her 50th\u00a0birthday by opening the planet&apos;s largest Barbie emporium. Covered in pink plastic, the six-storey doll&apos;s house on Huaihai Road became an instant landmark. Martial arts star Jet Li and the actor Christy Chung were among the celebrities at its launch. This was more than a party; it was the start of a marketing campaign aimed at prolonging and expanding the lifestyle championed by the toy firm. For the Barbie market to continue to grow for another 50 years, the doll would have to\u00a0make it big in China. When I lunch at Barbie&apos;s place, in the fantastically kitsch restaurant with a menu devised by chef David Laris, it doesn&apos;t seem to be hugely popular. Along with Barbie\u2122 burgers with Barbie\u2122 pink sauce, Ken burgers, pinktastic pasta, doll-icious desserts and Barbie\u2122 tini cocktails, the restaurant boasts generous promotional offers: those opting for the special meal receive a boxed set of Barbie plates and cutlery to take away. I ask Liu Yunting, who works for an advertising company, what she plans to do with her new tableware. &quot;I will use it myself,&quot; she says. Isn&apos;t it a little childish? &quot;Not at all. It is cute. This is much better than the stuff for children. We\u00a0know better how to appreciate it.&quot; Liu is a member of the fastest-growing consumer class: single women \u2013 or xiaobailing (white-collar princesses). They have high levels of disposable income and a craving for designer labels. For marketing moguls, they are the future face of consumer power. State\u00a0planners forecast that half the population will be middle class by 2020. Until recently, China was living within the planet&apos;s means. If everyone in the world consumed what the average Mr or Mrs Wang did in 2007, we&apos;d just about stay within the sustainable resources of our planet. Humanity would have a balanced ecological budget. But, understandably, Mr and Mrs Wang wanted to keep up with Mr and Mrs Jones on the other side of the Pacific. That was human nature. It was also bad news for the environment, because if we all ate, shopped and travelled like those average Americans, we&apos;d need 4.5 Earths.     A mall in Xujiahui, Shanghai. Photograph:  /Reuters    In recent years, the planet&apos;s largest corporations have become dependent on the Wangs catching up with the Joneses. The US had shopped until its economy dropped. Sinking in debt, plagued by obesity and increasingly dependent on military might to protect its lifestyle, the world&apos;s superconsumer was groaning with indigestion. Europe was too decrepit and conservative to take up the slack, so global manufacturers, retailers and restaurant chains were desperate to stimulate the Chinese appetite. Shanghai was their beachhead. While information firms and political lobbyists headed to Beijing and manufacturers flocked to Guangzhou, retail giants almost invariably chose Shanghai for their China headquarters and their first showrooms. From Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald&apos;s and Starbucks to Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel, international brands made the city a giant shopping mall. Shanghai became the biggest, richest, most globalised mass of modernity in China, home to the most luxurious boutiques, the tallest buildings, the nation&apos;s first formula one track, the biggest auto companies, the second busiest port in the world and a gathering horde of international salesmen trying to sell the American consumer lifestyle. Chinese consumers have never had more options. America&apos;s Wal-Mart, France&apos;s Carrefour, Britain&apos;s Tesco and Japan&apos;s Ito Yokado are expanding in China faster than in any other country. Each year, they open hundreds of new stores in the expectation that demand will surge as more rural migrants move into cities and work their way into the middle class. Young urbanites are becoming as enthusiastic about french fries, burgers and fried chicken as their counterparts in New York or London. When the first KFC opened near Tiananmen Square in 1987, it was seen as a novel western dining experience; 20 years later, the company has 2,000 outlets in 400 cities, employing 200,000 people, making it easily the biggest restaurant chain in China. In roughly the same period, McDonald&apos;s had grown from one restaurant to 800. Along with the changing diet came a surge in obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Obese children used to be rare in China; now nearly 15% of the population is overweight. Shanghai is often cited as the worst affected city. Barbie\u2122 burgers and the like are part of an increasingly carnivorous diet. To\u00a0feed its growing livestock, China imports huge quantities of soya, much of it from Brazil, which has resulted in accelerated clearance of Amazonian forest and Cerrado savanna. Like many other wealthy cities, the high-protein, high-octane, jet-set lifestyle is being paid for elsewhere. I meet my guide, Emily Zhang Huijia, a connoisseur of consumption, outside number 18 the Bund. Once the China HQ of Standard Chartered Bank, the Bund is now a centre for shopping, eating and clubbing. Emily is its PR manager. A fashionista since her teens, she has worked for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, and says she was brought up on Vogue, Glamour and OK! magazines. By western standards, her childhood was not privileged. In 1985, when she was three, her family got its first colour television. In 1992, around the time the first Barbies went on sale in China, they bought their first air-conditioner; so did everyone in the neighbourhood. The Zhangs had their first fixed phone line installed when Emily was six. By the time she was 16, they were connected to the internet. My family in the UK had a phone three generations before Emily&apos;s, but her parents went online four years earlier than mine. By 2006, the average person in Shanghai owned two mobile phones, 1.7 air-conditioners, 1.7 colour television sets, more than one fridge and spent 14,761 yuan a year (around \u00a31,455), some 70% more than the rest of the country. They use almost twice as much toilet paper as the average in developed nations and have a bigger carbon footprint than people in the UK. The city is consuming beyond the planet&apos;s means, and its appetite is growing by the day. By the time Emily&apos;s generation were earning a salary, they could afford more than the essentials; they could buy style. &quot;I&apos;m a Shanghai girl,&quot; she says. &quot;We don&apos;t earn so much, but we see luxury brands every day. We don&apos;t want to buy anything else.&quot; Most of her friends are in the industry and\u00a0they share information about discounts and sample sales. At her first sale, she blew a third of her salary on Fendi sunglasses. &quot;It is like a fever,&quot; she says. &quot;The price is so low, you cannot refuse.&quot; Like many a proud shopper, Emily lists how much she saved rather than how much she spent. She is wearing a half-price Dior watch reduced by 2,900 yuan (\u00a3286). In her 40 sq m flat near Fuxing Park, she has dozens of other bags, accessories and clothes, including an Armani coat for 999 yuan (\u00a398), discounted from 9,900 (\u00a3976). Compared with friends, she says, she is restrained. In the last three years, Emily&apos;s monthly salary has increased from 3,000 yuan to just under 20,000, putting her firmly in the middle-class bracket. She eats at restaurants at weekends, has a French boyfriend, plays poker every Thursday. Business and pleasure are mixed. Her favourite after-hours hangout, she says, is the building where she works. &quot;Bund 18 has the coolest nightclub in Shanghai, so it&apos;s probably also the coolest in China.&quot; We agree to meet there again at midnight. After dark, the Bund&apos;s spotlit neoclassical pillars and low-rise architecture are reminiscent of London. On the other side of the Huangpu river, however, the futuristic Pudong skyline rises higher than almost anywhere on Earth, including one of the world&apos;s tallest buildings, the 492m bottle opener-shaped Shanghai World Financial Centre. Twenty years ago, most of Pudong was farmland. Today, it pulsates with light and colour. The crowd in the club is made up mostly of expat western men and their Chinese girlfriends. In the cigar lounge, Emily introduces me to a French food and beverage manager, Julian Desmettre, who describes how the nouveau riche from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have made the city their playground: &quot;Shanghai is like Paris during la belle \u00e9poque. This is the city of wealth and style, where people must show their money, where they are judged by how they dress, where they look down on those with less than themselves.&quot; Julian arrived in Shanghai as a student eight years ago with 5,000 yuan in his pocket. Now, he has on his wrist an Omega watch worth six times that amount. &quot;My life here is better than in France. I have a big apartment, a cleaner, a compound with a pool and a gym. It is so comfortable, it is almost too much.&quot; Most revellers in the lounge are European. &quot;Where can I meet Chinese partygoers?&quot; I\u00a0ask Emily, but she is reluctant to recommend anywhere: &quot;There are clubs, but they are the type of place you&apos;d find in a second-tier city. The music and decor are not as good, but Chinese men prefer them because they don&apos;t want to be near foreigners. Chinese women are different. They are\u00a0more open. They go where the quality is.&quot; Wandering around local bars and restaurants, I\u00a0meet bar owners who organise prostitutes for customers and set up trips to karaoke parlours, where hostesses strip off to sing. Shanghai seems to be emulating the consumer sex industry of Tokyo; the hostess bar scene is reminiscent of Japan at the height of its &quot;bubble economy&quot;. The next day, Emily introduces me to Cindy Tai, the head of a marketing agency and former head of EMI Music in China, who helped organise the first Rolling Stones concert in Shanghai. As a child during the Cultural Revolution, Cindy and her academic parents were sent from Shanghai to a farm on the nearby island of Chongming. &quot;We had enough to eat, but nothing to spare. We were very happy if we got a little meat on the table once a week. My\u00a0parents suffered. I vowed that one day I\u00a0would buy them whatever they wanted.&quot; She has achieved that ambition; now, her dream is &quot;to create an organic farm. I&apos;d like to grow fruit, vegetables and rice, raise pigs and chickens. And to have a helicopter, because the traffic is so bad.&quot; But like many affluent consumers around the world, Cindy&apos;s environmentalism seems selective. She has blueberries delivered from an organic farm, baguettes from a French bakery in Xintiandi and olive oil from Italy. She eats out at least once a day, and at one point she and her French husband had four cars: a BMW, an MG and two Mercs. Now they have two; a sign, she says, of their increasing concern for the planet. Later, however, she reveals that her interest has switched to yachts. One is moored near their second home in Cannes. She may yet get another luxury car. Cindy is a member of the Shanghai Porsche club, mainly to\u00a0keep up with her friends, and has been invited to an awards ceremony hosted by Jaguar. I\u00a0shamelessly ask if I can come along. The venue for the Jaguar Gorgeous Award Party is a renovated mansion off Huaihai Road, a few minutes&apos; walk from the Barbie store. In cocktail dresses and designer suits, guests sip wine in the courtyard, where they are treated to a sales pitch for the new 5-litre XKR: &quot;It is a wow car!&quot; gushes a PR lady who introduces herself by her westernised name, Seraph. I am sceptical: &quot;But you can barely move in Shanghai&apos;s traffic. Why would anyone want such a\u00a0huge engine?&quot; &quot;Rich people never take the subway,&quot; Seraph replies. &quot;Even if the traffic is bad, they need a car. Jaguar is nothing but gorgeous and beautiful.&quot; In the five years to 2009, sales of luxury cars in China rose five-fold, de luxe villas seven-fold and luxury goods tripled. This was just the start of a spending splurge: the number of wealthy households is forecast to double again by 2015. Earthwatch Institute estimates that if China&apos;s 1.3 billion people were to consume at the same rate as Americans, global production of steel, paper and cars would have to double, oil output would need to rise by 20m barrels a day and miners would have to dig an extra 5bn tons of coal. If it followed the US appetite, China would chew its way through 80% of current meat production and two-thirds of the global grain harvest. &quot;China is telescoping history,&quot; says Lester Brown, president of Earthwatch. &quot;It forces us to focus on what happens when huge numbers of low-income people rise rapidly in affluence. Chinese consumption shows the need to reconstruct the world economy.&quot; Instead of relying on an ever greater consumption of resources to generate growth, Brown says mankind needs to move to a fairer, more sustainable model. Yet the opposite seems to be happening. Global corporations and the communist government are trying to make China the greatest shopper of them all. In Shanghai, that goal is already being realised. By one estimate, the average carbon dioxide emissions of its residents have already overtaken those in Tokyo, New York and London. If there is a glimmer of environmental hope, it is that even in Shanghai people have not yet fully embraced western levels of throwaway consumption. Many still prefer flasks of hot tea to cans of Coke, and in the supermarkets the average basket of goods is smaller than in the west and profit margins are lower. This thrift is not inspired by environmental concerns, but by a\u00a0traditional desire to live within one&apos;s means. Even so, the rest of the country has some way to go to catch up with Shanghai, which is what the government wants. This will require a great deal more energy and raw materials. To provide everyone with a Shanghai lifestyle, factories will\u00a0need to churn out an extra 159 million refrigerators, 213 million televisions, 233 million computers, 166 million microwave ovens, 260 million air-conditioners and 187 million cars. The retail market, meanwhile, is becoming less diverse the bigger it grows. Paul French, a Shanghai-based marketing consultant, says the problem is that the shopping malls designed to create the image of a good life do not reflect reality for most people: &quot;They are building more and more malls filled with luxury brands. Like the power stations in Soviet-era Russia, they are being built not because of demand but because of prestige. Every official in China wants one to show their city is on the international map.&quot; These emporiums are designed to generate desire, not meet needs. Many are dismissed by locals as gui gouwu zhongxin (ghost malls) because they attract so few customers. Yet in Shanghai they are everywhere. Xujiahui intersection, for example, is ringed by six department stores. Among them is the Orient Shopping Mall, boasting Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics, Rolex watches, Cartier pens and Dior lipstick. Passing through the revolving door one weekday morning, I\u00a0see not a single customer. Not even a window shopper.

His pieces are often grouped as families on shelves or in niches, as in the new ceramics galleries at the V&amp;A, where they talk among themselves and hold converse with the space they&apos;re living in: its past, its associations, the qualities of its light. Sometimes they look like the stacked contents of a cooled kiln, waiting for the selection to reject the misfires; or survivors retrieved from a cargo long sunk on its voyage back from the Far East. De Waal barely mentions his pots in this unique memoir of his family, though. They&apos;re present as an absence, the vocation he evaded for a couple of years while he researched how he came to inherit a collection of 264 netsuke from his great-uncle Iggie. Netsuke seem the opposite of frangible porcelain. They were carved in finegrained wood or ivory to reward touch and endure wear while doing their job, as the toggle on a cord from which a container was slung, most often for medicine or tobacco. A man in traditional Japan tucked the cord behind his obi-sash, and the netsuke prevented it from slipping out. Private satisfaction and public display contended in them, as it does in many small, personal objects. Some were carved by great craftsmen, some by gifted amateurs; all held forever a moment of time \u2013 the twist of a tiger&apos;s shoulders, the twitch of a hare&apos;s head. De Waal&apos;s intent in studying the collection was to use their acquisition by Charles Ephrussi, a cousin of his great-grandfather, to understand the first wave of Japonisme as it surged through Paris in the 1870s. (De Waal has the credentials, years studying Japanese aesthetics.) But that proved too narrow a subject. He came to want to hear the dialogue between all the possessions of Charles, wealthy son of a pan-European Jewish dynasty of grain brokers and bankers who had migrated from Odessa on the Black Sea. He needed to know how Charles had educated himself in art \u2013 Charles first wrote for, then became proprietor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts magazine; how Charles evolved his taste from tourist souvenirs, albeit the grandest ones, to the purchase of lacquer, and bold commissions of his friends, the Impressionists. Charles paid Manet so amply for a painting of a bundle of asparagus that, a week later, Manet delivered an extra canvas with a single stalk, and the note: &quot;This seems to have slipped from the bundle.&quot; Recognise the story? Proust borrowed it. Charles became one of the models for Swann in In Search of Lost Time, although by the year Proust began to write that, Charles had moved on from Japan, his passion for which had been intertwined with his relationship with his netsuke-collecting mistress. They had exhibited their treasures together \u2013 there&apos;s Parisian sexual daring. De Waal moderates the exchanges between art and life (the back of Charles&apos;s top hat, so out of place, in Renoir&apos;s informal canvas, The Boating Party Lunch; the anger of Renoir when Charles bought an auric Moreau painting, which Renoir regarded as a Jewish lapse of taste), and explores as close as he can get to Charles&apos;s apartment, its contents and their meaning. A sure way to retrieve lost time, or at least to feel that retrieval is possible, is to make contact with the dead fingers that left their impressions on what they created, and with the eyes and hands that appreciated that creation. De Waal has a mystical ability to so inhabit the long-gone moment as to seem to suspend inexorable history, personal and impersonal. A lot happens next \u2013 that&apos;s what stories are for \u2013 but none of it seems inevitable. Charles on a whim gave the netsuke, and the vitrine that was their glass carapace, as a wedding present to his cousin Viktor, who married the Baroness Emmy Schey von Koromla in 1899. They were shipped to the marble burg of the Palais Ephrussi in Vienna, and being too intimate for its salons, were stashed in Emmy&apos;s dressing room. She made up stories about the netsuke as her children took them out for play, but otherwise they remained undisturbed for almost 40 years, while the Austro-Hungarian emperor died and his empire evaporated. Viktor and Emmy, confident in assimilation \u2013 his Russianness was vestigial, their Jewishness marginal \u2013 had invested in that empire and lost much of their fortune, but they lived on diminished in the palais. The paintings and miscellanea, no longer supplemented with fresh-bought excitements, barring Viktor&apos;s choice books, solidified into a family heritage. The central passage of this narration is overwhelming. Emmy&apos;s daughter Elisabeth fought her way through university to become a lawyer, then escaped Vienna to study further before a marriage to a Dutch businessman; son Iggie, in pursuit of a minor talent for couture, and a major discovery about his sexuality, slipped away to Paris, then America. They travelled light to their future lives, assured that all the familiar things remained in their remembered places back in the old home, the ivory rats set out in the vitrine; while their parents were immobilised by those same things, withdrawn from the thickening, darkening public world of Austria after Hitler&apos;s rise into what seemed safe domestic space, the silver calm in its room, the rare books wise in their locked case. We all know the dates, and events on those dates, yet De Waal&apos;s description of the Anschluss and after comes as an absolute shock: the palais breached by night, the initial smash and grabs. Then, by many methodical days, the inventories, as the Property Transactions Office sent in its appraisal valuation official to divest Viktor and Emmy of everything from the ownership of the Ephrussi bank to a bundle of umbrellas. Viktor and Emmy left with two suitcases for the limbo of a country estate in a Slovakia that no longer existed, and half their little luggage was confiscated on the way. Emmy committed discreet suicide; Elisabeth, by now a bicycling, observant Christian bringing up her own children in Tunbridge Wells, extricated her father. He arrived with the key to his case of books \u2013 all Aryanised by diktat into Austrian libraries \u2013 on his watchchain, and not much more. And the netsuke? That&apos;s De Waal&apos;s revelation, the &quot;hidden inheritance&quot;. Anna, who for decades was Emmy&apos;s personal maid (no other details specified), was suborned by the Nazi asset strippers to crate up the Ephrussi household goods. Allowed to dwell on in her servant&apos;s chamber, she pilfered the netsuke \u2013 so portable they could be slipped in an apron pocket one at a time \u2013 until she had stolen them all away, and bedded them down in her straw palliasse. Postwar, Elisabeth reached a wrecked Vienna to retrieve any morsels of what had been home, to find the palais had been a Nazi, then a US occupation, office. The Americans reunited her with Anna, who returned all 264 netsuke in an attach\u00e9 case, and dematerialised from the story. Elisabeth, who was De Waal&apos;s grandmother, gave them to Iggie, thereby making up his mind to take up a business appointment in despoiled Japan. Iggie made his life there, installed the netsuke in a wall case in Tokyo, and found his true partner, a young Japanese man who inherited the netsuke at Iggie&apos;s death, and passed them back to De Waal at his own. That had to be told because this story compels telling; but it is such a bald summary of a work that succeeds in several known genres: as family memoir, travel literature (De Waal&apos;s Japan is the nearest thing to being there, and over decades), essays on migration and exile, on cultural misperceptions, and on De Waal&apos;s attempt to define his relationship with his own kaolin creations. His book is also a new genre, unnamed and maybe unnameable. A thing-book, perhaps, or a Wunderkammer \u2013 cabinet of marvels \u2013 except they&apos;re both such German concepts. The netsuke, and other works of art and craft gained and lost along the way, never serve merely as accessories, trophies or substitutes for their owners and looters, but retain their own secret identities, and hold within them, as they always will, the time of their creation; both the moment they show \u2013 that hare with his front feet so briefly lofted off the ground \u2013 and the many, many hours of their manufacture. If you have ever cleared a house after a death you will recognise this feeling, that each handmade thing matters of itself, even when mortality casts it loose sequentially from maker and owners; the sense that responsibility for the present of an object is also a duty to its past, and an obligation to its onward transmission. What happened to the hare with amber eyes, and the carved medlar that almost felt as if it might squish when handled, after their return from Japan? De Waal bought them a secondhand vitrine from the V&amp;A and set it up in his London house, its door unlocked so his own children could play with its contents. &quot;Objects have always been . . . stolen, retrieved and lost. It is how you tell their stories that matters.&quot; He has told their story wonderfully. Oh, and this is a beautiful and unusual book, as a physical object.

He might not be as famous as fellow artists Banksy or Jamie Hewlett but Eine regularly works on big commercial projects, including one recently with designer Anya Hindmarch (of &quot;This Is Not a Plastic Bag&quot; fame) as well as with pop acts such as Duffy and, fittingly, Alphabeat. And with his penchant for bright colours he&apos;s clearly something of a hero in his own home: &quot;Whenever the kids see one of my shutters they shout, &apos;Daddy painted that!&apos;&quot; So, aside from cheering up our city streets, Eine&apos;s alphabet art is a novel way of encouraging his little ones to learn their letters. einesigns.co.uk"}, {"sentences": ["Last year they scrapped the huge laser-beaming satellite set from their Wembley stadium stint and toured an arena show featuring a trio of hydraulic tower blocks; now they&apos;ve recycled them (we hope, for the planet&apos;s sake) into a swarm of flying saucers and a gigantic Tokyo corner office for their current tour."], "tags": ["Glastonbury festival", "Muse", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Glastonbury 2010"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-27T01:05:34Z", "title": "Muse at Glastonbury 2010 | Review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/27/muse-glastonbury-2010-review", "article": "Who: Muse. Where and when: Pyramid stage, 10.20pm Saturday Dress code: Red jeans and T-shirt for Matt Bellamy, white suit and pipe for bassist Chris Wolstenholme. What happened: The chances of anything coming from Teignmouth \u2013 or at least anything of this grandeur and magnitude \u2013 were a million to one, they said. But still, they come: though Muse fail to arrive in the massive inflatable UFO they&apos;ve been promising to sneak past every festival health and safety official since V2008, they still prove themselves a formidable celestial invasion. Expectations are understandably high: Muse have won every best live band award from here to Timbuktu on account of their resplendent space operas, thump-along pop hits and knack for a stadium-sized spectacle. And like the best rock magicians, they never repeat the same trick twice. Last year they scrapped the huge laser-beaming satellite set from their Wembley stadium stint and toured an arena show featuring a trio of hydraulic tower blocks; now they&apos;ve recycled them (we hope, for the planet&apos;s sake) into a swarm of flying saucers and a gigantic Tokyo corner office for their current tour. For some, anything short of the Pyramid stage literally lifting off for Mars will be a disappointment. Instead, the Devon three-piece focus on their music&apos;s sheer rock wallop. The Pyramid stage \u2013 the cultural Canaveral from which Muse launched themselves into the headline hierarchy back in 2004 \u2013 gets as much of Muse 2010 as it can accommodate: steam flumes close Knights of Cydonia, honeycomb screens beam out hi-def visuals and pretty much everything they touch lights up \u2013 Dominic Howard&apos;s drums, Matt Bellamy&apos;s keytar and even the strings of his grand piano. But otherwise Muse&apos;s set is a ballsy, no-frills trawl through 21st-century rock&apos;s most powerful canon. Striding casually onstage with a cheery &quot;hey!&quot; they begin with Uprising \u2013 essentially what the Dr Who theme tune would sound like if Slade had written it in 1973 \u2013 before throwing away their biggest pop hit, Supermassive Black Hole, inside the first 10 minutes. It&apos;s when Bellamy raises his arm and ushers in the molten-rock riff of New Born that the pace is set at volcanic: Hysteria, Stockholm Syndrome and Knights of Cydonia are some of the most melodic metal songs ever written, and when Bellamy indulges his political conspiracy theories \u2013 while playing a double-necked guitar that sounds like an alien ambulance \u2013 on their latest album&apos;s title track The Resistance, paranoia has rarely sounded so powerful. In such company some of the poppier new material \u2013 Undisclosed Desires, Guiding Light \u2013 seem lightweight and insubstantial, and it&apos;s a shame that the Queen-aping epic United States of Eurasia has supplanted the far superior Butterflies &amp; Hurricanes in Muse&apos;s set. But there are few final half hours that can compete with one containing Starlight, Time Is Running Out and Plug in Baby \u2013 arguably the best rock song of the century so far. And if it seems foolhardy, after Gorillaz&apos;s star-studded headline set last night, for Muse to bring on The Edge to play Where the Streets Have No Name to make up for U2 having to pull out of their slot, it actually turned into one of the defining moments of Glastonbury 2010. It could only have felt like more of an event if they&apos;d wheeled Bono out for the chorus. So: little flash, minimal flam but a hefty dose of wham and bam. No one else is this heavy and tuneful, paranoid and confident, controversial and accessible. &quot;That was the best gig of my life,&quot; says one young convert, the first of a lifetime of close Muse encounters. Who&apos;s watching: About 100,000 futuristic-rock fans, some wearing light-up LED T-shirts. High point: Being brave enough to cover Where the Streets Have No Name \u2013 take that Pet Shop Boys!

The Japan Sumo Association (JSA) will meet this weekend to consider action against 15 senior wrestlers \u2014 one-third of the top division \u2014 and a dozen sumo elders, including four JSA board members, over allegations that they bet tens of thousands of dollars on professional baseball matches, a violation of Japan&apos;s strict gambling laws. Local media reports said most faced suspension, but one coach and the wrestler Kotomitsuki could be expelled. The sport&apos;s governing body stopped short of cancelling the next tournament, which begins in Nagoya on 11 July. The national broadcaster, NHK, has threatened to stop its coverage if the event involves any of the wrestlers implicated in illegal betting. Last week, police arrested Mitsutomo Furuichi, a former wrestler, for allegedly demanding that Kotomitsuki pay him more than 100m yen (\u00a3745,000) in return for Furuichi keeping quiet about Kotomitsuki&apos;s gambling habit. Kotomitsuki, a former ozeki, or champion wrestler, told investigators he had handed over 3.5m yen to Furuichi, who reportedly told police he had once been a member of a crime group. More arrests could follow as police widen their investigation into illegal betting and the alleged use of middlemen with ties to organised crime. In all, about 65 wrestlers have admitted gambling on baseball, golf, cards or mahjong. An independent panel had urged sumo elders to cancel next month&apos;s tournament \u2014 one of only six held each year \u2014 if those involved in gambling were not severely punished. Takayasu Okushima, a member of the panel, said: &quot;Unless they take actions like those we have recommended, they won&apos;t be able to win back public trust.&quot; &quot;This is the result of failing to deal with all of the other scandals of the past.&quot; The betting ring is one of several incidents to have damaged sumo&apos;s reputation in recent years. In February, Asashoryu, a former yokozuna (grand champion) considered to be the finest wrestler of his generation, quit after a drunken assault on a man outside a Tokyo nightclub. The Mongolian&apos;s departure came as sumo was attempting to recover from a criminal investigation into the hazing death of a 17-year-old trainee wrestler in 2007. The victim&apos;s coach was sentenced to six years in prison, and three of his stablemates received suspended sentences after being found guilty of administering a beating that later caused his death. Several wrestlers have been expelled from the sport for marijuana abuse in recent years. Sumo&apos;s ties with organised crime, in the form of the yakuza, have come under scrutiny in recent weeks after it emerged that two stable masters had allowed coveted ringside tickets to be passed on to senior members of the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan&apos;s biggest crime syndicate. The crime bosses had reportedly wanted to be visible on TV broadcasts and to boost the morale of fellow gangsters watching the tournament from their prison cells. Takaharu Ando, head of the national police agency, vowed to clean up sumo as it struggles to revive its founding traditions of humility and stoicism. &quot;We have to sweep links with organised crime right out of the sumo world,&quot; he told reporters. The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said the scandal had exposed the &quot;deep-rooted&quot; links between the sport and the yakuza. &quot;Money wagered by sumo wrestlers must not be allowed to end up being used to fund gang activities,&quot; it said in an editorial. &quot;We think the wrestlers involved should be severely punished.&quot; The sport is haemorrhaging sponsors and fans, and has struggled to attract teenage boys, who are deterred by the meagre salaries of lowly ranked wrestlers, reports of widespread bullying and the physical and mental demands of stable life."}, {"sentences": ["How much Gunners-related bed linen was sold in Tokyo is not recorded."], "tags": ["Japan", "World Cup 2010 Group E", "World Cup 2010", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "publicationDate": "2010-06-28T15:30:35Z", "title": "World Cup 2010: Didn't he used to be rubbish?

The stereotype of the people&apos;s reserve does not connect easily with the audaciousness of one of the most colourful maestros in the history of the game. Keisuke Honda has had to quietly absorb more than his fair share of hysteria in his career so far, but it is not pushing it to suggest that Diego Maradona would approve of his array of skills, and the way he is inspiring his nation. Honda scored the winner as Japan overcame Cameroon in their opening game. That was just the warm-up. In the decisive group meeting with Denmark he pulled the strings like a virtuoso, arrowing in a fabulous free-kick and preparing the killer blow with a Cruyff turn and pass of feathered delicacy. Had he been one of the marquee names in South Africa rather than an athlete schooled in the J-League who plays his club football in Russia, his performance would have made banner headlines worldwide. As it was fans back home in Japan, who had watched the game at 3.30am, went berserk. In Osaka, a group ran through the streets and jumped into the Dotonbori river \u2013 a traditional ritual to celebrate sporting success. In Tokyo, Shibuya&apos;s famed main intersection was taken over by a cast of thousands in Blue Samurai shirts, beating drums and chanting. They are understandably overjoyed to see Japan enter the knockout stage for the first time on foreign soil, and if they continue current form against Paraguay an historic last-eight spot is perfectly possible. Back in George, Japan&apos;s World Cup base, their icon was greeted by supporters from the local township who sang his name, and acclaimed by the mayor, who decreed: &quot;Honda, you&apos;re the hero of the nation of South Africa.&quot; With his beach-blond surfer haircut and chiselled looks, Honda has already become the new face of the Japanese game. Word is spreading that they have nurtured a special talent. His ability is not exactly a secret given that he caught the eye and scored one of his trademark free- kicks in the Champions League last season for CSKA Moscow. The Russians are entitled to feel smug that they secured him on a four-year contract months before the World Cup shop window was flung open, and for only \u20ac6m (\u00a34.9m). They bought him from VVV Venlo, an inauspicious first stop in Europe but an invaluable one for Honda. At the age of 22 he found himself at a modest club in a small Dutch town, but it was a place that allowed him to blossom away from pressure. He immediately earned a cult following, was swiftly awarded the captaincy, and was carried shoulder high from the pitch when he guided the team to promotion. They called him &quot;Keizer Keisuke&quot; \u2013 Emperor Keisuke. It is not only his technique that marks him out. He is also blessed with a ferocious work ethic and will to win. That mixture is a feature of Japan&apos;s team, who in World Cup 2010 look so much more advanced than in previous tournaments. Four years ago in Germany, they made little impression and exited without winning a game. The current manager, Takeshi Okada, had intended a more disciplined regime than the liberal approach of Zico in 2006, but a series of awful results in the build-up to the World Cup did not augur well. At the last minute he changed his ideas, and the Japanese players have now found the platform to express their individuality within a hardworking team framework. &quot;We have put in a great deal of effort in training so we are able to move forward very strongly when the ball is passed,&quot; explains the midfielder Yasuhito Endo. Okada has done a sound job, but he will be stepping down after the World Cup irrespective of how far Japan go. &quot;I&apos;ll be a farmer. When it rains, I&apos;ll read a book, and when it&apos;s fine, I&apos;ll work on the farm,&quot; he explained.

Cancer therapy can leave women infertile, but some patients have had ovary transplants afterwards to restore their fertility. The ovary tissue is either collected and frozen before their treatment begins, or is donated by another woman. In a series of animal experiments, researchers found that ovary transplants rejuventated mice and extended their lifespan by more than 40%. In the study, ovaries from young mice were implanted into older mice. Researchers are now asking whether the equivalent operation extends the life of women. Fewer than a dozen babies have been born around the world after their mothers received an ovary transplant. The first was born in London in 2008, to a 39-year-old woman who conceived naturally after receiving an ovary from her twin sister. Doctors at a meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome, where the research was announced, said ovarian transplants might rejuvenate and extend the lifespan of mice by changing levels of hormones in their bodies. &quot;At present, ovarian transplants are performed with the aim of preserving a woman&apos;s fertility after cancer treatment for instance, or of extending her reproductive lifespan,&quot; said Dr Noriko Kagawa at the Kato Ladies Clinic in Tokyo, who was one of the researchers. &quot;However, the completely unexpected extra benefit of fertility-preserving procedures in our mouse studies indicates that there is a possibility that carrying out similar procedures in women could lengthen their lifespans in general.&quot; Dr Kagawa stressed that far more research is needed to investigate whether ovarian transplants extend the lives of women, particularly as none of the women has yet reached old age. Arne Akbar, an expert on the immune system and ageing at University College London, said: &quot;What people in the field of ageing research will want to know is, if this is a real effect, what is the biological mechanism?&quot; In one set of experiments, Kagawa&apos;s team removed both ovaries from mice when they were around 140 days old, and implanted them in six older mice aged around 525 days. Before the operation, the older mice were too old to be fertile. In further experiments, single ovaries from young mice, around 170 days old, were implanted into eight older mice, aged around 540 days old. All of the mice who received transplants became fertile again, but more striking was the effect the operation had on their longevity. Mice that received two ovaries lived for an average of 915 days, while those that had one ovary implanted lived for an average of 877 days. Their average lifespan was expected to be 548 days. After their transplant operations, the aged mice began to behave as though they were much younger. &quot;They showed interest in male mice, mated and some had pups. Normally, old mice stay in the corner of the cage and don&apos;t move much,&quot; Dr Kagawa said."}, {"sentences": ["A Toyota spokeswoman said the company had not decided whether to recall cars in the UK, but Japan&apos;s transport ministry told reporters in Tokyo that Toyota was planning a recall in the US and Europe.", "Shares in Toyota dropped 2.2% in Tokyo trading today."], "tags": ["Toyota", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Japan", "World news", "Lexus"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-02T08:05:35Z", "title": "Toyota to recall 270,000 Lexus cars over stalling engines", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/02/toyota-lexus-recall", "article": "Toyota is recalling up to 270,000 luxury cars worldwide to fix an engine problem that can cause vehicles to stall.

Johnson&apos;s only tax-raising power over Londoners is the London precept, levied on Londoners&apos; council tax, which he has chosen to freeze for two successive years. Prior to the Tories forming a coalition government in May, Johnson had described his freeze on the precept as a sign of &quot;Conservative government in action&quot;. But in an article for the trade journal Public Servant, Browne suggested that Johnson wanted more scope to impose levies. He contrasted the mayor&apos;s existing powers, which allow him to raise just 7% of his own income, with those of the mayors of major cities such as New York and Tokyo, which raise 50% and 80% respectively. Browne laid out the case for greater fiscal powers for the mayoralty and described the devolution for London introduced under Labour in 2000 as &quot;half-baked&quot;. Johnson was in talks with the Conservative party about power-boosting measures prior to the general election. Last month, he published a document suggesting a range of amendments to enhance the devolution deal for London, which made no mention of his desire for greater tax powers. His published proposals, billed as giving the mayoralty more accountability, include bringing the economic London Development Agency (LDA) arm into the Greater London authority, taking control of the Homes and Communities Agency for London, and ending ringfenced grants from government to give him more &quot;financial freedom&quot;. Highlighting the extra powers already requested, Browne wrote: &quot;We have one big ask \u2013 more power over taxation ... we have to go cap in hand to central government, both for money and permission. &quot;There is a fundamental issue here about so called buoyancy \u2013 our revenues don&apos;t increase as the economy grows. &quot;Although we are statutorily responsible for the economic development of London, we get no financial benefit from it. We can&apos;t invest in measures to boost the London economy and reap the rewards of economic growth. &quot;Both the previous and current incumbent believe we need more financial autonomy in London, with the mayor getting greater tax powers. It would require a leap of trust from Whitehall, but we have more than earned it.&quot; Browne was unavailable for further comment, but his suggestion was welcomed by Darren Johnson, a Green London assembly member. He said the mayor should also take back control of the setting of business rates for the capital, adding: &quot;A city like London should be given more power to raise its own funds, rather than going cap in hand to the government all the time. &quot;The mayor and assembly should be given the power to raise a precept on income tax, like the Scottish parliament, rather than relying on a less than fair precept on the council tax.&quot; The Department of Communities and Local Government, which is expected to draw up a green or white paper on the devolution of further powers to London and local government ahead of the localism bill, due in autumn, was unable to provide a comment."}, {"sentences": ["The faces staring out from the prints covering the wall of a tiny museum in Tokyo are uniformly podgy.", "The coach parties of pensioners at the sumo museum in Tokyo&apos;s Ryogoku district linger before the yokozuna (grand champions), laughing as they recognise faces from the past and, perhaps, hoping for happier times for Japan&apos;s de facto national sport.", "Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice and an authority on organised crime in Japan, said the scandal was connected with a fresh crackdown on a notoriously violent faction within the Yamaguchi-gumi that also had strong ties to the sumo world.", "In February, Asashoryu, a former grand champion who had dominated the sport in recent years, was forced to retire after breaking a man&apos;s nose in a drunken brawl outside a Tokyo nightclub."], "tags": ["Japan", "Organised crime", "World news", "Sport", "Sumo wrestling"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-03T23:06:09Z", "title": "Sumo threatened by scandal and crime", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/04/sumo-threatened-by-scandal-and-crime", "article": "The faces staring out from the prints covering the wall of a tiny museum in Tokyo are uniformly podgy.

Possessed of devastating strength and skill, they are also feted for modesty in victory and dignity in defeat. The coach parties of pensioners at the sumo museum in Tokyo&apos;s Ryogoku district linger before the yokozuna (grand champions), laughing as they recognise faces from the past and, perhaps, hoping for happier times for Japan&apos;s de facto national sport. However, the storm clouds are gathering above sumo, a 2,000-year-old sport celebrated in Japanese mythology, watched by warlords and emperors, and steeped in Shinto ritual and pretensions of moral rectitude. The Japan Sumo Association (JSA) is today poised to suspend more than two dozen wrestlers \u2013 about a third of the top division \u2013 and coaches implicated in an illegal gambling ring that has shaken the once unimpeachable sport to its core. The talk is of tens of thousands of dollars in illicit bets, extortion, shady middlemen\u2026 and speculation about sumo&apos;s very future. The JSA is expected to expel Kotomitsuki, an ozeki (champion) who has admitted placing large sums on baseball matches, a violation of Japan&apos;s strict gambling laws. Otake, a former wrestler-turned-sumo stable master, also faces expulsion. According to Japanese media, as many as 65 of 700 wrestlers have admitted betting illegally on baseball, cards, golf and mahjong. In a crisis meeting last week the association stopped short of cancelling this month&apos;s 15-day tournament in Nagoya \u2013 one of only six Grand Sumo contests held each year \u2013 but NHK, the national broadcaster, may refuse to screen the bouts if it decides the governing body has failed take tough enough action. It has received more than 8,000 protests from angry fans, almost two-thirds of whom say the tournament should not go on air for the first time in broadcasting history. Large numbers of tickets remain unsold, and the food producer Nagatanien, the tournament&apos;s biggest corporate supporter, has withdrawn \u00a512m (\u00a390,000) in sponsorship money. Other sponsors are certain to follow. But most damaging of ll is the exposure of sumo&apos;s ties with organised crime, a badly kept secret among insiders and long overlooked by the sumo hierarchy and the sport&apos;s administrators at the education ministry. In the first of what is expected to be a string of arrests over illegal gambling, Mitsutomo Furuichi, a former wrestler and gang member, is suspected of attempting to extort more than \u00a5100m from Kotomitsuki in return for keeping quiet about his gambling habit. Kotomitsuki, the highest ranked Japanese wrestler, admitted paying Furuichi \u00a53.5m out of fear for his safety and that of his family. In May, reports surfaced that coveted ringside tickets usually reserved for fan club members and corporate sponsors had found their way into the hands of senior figures in the Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan&apos;s most powerful crime syndicate. The gang bosses had apparently wanted to appear on television to show solidarity with incarcerated gangsters (yakuza) watching live coverage of the bouts from their cells. Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice and an authority on organised crime in Japan, said the scandal was connected with a fresh crackdown on a notoriously violent faction within the Yamaguchi-gumi that also had strong ties to the sumo world. &quot;The media haven&apos;t suddenly decided to expose the relationship between sumo and the yakuza,&quot; Adelstein said. &quot;The details were leaked to them by the police. &quot;Failed sumo wrestlers often end up as yakuza enforcers. The sumo world and the yakuza world have long been intertwined. Some ex-sumo wrestlers have even become yakuza bosses.&quot; The media have united to condemn the failure of sumo&apos;s guardians to safeguard its morals, and called for a purge of anyone tainted by association with the scandal. &quot;The [JSA&apos;s] leadership is as good as dead,&quot; the Asahi Shimbun said before calling on the body&apos;s entire 120-member board to resign in disgrace. The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan&apos;s biggest-selling newspaper, said the JSA had &quot;forfeited the public&apos;s trust&quot;. The biggest scandal in sumo&apos;s modern history has come at just the wrong time for a sport still reeling from a flurry of incidents that have come close to destroying its reputation. Last December, a coach was sentenced to six years in prison in connection with the death of a 17-year-old trainee from his stable in 2007. The teenager died following an assault by three stable mates, one armed with a baseball bat, after he tried to abscond. His corpse was dotted with cigarette burns. The death prompted calls for the authorities to address widespread bullying in sumo stables, where wrestlers train, eat and sleep together under the tutelage of their masters. Former wrestlers are supposed to imbue their charges with ethical values, as well as teaching them how to wrestle. In February, Asashoryu, a former grand champion who had dominated the sport in recent years, was forced to retire after breaking a man&apos;s nose in a drunken brawl outside a Tokyo nightclub. This came soon after several wrestlers had been expelled for possession of marijuana. But some experts say sumo is being unfairly singled out for misdemeanours that barely raise an eyebrow in other sectors of Japanese society. &quot;It has been open season on sumo for the past three years,&quot; said sumo writer Mark Buckton. &quot;People do hold sumo wrestlers to higher standards of behaviour, but they have to admit that wrestlers are only doing what many other Japanese have been doing for years. Other sportsmen have been found guilty of illegal gambling, but no one said a word.&quot; Sumo&apos;s current woes lie in its failure to adapt to the public and commercial demands of the modern age. After decades of insularity, the sport now attracts a global audience, and its elite ranks are filled with foreign wrestlers who are proving more successful than their Japanese counterparts. Fewer athletic teenagers, particularly those from its traditional heartland in the rural north, feel the lure of sumo, with its spartan stable lifestyle and relatively poor salaries for all but those at the sport&apos;s pinnacle. But Buckton dismissed the idea that the betting scandal was a symptom of a sport in terminable decline: &quot;That&apos;s just not going to happen. Sumo is too much a part of the Japanese national psyche. At the moment, it is struggling to live in the modern world, that&apos;s all.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo!", "Tokyo is our fourth largest city, one of our top cities!"], "tags": ["Social networking", "Sex", "Social trends", "Relationships", "Grindr"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-03T23:07:37Z", "title": "Grindr: a new sexual revolution?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/04/grindr-the-new-sexual-revolution", "article": "Ever heard of Grindr? If you have, I&apos;m going to guess that you are male and gay; or male, technically straight and somewhat curious; or the straight friend of a gay man. If not, allow me to enlighten you. Grindr (pronounced &quot;grinder&quot;) is a free downloadable iPhone app which, it promises, will help you &quot;Find gay, bi, curious guys for free near you!&quot; Grindr harnesses GPS, allowing you to establish who else in your direct vicinity is also using Grindr. It shows you \u2013 on a gridded display \u2013 who these men are and what they look like; it&apos;ll tell you how far away from you (in feet, and even more thrillingly, fractions of feet) they are standing; and it will allow you to &quot;chat&quot; them, if they take your fancy. Although buried deep in the Grindr ethos is the idea that you shouldn&apos;t do in cyberspace what you could be easily be doing in person. Don&apos;t &quot;chat&quot; when you could actually, you know, chat. Grinding is an intoxicating experience. I was first introduced to it on the roof terrace of a bar in east London by my friends J and W. J launched the app on his iPhone and I got palpitations as the grid of portraits (ordered in terms of geographical proximity \u2013 your nearest Grindr user is posted at the top left) instantly unfurled itself across the screen. All these men, effectively coming on to \u2013 well, not me, but still\u2026 It is literally a sexy app and the overflow of that sexual potency, the decadence, sweeps you along on a wave of lust, regardless of who you are and what your gender or sexual orientation might be. I was reminded of the first time I entered words into the search criteria on Google, of the first time I downloaded music from iTunes \u2013 I knew I was engaging with a bit of technology that would alter things on a profound level. I scrolled on and on through the grid of gay offerings, furtively trying to match the pixelated images with the real-life men ranged around me in the bar. &quot;But do you want to know the funny thing?&quot; J said. &quot;The best nights you can have on Grindr are the nights when you stay in.&quot; And he laughed, wickedly. Grindr is reconfiguring the landscape of human relationships. Partly because it&apos;s sex in an app, the sexual equivalent of ordering take-away, or online fashion (my friend Kevin calls it &quot;net-a-port-gay.com&quot;, and he&apos;s so pleased with himself for this he says I can use his real name. Everyone else asked to remain anonymous). Grindr was launched on 25 March 2009; now more than 700,000 (and counting) men in 162 countries around the world are using it to phenomenal effect, if J, W, Kevin and the other gay men I&apos;ve asked are any kind of a guide. &quot;I&apos;ve never, ever had so much sex in my life!&quot; R told me gleefully. &quot;I&apos;ve probably had as much in the past eight months of Grinding as I have over the 20 years since I came out. Maybe more.&quot; It&apos;s only going to get bigger, to facilitate more sex. Two thousand people download it every day, and a BlackBerry-friendly version of the app launched less than a month ago \u2013 a development which could triple Grindr&apos;s reach. But Grindr is more significant even than that suggests. It marks a major evolution in how all of us \u2013 gay, straight, alive \u2013 will meet and interact with each other. Depending on who you talk to, this is either brilliant (liberating, socially enabling \u2013 the end, even, of loneliness and boredom); or a potential disaster (signalling the end of monogamy, facilitating sex addiction). Either way, it matters. Arguably we are living in a post-gay era. The divide between gay and straight worlds diminishes daily. Gay culture and straight culture become increasingly intertwined. For example, Grindr&apos;s biggest boost occurred in June 2009, after gay icon Stephen Fry told the boorishly straight Jeremy Clarkson all about it during an interview on super-hetero TV show Top Gear. So Grindr would matter even if it was not in the process of developing a straight version of its sexy self. But it is. It is likely that the Grindr experience will be open to a straight market by the end of 2010. &quot;Oh, at the very latest,&quot; says Joel Simkhai, the founder of Grindr. He&apos;s a wiry, neatly handsome 33-year-old man with an American accent, a hectic manner and a sharp business edge. I meet him for coffee in a chic hotel in London. This is where he&apos;s basing himself while he checks out Grindr&apos;s flourishing UK market; he usually lives in Los Angeles. &quot;The UK is the second biggest country for Grindr after the US,&quot; he tells me. &quot;London is the third biggest city after New York and LA. You love us.&quot; Simkhai was born in Tel Aviv and he and his parents moved to New York (&quot;State, not the city&quot;) when he was three. He came out in his mid-teens &quot;just as AOL was taking off. I was born \u2013 gay-born \u2013 with online. And that was a huge help to me in terms of meeting people \u2013 people who unfortunately were a ways away in Wyoming or wherever \u2013 but still, I was meeting people who were gay and who weren&apos;t freaks.&quot; But Simkhai says he still felt isolated as a young gay teenager. He found himself asking: &quot;The question. I think every gay man starts asking it, from the moment he realises he&apos;s gay. You are somewhere and it&apos;s: &apos;Who else here, right now, is gay? Who?&apos; You are looking around, you are constantly wondering. Because coming out is a lonely process.&quot; Still? &quot;Yes! Very much so! And every gay man who asks himself that question also thinks: &apos;Wouldn&apos;t it be good if there was some way for me to tell? Some way for me to know?&apos; Every gay man has had the idea for Grindr.&quot; Nearly two decades later, after Simkhai had finished a degree in international relations and economics and worked for some years in finance, Apple launched its second-generation iPhone. &quot;It was almost as if someone was handing Grindr to me on a silver platter. The first iPhone didn&apos;t have GPS, and it only had about eight apps. They were all Apple apps, too \u2013 you couldn&apos;t develop your own. It really wasn&apos;t that great a device. But in the same announcement of the second-generation phone, they said: &apos;This phone will have GPS and now you can create apps!&apos; I was like: &apos;Wait a minute! I know an app I want to do!&apos;&quot;\u00a0 Did he have a complete notion of what he wanted from Grindr? How it would work, what it would look like, what sort of commotion it would create? &quot;Ha! No. My notion was use GPS, see who else is near. Simple as that.&quot; In August 2008, Simkhai contacted Morten Bek Ditlevsen, an app developer based in Denmark. &quot;He had a passion for GPS, just as I did. He&apos;s straight, but he liked the idea; he had a full-time job, but he said: &apos;Yeah, I&apos;ll do this as a hobby.&apos; Didn&apos;t ask for much money.&quot; Simkhai brought another friend, &quot;Scott Lewallen, an expert in branding, marketing and design&quot;, into the fold. Both still work on Grindr. It took Simkhai, Bek Ditlevsen and Lewallen six months and $5,000 to build Grindr. About the name: where did it come from? &quot;Nowhere specific. We liked the word. We liked the notion of a coffee grinder, mixing things together\u2026 And there&apos;s the term &apos;guy finder&apos; in there, too. We wanted something that was masculine but was not about pride flags. Was not about\u2026&quot; A politicised idea of gayness? &quot;Yes! And was fun! And was in a way \u2013 not about being gay. I&apos;m gay; I am a proud gay man. It&apos;s not that we have any issues, right? But Grindr&apos;s not about gay rights, or gay anything. It&apos;s about finding guys. Being among your peers. Socialising. Being part of your community. It&apos;s not about: &apos;We&apos;re here, we&apos;re queer.&apos;&quot; So Grindr launched in spring 2009. For the first few months uptake was steady but modest. Then Stephen Fry showed it to Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear &quot;and 40,000 men had downloaded it within a week. Amazing.&quot; Simkhai talks with great passion about his creation. He builds a beautiful case for Grindr. He trumpets its international, unifying aspect, making it sound like the United Nations of gayness. &quot;Here we are, 8,000 miles from home and we have 50,000 guys here in London. How? What? I haven&apos;t been here for 10 years \u2013 the first thing I did when I landed at Heathrow was launch Grindr! Sydney. Melbourne. Singapore. Tokyo! Tokyo is our fourth largest city, one of our top cities! I&apos;ve never been to Japan! I don&apos;t speak Japanese!&quot; He points out that Grindr is a response to online dating, which causes as many problems as it solves. &quot;With missed connections and back and forth, and: &apos;Oh actually, this week I&apos;m in New York, and you&apos;re in LA\u2026&apos; Online dating is frustrating! It is a lot of work!&quot; Grindr, on the other hand, is immediate. There is no messing about, no toing and froing, no building up your hopes via weeks of emails only to discover on your first physical date that you just don&apos;t fancy whoever in the flesh. You see someone&apos;s picture on Grindr, you meet immediately, you establish whether or not you&apos;re attracted to each other: &quot;Grindr reintroduces the aspect of chemistry. And \u2013 it&apos;s real. It is not a Second Life. It is not a virtual world. It&apos;s a tool. It enables real life, it doesn&apos;t replace it.&quot; And it leads, I say, to very real sex. None of this virtual nonsense. Simkhai pauses. &quot;Er\u2026 From my perspective\u2026 it&apos;s not sex. It&apos;s a precursor to sex. It&apos;s just before. That&apos;s how I see Grindr. We want to be sexy. We think sex is part of life, the basis of life. But Grindr is sexiness rather than sex.&quot; Simkhai is concerned, perhaps, about the conservative elements of the US media. Editorials on the danger of the &quot;new gay hook-up app&quot; pop up periodically. Simkhai is keen to make the point that Grindr is not uniquely concerned with procuring sex. &quot;I meet guys all the time who say to me: &apos;I know it&apos;s for hooking up, but\u2026 &apos; But they met some really good friends. But they met their boyfriend. But. But.&quot; Simkhai says his main hope for Grindr is it will help young gay men through the process of coming out. I am moved by Simkhai&apos;s passion, by the tales of the non-sexual impact of Grindr. I appreciate that it is still not easy to come out, and how important that sense of geographical proximity, of being part of a visible and accepting community, would be. The David Laws story breaks a fortnight after I interview Simkhai; a high-profile, sad piece of evidence that gay men still encounter problems in making their sexuality public. Yet the men I speak to tell me Grindr is all about sex. &quot;Internet&apos;s for dating; Grindr&apos;s for sex,&quot; D tells me. &quot;Well, sometimes the internet&apos;s for sex, too, but Grindr: definitely sex.&quot; I ask around and am inundated with Grindr stories, all of which end in a sexual encounter. &quot;Sometimes you don&apos;t really fancy them , but\u2026&quot; There&apos;s a sense of obligation to have sex anyway? &quot;Yeah. But that&apos;s OK.&quot; I begin to develop an idea of the culture that surrounds it. Many gay men see Grindr as a way to round off an evening. &quot;I&apos;d had dinner at a friend&apos;s house in west London and I was walking back to the tube; thought I&apos;d launch Grindr, see what was going on. This guy pops up and chats me: &apos;You&apos;re near!&apos; I chat back: &apos;I know\u2026 &apos; He says: &apos;I&apos;m here with my boyfriend. Come and see us.&apos; So\u2026 I did.&quot;\u00a0 Others use it as you might a glass of wine at the end of a stressful day. Kev lives near a major station: &quot;And so I get a lot of literal traffic. Men get off the train on Sunday night after a weekend somewhere stifling, probably with their parents; they launch Grindr \u2013 guess who pops up first?&quot; It&apos;s mixing formerly segregated elements of gay society. My 30- and 40-something gay male friends tell me they&apos;re having much more to do with younger gay men: &quot;Which is weird, and yeah, sometimes not totally comfortable, if you think about it,&quot; says one. &quot;You have to work out what&apos;s too young for you and stick to that limit. But \u2013 you&apos;re always honest about who you are. You&apos;ve got to be. You can&apos;t say you&apos;re younger or hotter than you are; you can&apos;t post someone else&apos;s photo. If you lie you&apos;re just going to get found out, and that pisses people off, obviously. Lying isn&apos;t done on Grindr.&quot; Cheating, on the other hand, definitely is. &quot;You always see on Grindr: &apos;Oh, I&apos;ve got a boyfriend \u2013 just interested in chatting!&apos;&quot; says Matthew Todd, editor of gay lifestyle magazine Attitude. &quot;Oh really? Why? Why do you need to chat to people? Why do you need to be on Grindr? Call your mum up!&quot; A gay man who is in a long-term relationship tells me he&apos;s aware of Grindr, but is choosing not to try it. &quot;It would change everything. I&apos;m very tempted, of course I am! But ultimately I don&apos;t want to go there, and I don&apos;t want my boyfriend F to go there either.&quot; &quot;The vast majority of guys on Grindr are in a relationship,&quot; says P. &quot;And I reckon a quarter of the guys who use it are straight. Not curious or bi or whatever. Straight.&quot; &quot;The straight ones are all talk!&quot; says D. &quot;They love the idea that sex with a stranger could be that easy, could be downloaded on their phone\u2026 But when it comes to it, they won&apos;t do anything.&quot; Not every gay man is enamoured of Grindr. Attitude&apos;s Matthew Todd has reservations. &quot;A friend with an iPhone showed me it about a year ago and said: &apos;Can you believe it?&apos; I rolled my eyes and thought: &apos;There is no way of stopping this.&apos; Find any new technology \u2013 we will always bring it back to sex.&quot; Todd&apos;s used it (&quot;I dip in and out&quot;) and he knows from feedback that Attitude&apos;s readers are using it a great deal. &quot;I think it&apos;s good for people to be able to connect. Especially young people. It&apos;s good to be able to see that there are other gay people around, and to be able to interact. But at the same time I think it&apos;s a very adult world. The commercial gay world \u2013 which Grindr is part of \u2013 is a very adult, very sexual world. And I worry when I see these young kids coming out on to the gay scene, and everything is about sex. There&apos;s no real concept of relationships.&quot; Others condemn it more directly. &quot;Grindr&apos;s addictive,&quot; writes one man \u2013 the ex-boyfriend of a close friend \u2013 by email. &quot;Grindr and Gaydar [the UK&apos;s biggest gay dating site]\u2026 A lot of gay men have addiction issues. I feel crap even writing it, but there it is. We drink, we use drugs and we use sex to overcome the shame we feel. And we feel worse because we know we shouldn&apos;t feel shame, we should feel pride \u2013 so we abuse drugs and sex more. Things like Grindr and Gaydar enable that sort of sex, sex which is compulsive and which dehumanises you; and means you in turn dehumanise the people you are having sex with.&quot; He puts me in touch with G, a man he met while seeking treatment for sex addiction. &quot;I&apos;ve lost entire weekends to sex,&quot; writes G. &quot;Downloading porn, going on Grindr, meeting men whose names I don&apos;t find out, having sex; downloading more porn\u2026&quot; &quot;Low self-esteem,&quot; says Todd. &quot;I see it a lot in gay men \u2013 it&apos;s inevitable after years of repression and shame. And what&apos;s better for self-esteem than someone having sex with you?&quot; Could Grindr work for a straight market? There is, I think, an undeniable gender divide on the things that men and women will do for sex, and the things they expect and want from sex. Yes, women are capable of having inconsequential flings. We are capable of one-night stands. We are capable of having sex without becoming emotionally involved. FitFinder \u2013 which allowed undergraduate users to post descriptions of people they&apos;d seen and fancied on their university-dedicated website \u2013 became extremely popular earlier this spring, before university authorities banned it, which would suggest that there is a straight market for a location-specific dating concept. But I&apos;m not sure Grindr could fully accommodate the complexities of male-female interactions. The gender politics, the power games, the ebb and flow of interest, the tedious but totally authentic need most men feel to pursue a potential sexual conquest\u2026 I ask a handful of straight women \u2013 some single, some not \u2013 if they think they might be interested in a Grindr equivalent; they say they can just about envisage it working, although none of them would commit to the notion of using it themselves. The straight men I poll say they&apos;d think less of any woman who &quot;advertised herself like that&quot; \u2013 and then all insisted on downloading gay Grindr on to their phones, &quot;just to see how it works&quot;. If anyone can make and sell a straight Grindr, Simkhai can. He does concede: &quot;I&apos;m a gay man and I know how to think like a gay man\u2026 actually, my sense is I know how to think like a man. I&apos;m not a woman. I don&apos;t know how to think like a woman.&quot; Yet he says he gets more requests for a straight Grindr from women than he does from straight men. &quot;Many more. Which might be because straight women are often friends with gay men, so know about Grindr\u2026 But I do think it would be relevant for women. I do.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;We&apos;ll redesign it; we&apos;ll call it something different, market it differently. We have to. Gay men are very territorial. They want to keep it all to themselves, but they say: &apos;If you have to make a straight version, call it something else. Grindr is ours.&apos;&quot; I am still sceptical, but then Simkhai says: &quot;This notion of: &apos;Who is around me? Who is in this room now? Who else is like me?&apos; \u2013 this is not just a gay thing. And this thing where: &apos;I want a more fulfilling life. A richer life!&apos; This is not just a gay thing either. Gay men don&apos;t have the monopoly on loneliness and isolation.&quot; He is right, of course. As I say goodbye to Joel Simkhai, I find myself thinking: however straight Grindr plays out for us \u2013 even if it opens up a Pandora&apos;s box on our sexuality, alters forever the way men and women relate, leaves us vulnerable to a whole new world of emotional and sexual complications \u2013 bring it on. It&apos;s going to make life more interesting. grindr.com"}, {"sentences": ["The biggest known collections are now at the Chi Mei Museum in Tainan, Taiwan and the Japan Foundation in Tokyo, both of which are potential resting places for the Vieuxtemps Guarneri."], "tags": ["Music", "Classical music", "US news", "World news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-05T17:37:00Z", "title": "Asking price would make Vieuxtemps Guarneri the most expensive musical instrument ever", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/05/vieuxtemps-guarneri-violin-sale", "article": "     In the rarified world of old violins, the Stradivarius is commonly thought of as the very best. But for many connoisseurs and concert performers, the pinnacle is the work of a craftsman from Cremona in Italy known as Guarneri del Ges\u00f9. One of the last violins to be created by the master, the Vieuxtemps Guarneri, made in 1741 three years before his death. Now it has been put up for sale in Chicago. If the violin achieves the asking price of $18m (\u00a312m), it would be by a wide margin the most expensive musical instrument on Earth. Dubbed the Mona Lisa of violins, it has been played in concert halls around the world by some of the greatest virtuosi of its 269-year existence. It is named after Henri Vieuxtemps, a 19th-century musician who composed solo pieces for violin which he performed using the instrument. More recently, it has passed through the hands of Yehudi Menuhin, Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman. The instrument is owned by a retired British financier and music philanthropist, Ian Stoutzker, who bought it from Sir Isaac Wolfson, founder of Wolfson College, Oxford. It is being sold through one of the world&apos;s leading traders in rare violins, Bein &amp; Fushi of Chicago. Geoffrey Fushi said the instrument was one of the most unusual of Guarneri&apos;s output. It is larger than most, with enormous projection. &quot;I believe it is a living entity, a living being,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;Musicians say the same thing \u2013 that the instrument dictates to them how they play the music.&quot; Philippe Quint, a soloist, has performed on the Vieuxtemps several times with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. &quot;This instrument has the most unbelievable power, not just in loudness but in sound quality. It has a huge palate of colours that allow you to express a wider range of emotions.&quot; For years lovers of the violin have obsessed over the Vieuxtemps. In 1891 the London trader Arthur Hill, who was selling it, wrote in his diary: &quot;What a pity we are not rich enough to keep the violin ourselves as its tone and other merits are perfect.&quot; It is a favourite parlour game of violin aficionados to compare the creations of Antonio Stradivari with his younger rival, Guarneri. Stradivari lived to 93 and about 640 of his violins survive. Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri, to give his proper name, by contrast, died in 1744 at 46, and only about 140 survive. Fushi said the consensus was that &quot;a Guarneri is like a rich chocolate, while a Strad is like strawberry or vanilla ice cream. The Guarneri is often deeper, darker in sound.&quot; Professor David Schoenbaum, of the University of Iowa, who is writing a book on the social history of the violin, said it was almost 100 years after Guarneri&apos;s death before his genius was recognised. In 1830 Niccol\u00f2 Paganini took the Cannone Guarneri to Paris where he astonished audiences with its richness and power. That violin is now regarded as a national treasure and kept in a museum in Genoa. Bein &amp; Fushi&apos;s sales price has raised eyebrows in the historic instrument market. The previous record price was almost half: last October another Guarneri, the Kochanski, sold for $10m. Most observers expect the Vieuxtemps to go to a museum or hedge fund or other institutional collector, as the days in which private individuals and players could afford any Guarneri, let alone a prime specimen, are long since past. Fushi said he had received expressions of interest from all over the world. One of the only collection of violins still in private hands is that of David Fulton, a retired Microsoft magnate, in Seattle but, as in fine art, the money is increasingly coming from the east. The biggest known collections are now at the Chi Mei Museum in Tainan, Taiwan and the Japan Foundation in Tokyo, both of which are potential resting places for the Vieuxtemps Guarneri. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 and 7 July 2010 to make clear in headlines that the Viextemps Guarneri has not yet become the most expensive instrument, and that (contrary to a heading) it is for sale not auction The original also located Chi Mei Museum in Taipei and referred to the soloist Peter Quint.

Some analysts now believe the market may have fallen too far on fears of a double dip recession and worries about European sovereign debt.  Mike Lenhoff at Brewin Dolphin, for example, said a good US earnings season - which starts next week - could give the optimists some encouragement:  The sovereign debt crisis, the related problems with banks, Europe&apos;s fiscal austerity...have all brought the prospect of a double dip more closely into focus. It&apos;s what the correction in equity markets has been all about and they are now oversold, attractively valued and in a strong position to rebound on any good earnings news flow.  A US service sector survey for June showed activity was still growing, albeit slightly more slowly than forecast. Earlier, news that Australia had kept its interest rates on hold rather than cutting them prompted talk that the government believed a severe downturn may not be imminent. So base metal prices moved higher on hopes of steady demand, pushing mining shares higher. Antofagasta added 57.5p to 818.5p and Xstrata climbed 54.8p to 905.8p after it agreed to sell thermal coal to Tokyo Electric Power at a 30% premium to last year&apos;s prices. Banks moved higher on hopes the forthcoming stress tests would throw up no new horrors. Barclays was 15.4p better at 274.6p and Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1.95p to 40.91p. BP rose 12.2p to 345.5p after it said it had no plans to issue new equity, but talk of interest from sovereign wealth funds continued. Analysts at RBS moved their rating from hold to buy with a price target of 455p. They said:  We expect the first relief well to intersect the Macondo bore by mid-July, and we believe this will be a turning point for BP&apos;s share. Stopping the flow of oil will cap the physical volume of the spill, reduce the daily costs being incurred, cool the political temperature and, if BP&apos;s share price remains excessively depressed, it could trigger credible merger speculation.  Still with sovereign wealth funds, Sainsbury climbed 7.4p to 328.2p on vague talk of a move by the Qatar Investment Authority, which holds a 26% stake in the supermarket group after its failed bid in 2007.

Last month Sainsbury chief executive Justin King said he had &quot;no indication whatsoever&quot; that the QIA had changed its stance from being a supportive, long-term investor. Elsewhere Associated British Foods added 23.5p to 970.5p ahead of a third quarter trading update on Thursday. Investec raised its target price for the company from \u00a310.60 to \u00a310.80, partly to reflect the value of ABF&apos;s growing retail business Primark. Analyst Martin Deboo estimated Primark&apos;s enterprise value could be more than \u00a33bn or around 374p a share:  Buried within the occasionally dowdy businesses that comprise ABF, is what we now consider to be one of the most valuable retailers in the world on a pound-for-pound basis. We conclude that Primark is capable of growing its operating profits sustainably by 12-14% per annum on a five year view and that this merits a premium over its current embedded valuation.  HMV was 3.5p higher at 58p as Nick Bubb at Arden Partners suggested activist investors could target the company if its performance did not improve. He said:  HMV&apos;s management continue to think that if they deliver their strategy [of building a broadbased entertainment brand] then profits will follow and that the share price will also follow. Given the structural challenges from online retailing and downloading, the stockmarket is clearly highly sceptical and we are disappointed that HMV does not appear to have a Plan B to boost its ailing share price, e.g. a share buyback programme or a corporate restructuring. But perhaps it is too soon for management to be planning that. If they are not planning something, then it may not be long before an activist shareholder appears on their share register\u2026 We still have faith in HMV and we hope that others start to give HMV the benefit of the doubt, given its derisory rating. We have cut our target price from 115p to 90p, being realistic, but we would buy HMV at this level.  Among the mid-caps Heritage Oil jumped 36p to 414p after the Ugandan government gave conditional approval for its $1.5bn sale of assets to Tullow Oil, up 42p to \u00a310.83. The deal had been held up by a tax dispute between the government and Heritage. GKN was 7.4p better at 119.5p after UBS moved its recommendation on the engineering group from neutral to buy, with a 140p price target. Analyst Stephan Puetter said:  In our view the recent decline in the GKN share price offers a good opportunity to buy the stock again. Although our investment case and profit forecasts are unchanged, we believe the lower valuation now offers an attractive risk-reward profile for investors.

Peter Bethune, who was a member of Sea Shepherd, a marine conservation group, was given two years in prison, suspended for five years, amid tight security at the Tokyo district court. He was also found guilty of trespassing, vandalism and possession of a knife. Bethune, who did not speak during today&apos;s hearing, is expected to be deported to his native New Zealand within days. After the verdict, Bethune said he was relieved and thanked his legal team in Japan. &quot;I am truly sorry for all the trouble and worry this has caused my family and am desperate to get back home to see them,&quot; he said. &quot;I also want to thank all the supporters worldwide who have been sending messages and signing petitions, and the media, who have been keeping this story in the public eye.&quot; The 45-year-old was arrested after boarding the Shonan Maru 2, the fleet&apos;s security vessel, from a jet ski in darkness in February. He had boarded the vessel to protest the sinking of his speedboat, the Ady Gil, in a collision the previous month. He had intended to carry out a citizen&apos;s arrest of the captain and hand him a US$3m bill for damage to the protest boat, which sank. Instead Bethune was detained and then arrested when the ship returned to Japan in March. Bethune accepted four of the charges but denied the most serious charge of assault. He had been accused of throwing bottles of butyric acid \u2013 rancid butter \u2013 at whalers last winter during one of several confrontations between the fleet and campaigners in the Antarctic. Last month the victim of the assault told the court that the attack had left him with facial burns. A small group of rightwing protesters demonstrated outside the court and labelled Bethune a terrorist, with some urging the court to give him the death penalty. During his trial Sea Shepherd said Bethune would no longer take part in the group&apos;s campaigns because he had violated its principle of &quot;aggressive but non-violent direct action&quot; by taking a bow and arrows with him. While in detention in Tokyo he indicated he no longer wished to take part in anti-whaling activities. Sea Shepherd&apos;s founder, Paul Watson, is on an Interpol wanted list for ordering Bethune to board the Shonan Maru 2. There are Japanese allegations that the group&apos;s actions put whalers&apos; lives at risk. Japan launched a crackdown against anti-whaling protesters following a winter of bitter confrontation in the Southern Ocean that forced the fleet to return to port with barely half its intended catch of minke whales. Despite the 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium on commercial whaling Japan is permitted to kill nearly 1,000 whales each year for what it calls scientific research."}, {"sentences": ["Major exhibitions of his work were held in the British Museum in 1988, in the US in 1988-89, in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, and today he is recognised around the world as one of the masters of modern Chinese painting."], "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-07T17:42:34Z", "title": "Wu Guanzhong obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/07/wu-guanzhong-obituary", "article": "In the summer of 1950, soon after Mao Zedong had proclaimed the founding of the people&apos;s republic, Wu Guanzhong, happily studying painting in Paris, made the fateful decision to return to China. Appointed to teach in the Central Academy of Art in Beijing, his head full of C\u00e9zanne and Van Gogh, he soon found that he was forbidden to\u00a0mention those names, and felt unable to face his radical students until he could talk about socialist realism in the Soviet Union, and its foreshadowing in the art of Ilya Repin. This was the beginning of almost three decades of\u00a0harassment and victimisation that, for him and countless others, ended only after the death of Mao in 1976.     Wu Guanzhong     One of modern China&apos;s leading artists, Wu, who has died aged 90, was\u00a0born into a peasant family in a\u00a0village near Yixing, in the east-coast province of\u00a0Jiangsu, where his father was head of\u00a0the primary school. In\u00a0his teens he was training to be an electrical engineer when he met Chu Teh Chun, then studying art under Lin Fengmian at the Academy of Art in\u00a0Hangzhou, to the south. He\u00a0transferred to that delectable lakeside institution, where his talent blossomed under Lin&apos;s guidance. When war came in 1937, Wu moved with the school to the far west \u2013 first to Yunnan, then to Chongqing, the wartime capital, where Lin, who had spent several years in France, fired his most gifted students with a longing to go there. Wu, Chu and the equally gifted Zhao Wuji set about learning French, and by 1948 they were settled in Paris. Wu, a favourite student of\u00a0Jean\u00a0Souverbie, felt increasingly cut\u00a0off from his roots until, after agonising heart-searching, he returned to Beijing, leaving Chu and Zhao to flourish as major figures in the art world of Paris. Exiled from the Central Academy, Wu took a job in the architecture department at Qinghua University, Beijing, and later at the Academy of\u00a0Decorative Arts, founded by Pang Xunqin in 1953 with the support of the premier, Zhou Enlai. Thereafter, he held several teaching posts until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in August 1966, when he was forbidden to teach, write or paint. Eventually he was sent to the country to work as a farm labourer. After two years of backbreaking work, he was permitted to paint, on any bit of board he could find, on Sundays. He remarked later that he had become a member of\u00a0the dung basket school of painting. Gradually, things got better. In\u00a01973 Wu was one of the leading artists brought back from the countryside \u2013 on the initiative of Zhou \u2013 to decorate hotels and public buildings. He was painting again, travelling around China, writing articles. His rehabilitation was marked by an exhibition of his work in 1978 at the Central Academy. From that moment, he never looked back. Major exhibitions of his work were held in the British Museum in 1988, in the US in 1988-89, in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, and today he is recognised around the world as one of the masters of modern Chinese painting. Wu was trained as an oil painter, chiefly of the human figure. When his nudes were condemned in the early 1950s, he destroyed them all and did not paint another until 1990, after a longed-for return visit to Paris. Unwilling to paint heroic workers, peasants and soldiers, he had turned to landscape, painted both in oils and in ink on paper. Unlike some other modern Chinese artists, he never found the choice of styles a problem. Asked whether he preferred the Chinese or the western style, he said: &quot;When I take up a brush to paint, I paint a Chinese picture.&quot; Wu&apos;s style, or rather styles, are unmistakable. His landscapes in oils are marked by a delicacy of touch and colour, a purity and fluidity of line, that are very seductive. He also liked to work in the traditional Chinese medium of\u00a0ink on paper, and his studies of trees and plants have a vitality and freedom that sometimes verges on abstract expressionism, although Wu always denied that abstraction was an issue. Indeed, perhaps his chief contribution to the development of\u00a0Chinese painting since 1950 was his defence of\u00a0abstraction. &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid of it,&quot; he insisted, &quot;because it is all around us in nature \u2013 in the design of the trellis in a garden pavilion, in\u00a0the\u00a0shadow of\u00a0the bamboo leaves on a white wall... The line that connects the painted image to the real thing can never be broken.&quot; He would even say that the compositions of Piet Mondrian were not pure abstractions, because they obeyed the laws of harmony in nature. To the Chinese artist, there is no art that does not have a reference in\u00a0nature. Wu was a remarkable man, not only for his prodigious talent, but for the courage with which he stood up to the Maoist ideologues \u2013 unlike his teacher Lin, who was crushed by them \u2013 for the lucidity of his writings about art, and for the demands he made upon himself. He\u00a0was a prolific painter, perhaps excessively so, and not all his work, in particular in the too-fluid Chinese medium of brush and ink, is up to his best standard. Realising this, in 1991 he destroyed several hundred of his paintings. He died a much-admired &quot;old master&quot;, survived by his wife, Zhu Biqin, two sons and a daughter, and many young artists who had felt his inspiring influence in stressful times. \u2022 Wu Guanzhong, artist, born 29 August 1919; died 25 June 2010"}, {"sentences": ["Who would have thought that sour wine (literally, &quot;vin aigre&quot;) would play such an important role in all the world&apos;s great cuisines, from Tokyo to Burgundy?"], "tags": ["Barbecue", "British food and drink", "Chinese food and drink", "Fruit", "Main course", "Meat", "Salad", "Starter", "Dessert", "Side dish", "Soft drinks", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-09T23:02:11Z", "title": "Vinegar recipes | Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall | Food", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/10/vinegar-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall", "article": "Wherever there has been wine, there has been vinegar, its sharp-tongued twin. I don&apos;t mean this disparagingly. I wouldn&apos;t be without its puckery, palate-bracing charms. From the mildest rice wine vinegar to potent, syrupy, complex balsamic, vinegars perk up my cooking every day. Vinegar is one of history&apos;s happiest culinary accidents. Who would have thought that sour wine (literally, &quot;vin aigre&quot;) would play such an important role in all the world&apos;s great cuisines, from Tokyo to Burgundy? And, indeed, here in the\u00a0West Country, where cider vinegar is\u00a0my reach-for default for dressings and sauces. The first batch of vinegar was no doubt a great surprise to its owner, a\u00a0disappointment \u2013 amusing now, when you think that the finest Italian\u00a0balsamics command a price to rival the world&apos;s greatest wines. But when air seeped into that first cask, along with a few yeasty spores, allowing the vinegar mother to\u00a0thrive and grow like some all-consuming alien, it must have been\u00a0something of a blow. What a\u00a0credit to whomever then took this throat-rasping liquor and said to themselves, &quot;There must be something useful I can do with this. Now where&apos;s the olive oil?&quot; There are records of vinegar going back thousands of years. Hippocrates mentions its medicinal properties in\u00a0the fifth century BC. The Greeks used it to preserve food \u2013 very important in the days before refrigeration. Caesar&apos;s armies fortified themselves with it. Pliny the Elder wrote that Cleopatra dissolved her pearls in it to impress Mark Antony that she could throw the most expensive banquet in history. Wags,\u00a0take note\u2026 I have quite the collection at home, from white-wine vinegars with tarragon (perfect for a b\u00e9arnaise sauce), to brown rice vinegar and homemade red-wine vinegar, made from our (scant) leftovers, which is slowly gathering age and complexity in its special jar.\u00a0But my beloved cider vinegar comes\u00a0out more often than the rest put together. I use it not only for most of my dressings, but for most\u00a0of my pickling, too, where its\u00a0genuine fruitiness lends far more\u00a0character than white distilled vinegar or even malt vinegar (save that for the chips). Recently, I&apos;ve been using quite a\u00a0bit of apple balsamic vinegar, too \u2013 the Suffolk company Aspall, still family-run, makes a stunner \u2013 adding it to recipes or simply mixing it with olive oil to dip bread into, or trickling it over ripe, sliced tomatoes with a sprinkling of salt. From time to time, I very purposefully reach for rice vinegar, made \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 through the fermentation of sugars derived from rice. Used in Japanese and Chinese cooking, it has a light, sweet flavour with a nice hint of sake about it. It&apos;s great for dressing \u2013 or the very light pickling of \u2013 delicate vegetables, such as cucumbers, courgettes, peas and beans, or for using in marinades and\u00a0sauces for fish or shellfish. Many vinegars have a great affinity with sweet things, too. Add\u00a0a\u00a0spoonful of white-wine or cider vinegar to meringues as you whip them. Some swear a spoonful added to the dough makes pastry especially flaky, so try it next time you make a\u00a0tart. And vinegar is astonishingly good with fruit. Who\u00a0didn&apos;t, during the 1990s, trickle a little balsamic over strawberries to create one of the laziest, tastiest puds ever? Try it again, with strawberries, blueberries, cherries, even ripe peaches. It really is delicious. So let&apos;s hear it for one of the kitchen&apos;s hardest working ingredients. So often, when I think a\u00a0dish is missing a little something, it turns out to be a vinegar-shaped hole. If forced to choose, by some evil demon, would I pick wine over vinegar? I&apos;m not sure I would. As long as I could have cider, that is\u2026 Sticky apple balsamic spare ribs These sticky ribs are near-addictively good, and incredibly easy to make. Serves four to six. 1.5kg free-range pork ribs (2\u00a0racks) For the marinade4 tbsp redcurrant, plum, crab apple or other fruit jelly3 tbsp apple balsamic vinegar2 tbsp light muscovado sugar3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger\u00bd-1 medium-hot red chilli, finely chopped, or \u00bd tsp dried chilli flakes2 tbsp soy sauce Steamed rice and wilted greens, to\u00a0serve  Whisk together all the marinade ingredients. Put the ribs in a large, ovenproof dish, pour the marinade over and, using your hands, turn the ribs around in it so they&apos;re all well coated. Cover and leave to marinate in a cool place for at least an hour, several hours if possible, turning them from time to time. Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Turn the ribs in their marinade one final time, cover the\u00a0dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Raise the temperature to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Remove the foil and turn the ribs again, basting them with the sauce. Return the uncovered dish to the oven and cook for 35-45 minutes longer, turning and basting the ribs two or three more times, until they are glossy and dark and coated in the caramelised sauce. Lift the ribs on to a serving plate and spoon any remaining sauce over them. Leave until they are cool enough to pick up with your fingers, then tuck in. Serve with steamed rice and wilted greens. Chilli dipping sauce This easy sauce is delicious with deep-fried squid, tempura vegetables and Thai fish or crab cakes. It will keep, sealed in a jar, for\u00a0a week, and is the perfect thing to perk\u00a0up all manner of dressings and marinades. Before serving, when the sauce is cool, add some chopped coriander if you like, too. 3 tbsp redcurrant or crab apple jelly1 tbsp cider vinegar1 tsp soy sauce1 red chilli, deseeded and very finely\u00a0chopped1 small garlic clove, very finely choppedA few twists black pepper  Tip all of the ingredients into a\u00a0small\u00a0saucepan and stir over a\u00a0very\u00a0low heat until the fruit jelly has dissolved and\u00a0you are left with a\u00a0silky syrup. Bring up to a simmer and allow to\u00a0bubble gently for a few minutes \u2013 this will mellow the harshness of the garlic. Set aside to cool and serve at room temperature. If the\u00a0sauce re-sets to a\u00a0jelly when it&apos;s\u00a0cool, simply whisk in a splash of\u00a0warm water. Tarragon vinegar Use this vinegar in mayonnaise to dress egg or chicken salads, or in a light vinaigrette to dress still-warm potatoes, French beans or leeks. Makes about 500ml. 500ml white-wine or cider vinegar\u00bd tsp pink peppercorns (optional)\u00bd tsp black peppercorns (optional)6 large sprigs French tarragon  Pour the vinegar into a Kilner-type jar and add the peppercorns and tarragon. Seal and refrigerate for a couple of weeks. Strain, discard the herbs, and seal in sterilised bottles. Strawberry vinegar This works equally well with raspberries, blackcurrants or\u00a0blackberries, too. It&apos;s a recipe from the queen of all things bottled and jarred, Pam Corbin, who wrote River Cottage Handbook 2: Preserves (Bloomsbury, \u00a312.99). Use in salad dressing, trickled over goat&apos;s cheese or ice cream, or as a cordial to make refreshing summer drinks. Makes 1.5 litres. 1kg strawberries600ml cider vinegar or white-wine\u00a0vinegarGranulated sugar Put the fruit in a bowl and crush lightly with a wooden spoon. Add the vinegar, cover and leave to steep for four to five days, stirring occasionally. Pour the fruit and vinegar into a\u00a0scalded jelly bag or piece of muslin suspended over a bowl, and leave to drain overnight. You can squeeze it a\u00a0bit if you like. Measure the liquid, pour into a saucepan and add 450g of sugar for every 600ml of fruit vinegar. Over a\u00a0low heat, bring gently to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Boil for eight to 10 minutes, removing any scum as it rises. Take off the heat and set aside to cool. When cold, bottle and seal. Use within 12 months. \u2022 Go to rivercottage.net for the latest news from River Cottage HQ."}, {"sentences": ["While we have to stagger\u00a0on through this vale of tears\u00a0with only YouTube videos of\u00a0tiny cats playing in tissue boxes to\u00a0sustain us,\u00a0others get to say, &quot;Yes,\u00a0I&apos;ll\u00a0have a tall, non-fat macchiato, a yarn ball and a go of the blue burmese bundle of fluff in\u00a0the corner, please.&quot; The rest of\u00a0the world should get together and\u00a0forge\u00a0a giant medal, embossed with beaming urbanite faces, in honour of this achievement and hang it round Tokyo&apos;s neck."], "tags": ["Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-09T23:02:15Z", "title": "Lucy Mangan: Why I love Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/10/lucy-mangan-japan", "article": "   Illustration Photograph: Demetrios Psillos for the Guardian    I think I might have to move to Japan.

Infusing ordinary daily acts with a weird semi-erotic undertone is one of the delicate arts at which the Japanese are masters, but the basic premise is terrifically sound and, I would submit, wholly importable. Who wouldn&apos;t, after all, love half an hour of being petted like\u00a0a kitten in a cafe? You would have to tweak it a\u00a0bit to\u00a0take away the unsavoury tang \u2013 laps provided by starched-aproned matriarchs and fully-vetted grandads sitting on battered sofas instead of charming young ladies kneeling on the ground, maybe. Women and their ears allowed in for half price to encourage a gender balance and civilising influence on the clientele, perhaps. And if anyone does misinterpret the services on offer, hey, there&apos;s only one person in\u00a0that little relationship who&apos;s armed with an ear pick. Maybe I don&apos;t have to move. Maybe I just have to bring the best bits here. How difficult can it be?

Stringer&apos;s company had a big stake in the South African tournament: the official song was sung by Sony artist Shakira; as an official sponsor, Sony ads appeared on the rotating pitchside hoardings for 30 seconds every five-and-a-half minutes, while the Japanese company filmed 25 matches in its new 3D technology, with the official film due to be released in December. The company&apos;s new technology was the thread that held all of these together: Shakira&apos;s Waka Waka video was a three-dimensional affair, while the adverts flagged up the latest step-change in television (and cinema) viewing. Possibly Stringer&apos;s favourite moment of the tournament was when a picture of a despondent Italian player, with a Sony ad in the background, featured across the sports pages. &quot;If you don&apos;t know that Sony does 3D by now, you haven&apos;t been paying attention,&quot; he says. But 3D is also clearly more than just the latest technological fad for the Welshman, one of only two foreign chief executives of big Japanese companies (the other is Carlos Ghosn at Nissan). It is a major policy move: to counter rivals and to unite his own disparate empire. Sony&apos;s recent financial misfortunes \u2013 two consecutive years in the red, with the \u00a540bn (\u00a3298m) loss in 2009 an improvement on 2008&apos;s \u00a599bn \u2013 saw pressure heaped upon the journalist-turned-chief executive, chairman and president. At first his colleagues did not understand his new obsession. &quot;I remember one of my favourite executives was being very protective that I would be the laughing stock when I started talking about 3D when I did,&quot; he says. &quot;But I did anyway, and a well-known executive rang me and said &apos;You can&apos;t stake your career on 3D&apos;. I said it would be one thing to stake your career at 38, but at 68 it&apos;s not so brave.&quot; Stringer says he is tired of being a technological leader while seeing his products undercut by Korean and Chinese rivals: &quot;Sony innovation is good, but it can be copied fast. Our engineering gives us a lead time we have got to find a way to keep it.&quot; He was also disenchanted by running what was effectively four separate companies which did not work with each other. Solving the second problem would help deal with the first: &quot;We are lots of different companies. I had to say we will go for 3D in a big way. We united the company behind 3D. It is an example where we might be able to demonstrate that size does matter. &quot;We are a large company which competes with very sophisticated boutiques: Canon in cameras, Apple in tablets and phones. [But] nobody can match us for an extended product range in 3D. We can deliver 3D all the way from Sony Ericsson phones to Blu-ray and cinema. We create an energy in the marketplace no one else can match. We are a more competitive technology company than we can be when we are second in a [single] product race led by a smaller competitor. We have 3D movies coming out, we have 3D games, we have a 3D camera and on Playstation you can upload 3D capability. We are networking all our products.&quot; Ruminating on teamwork, Stringer returns to the football and argues that the teams that succeeded were unified and had the inbuilt advantages of playing together at club teams. &quot;England played as if they had never played together. The Italians and French went the same way.&quot; The 3D blitz has made all parts of the company think about software and content as much as it does about hardware, he says: &quot;Bill Gates once said we do not do software at Sony. It was true because everything was vertically integrated. Software is a horizontal skill. We have to digitise the company. We were an analogue company.&quot; Sony is aiming to sell 25m TV sets this year, with 10% of those 3D-capable. But will people buy expensive new TVs with an unproven track record during a recession? The son of an RAF officer questions how bad the economy will get: &quot;I&apos;m still slightly appalled by the failure to recognise the recession as it was coming or the impact of the banks. So when people tell you it&apos;s a double-dip recession, I don&apos;t think anybody really knows.&quot; His problem was compounded in Sony&apos;s homeland because the Japanese had ridden out the downturn: &quot;The Japanese are brilliant non-spenders. They move into each others&apos; houses, children move back home to their parents, they don&apos;t buy cars because public transport is so good. Yet go to Tokyo and every restaurant is jammed with young people \u2013 there&apos;s no physical evidence of pain. Japan had a stagnant economy for 10 years, yet it has the best trains in the world, the best infrastructure and no crime. What&apos;s the big deal? &quot;For me to get a sense of urgency [for change] in Tokyo was very hard. A year-and-a-half ago I had to cut costs.&quot; Almost 20,000 jobs have been cut, leaving Sony with 43 factories worldwide. Irrespective of the state of the economy, do TV viewers even want their pictures in 3D? Stringer highlights the images available in sport, documentaries and music. ESPN has launched a 3D channel in the US, while &quot;we did a deal with Discovery in two weeks, which suggests that somebody else thinks 3D has something to offer&quot;. What about news images? &quot;TV news is voyeuristic. The arrival of camera phones has generated interest in a variety of images. Would 3D be even more voyeuristic? I do not use that word as a value judgment. If people are strange enough to want to watch oil gushing into the gulf on the internet, then I suppose you would [be prepared] to watch it in 3D. Newsgathering is very expensive. [News organisations] are not going to spend a lot of money on sending out 3D cameras. But if you have a big natural disaster, a large broadcaster might be tempted to send a 3D camera out for a competitive advantage.&quot; But he is not interested in every possibility: &quot;The pornography industry is totally thrilled by 3D. We have not done anything with them. We ran off screaming as far as that image is concerned.&quot; Even if spectacular images are available, do people want to gather around their television sets in dark glasses? Stringer&apos;s response is twofold. First, he says: &quot;Those of us who wear glasses already are not as impressed by the rest of you who are more narcissistic. We wear glasses anyway. It&apos;s not that big a deal.&quot; Second, he adds: &quot;The family isn&apos;t gathering around anyway. When I go home my son is in a darkened bedroom \u2013 God knows what he&apos;s watching on the internet because the curtains are pulled and his door is shut, you don&apos;t want to know with a 17-year-old. My daughter is watching something softer and sweeter, and my wife now has a TV in a small room because she wants to watch anything remotely resembling Jane Austen and I&apos;m here watching wall-to-wall British sports. So I think anything that brings you all together is a good thing. It&apos;s why reality television has succeeded, it&apos;s why The X-Factor worked.&quot; Pensionable age or not, Stringer does admit that the company&apos;s push may be make or break: &quot;3D is an opportunity for us to demonstrate high-quality technology. We have to make sure the customer is satisfied. If we do not and it is not profitable then we will fail.&quot; Curriculum Vitae Born: Cardiff, Wales; now aged 68.

It&apos;s like being beamed into an alternative reality, where optimism and respect permeate life, and modernism is fused with tradition to create exciting new possibilities of how to live. I&apos;d organised my trip in and around Kyoto and Tokyo to explore Japanese food, but found myself captivated by the latest fashion in ryokans \u2013 Japanese inns. My revelation came in the form of Miyamasou, an idyllic new ryokan high up in the Northern mountain forests of Kyoto prefecture, famed for its wild herb food. Once our bus passed what looked like a beware-of-bears-crossing-the-road sign, deep in the dark cypress woods, the driver put on Greensleeves to announce its arrival to the mountain hamlets. Dropped off beside a phone booth, we were collected by a shaven-headed, monk-like man from Miyamasou who drove us up through the misty woods until we reached two low buildings. They lay on either side of a winding path, which continued up the mountain to a weather-beaten Shinto shrine. The air was sweet with the scent of cryptomeria (cypress) trees. We took off our shoes and were led by our smiling kimono-clad maid to our room and served a welcoming cup of magnolia tea with a red bean sweetmeat. Like all traditional ryokan rooms, it was very simple: tempered walls, tatami matted floor and one table. The only decoration was a hanging scroll and a vase with a single stem of frothy white flowers in an alcove. The room was dominated by a perfect woodland view of mossy maple boughs and a gurgling brook. The glass is so clear that tiny dots are placed on it to prevent you walking into it. Outside, birds fluttered and the last wild cherry blossom fell in the summer rain. Everything was conducive to reflection. Home, I decided, was going to be de-cluttered on my return, although I didn&apos;t know how I was going to replicate the delicate fresh smell that seems to pervade Japan. But my revelation came when I visited the loo. It&apos;s unnerving enough to find that the loo seat opens automatically when you enter the room, but I was truly startled when it started playing Bach&apos;s air on the G string (the theme tune of the Hamlet cigar ad) as I touched its toasty, comfort-controlled seat \u2013 the latest in Japanese lavatory fashion.     Miyamasou serves amazing kaiseki food.    Despite these hi-tech extras, ryokan Miyamasou still follows traditional lines, from the same-sex shared wooden bath tub to laying out the bedding at night on your tatami mat. Its food is exquisite, from the amazing kaiseki meal of myriad different seasonal courses of wild foods such as bamboo shoot and fresh water shrimp, to breakfast the following morning with its miso-cured river fish (think Japanese kippers) and plum tea. Other ryokans, however, are forging a &quot;New Japanese&quot; concept where traditional and western elements are combined to create an ultra-comfortable 21st-century style. Hoshinoya, just outside Kyoto, and Kaichoro in Ikaho, about two hours north of Tokyo, are perhaps the most famous examples of this new style. An hour&apos;s drive back to Kyoto took us to Hoshinoya Kyoto where we were suddenly cast into the lap of luxury by English-speaking staff. Little temple bells were rung as we walked up from the jade green Oigawa river to Hoshinoya. Overhead, wild monkeys chattered in the rustling trees. A hundred years ago these buildings were the library of a Kyoto merchant. Inside they felt excitingly modern. There are western elements \u2013 high ceilings, low modern furniture designed to contemplate the river view, futons (rather than a tatami mat), English books and continental breakfast \u2013 mixed with Japanese paper screens, incense, sophisticated lighting and your own private wet room with a fragrant cryptomeria-wood tub. There is a public lounge area, and a funky dining room where you can eat French or Japanese food a la carte. It is more open than traditional ryokans, where guests are usually carefully screened from each other \u2013 except when they visit an onsen (hot water spring bath).     The Kaichoro blends western with traditional elements.     Kaichoro in Ikaho, two hours north-west of Tokyo, in contrast, seemed more traditional, with its private dining rooms and your own personal (English speaking) maid, albeit in a modern hotel block. Crucially, though, it has delicious French-influenced kaiseki food, European furniture, hi-tech lighting, and each room has its own private onsen overlooking the mountains. By the time we&apos;d reached Kaichoro, our minds were so full of the zen-gardens, Noh theatre, temples and bubbling volcanic springs that we&apos;d seen, we didn&apos;t want to leave. We&apos;d arrived needing a guide, but after 10 days of Japanese kindness, felt confident enough to use bilingual notes and maps to communicate. \u2022 Abercrombie &amp; Kent&apos;s (0845 618 2214) tailormade 12-night trip to Japan, including B&amp;B accommodation at the ryokans (and dinner at Kaichoro), transfers and a seven-day rail pass costs from \u00a33,845 per person (flights excluded).

He dreamed of convenient acts of God\u2026&quot; writes Adam Ross in the opening to Mr Peanut (Jonathan Cape, \u00a316.99). Yet when Alice, David&apos;s beloved wife of 13 years, actually does die (apparently of a peanut allergy), he is devastated \u2013 and quickly becomes the prime suspect. Investigators think they&apos;ve nailed him when they find the manuscript of a book that Pepin (a Hitchcock fan) has been working on. It details his marital strife and fantasies of Alice&apos;s demise. But all is not what it seems. As the tale progresses, it sheds layers like a matryoshka doll \u2013 revealing that the two detectives investigating the case both harbour good reasons to murder their own wives (one of them may even have done so). Enter an enigmatic hit man called Mobius, and the narrative dissolves into interwoven episodes from three different lives \u2013 told and sometimes retold from multiple perspectives. Although fragmented and stretched back over many years, these episodes share notable resemblances, from historical details about their characters&apos; lives to their broader instincts, relationships and perspectives. It&apos;s an ambitious and well-crafted noir that manages to humanise its characters while fashioning their stories into a gripping page-turner. Ross&apos;s depiction of love and hatred, and the conflicted ways we manifest these feelings, is both sensitive and fearless. But sometimes the structural contortions of the narrative detract from the overall effect: as the story approaches its denouement, the prose slips into creative-writing exercise territory, and the playful, postmodern devices begin to feel like overkill. Jonathan Lee&apos;s Who Is Mr Satoshi? (William Heinemann, \u00a312.99) is, by contrast, told entirely from the perspective of one man, with occasional interjections from the authors of old letters he finds. Although set in contemporary London and Tokyo, it is also concerned with excavating the past \u2013 and written texts \u2013 in order to solve a mystery. Since the tragic death of his pregnant wife, the life of Rob Fossick, a once-brilliant photographer, has descended into prescription drug-fuelled agoraphobia. He rarely leaves his London flat except to visit his mother, who suffers from dementia. But he is drawn out of his bubble when, just moments before his mother dies, he discovers that she was hoping to deliver a package to a man called Mr Satoshi. Suddenly, the burden has fallen to him. He has no idea who the man is, or how to find him. His search takes him to Japan, where he meets an alluring young hotel receptionist who&apos;s determined to help him. With her help, he negotiates a new and unfamiliar landscape where nothing is quite what it seems. Although predictable in some of its twists, it&apos;s an elegant and incisive examination of how history and our perceptions of the world are partial, filtered, and continually revised. Both Mr Peanut and Who is Mr Satoshi? ask intriguing questions about how we see, remember and narrate our lives. But Paul Harding&apos;s Tinkers (William Heinemann, \u00a312.99) \u2013 winner of the 2010 Pulitzer prize \u2013 is by far the most captivating exploration of history, time and human consciousness. It opens with George Washington Crosby as an old man on his deathbed. While his grip on life slips, the physical world around him appears to melt, and anarchic memories \u2013 or hallucinations \u2013 spring forth unbidden. As his mind drifts back to his earlier life, his memories are blended with those of his father, a rural tinker who plied his trade in Maine on a horse and cart, and who disappeared without a trace when George was a boy. The narrative oscillates between the voices of the two men, as young boys, adults, husbands and grandfathers. It&apos;s an expert piece of historical and psychological archaeology, which unpicks the (bewitching) intricacies of ordinary life while also asking the terrifying, unanswerable, yet endlessly fascinating questions that haunt us all: &quot;What persists beyond this cataclysm of making and unmaking?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Story."], "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Television", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-19T20:30:29Z", "title": "Portrait of the artist: Richard Wilson, actor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jul/19/richard-wilson-actor-that-face", "article": "What got you started? I got into drama accidentally, in a rather unusual way. My primary school had a stage in its gymnasium. Once you had passed the 11-plus, it was considered a privilege for you to stay behind after school, move all the chairs out of the way and turn the gymnasium into a theatre. You&apos;d go and have your tea, then come back and see a show, and put all the chairs away again. What was your big breakthrough? Doing [the 1987 TV series] Tutti Frutti was a big landmark for me as an actor \u2013 and later, One Foot in the Grave. But as a director, the big moment came when I was asked to direct a mime-play in my final year at Rada. I was good at mime, because I didn&apos;t have to expose my Scottish accent. That was my first inkling of directing, and I&apos;ve combined the two ever since. Is this a boom time for British theatre?  Yes, I think it is.

It must be for escapism, because it&apos;s certainly not cheap. What one song would work as the soundtrack to your life? That&apos;s a difficult one to throw at someone. But for me it would be the Four Last Songs by Strauss. I first heard them when I was doing a play for Joint Stock [theatre company]. It was an &quot;oh my God&quot; moment \u2013 why, I thought, have I not heard this before? What&apos;s your favourite film? Tokyo Story. I first saw it in the 60s at a screening at the British Film Institute, and it changed my life. I was watching nuances of family life and behaviour that I utterly recognised, despite the fact that the actors were Japanese, and speaking a language I didn&apos;t understand. I&apos;d never smelt anything as rich and detailed as that in British cinema. Complete this sentence: At heart I&apos;m just a frustrated . . . Orchestra conductor. What work of art would you most like to own? It would give me immense pleasure to\u00a0say that I owned something by Mark\u00a0Rothko. Which other artists do you most admire? The late [choreographer] Pina Bausch. Her work opened up for me the idea of what dance could be. Is there anything about your career you\u00a0regret? Being asked to direct several plays that\u00a0I turned down, and which went on\u00a0to be big successes.

Kim Hyon-hui was sentenced to death after being convicted of bombing a South Korean airliner in 1987, killing all 115 people on board, but was later pardoned and went on to write a bestselling autobiography about her life as a secret agent. She flew in to Tokyo after the Japanese authorities waived strict immigration controls to allow her to meet the relatives of two Japanese citizens snatched by North Korean agents in the late 1970s. Hyon-hui says she was tutored by a woman who is among several Japanese abducted by North Korean spies at the height of the cold war. She may also have information about Megumi Yokota, who was taken from near her home, aged 13, in the late 1970s. Kim&apos;s visit comes at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, coinciding with reports that a North Korean cabinet official who led talks with the South, has been executed, and as Seoul and Washington announced a joint naval exercise designed to remind Pyongyang of the formidable military forces it would confront should a conflict break out. Kwon Ho-ung, who headed the North&apos;s negotiating team from 2004-07, was executed by firing squad, according to the Dong-a Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper. His death appears to be part of a purge of &quot;impure&quot; officials connected with policy failures. In March, the regime executed two officials responsible for a botched currency revaluation. Next week&apos;s naval exercise will send a &quot;clear message&quot; to the North following the sinking in March of a South Korean naval vessel, the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, told reporters in Seoul . &quot;These defensive, combined exercises are designed to send a clear message to North Korea that its aggressive behaviour must stop, and that we are committed to together enhancing our combined defensive capabilities,&quot; he said. Gates and the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, will tomorrow visit the demilitarised zone, the heavily fortified border separating the two Koreas, in a show of support for Washington&apos;s ally. Hyon-hui, who arrived in Japan before dawn under tight security, was due to meet the parents of Yokota, who was snatched as she walked home from badminton practice near her home on the Japan Sea coast in 1977. Her parents refuse to believe North Korean claims that she suffered from a mental illness and committed suicide in 1994. Kim was also due to meet the relatives of Yaeko Taguchi, who was abducted in 1978, aged 22. Hyon-hui claims that Taguchi subsequently became her live-in Japanese teacher for more than a year-and-a-half in the early 1980s. Critics denounced this week&apos;s visit as a stunt designed to deflect attention from Japan&apos;s failure to establish the fates of Yokota and other abductees. Hyon-hui has already spoken to some of the victims&apos; families and is not expected to offer any new information. During a 2002 summit with Japan&apos;s then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that the regime had abducted 13 people and used them to teach spies how to pass themselves off as Japanese. It allowed five of them to return home later that year, but insisted the remaining eight had died. Hyon-hui quickly gained notoriety for the attack on the Korean Air jet, which came as Seoul was preparing to host the 1988 summer Olympics. She and Kim Seung-il, a male spy, posed as a Japanese father and daughter and boarded KAL flight 858 from Baghdad to Seoul, planting a time bomb in a luggage rack before getting off at Abu Dhabi. The plane later exploded over the Andaman Sea near Burma. They were arrested two days later in Bahrain, where they tried to kill themselves by swallowing cyanide capsules hidden in cigarettes. Kim Seung-il died, but Kim&apos;s cigarette was snatched from her before she could ingest a lethal dose. Kim was extradited to Seoul, where she was sentenced to death in March 1989. She was pardoned the following year after the then South Korean president, Roh Tae-woo, accepted she had been brainwashed into carrying out the bombing on the orders of communist North Korea&apos;s founder, Kim Il-sung. Kim, 48, married one of the South Korean intelligence officers who investigated her and donated the proceeds from her autobiography to the families of the bombing&apos;s victims. Last year, she told Taguchi&apos;s relatives in a meeting in South Korea that the abducted woman may still be alive, contradicting Pyongyang&apos;s claim that she died in a traffic accident in 1986. The former spy, who is due to return to South Korea on Friday, is reportedly staying at the mountain retreat of the former prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, who resigned last month."}, {"sentences": ["The investigation was launched in January when five passengers aboard a Boeing 777 between Tokyo and Paris complained of having had around \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,380) of foreign currency stolen during flights."], "tags": ["France", "Air transport", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-20T16:59:28Z", "title": "Air France flight attendant charged over 'mile-high' thefts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/20/air-france-flight-attendant-theft", "article": "For more than a year, she operated stealthily as business class passengers slumbered; an apparently comforting flight attendant who poured tea for travellers with one hand and swiped their bank cards with the other.

The lineup: Rumer (piano, vocals). The background: Rumer has been a rumour for a while now. We heard one song by her a year or so ago on her MySpace page and suspected it was a one-off moment of greatness, never to be repeated. We waited for more, just so that we could be sure before we raved about her. And now here she is, with four songs of almost equal quality, and we couldn&apos;t be more delighted because both vocally and in terms of songwriting style she recalls two of our favourite female artists: Karen Carpenter and Laura Nyro (with a hint of Judee Sill, who would be also in our top five). This is quite brave of her. Whenever young female singer-songwriters acknowledge their influences, they usually go for cool countercultural types or Laurel Canyon ladies such as Joni Mitchell. Not Rumer. Her voice sounds uncannily like Karen Carpenter, and despite the latter&apos;s tragic death in 1983 \u2013 and Sonic Youth&apos;s attempt in the 90s to bestow posthumous cachet on the Carpenters by highlighting the sadness at the centre of their work, Carpenter is never going to be in the pantheon. Meanwhile, the Nyro she evokes is that of Wedding Bell Blues, when she was an unhip young tunesmith penning pop hits in a Brill Building vein, rather than the terrifying confessionals of the New York Tendaberry album. The track Am I Forgiven? has that distinctively jaunty early-Nyro quality, verging on 60s Broadway/showtunes territory. Slow, that MySpace song we imagined would be a fluke, is so Karen-sings-Laura it&apos;s untrue. It&apos;s a gentle, meandering ballad with a lustrous, almost jazzy chord progression that so impressed Burt Bacharach he flew her to California just to hear her sing. Basically, if you found The Look of Love on 7in vinyl in a jumble sale and discovered that Slow was the original Bacharach/Hal David-penned B-side, you wouldn&apos;t blink. It&apos;s that good, that classy. She has another song called Aretha that, as tributes to the Queen of Soul go, isn&apos;t quite up there with Scritti Politti&apos;s but matches Sheryl Crow&apos;s latest Memphian incursion. Finally there&apos;s Long Long Day, with its line about wishing she was in Rolling Stone, which for some reason strikes us as a brilliantly 1972 thing to say. Rumer \u2013 formerly of folk-indie band La Honda, who did a nice version of the Flaming Lips&apos; Moth in the Incubator and had a lovely song about a Tokyo ladyboy called, well, Tokyo Lady Boy \u2013 is the best act of her kind that we&apos;ve heard in ages. If we were Jann Wenner, we&apos;d put her on the cover tomorrow. The buzz: &quot;Slow is a relaxing melody about unrequited love that&apos;s a great listen for those of us who need to unwind after a long day at work&quot; \u2013 Beauty and the Dirt. The truth: She&apos;s more than a new discovery, but it&apos;ll take a miracle to convert critical acclaim into sales. Most likely to: Piss off Diane Birch something rotten. Least likely to: Take Angie Dickenson&apos;s role in a remake of Police Woman (oblique Bacharach reference ahoy!). What to buy: Her debut album, Seasons of My Soul, is released by Atlantic this autumn, preceded by the single Slowon 30 August. File next to: Carole King, Karen Carpenter, Laura Nyro, Judee Sill.

You wake up one morning as a street artist known to few outside the aficionados of Britain&apos;s urban art scene, and go to bed as the man whose work the new prime minister, for his first official visit to Washington, chose to present to the president of the United States. &quot;It&apos;s quite mad, really,&quot; says Eine (real name Ben Flynn), whose early creative life as a particularly productive graffiti artist earned him 15 or 20 arrests, five convictions for criminal damage and, on the final occasion, a narrow escape from jail. &quot;But it&apos;s OK. It&apos;s not the kind of recognition I seek or get every day, but Cameron seems quite a positive kind of guy and Obama&apos;s a dude. I would probably have had issues if it had been for Bush.&quot; But the gift \u2013 and attendant publicity \u2013 should bring Eine more than recognition. Described by the Nelly Duff gallery in London&apos;s Columbia Road, which has been selling his work for the last five years, as &quot;a screen printer of technical brilliance . . . one of the hardest-working and most prolific street artists working today&quot;, he can also expect a considerable improvement in his income. &quot;We&apos;ve had very significant interest already,&quot; says the gallery&apos;s Cassius Colman. &quot;He had a fairly large fan base among people who know about street art, but now . . . If people were considering a purchase, this will push them over the edge. I&apos;d say we were probably looking at a tenfold increase in his sales.&quot; Eine, 39, is best known in and around Shoreditch in the East End of London, where he has worked for several years with his close friend, the elusive Banksy. &quot;They&apos;re the best of mates, old friends,&quot; says Lindsay Alkin, manager of the Artrepublic gallery in Brighton, which also sells the artist&apos;s work. &quot;Banksy would do one side of the street and Ben the other, and Ben did all Banksy&apos;s screenprints. He&apos;s one of the founders of the whole street-art movement. But this is really going to broaden his audience: we&apos;ve had a great deal of interest this morning. And we&apos;ve sold one of his originals.&quot; Eine last came to the media&apos;s attention when he persuaded the shopkeepers of Middlesex Street in Spitalfields to allow him to paint the entire alphabet, in his trademark vibrant, cheerful colours, on their closed security shutters. Elsewhere in London, his letters spell out whole words \u2013 &quot;Exciting&quot; or &quot;Scary&quot; or &quot;Vandalism&quot; \u2013 on walls and buildings, or just stand on their own: a solitary &quot;e&quot; or &quot;a&quot; adorning a shopfront or telecomm box. There&apos;s a Googlemap of his London work, but similar typographical totems can also be seen in Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles and Paris, as well as Newcastle and Hastings, where he now lives. &quot;For me, it&apos;s mostly about having stuff on the street,&quot; Eine says. &quot;You&apos;re walking down the street, you do it every day, and suddenly there&apos;s something that wasn&apos;t there yesterday: something bright and cheerful and different. It might stay there for a year; maybe it will disappear. But you know, I have a family, I have a mortgage, I have to make a living. So I do the screenprints too.&quot; (Among the cognoscenti, Eine is widely admired as an expert screenprinter, and holds the unofficial world record for the number of colours across an edition: 77 across 200 prints.) It wasn&apos;t easy, once Downing Street had called to say Samantha Cameron really liked his work, to find an Eine suitable for a US president. &quot;A lot of my paintings have quite negative meanings, but painted in a bright and cheerful way,&quot; Eine says. &quot;All of those had to be written off straight away; you can&apos;t give something that might be misinterpreted.&quot; Eventually, he remembered his painting of the letters TWENTYFIRSTCENTURYCITY, laid out on black, in seven rows. &quot;I emailed it, and they said yes straight away,&quot; Eine says. &quot;It works pretty well, I think.&quot; Will he sell more work now? &quot;I would imagine, people being what they are, that some more of them might want a piece of it.

But Britain&apos;s men and women in far-flung outposts are being ordered to work harder to promote trade, business and investment. Ethics may not be abandoned, but exports and contracts are now in, big time. Taking its cue from David Cameron&apos;s wish to &quot;refashion&quot; Britain&apos;s external relations, the Foreign Office today confirmed the appointment of Simon Fraser, a top trade expert, as its permanent under-secretary \u2013 its senior civil servant. Colleagues described Fraser, 52, as a &quot;platinum-level&quot; technocrat whose experience in Paris, Brussels and in senior Whitehall jobs will help him galvanise his department into putting UK plc first. It still seems unlikely, however, that any more than a handful of business people will be appointed as full-time ambassadors in the way that is common practice in the US. William Hague, the foreign secretary, set out his stall in a speech in Tokyo last week, promising to &quot;inject a new commercialism into the work of our foreign office and into the definition of \u2026 international objectives, ensuring that we develop the strong political relationships which will help British business to thrive overseas&quot;. Hague followed this up with a speech to ambassadors at their annual conference and then with a message to every Foreign Office employee. These have clearly been noted. &quot;Every submission and every brief for a visit now has to include the commercial interests,&quot; one senior official told the Guardian today. &quot;The emphasis is new and genuine. It&apos;s being put into the bloodstream.&quot; Economic issues, said another King Charles Street insider, are now as important as politics. &quot;This organisation still culturally believes that the most important part of its work is strategic diplomacy, state-to-state relations and political analysis for ministers. That is going to shift. We are not starting from a zero base, but we are going to supercharge this activity.&quot; Hague will expect to be briefed on tariff barriers, regulatory issues and business when he meets his ambassadors in future. Promoting British business has been a core mission of the Foreign Office for decades, though Cameron&apos;s approach reflects the search for value for money in strained financial times. Old-timers insist that the days when generalist diplomats could look down their noses at trade are long past. Lavish hospitality, playing croquet and sipping Pimm&apos;s on manicured lawns are no longer central to representing Britain. &quot;I am sorry that David Cameron feels he has to lead on an issue that is purely populist,&quot; complained Sir Brian Crowe, a former Foreign Office economics chief and ambassador to Austria. &quot;British diplomats have been involved in commercial work with growing intensity for the past 20 years. Ambassadors need to be politically savvy, provide big-picture advice \u2013 and not try to sell widgets or services to people.&quot; Others see sense behind the new approach. &quot;When I joined 25 years ago, everyone said commercial work was the way to go,&quot; said a still-serving official who has been posted to the US, the Middle East and EU. &quot;It was absolutely the flavour of the month. But it&apos;s not been so for the last 10 years. There are senior people in the office who say it&apos;s a waste of time and that the best way to help UK firms is to use ambassadorial influence to open doors to secure contracts.&quot; Sir Ivor Roberts, formerly ambassador to Italy and Ireland, welcomed Cameron&apos;s shift. &quot;In the seven or eight years of the last government we were actively discouraged on instructions from the Treasury \u2013 under Gordon Brown \u2013 from export promotion. If we had followed [the instruction] to the letter we would have broken off work trying to promote British companies overseas. We were told that the only thing that mattered was inward investment.&quot; It seemed &quot;absurd&quot; when he was in Rome to walk away from the effort he put into working on British Gas operations in Italy. In Dublin in the early 2000s, Roberts built up the embassy&apos;s commercial section at a time when Ireland was the UK&apos;s fourth largest export market. But the section was later shut down. &quot;Everyone in it was sacked or reposted,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;It was so depressing and counter-intuitive.&quot; The bulk of the day-to-day work of trade and export promotion is done by UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), jointly run by the Foreign Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Sir Andrew Cahn, its chief executive, sits on the Foreign Office board, as do three outside businessmen in non-executive positions. But diplomats admit that UKTI has long been seen as a &quot;Cinderella&quot; department which does not advance their career prospects. It prides itself, though, on providing value for money \u2013 generating \u00a319 for every \u00a31 of its budget. Defence sales are to be a priority. Liam Fox, the defence secretary, has described increasing arms exports as an &quot;essential aim&quot;. The renewed emphasis on arms sales \u2013 pushed by Margaret Thatcher, architect of al-Yamamah, the huge and controversial arms-for-oil deal with Saudi Arabia \u2013 will be welcomed by armed forces chiefs, the MoD and defence companies. Fox announced at the Farnborough Air Show this week that Britain had secured \u00a37.2bn of new arms sales last year \u2013 a whopping 70% increase over the 2008 figure. For all the &quot;new commercialism&quot;, there seems little chance of many business people becoming ambassadors. The Foreign Office says that Hague, like his predecessors, &quot;reserves the right&quot; to make a small number of political appointments. But none of the handful of British ambassadors who come from outside the diplomatic service have been appointed because of their business acumen or experience. The difficulty of finding a new trade minister suggests that even top Whitehall salaries are no match for the private sector. Mandarins have been here before. Robin Cook, pursuing his &quot;ethical foreign policy&quot; as well as trade, talked of recruiting outsiders, but never managed it. And no one wants to see businessmen chosen for political reasons. &quot;Look at what the Americans do \u2013 and do not emulate it,&quot; warned Crowe. &quot;They appoint people who contribute to party funds and then get sent to sexy posts like London where they are useless both commercially and politically.&quot; Embassy coups From loos to conflicts What I would call the Ferrero Rocher side of diplomacy, though sometimes glamorous, can be excruciatingly dull. At the risk of overdramatisation, I will quote a few examples where I feel I earned my wages ... \u2022 Persuading the local government in eastern Yemen (which was then a British protectorate) to install toilets in preparation for a visit by some VIPs from the UN. \u2022 Passing a secret message from the Luxembourg monetary authority to the Bank of England about the need for tighter regulation of the BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International), which collapsed soon afterwards. \u2022 Interceding with a Saudi prince to get a British lorry driver&apos;s flogging sentence commuted. \u2022 Obtaining the release of a CIA double agent&apos;s British sidekick who had been tortured by the Libyan revolutionary committees. \u2022 Leading a seminar on export promotion in the Russian ministry of foreign economic relations immediately after the end of the Soviet Union. \u2022 Nobbling the Greek minister of foreign affairs in the middle of the night to urge restraint in a military confrontation with Turkey that looked like ending in shooting. It is worth mentioning that, of these examples, only the Luxembourg business was conducted mainly in English. I was dismayed to learn recently that neither the Middle East director in the Foreign Office nor two of our ambassadors in important Gulf countries can speak Arabic.

Yet only three million of those sales were outside Japan. Now, with the latest instalment, Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies, its creators are determined to finally recreate their domestic success abroad. Dragon Quest was created in 1986 by Yuji Horii, who has remained its designer and writer ever since. It&apos;s an RPG responsible for the premise that so many followed: take on your role, travel and battle to amass experience points and gold, exchange these for levelling-up and equipment \u2013 allowing further travel and battle \u2013 the cycle giving impetus to the plot. Had this formula been all there was, DQ may have remained a footnote, but it offered much more. &quot;Twenty-four years ago the Dragon Quest series didn&apos;t exist,&quot; explains Horii in Tokyo, before the game&apos;s European launch. &quot;Role play in those days in Japan was for geeks. At that point, with the Nintendo Entertainment System, people were saying: &apos;Regular people aren&apos;t going to play Dragon Quest.&apos; We set out to change that.&quot; He did, spectacularly. The series stands out through its grandiose plots, told with attention to detail and a focus on the minutiae of the players&apos; role within them. With its inventive, emotional, interaction between clever, humorous characters and a strong sense of continuity \u2013 from storylines to the ubiquitous slime monsters and the soundtracks, all scored by classically trained conductor and composer Koichi Sugiyama. They&apos;re also time-consuming and tough, but accessible too, a feature producer Ryutaro Ichimura hopes they have emphasised in DQIX \u2013 which stands alone, demanding no prior knowledge of the franchise: &quot;We made it with the idea that anyone can pick it up and enjoy it. There are a lot of people in Japan who had never played Dragon Quest before and IX was their first experience. We had a lot of good feedback from that and we&apos;re hoping it will happen overseas too.&quot; Key to whether it does, of course, is why it hasn&apos;t already. The very challenge itself may be partly responsible. Horii theorises: &quot;The Japanese character is more predisposed to doing lots of small tasks to prepare to take the next step in gaming, to perform a lot of little steps before you can take the next big step to the next level. That&apos;s something they get a lot of satisfaction from doing.&quot; Sugiyama sees this manifested beyond video games: &quot;The Japanese enjoy and play a lot more thinking games. There is Japanese chess: &apos;Shogi&apos; and &apos;Go&apos; which is a military strategy game\u2026 Dragon Quest is a thinking game.&quot; Yet he believes the central theme should appeal universally: &quot;It&apos;s in the first person. You are the hero. You experience the story,&quot; says Horii. They&apos;ve given this latest version every chance of crossing borders. The game is magnificent: its move on to DS sharpening gameplay and interface. Playing as a guardian angel fallen from on high after a heavenly earthquake (a kind of gentle, Nintendo-friendly G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung), you are tasked with regaining your wings and thus order above. This sets the scene for multiple quests, often short, almost vignettes by DQ standards. They&apos;re imaginative, fun and, as always, character-driven, the clever dialogue pacing the gameplay. But the real impact is in multiplayer. Four can play within a single game entirely independently of one another \u2013 but a clever tag system means when battle begins you are summoned to the fight. This is a huge development for DQ. It means players can roam a shared world playing solo and yet still interact if they choose, as with the online open-world genre \u2013 play the entire game alone or dip in and out with friends. Or, indeed, anyone nearby \u2013 at Tokyo&apos;s electronics and gaming centre, the Akihabara district, authorities have erected barriers to control the gathering of DQIX players who have taken to the communal aspect with abandon. It should be enough. The refinements are perfect for the franchise and it deserves a wider audience. Indeed for RPG fans it positively demands to be played \u2013 preconceptions be damned. Horii insists the rationale has always been simple: &quot;If the game is good, people will play \u2013 and we&apos;re just trying to make a good game.&quot; Twenty-four years on, DQIX really should add up to magic numbers in the west."}, {"sentences": ["Now, as globalisation tightens its grip, they increasingly look the same as cabs on the road from Tokyo to Toronto, except for that great asplash of colour."], "tags": ["New York", "New York holidays", "US news", "World news", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-25T19:00:50Z", "title": "Is this the end of the road for New York's taxis?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/new-york-yellow-taxis", "article": "Like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, New York&apos;s sedan-style yellow taxis are iconic symbols of the city.

Climate change and the recession are the unlikely killers of the Crown Vic: as the economy soured and petrol prices rose, money-conscious cabbies turned away from the gas-guzzling model in favour of hybrid taxis, introduced by New York&apos;s green-minded mayor, Michael Bloomberg, in 2005. There are now 3,480 hybrids out of 13,237 yellow taxis on the road and, under new city rules prohibiting taxis over five-years-old, sedans will have disappeared by 2015. Its slow demise is lamented in both the front and back seats. &quot;I feel sad about it,&quot; says cabbie Edison Capa, 42. &quot;This type of car is designed for this type of job \u2013 it&apos;s fast, comfortable and has a great big trunk.&quot; &quot;These new cars are garbage,&quot; barks 81-year-old attorney Murray Landsman as he climbs into Capa&apos;s cab in downtown Brooklyn. &quot;I don&apos;t get in them unless I can&apos;t avoid it. They&apos;re too small and uncomfortable. And if you want to fit three [people] in the back \u2013 forget about it.&quot; The Crown Vic&apos;s fall from grace is also symptomatic of something bigger. Immortalised in countless movies and TV shows such as Taxi driver, Woody Allen&apos;s Manhattan, and Sex and the City, New York&apos;s unmistakable yellow cab models \u2013 from the instantly recognisable &quot;checker taxi&quot; onwards \u2013 have always exuded American culture and power. Now, as globalisation tightens its grip, they increasingly look the same as cabs on the road from Tokyo to Toronto, except for that great asplash of colour.

No technology can transmit the sound of a\u00a0real orchestra or the immediacy of theatre, can it? If you haven&apos;t shared a room with your favourite band, you can&apos;t really call yourself a fan. Even giant plasma screens and Blu-ray players cannot properly display those films that, everyone agrees, &quot;you have to see in the cinema&quot;. And everyone is probably right. But they overrate some aspects of the live experience, too. Having spent money going out, we all want to believe we had a good time, if only so we don&apos;t resent the journey home. A certain cachet attaches itself to the exclusivity of a live event: naturally, those lucky people who got tickets like to say what a magical experience it was. Yet for everybody else \u2013 those who live too far away, or who can&apos;t afford it, or who have small children who need putting to bed (that&apos;s me) \u2013 that magic simply isn&apos;t available. Now, through webcasts and other kinds of virtual participation, there are alternatives. Nothing is ever quite the same enjoyed through a computer or a\u00a0phone, of course. But it is certainly convenient. It can still be good or very good; sometimes, as I found over the course of a week of going out by staying in, it can even be better. Monday: theatre In my fruitless search for a play being webcast on a Monday night, I stumble instead on to something much more exciting: a group called the Avatar Repertory Theatre who perform in Second Life, the virtual world in which anonymous users take the form of animated characters. The ART do not have a show tonight (they work Fridays), but Second Life is vast, and free to download, so I explore it for other options. Moments later, I am wandering baffled around Welcome Island in my guise as &quot;Leo Soir&quot;, and I\u00a0see a young man in a tight white T-shirt. Our chat goes like this. Leo Soir: &quot;Hello.&quot; T-shirt man: &quot;hello. do you like sex&quot;. Leo Soir: &quot;No.&quot; (Silence.) Leo Soir: &quot;Do you know where the theatres are?&quot; (T-shirt man disappears.) Already, I feel that I am learning. Fortunately, the next thing I find is the search facility, which brings up The Rose Theatre, Angel Manor. This is closed when I teleport there, but next door is an art gallery, so I wander in. A selection of banal paintings hang in the first room (doleful bride, doleful crow, doleful ballerina, etc), but the next room is more interesting. Here are swirling multicoloured spheres, poems on parchment, rings of singing mushrooms: they look like somebody&apos;s screensaver, but by now I am so immersed in Second Life that they look miraculous. Behind me, two women discuss the work. We get talking about my project, and one of them wants to know if I &quot;do role play&quot;. Dodging this, I ask if they know anything about theatre on Second Life. &quot;Everything is acting on here,&quot; says the second woman. &quot;All of sl [Second Life] is a stage.&quot; The first has been to some events, and says the site hosts opera, dance and burlesque \u2013 though anything that involves the physical movement of characters is\u00a0technically very challenging to construct. &quot;It requires multi-person dance HUDS and complex scripting,&quot; she explains. Besides, most of what she&apos;s seen, as if I couldn&apos;t guess, is role play. Which is a bit like improvised theatre, I suggest hopefully. &quot;Organized improv! yes!&quot; she says. &quot;that&apos;s the way to describe it :)&quot; She has a friend who might be able to help, so we teleport together into a space-age shop. The friend is preparing a performance of the\u00a0Song of Solomon, and is about to go and finish building the stage. She hands me a virtual press release: &quot;To my knowledge, no other group has attempted to bring bible stories to virtual life in a staged production,&quot; it\u00a0says. The first woman starts talking to me through my speakers \u2013 she sounds American, in her 50s. &quot;You can do all kinds of bad stuff in places like this,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t know anything about that shit though.&quot; Typing a nervous &quot;thanks for the help&quot;, I teleport away from her, to a poetry event at the West of Ireland Library and Cultural Centre. The auditorium is empty, but filled with a rich voice reading TS Eliot. Gratefully, I take my seat. Tuesday: pop It wasn&apos;t until tea time that I found out what tonight&apos;s entertainment would be. This is one of the features of the iTunes festival, which runs throughout July: they promise to stream some of their gigs free to an app on your phone, but they won&apos;t tell you which ones until the last minute. It&apos;s a clever trick. I haven&apos;t travelled into town, I haven&apos;t met friends for a drink, I haven&apos;t had to queue. I&apos;m not even much of a fan of Florence and the Machine, whose acoustic set is on the playlist. Yet here I am, sitting in my office, staring at a graphic on a tiny screen, which promises that Lauren Pritchard, the warm-up act, &quot;will take to the stage shortly&quot;, and I am very excited about it. Then Pritchard does appear, and her timid opening exchanges with the audience \u2013 about today&apos;s weather, her bottle of water and so on \u2013 heighten the sense of occasion even further. When my Wi-Fi signal stutters momentarily, I am close to panic. It returns just as the musicians are readying themselves, and at last we are off. The problem is the music. No amount of mise-en-scene is going to hide the ordinariness of Pritchard&apos;s songs. At the beginning of the third one, I realise that, if I were there, I would have started peering awkwardly around the audience by now. My office contains better distractions, however. There is a newspaper cutting I haven&apos;t read yet, some expenses that need claiming . . . actually, this place is a bit of a mess. I&apos;d better tidy. When I get a phone call, it is a guilty pleasure to put Pritchard and\u00a0her sincerity on pause. Her paying audience, the saps, have no\u00a0such choice. When she finishes, I join in with the applause, mostly out of guilt. And now we are waiting again, this time for Florence and the Machine. Having been through this once already, the excitement doesn&apos;t tingle as it did. Indeed when she finally appears, and the crowd go wild, it is actually rather alienating. Now that something truly big is happening, I feel I am missing out. By the time Florence yodels her way into You&apos;ve Got the Love, harp plinking away, I am actually annoyed with her. But then I have been staring at my phone for more than two hours. Wednesday: dance I am no expert when it comes to dance, and I don&apos;t mind admitting it. But I have spoken to people who are, and they assure me that no other art form works less well on a computer. A sense\u00a0of space and gravity, the three-dimensional physicality of the dancers, their power and effort: none of these things, they say, will survive the transfer to a computer screen. So my expectations are low. None of the major ballet theatres webcast their shows, that much becomes clear. And though there are several amateur dance groups around the world who do, it is hard to find any that are live right now. Then, just as I am losing hope, I see one. It is a Japanese breakdance competition on ustream.tv, filmed with\u00a0a single camera from a late-night basement somewhere in Tokyo. Eight young people are standing in a circle, surrounded by a cross-legged crowd. And, as they take turns in the centre, it&apos;s clear that they are very good indeed. Despite being constantly offered a Used Machinery Auction and a Great Source of Wood Patterns by pop-up ads that clearly do not know me very well, I soon find that I am nodding my head. Indeed, I am gasping along with the audience at each acrobatic spin or freakishly perfect robot impression, and I feel sure that the other 283 people watching online must be doing\u00a0the same thing. Certainly, the comments feed is rolling rapidly, its many exclamation marks the only characters I understand. This is definitely a &quot;live&quot; experience, I decide, if a somewhat voyeuristic one. Breakdancing might just be the perfect art form to watch online, precisely because no one is aiming for\u00a0anything subtle or emotive. This is raw, spectacular showing-off, the kind of thing that gets passed around on YouTube. I could watch for hours. But finally, after 45 minutes, the guy in the\u00a0red T-shirt wins, and performs a deserved dance of victory. &quot;Yo dancerz from overseas, we r gonna finish this live broadcast&quot; appears among the comments. I log off, satisfied. Later, I feel like trying something more refined, so I return to my desk at 10.30pm, hoping to find a ballet group in the US. It seems to be too early, though, because I can&apos;t. There are some recordings from California-based Anaheim Ballet, which are impressive but bland, but these lead me to an old clip of Swan Lake danced by the Kirov. This, even to my ignorant eyes, is exceptional. At the very least, online viewing is good enough to show me that these dancers are better than anybody else I&apos;ve watched. It also offers this advantage: from the close-ups of the ballerina&apos;s face as she holds her legs in a perfect half past 11, I can see that she knows she&apos;s exceptional, too. She would do very well in Tokyo. Thursday: opera Enjoyable as my week has been, I can no longer deny that something has been missing: company. Until now, my wife Sarah has been too tired or busy to\u00a0join me, but tonight the promise of\u00a0opera has reeled her in. Happily, I have something special lined up. New York&apos;s Metropolitan Opera provides dozens of online video and audio recordings, including many that were screened lived in cinemas around the world. Recent shows are available in HD, and you can choose whether you want subtitles, and in which language. For such a service, one has to pay. A\u00a0subscription to the MetPlayer costs $14.99 a\u00a0month, or $3.99/$4.99 per opera, though there is a seven-day free trial, too. All I\u00a0have to do is fill in my credit card details and make a mental note to\u00a0cancel in the morning. Sarah and I decide to brush up a bit. (Why else do I keep someone else&apos;s dinner jacket in my wardrobe?) After a\u00a0brief online introduction to Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Federico Fellini&apos;s 1978 production of Cavalleria Rusticana and\u00a0Pagliacci (&quot;To get both in the same\u00a0incandescent performance is to\u00a0see history,&quot; foams the Met), we are\u00a0ready. In fairness to the MetPlayer, all the technical hitches are my fault. Even on\u00a0full volume, my laptop&apos;s speakers are quieter than someone else&apos;s headphones. I\u00a0pause on the image of the conductor (a man who embraced 1978 wholeheartedly) and disentangle some external speakers, which are an\u00a0improvement. Only now we seem to be watching photographs of an opera, with a plot summary. This is confusing until we realise that it is only the MetPlayer trying to be helpful, explaining the story in advance. Except we didn&apos;t really follow it, because we were too busy trying to work out why it wasn&apos;t starting. &quot;They&apos;re all the same,&quot; Sarah,\u00a0a Covent Garden semi-regular, reassures me. &quot;There is a lady. She\u00a0dies.&quot; There is a lady; she is Italian and she\u00a0thinks her husband might be having an affair. The lady sings beautifully, too, and in her duet with another lady it is rewarding to be able to see their faces up close \u2013 although the crowd scene that follows lacks the intended sense of spectacle. Now &quot;the\u00a0brilliant Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&quot; appears. He sings beautifully, too, and\u00a0the story begins to absorb me. I am enjoying this more than I expected. Yes, the sound is terrible and\u00a0the picture nothing special; but the stream is solid, and could easily be connected to a better screen. Given that Sarah&apos;s last opera ticket cost \u00a387 (plus drinks and travel) and this is costing us nothing, I think a strong argument can be made for the MetPlayer. I calculate that, even at full\u00a0price, it need only be 4% as good as\u00a0Covent Garden to be better value. We applaud the curtain calls, which\u00a0I&apos;m glad to see included. Sarah is\u00a0getting tired, however, and suggests watching Pagliacci in bed. Miraculously, the laptop survives the transition, and we fall asleep to Domingo&apos;s historic meta-tragedy about clowns. Friday: film It is possible, of course, that the idea of\u00a0watching a film at home has already occurred to you. Many people, particularly those with fancy TVs, prefer it. What one loses in scale and atmosphere, they argue, is more than compensated for by the convenience and breadth of choice. What is hard to recreate, however, is the sense of adventure you get at a film festival, where the programme is dreamed up by a curator. Tonight I plan to watch my very own at-home film festival, curated by the Guardian&apos;s film editor, Andrew Pulver. A stickler for authenticity, he suggests a repertory cinema revival theme, drawn from a selection of films he saw at legendary flea-pit the Scala, in King&apos;s Cross, London, during a formative period in the 1980s. Once again, Sarah and I gather in front of my laptop in a darkened room. First up is William Burroughs and Antony Balch&apos;s avant-garde short Towers Open Fire, from the arts site Ubu. After a few minutes, it&apos;s clear that\u00a0being understood was not high on\u00a0Balch and Burroughs&apos;s agenda. Race\u00a0hate, spinning patterns, a man having\u00a0an orgasm, stuff about opium, repetitive bell sounds: this might have\u00a0been intoxicatingly liberated in the early 1960s, but it is only in this respect \u2013 as a relic \u2013 that it means anything to me now. &quot;It&apos;s terrible,&quot; says Sarah. &quot;I&apos;m really pleased we didn&apos;t go anywhere to see this.&quot; Next up is Derek Jarman&apos;s The Queen Is Dead, a video for the Smiths&apos; song, whose flickering non sequiturs are more beautiful than Burroughs&apos;s. This is followed by the final short, Jean Genet&apos;s notorious Un Chant d&apos;Amour from 1950. Ubu summarises the narrative thus: &quot;The plot is set in a French prison, where a prison guard takes voyeuristic pleasure in observing prisoners perform masturbatory sexual acts.&quot; Unenthused, I soon find\u00a0that the film is actually rather wonderful, a gorgeous allegory for what it was like, and perhaps is still like, to be gay in a hostile society. It looks extraordinary, like Mapplethorpe decades before Mapplethorpe. Sarah, however, is now asleep. I move to the &quot;big screen&quot; in my office for the main feature: Tod Browning&apos;s Freaks, viewable in its entirety on Google Videos. I&apos;ve heard about this famously disturbing (and career-ending) horror film from 1932, but never watched it. Now, seeing something so old stare so frankly at deformity and prejudice, I understand its power. Still, like most films with an explicit moral purpose, it is also very bad. The sound is terrible, the script and acting school-play bad, and when the &quot;freaks&quot; at last take their revenge, I find it absurd to imagine that any adult might be scared. I am glad to have finally seen it, but gladder still that my bed is not a bus ride away. In the course of a week, what have I learned? That I never knew there were so many new experiences waiting to be had in the confines of my own home. I\u00a0do wonder whether it is mostly this, the newness, that has made sampling them so much fun. But when online arts grow up \u2013 as the MetPlayer, for instance, is already beginning to \u2013 I\u00a0think it could become a habit.

Sunday was kids&apos; day, which translated into a bias toward SpongeBob SquarePants and Phineas and Ferb. By a staggering coincidence, many day passes remained unsold, and ticket touts were spotted for the first time hawking their wares outside the convention centre. In the absence of any of the big movie presentations which, though maligned by fundamentalist comic-book devotees, have widened Comic-Con&apos;s appeal and audience, the spotlight shifted to panels for two television series: Smallville and Glee. (I like to think someone devilish in the programming department slapped Glee on the schedule purely to wind up all the comic-book purists. Here&apos;s hoping someone has the perversity to book the Jonas Brothers for next year.) These panels served up so many spoilers that there seems little point now in the programmes being screened: we know every twist and kink that&apos;s coming. I won&apos;t compound the error by repeating the surprises here, but all this could present a viable way forward in these frugal times: forget about lavishing millions of dollars on making the shows, and simply do the panels instead. I dropped in on a different panel, Women of Marvel, where I think I started to annoy some of the panellists by pressing them on a question that kept being left unanswered. The very existence of a Women of Marvel panel indicated either that the experience of women working in comics was radically distinct from that of their male counterparts, or that the tenor of their writing and drawing was somehow different. On the question of the former, the colourist Laura Martin (whose bright-as-a-button colouring lights up Brian Michael Bendis&apos;s New Avengers stories) put me straight. The digital age was a blessing, she pointed out, because &quot;it&apos;s anonymous. We&apos;re jpegs, we&apos;re scripts sent in, so gender doesn&apos;t really make a difference.&quot; Marjorie M Liu (whose work on Black Widow and Dark Wolverine proved popular with the audience) later admitted that my question, about whether the comics industry was still a predominantly male world, was a pet peev of hers, since neither she nor the other panellists had experienced any sexism or hostility. I&apos;m pleased to hear that, but I still wanted to know why we needed a Women in Marvel panel; Martin replied that the desire to encourage women to consider a career in comics, rather than assuming it to be a boy&apos;s club, was precisely why she participated in such events. If that didn&apos;t seem sufficient to justify the demarcation between male and female, the discussion did raise the interesting subject of how to make women feel comfortable entering a comic-book store. Female customers said they were patronised or ignored by male shop assistants, while women working in comic shops themselves could sense the mistrust in (male) clientele whenever they tried to recommend something. There was also some excitement surrounding the long-awaited film of Runaways (one of the comic&apos;s writers, Kathryn Immonen, was in attendance), which may at last be heading for the screen in the safe hands of Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas, Nick &amp; Norah&apos;s Infinite Playlist). The panel became more of a fan/writer love-in than a debate, which is always a risk at Comic-Con, but at least everyone who attended received a super-spiffy, limited edition Black Cat skin for the iPhone. Awesome, eh? All I needed to do after that was to find the panel which was giving away iPhones. Women in Marvel was a low-key end to my first Comic-Con, but the past four days had already thrown up a healthy share of oddball highlights. Here&apos;s a brief selection: Best sneak footage: There were excerpts from Tron: Legacy, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, Cowboys &amp; Aliens, The Green Lantern and a five-minute chunk of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, among others. The most promising thing I saw, though, was the prologue to Priest (the first Tokyopop graphic novel to be filmed). The movie continues Paul Bettany&apos;s unexpected detour into the religious-horror-mystery sub-genre (see also Legion and The Reckoning), but it is Genndy Tartakovsky&apos;s gory animated introduction that is sure to attract the lion&apos;s share of attention. Tartakovsky was very funny on the matter of instructing his team of animators, hot from The Princess and the Frog, in the business of decapitations and dismemberments. Most candid celebrity confession: Seth Rogen, who joined the Paul panel (he provides the voice of the eponymous alien, and gives a motion-capture performance), reflected on his fondest Comic-Con memory \u2013 the time he smoked a joint with Method Man and illustrator Ed Brubaker. Then there was Paul Bettany admitting that he stopped working out as soon as he&apos;d finished shooting Priest: &quot;I simply can&apos;t keep it up unless someone&apos;s paying me a lot of money, that&apos;s the fucking truth,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Since the film ended I&apos;ve been working on my beer and cheese skills and they&apos;re coming along very nicely.&quot; Most off-colour comment: Michelle Rodriguez at the Battle: Los Angeles panel, whose response to a fan asking whether she would consider trying lighter material was: &quot;Oh, you mean get raped and win an Oscar?&quot; What was that all about? Best discovery: At the risk of attracting a slew of comments berating me for not having come across it before, I was thrilled to get into Leviathan, an attempt to revive the illustrated novel. Written by Scott Westerfeld, the series is peppered with richly textured illustrations (giant jellyfish, walking tanks) by Keith Thompson, which his co-author described perfectly as &quot;Victorian manga&quot;. My best night: It would have been good enough just watching Edgar Wright&apos;s wham-bam comedy Scott Pilgrim vs the World, which took over every corner of this year&apos;s Comic-Con, but the packed screening at San Diego&apos;s gorgeous art deco Balboa theatre was made that bit more special by the spectacles which bookended it. Before the film, we were treated to DJs and an on-stage pillow fight. After the credits, the screen rose to reveal the band Metric (who, along with Beck and Broken Social Scene, have provided songs for the movie) all set up and ready to storm through a five-song set. Best costume: You get sick of them after a day or two, and the sight of the pink Power Ranger chatting to Daredevil as they stand on line for a macchiato becomes positively humdrum. But every now and then you&apos;re jolted out of your complacency. That happened to me twice yesterday. The first time was seeing someone not only dressed as Stan Smith from American Dad, but wearing facial prosthetics of an Oscar-winning standard to render his chin dramatically enlarged. Then I was crossing the convention floor when I noticed a teenage Robin, Batman&apos;s ward and sidekick, in a spiffy gold-and-red outfit. I dressed as Robin all the time as a child \u2013 my grandmother ran up my costume in the kitchen on her sewing machine \u2013 and seeing a 21st-century version was oddly emotional for me. I might even have considered dressing up myself next year, if the sight of a middle-aged Robin were not creepier than a dozen Pinheads and Hellboys."}, {"sentences": ["London now raises just 7% of its local needs from its own taxes, against 50% in New York and 80% in Tokyo."], "tags": ["London", "Boris Johnson", "Tax and spending", "UK news", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2010-07-29T19:30:45Z", "title": "Big spender Boris should spend a little less on Londoners like me | Simon Jenkins", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/29/boris-johnson-london-spending-cuts", "article": "The Tory arts spokesman, Ed Vaizey, was strolling home one night before the election when he was suddenly met by a gang of hoodies. They dragged him into an alley, slammed his head against a wall and told him never, ever to reintroduce museum charges. They then broke his fingers and said he\u00a0should &quot;tell that George Osborne he gets the same&quot;. They knew where his children lived. A petrified Vaizey stammered out a promise that he and Osborne would treat &quot;free entry as iconic&quot;. So they did. They had just had their first encounter with London&apos;s arts mafia. But appeasing the powerful seldom yields peace of mind. Another gang, the Treasury, was already furious at the coalition ringfencing the NHS, overseas aid and the Olympics. This was another case of weak ministers being mugged by a metropolitan lobby \u2013 and someone would have to pay. Meanwhile lurking behind the muggers was London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson. He champions free museum entry and a general exemption from all cuts, since the capital has a &quot;special status as an engine for growth \u2026 Its economy is bigger than those of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the East Midlands combined&quot;. He wants a ringfence round the entire capital, woven of taxpayer gold. To any provincials who complain of unfairness, the mayor says of London&apos;s largesse, &quot;any diminishing of it will be to the detriment of the entire country&quot;. As goes London, so goes the nation. Trickle-down is alive and living in City Hall. In recent months Johnson has fiercely defended the high-cost, \u00a39bn version of the Olympics. He has defended the \u00a312bn Crossrail project in addition to a multibillion-pound tube upgrade programme. He called any threat to Crossrail &quot;madness&quot;, any cut in housing subsidy &quot;insane&quot;, and any cut in police numbers &quot;barking&quot;. He has demanded no taxes for non-doms and no super-taxes for bankers. Last week he opened two new cycle lanes that succeeded in costing \u00a343m. The mayor is filling London streets with electronic bays for an exotic cycle-sharing scheme. He is blowing \u00a350m by shrinking the congestion charge zone. He has rescued the senseless London Development Agency. He has refused to cut back on the 2012 games, even salvaging the unfundable Olympic Village. He is bidding both for the football World Cup and a new airport in the Thames estuary. He is the wildest of old-style big spenders. There is no doubt London will take a hit from reductions in public spending, directed principally at bureaucratic overheads. The assault on quangos and on such extravagances as management consultants, privatisation lawyers, advertisers, conferences and hospitality will hurt the capital. But the experience of past recessions is that London is resilient. It has already done well from the weak pound and from staycationing, with theatres and entertainment showing record takings in 2009. Financial services are far from down and out, surging to pre-crash levels of activity and profit. Commercial property is healthy, and London house prices have regained their former buoyancy. Plutocratic flats are rising over Knightsbridge and along the south bank of the Thames. Almost every road in the capital is being expensively reconstructed. London has money to burn, and is burning it. The transport secretary, Philip Hammond, probably spoke for the rest of the nation when he remarked recently that, &quot;there is a feeling, justified or unjustified, that London gets\u00a0a very good deal&quot; from taxpayers. When he added that &quot;public money is\u00a0better spent on maintenance of existing infrastructure than on new projects&quot;, he was sending a clear signal that the game is up. As a lifelong Londoner I am acutely aware of the good fortune with which my home town is blessed. As a provincial traveller, I am equally aware how provincial cities have squandered money on urban renewal that has merely desecrated their centres and weakened their identity and vitality. Britain would still benefit from an architectural &quot;truth and reconciliation commission&quot; to atone for the civic horrors of the 1970s and 1980s. But London&apos;s good fortune does not qualify it for special treatment. The proclaimed engine of its prosperity, banking, was overwhelmingly the cause of the collapse in public finances. It was also the overwhelming beneficiary of the subsequent state handout. Why should these bankers get their galleries for nothing, and their theatre and opera subsidised at the expense of the rest of the nation? Why should the Tate in London be free when Cornish yokels must pay \u00a35.75 to visit the Tate St Ives? The London behemoths on which Johnson wants millions spent \u2013 tubes, airports, museums, sports stadiums \u2013 are beyond the dreams of provincial Britain. That they are &quot;iconic&quot; merely means that powerful middle-class lobbies are behind them. It is an open secret that Transport for London strategists have long been sceptical of\u00a0Crossrail. When he left in April 2009,\u00a0TfL&apos;s then boss, Tim O&apos;Toole, pleaded with colleagues to concentrate on upgrading the tube, fearing that London would end the next decade with years of Crossrail chaos still ahead,\u00a0while the rest of the undercapitalised network degenerated. Johnson was half-persuaded of this, until the construction industry lobby told him Crossrail was a virility symbol and he capitulated. Hammond should kill the project forthwith. Johnson&apos;s spendthrift approach to public expenditure is because in 2012, he will probably face a challenge from Ken Livingstone. This Rip Van Winkle of British politics is already gaily campaigning on his old platform of opposing &quot;Tory cuts&quot;. Johnson is desperate to avoid being tarred with that Thatcherite brush. There is a straightforward way out of this bind. It was put forward by LSE&apos;s Tony Travers and myself in these pages last year. London now raises just 7% of its local needs from its own taxes, against 50% in New York and 80% in Tokyo. It should be empowered to raise its own revenue. This cause has been taken up by Johnson&apos;s own policy director, Anthony Browne, who this month pointed out that &quot;London is the most fiscally infantilised big city on earth&quot;. While it yields gargantuan revenue to the state, its own taxation, based on static property bands, has no buoyancy. Browne rightly argues that the mayor should be pleading not with the government but with his own electors for cash. He\u00a0cannot be excused from central government cuts, but he should be free to raise compensating resources from London&apos;s taxpayers. That is the route open to most mayors abroad. The best scheme would be the one floated by Sir Kenneth Calman for the Scottish parliament. It would cut London&apos;s gross income tax by, say, 10% in year one, and cut grants to London from central government by an equivalent amount. It would then be left\u00a0 to Johnson and borough leaders to make up the 10% from whatever mix of local income tax, council tax or business rates they chose. If they wanted to go over 10% from local income tax to pay for Crossrail or whatever, so be it. Londoners \u2013 indeed residents anywhere \u2013 should be entitled to relief\u00a0from the pain now afflicting the nation. They should not expect others to pay for it. They should be able to pay\u00a0for it themselves."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I eat lots of oily fish, like mackerel and sardines, I&apos;ve never smoked and I hardly ever drink,&quot; she adds between mouthfuls at a restaurant in the elderly shopping and entertainment neighbourhood of Sugamo, in Tokyo.", "Yet at 81, she is the picture of health as she shrugs off Tokyo&apos;s stifling humidity and sips \u2013 of all things \u2013 a Coke outside McDonald&apos;s. &quot;I eat just about anything, but I draw the line at western food,&quot; she says, adding that regular exercise comes in the form of outings with friends in Sugamo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Ageing", "Health", "World news", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-01T14:09:39Z", "title": "Japan's women toast their own health as life expectancy rises again", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/01/japan-women-life-expectancy-rises", "article": "Eriko Maeda could be forgiven for succumbing to occasional thoughts about her own mortality. But even as she prepares to turn 70, she has every reason to expect she&apos;ll be around for at least another two decades. Aside from an exemplary low-fat diet and regular exercise, she has one other important factor on her side in the longevity stakes: her nationality. Japanese women have enjoyed the longest life expectancy in the world for a quarter of a century, according to government figures. In 2009, they could expect to live, on average, a record 86.4 years \u2013 up almost five months from the previous year \u2013 followed by women in Hong Kong and France. Japanese men, meanwhile, added almost four months to their life expectancy to 79:5 years, although they fell from fourth to fifth place in the global rankings behind Qatar, Hong Kong, Iceland and Switzerland. Experts attribute Japan&apos;s extraordinary longevity statistics to a traditional diet of fish, rice and simmered vegetables, easy access to healthcare and a comparatively high standard of living in old age. If Maeda is typical, then Japanese women will continue to outlive the rest of us. &quot;I never eat meat and avoid fried food ... with the occasional exception,&quot; she says as she nods, a little guiltily, at her lunch of rice and a pair of tempura prawns. &quot;I eat lots of oily fish, like mackerel and sardines, I&apos;ve never smoked and I hardly ever drink,&quot; she adds between mouthfuls at a restaurant in the elderly shopping and entertainment neighbourhood of Sugamo, in Tokyo. Diet aside, Maeda, who lives with her son and his family, attributes her impeccable health, and the prospect of easily outliving her male peers, to a lifestyle that would shame people at least 30 years her junior. &quot;I get up at 4:30, do the washing and the rest of the housework,&quot; she says. &quot;I make a Japanese-style dinner for me and usually something western for my son&apos;s family, and I&apos;m in bed well before 9 pm.&quot; In contrast, Sachiko Yasuhara is almost blase about her diet and confesses to being a regular sake drinker. Yet at 81, she is the picture of health as she shrugs off Tokyo&apos;s stifling humidity and sips \u2013 of all things \u2013 a Coke outside McDonald&apos;s. &quot;I eat just about anything, but I draw the line at western food,&quot; she says, adding that regular exercise comes in the form of outings with friends in Sugamo. According to the health ministry, the upward trend in life expectancy is largely down to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, cardiac disorders and strokes, Japan&apos;s three biggest killers. Takao Suzuki, general director of the National Institute of Geriatrics and Gerontology in Nagoya, believes that Japan&apos;s almost perfect literacy rate is also a factor. &quot;Older people are able to consume a huge amount of health and lifestyle advice in the media,&quot; he says. &quot;Although women live longer, they experience longer periods of ill-health than men before they die because they lose bone and muscle strength more easily than men. If the government addresses that problem, Japanese women will live even longer.&quot; The health of Japan&apos;s seniors is not without risks. If left unaddressed, the greying of the population combined with the low birth rate will lead to a pension crisis, ballooning healthcare costs and a labour shortage that could endanger Japan&apos;s economic status. &quot;I can see why people like me might be a problem in the future,&quot; Yasuhara says. &quot;Look around you; there are too many old people in Japan. We need more children.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The exact meaning of the landmark tweet on Saturday by a graphic designer in Tokyo is difficult to work out as it was part of a larger conversation: &quot;So that means the barrage might come back later all at once.&quot; But his reaction to having sent the 20 billionth tweet since the microblogging site launched in July 2006 was much easier to understand."], "tags": ["Twitter", "World news", "Social networking", "Japan", "Internet", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-02T00:39:31Z", "title": "Twitter reaches 20 billion tweets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/02/twitter-20-billion-tweet", "article": "It has been accused of proliferating pointless babble online and the 20 billionth message on Twitter will have done little to rebut such criticism.

Such was indeed the burden of the 1984 film bearing that title. In the current remake, however, it&apos;s kung fu that saves the junior hero&apos;s bacon. This martial arts metamorphosis reflects more than a change of cinematic fashion. Over the decades, Hollywood&apos;s geopolitics have tracked those of its host country. In the 1980s, Japan and its dark arts were a matter of national concern: the Japanese were presenting an unexpected challenge to American economic pre-eminence. Somehow, they were not only out-competing American industries but actually gaining control of them. In 1989, Sony even bought Columbia Pictures. On screen, karate became something of a metaphor for Japan&apos;s mysterious but devastating capabilities, enthralling audiences in films ranging from Showdown in Little Tokyo to the original Karate Kid. However, in the 1990s, Japan collapsed into its lost decade of recession, and so did much of the threat it had seemed to pose. Thereafter, the movies lost their passion for karate. Now, however, China presents the US with a greater challenge than Japan ever did. The People&apos;s Republic has somehow acquired a stranglehold over America&apos;s finances; worse, it threatens to displace the country as the world&apos;s leading power. Americans are well aware of this and feel not only anxious but intimidated. Once more, it seems, a martial art is standing in on screen for the unfathomable powers of an inscrutable national adversary. Like the earlier film, the current Karate Kid shows an American youngster appropriating his enemies&apos; techniques and turning them against their malevolent practitioners. Things have, however, deteriorated since 1984. Then, matters could be happily resolved within the comforting embrace of sunny California. Then, the eponymous hero&apos;s oriental mentor was a grateful transpacific immigrant who&apos;d fought for America against the land of his fathers. This time, however, it&apos;s Americans who&apos;re the importunate immigrants. Jaden Smith&apos;s Dre Parker and his mom are fleeing Detroit, the city that&apos;s become a byword for America&apos;s economic distress, to seek a better life in thriving China. The sunny setting for decisive events has become Beijing, a glittering metropolis peopled by happy, healthy and sporty citizens who&apos;re treated as deferentially as their capital. Unlike his 1984 counterpart, Jackie Chan&apos;s kung fu master is an uncompromised product of his country. Mr Han commands not just the exacting physical skills on which success depends, but also mental moxie. He&apos;s reluctant to pass on these assets to a self-indulgent young round-eye who&apos;s too lazy to hang up his jacket, but pity leads him to relent. Unfortunately, this is a quality much lacking among his compatriots. Beijing&apos;s playground bullies are kung fu fanatics who&apos;re all too ready to lay into an American wimp. Their motto is: &quot;No weakness! No pain! No mercy!&quot; Unless young Dre can learn their methods, he&apos;ll stand no chance against them. Thanks to Han&apos;s selfless guidance, he&apos;s able to get initiated. Even so, it&apos;s clear that he&apos;ll still be at a disadvantage compared to his inevitably more practised opponents. What saves Dre is that he turns out to have something they don&apos;t. They may be trained, disciplined and ruthless. He, however, has humanity. Like any self-centred American adolescent, but unlike the robotic Chinese, Dre&apos;s in touch with his feelings. Understandably in the circumstances obtaining, he&apos;s frightened. Somehow, this fear enables him to prevail over his enemies. Superficially, the moral appears to be this. Americans may have allowed themselves to become feckless, idle and otherwise pretty useless in comparison with their eastern challengers. Nonetheless, the regard for their own emotions in which they luxuriate may prove an unexpectedly effective weapon against their otherwise invincible rivals. So on the face of it, The Karate Kid offers reassurance. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to buoy up audiences beyond the closing credits. Even Americans will find it hard to convince themselves that their niceness will defeat an implacable foe. Smith succeeds in making Dre seem cute; he never makes him look like a genuine winner. The film&apos;s actual message is therefore one of foreboding. This time, America, it really seems to be saying, perhaps the game is up."}, {"sentences": ["P18 Also on MediaGuardian.co.uk today Twitter reaches 20 billion tweetsTokyo-based graphic designer&apos;s landmark message reflects growing popularity of the microblogging site in Japan Nestl\u00e9 seeks adult Milky Bar kidsOnline contest for impersonations of classic advert, backed by TV campaign, will find stars for poster adverts in autumn Wired UK launches website ad campaignFactoid-based campaign for Cond\u00e9 Nast title to run on digital poster sites in London Dacre lashes out at &apos;ignorant&apos; PCC criticsDaily Mail editor says politicians, media groups and bloggers are ignorant about &apos;success story&apos; of press self-regulation The new coalition government is the least of the BBC&apos;s problemsSteve Hewlett: Despite some claims, the BBC is actually facing a rather benign political environment and its problems are of its own making Stage play hails subeditors, the unsung heroesA new stage play, called Subs, focuses on work at an upmarket men&apos;s magazine."], "tags": ["Media"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-02T08:11:18Z", "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/02/1", "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk     US Army troops from the 101st Airborne Division take cover as an Afghan soldier fires a rocket propelled grenade towards insurgent positions in the volatile Arghandab Valley in Kandahar.

Last seen several decades ago.&quot; Japan today launched a nationwide campaign to establish the whereabouts of its oldest residents after embarrassed officials in Tokyo discovered that a 113-year-old woman thought to have been the capital&apos;s oldest citizen had been missing for more than 20 years. The revelation that Fusa Furuya&apos;s relatives have no idea where she is and that the house where she was supposed to have lived no longer exists has sparked feverish media coverage. It comes days after the corpse of Tokyo&apos;s supposed oldest man was found mummified more than 30 years after his unreported death. Officials in the capital&apos;s Suginami ward attempted to visit Furuya, who was born in 1897, at an apartment in the city yesterday but were told by her 79-year-old daughter that she had never lived there. The daughter gave them the address of a house in Chiba, outside Tokyo, where Furuya was apparently living with the daughter&apos;s estranged younger brother. Officials arrived at the address to find that the building had been demolished to make way for a motorway. Furuya and her daughter were registered as having moved to Tokyo in 1986 but the exact date of the older woman&apos;s disappearance remains a mystery. Police are attempting to contact her son to establish her whereabouts. The failure of the city&apos;s welfare office to maintain contact with its two oldest residents is an embarrassment for a country that prides itself on looking after its huge population of senior citizens. Tokyo welfare officials said they had not directly contacted the pair for decades, despite having recorded their apparent feats of longevity. The city reportedly learned of the man&apos;s death and the woman&apos;s disappearance when they began updating records ahead of a national holiday held to show respect for the elderly. It has since emerged that a search is under way for a 106-year-old man in Nagoya, while the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said three more centenarians had vanished. The government said it would establish their whereabouts, and those of an unknown number of other centenarians, as Japan prepares to mark respect-for-the-aged day on 21 September. &quot;It is important for authorities to grasp the reality of where and how old people are living,&quot; said the health minister, Akira Nagatsuma. Japan is home to 40,399 centenarians, including 4,800 in Tokyo, according to the health ministry. Each year, those who have turned or are just about to turn 100 receive a congratulatory letter and trophy from the prime minister. The phenomenon of disappearing seniors hit the headlines late last month when police discovered that Sogen Kato, then thought to be Tokyo&apos;s oldest man at 111, had long since died. His mummified corpse, dressed in long johns and covered with a blanket, was found 32 years after he retreated to his bedroom, telling his 81-year-old daughter and her 83-year-old husband that he wanted to become &quot;a living Buddha&quot;. &quot;He was a very scary man,&quot; Kyodo News quoted one of Kato&apos;s grandchildren as telling police. &quot;We couldn&apos;t open the door. He shut himself in the room without food or water.&quot; Police arrested several members of the family on suspicion of abandoning a corpse and continuing to withdraw millions of yen in pension payments from his bank account. &quot;His family must have known he has been dead all these years and acted as if nothing happened,&quot; said Yutaka Muroi, a Tokyo metropolitan welfare official. &quot;It&apos;s so eerie.&quot; It is not the first time Japan has been found wanting regarding the welfare of its oldest citizens. After a similar case in 2005, involving a woman who hadn&apos;t been seen for 40 years, local governments were urged to update their records and found there were 52 fewer centenarians than previously thought. The job of keeping track of the elderly is likely to become even more difficult. Japanese women have enjoyed the world&apos;s longest life expectancy \u2013 now a record 86.4 years \u2013 for the last quarter of a century, while men can expect to live 79.5 years. Welfare officials complain that they do not have the authority to forcibly inspect the homes of centenarians if other members of their family object."}, {"sentences": ["Yuzo Kato, director of the Tokyo Suicide Prevention Centre, explains: &quot;The most common factor behind suicide in Japan is depression caused by a failure to cope with [social pressure] either because of poverty or the demands of work.&quot; The stockmarket crash in 1997 precipitated business failures, loss of savings and unemployment.", "Shintaro Ishihara, the right-wing governor of Tokyo, remarked that cabinet minister Matsuoka was a true Samurai because he had committed suicide to preserve his honour.", "However, Andrew Grimes, director of Tokyo Counseling Services warns that with economic problems persisting the government&apos;s aim to reduce suicide rates to 23,000 by 2016 will be difficult to achieve &quot;unless very proactive and well-funded local and nationwide suicide prevention programmes and initiatives are taken immediately&quot;."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Life and style", "Depression", "Mental health", "Society", "Asia Pacific", "Suicide rates"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-03T16:37:58Z", "title": "Japan: ending the culture of the 'honourable' suicide | Andrew Chambers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/03/japan-honourable-suicide-rate", "article": "A recent report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists has noted &quot;strong evidence of a link between economic hardship and suicide&quot;. In 2009 there was a 24% year-on-year increase in suicides in the Republic of Ireland, while the most recently available figures in the UK show that the beginning of the economic downturn in 2007-8 resulted in a 6% rise. With the Samaritans&apos; warning that it is &quot;vital that the government is committed to a suicide prevention strategy&quot;, it is worth considering Japan&apos;s experience. Japanese suicide rates rocketed following the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s and, despite recent initiatives, Japan has struggled both politically and socially to fully address the problem. For at least a decade now there have been more than 30,000 annual suicide cases \u2013 equating to almost one every 15 minutes. In 2007, cabinet minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka killed himself while facing investigation over an expenses scandal. Later that year the Japanese government launched a white paper to radically reform how suicide was perceived and treated, promising better counselling and helpline services. Naoto Kan, who recently became prime minister, has repeatedly spoken about the suicide rate \u2013 seeing it as indicative of the social decline of the nation. He has stated that his primary political goal is to &quot;minimise unhappiness&quot; in the country. In 2009, Japan&apos;s suicide total rose 2% to 32,845, equating to nearly 26 suicides per 100,000 people and significantly higher than for any other OECD country. As a comparison, the UK rate is about nine per 100,000, and the US rate around 11. In Japan, suicide is now the leading cause of death among men aged 20-44 and women aged 15-34. This elevated suicide rate is the result of a complex interplay between healthcare provision, social attitudes, cultural influences and economic factors. Yuzo Kato, director of the Tokyo Suicide Prevention Centre, explains: &quot;The most common factor behind suicide in Japan is depression caused by a failure to cope with [social pressure] either because of poverty or the demands of work.&quot; The stockmarket crash in 1997 precipitated business failures, loss of savings and unemployment. In 1998 the Japanese suicide total rose by 35%, and has remained above 30,000 a year ever since. The National Police Agency records financial motivations in about a quarter of all suicides. Many of these are described as inseki-jisatsu (so-called &quot;responsibility-driven&quot; suicides), where people hope to take responsibility for outstanding debts through a life insurance payout. Finance companies regularly have the borrower take out an insurance policy in case of death. In 2005, more than 3,600 insurance payments to the big five finance companies were actually from suicides. The financial crisis coincided with the longer-term market-driven restructuring of the Japanese economy. Japan remains a patriarchal society with strong familial and social expectations \u2013 however the economic upheaval that accelerated the end of the jobs-for-life culture has left men in particular struggling to cope with job insecurity or the stigma of unemployment. In this period, social inequality (measured on the GINI coefficient) has also increased \u2013 which has been shown in studies to have affected the suicide rates in Japan proportionally more than in other OECD countries. In Japan, suicide does not have the Judaeo-Christian connotation of sin. Indeed, the inherited cultural notion of romanticised, noble suicide still lingers, especially among the older traditionalists. It would be a mistake to overplay this, but nevertheless the mindset is still apparent. Shintaro Ishihara, the right-wing governor of Tokyo, remarked that cabinet minister Matsuoka was a true Samurai because he had committed suicide to preserve his honour. Ishihara also recently wrote the screenplay for a film entitled &quot;I go to die for you&quot; \u2013 which glorified the kamikaze pilots&apos; self-sacrifice in the second world war. Mental health provision also needs to improve. Although Japan has a modern and well-equipped health service, the World Health Organisation assesses that it still has an &quot;inadequate number of mental health staff providing community care&quot;. Research published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology demonstrated that patient access to the latest anti-depressant drugs is still restricted. Meanwhile, a Lancet article noted that with counselling at private clinics not covered by national health insurance, many people are still not getting the help they need. The Japan Times reports how the country&apos;s largest suicide helpline, Inochi no Denwa (literally, &quot;the telephone of life&quot;) struggles to attract enough funding to maintain a free phone number. With 300 volunteers it takes 27,000 calls a year. When this is compared with the 2.4m phone calls the Samaritans in the UK receive it is clear that it needs to become more culturally acceptable to ask for help. In 2009 the government pledged a further \u00a515.8bn (\u00a3115m) towards suicide prevention policies. However, Andrew Grimes, director of Tokyo Counseling Services warns that with economic problems persisting the government&apos;s aim to reduce suicide rates to 23,000 by 2016 will be difficult to achieve &quot;unless very proactive and well-funded local and nationwide suicide prevention programmes and initiatives are taken immediately&quot;. Reducing the suicide rate will require tackling the cultural interpretation of suicide and mental health conditions, improving work environments, providing better access to mental health services, increasing welfare provision and driving economic growth. These measures also need to be undertaken in the UK \u2013 which has seen its own suicide levels increasing following the economic downturn. In Japan, reducing the suicide rate remains a huge task, but at least now there is a real political will to make it happen. \u2022 Befrienders Worldwide, run by the Samaritans, provides a network of helplines in 39 countries including Japan.

Last year ticket sales topped 1.85m and this year may even break 2m. But record numbers spell sky-high prices as visitors jostle for the few remaining hotel rooms \u2013 and long queues outside the best restaurants. In spite of the crowds, Guardian Money was still able to track down bargains for last-minute festival-goers. But we don&apos;t pretend this list is exhaustive: if you have any Edinburgh money-savers why don&apos;t you post them below. Getting there   What you could pay This week bmibaby was asking up to \u00a3750 for a Friday-Sunday return flight from London to Edinburgh \u2013 more than a return to Tokyo normally costs. Even easyJet fares were hovering around \u00a3400. The budget option Take the train but avoid the standard walk-up rate, which for London to Edinburgh is usually between \u00a399 and \u00a3117 single. Get a Super Off-Peak Return, now around \u00a3108.30, reduced to \u00a371.50 for railcard holders. Advance tickets go for as little as \u00a330-\u00a340 return, but you&apos;re too late to catch the festival. Return fares from Manchester start at around \u00a351.50. The best bargain is from Birmingham on Virgin, which this week was still selling returns to Edinburgh for \u00a333. The ultra-budget option Megabus runs overnight journeys from London to Edinburgh with prices as low as \u00a322 one way. The middle way Wait for the second half of the festival; Friday-Sunday flights on BA from Heathrow can be found for around \u00a3150, going out early and returning late. Try Martin Lewis&apos;s cheap flight checker tool where you can set the maximum price you would be willing to pay. The insider tip Super Off-Peak returns can be used for a seat on the sleeper at no extra cost, or you can upgrade to a shared cabin for \u00a338 and a solo berth for \u00a354. With hotels difficult to find for less than \u00a3150, the sleeper provides an alternative way to add a full day to your stay. Check First ScotRail on 08457 55 00 33. Staying there   What you could pay Suites in the Balmoral Hotel this weekend will set you back \u00a3985. The five-star Missoni wants \u00a3640, the four-star George \u00a3668, while the three-star Holiday Inn, \u00a3451. Next weekend, availability is little better, though prices are a tad lower. They will climb as the weekend approaches. B&amp;Bs are not really an option. A phone-around by Money found virtually all are sold out for weekend dates, and the few left want up to \u00a3150 a night The best we could find for this weekend was \u00a3228 for two nights. That was on Tuesday morning. By the afternoon it had gone. The budget option The University of Edinburgh&apos;s student accommodation is available during the summer and there is some availability. En suite rooms are available in Chancellor&apos;s Court, not far from the Pleasance, from \u00a379 for a single and \u00a399 for a twin or double. There is also the odd single available in Baird House, shared bathroom, at \u00a343 and Holland House, en suite, at \u00a357.50 although these dates tend to be during the week. But be warned, these are the basic end of the student market \u2013 the likes of Lenny Henrys wouldn&apos;t really fit in the single beds. Facebook.com/edfringe has some last-minute accommodation offers, typically rooms in student flats. This week we saw an offer of \u00a350 per night for two in a self-catering flat, but it disappeared pretty quickly. And check out deals on gumtree.com. The ultra-budget option The most unique, and cheapest, accommodation we found, was wood-frame wigwams for \u00a325 per head at Mortonhall caravan park. This is just within Edinburgh&apos;s city boundaries. It&apos;s a 25-minute bus ride to the city centre and the all-day ticket is \u00a33. It still had availability for this weekend and for 23-25 August. Made of sustainable wood and complete with fridge, the wigwams can accommodate up to five people, with a maximum of four adults. Children under 15 are \u00a313 a night and under-fives stay free. Or you can camp at the site for \u00a310.50 a night. The city centre backpacker hostels are almost entirely booked up and just have the odd week-day night with beds available. Try Brodie&apos;s Hostel or Argyle Backpackers where prices start at \u00a321 for a bunk in a dormitory. The middle way The &quot;budget&quot; chains are your best bet, although they ramp up prices in the festival. The Holiday Inn Express in Cowgate had rooms for two available this weekend, at \u00a3169.97 per night. The following weekend prices are still steep, with most three and four-star hotels asking \u00a3200-plus a night. Travelodge has 11 hotels around the city and many still have weekend availability, though some are a fair way away from the centre. Travelodge Cameron Toll is on a straight road into the centre and, when we searched, it had rooms for \u00a399.30 but beware the long walk \u2013 it&apos;s about 45 minutes to Princes Street. The insider tip Try weekly rental of a University of Edinburgh student flat. A five-bed flat costs around \u00a3700 which works out at \u00a320 a night per person. They are single-bed study bedrooms but do have their own kitchen. Go to the Edinburgh First website or call on 0131 651 2007. Seeing it   At \u00a310-\u00a312 a ticket for a typical fringe show, you and a partner could soon see the back of \u00a3100 in a day just on tickets. Two-for-one deals tend to run early in the festival. Consider becoming a Friend of the Fringe. As well as supporting the event you gain access to various two-for-one deals. Prices start at \u00a325. Check out the Free Festival at freefestival.co.uk, promising 300 free shows. Keep an eye out for events hosted by the BBC, which are sometimes free. The half-price hut at The Mound sells on-the-day tickets for selected performances. You might find a great show you wouldn&apos;t have seen, but it&apos;s a bit of a lottery. A interesting innovation for this year is an iPhone app and website, which allows show producers to offer last-minute tickets for their shows for free on an online forum. The idea is that tickets will be made available half an hour before the show runs, so you&apos;ll have to get your skates on. More information at the TheatreNinjas website. The insider tip: Another way to reduce the cost of tickets is to offer to help out with a production. There are still some last-minute jobs up for grabs. Keep an eye on the Fringe&apos;s Facebook group for opportunities. We spotted paid vacancies for a dresser and members of a street team. There are ads for unpaid work in return for freebies, while jobs are also posted on edinburghfestivaljobs.com. Last week the latter was offering vacancies for a dresser and members of a street team on the Facebook group (look at the discussions), some work experience in return for freebies and flyering jobs on the website.

They were school pupils in Hiroshima, both freed from study to work in the fields on Japan&apos;s wartime food production, at the moment the Enola Gay dropped the atomic bomb on their city. Their portraits are among those of 65 survivors in a London exhibition opening tomorrow, including those of a woman and her baby who are third and fourth-generation Hibakusha \u2013 literally bomb-affected people \u2013 and a man who was just a foetus in his mother&apos;s womb on August 6 1945 and who is too embarrassed to use his survivor&apos;s card. It is the first time the portraits have been seen outside Japan. The Moritas, explained Setsuko, are quiet people who married when they were 18 but &quot;were never fortunate enough to have the blessing of children&quot; \u2013 almost certainly as a result of injuries she suffered that day. They have come to London driven by the same urge which created the exhibition \u2013 to bear witness to what happened so that it will never happen again. Setsuko Morita managed to stagger home after the bombing with 25% burns, through roads where every building was gone, crowded with people bearing terrible injuries, pleading for water. Her parents treated her for a week with three buckets of sterilised water and baby powder until they finally got her to a doctor. She overheard a conversation in which her mother said it would be better if she died, while her father argued that her life might still be worth living. Noboru, meanwhile, spent the next three months working in his school, just beside his family home, which became a hospital, morgue, crematorium and cemetery. He watched many people die in what had been his classroom, begging for water. He spent most of every day searching for wells and springs because the mains had been destroyed and the river was choked with wreckage and bodies. The portraits are by Professor Hideo Ohya, a renowned artist in Japan, and by colleagues and postgraduate students at Hiroshima city university. A postwar baby, it was only when he moved from Tokyo to head the art faculty that he realised how limited his understanding of the fate of the city had been. As he began to meet survivors he realised that the youngest were approaching old age and there would soon be no first-hand witnesses. Gradually members of the university staff came forward, volunteering to have their own portraits included. Many in the city have hidden their status as a badge of shame that still attracts fear of contamination. The exhibition has come to London through Paul Stafford of Kingston university, who found them almost unbearably moving even though none show obvious disfigurement. He saw the portraits as a way of fostering links between the two institutions. The Brunei gallery at the School of Oriental and African Studies in Russell Square, which has a Japanese garden on the roof where a private ceremony will be held to mark the exact time of the atomic bomb explosion, proved the perfect space for the exhibition. Like many of those portrayed, Noboru Morita looks remarkably calm and cheerful \u2013 but that is one of the side effects he bears. He has been on anti-depressants for 20 years to calm his growing dread of cancers and other long-term effects suffered by many of the survivors. He felt angry for years, baffled and even resentful of his own survival, never speaking of them but deeply affected by the scenes he witnessed. His wife, in her portrait as in life, looks tranquil and immaculate. Only when she pushes back her sleeves do the streaks of white scars along the outside of one arm and the inside of the other show. \u2022 The Light - portraits of the Hibakusha, Brunei Gallery, London, free, until 8 October Portrait profiles     Mother and child portrait at the Hibakusha exhibition.

I hope peace will last, for the sake of our children,&quot; his mother says. His grandmother and great-grandparents are also part of the project.     Noboru and Setsuko Morita with their portraits. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Painted by Hideo Ohya, professor of art at Hiroshimo city university and creator of the project, Setsuko Morita was 13 at the time of the bombing. On returning home her parents tended to her burns with rationed ointment. She married fellow survivor, Noboru, at the age of 18 and believes strongly in speaking about her experiences. She has re-counted them at schools in Japan and New York. Walking with his mother towards the family field, Noboru Morita was 13 when the atomic bomb exploded. Noboru helped to care for the injured at the refuge set up at the school behind his half-demolished home. He moved away after marrying Setsuko but returned to the city at the age of 55. Keeping his survivor status a secret for many years he has, through the encouragement of his wife, gradually become able to speak about his experiences.

This ageing business is getting out of control | Alexander Chancellor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/06/alexander-chancellor-life-expectancy-britain", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 9 August 2010 This column referred to &quot;the Queen&apos;s practice of sending telegrams to people on their 100th birthdays&quot;. Since 1999, the palace has sent a birthday card instead    The Queen&apos;s practice of sending telegrams to people on their 100th birthdays can hardly continue for ever when the country is to be flooded with centenarians. Official statistics published yesterday showed life expectancy increasing at such a rate that a quarter of all babies born this year are expected to live to more than 100. Buckingham Palace will not be able to cope, nor will it want to, since reaching 100 will have become a very ordinary achievement. Already, there are more than 10,000 centenarians in Britain, compared to only about 100 a century ago. Nobody wants to die young, but this ageing business is getting out of control. Having been born in 1940 rather than 2010, I am pleased to say that my chances of reaching 100 are extremely slim. There comes a point when one starts to say to oneself that one is glad that certain scary things \u2013 the flooding of London, nuclear war, the end of the world or whatever \u2013 are unlikely to happen during one&apos;s lifetime. It is comforting to know that one&apos;s risk of exposure to serious unpleasantness is getting rapidly smaller, but future generations may not enjoy that solace. Only now are we waking up to the extent of the problems created by increasing life expectancy. There is a feeling of panic in the air as it is realised that within 30 years there will be only two working adults for every pensioner \u2013 half as many as at present. We are going to be made to work longer \u2013 forced retirement at 65 will soon be against the law \u2013 and to wait longer for our state pensions. It is good that one should not be forced to retire; less good that one should not be allowed to. While it makes economic sense that people should go on working into old age, there is no guarantee that they will be able to. There is no reason to think that their mental or physical capacities won&apos;t decline as early as they do now. On the other hand, forcing people to work after they should have stopped might paradoxically help to solve the problem by reversing the rise in life expectancy. It could only have this effect, however, if they were made to work very hard. Government leaders (with the spooky exception of Silvio Berlusconi) tend to age very quickly because of their gruelling schedules. David Cameron is only 43 and has been prime minister for just three months, but his hair is already greying and he has started to go bald. My advice to him is to travel much less and to limit himself to one major policy initiative a week. President Obama, who turned 49 this week, has been complaining that he has &quot;a lot more grey hair than last year&quot;. It has been claimed in the US that presidents typically age two years biologically for every year they are in office, and the same may easily be true of prime ministers as well. France&apos;s grey crimewave If expectations in France are anything to go by, the growing number of old people in Britain may also threaten Kenneth Clarke&apos;s plans to cut the prison population. For a French government report predicts a surge in the number of crimes committed by the over-60s from 24,000 last year to 40,000 a year by the middle of the century. France&apos;s Centre for Strategic Analysis even proposes that police should be given special training in detecting &quot;grey crime&quot; and that jails should be altered to cater for inmates with Alzheimer&apos;s disease and other geriatric illnesses. It is predicted that by 2050 one third of France&apos;s population will be over 60, compared to about a fifth at present, but the French seem to be in denial about this. Asked in an opinion poll how they would portray a typical French person, they chose an athletic young cyclist. By contrast, a typical Briton in French eyes is an old boy with a flat cap on a mobility scooter. No country for old men At least in Japan there seem to be fewer centenarians than was thought. Officials in Tokyo had been boasting that its oldest citizen, Fusa Furuya, was 113, only to discover she hadn&apos;t been seen by anybody for more than 20 years and the house in which she was supposed to have lived no longer existed. Not even her relations had shown the slightest interest in whether she was alive or dead. This might have seemed an aberrational case if a similar discovery had not been made only a week or so ago. Sogen Kato, at 111, was still being described as Tokyo&apos;s oldest man when his mummified corpse was found 32 years after his unreported death. All this is very embarrassing for a country that prides itself on its care for the old. That&apos;s the trouble when old people get too numerous: it&apos;s difficult for the young to go on revering them. Not such a disaster, after all The news from the Gulf of Mexico gets better and better. Not only has most of the oil vanished, but it is even being claimed that the Deepwater Horizon explosion may, in fact, have caused the fish population to rise. According to experts in marine biology, the oil has killed fewer fish than the fishermen would have done if they had been allowed to work. There is no evidence of oil contamination in fish samples, and it is predicted that fish will now be bigger than before because they have been allowed to develop unmolested.

In it, Stallone leads a gang of ageing motorbike-riding mercenaries employed on a deadly mission to overthrow an evil dictator. Obviously. The film is so named because Sly&apos;s gang are expendable soldiers, prepared to be sacrificed in order to accomplish their objective.

Meal for two, with wine and service, \u00a360-\u00a3150 There are lots of restaurants like Sushi of Shiori. It&apos;s just that none of them are in London. Or Britain. To be sure of finding another place like this you will have to head to Tokyo, where they cluster like so many pigeons around a split sack of seed. Here, restaurants with just one chef and seven seats are hardly common. But it really couldn&apos;t be simpler: an open kitchen where the young chef, a graduate of Mayfair&apos;s buttock-clenchingly expensive Umu, does his intense, detailed, obsessive-compulsive thing. There is a bar with three seats, so you can watch him doing it. Behind is a counter in the window with four seats looking out into Drummond Street, a road near Euston station famed only for its cheap Indian restaurants and colourful drunks. So should you go? Yes, though not for its novelty. Those with a sweaty, overheated love of Japanese food will find a lot to get frisky about here. But there is a problem, and it is so glaring, so big, that it needs mentioning early. The problem is this: the rice. I have heard certain sushi heads claim that the good stuff is &quot;all about the rice&quot;. This has always seemed a rather silly, pompous thing to say. How can it be about the rice, when the thing that goes on top of it costs so much more? And then I tried Shiori&apos;s nigiri sushi \u2013 the thumb-length pillows of rice with raw fish on top \u2013 and I\u00a0realised it really could be all about the rice. Good sushi rice should be just warm, each grain capable of letting go of the next with barely a shrug. Unfortunately the rice at Shiori just ain&apos;t all that: cold, claggy, under-flavoured, underwhelming. It is such a shame, because everything else is so good. Although there is a longish menu of various sushis and sashimis, you can, when you book, ask for an omakase \u2013 a\u00a0Japanese-style tasting menu prepared according to what&apos;s best and available. You name the price you want to pay per head, from \u00a330 or so upwards, and a delicate Japanese woman with small feet and perfect hands brings it to you. We asked for an omakase for two for \u00a345. It started magnificently, with four cylinders of white crabmeat, tightly wrapped in nori \u2013 toasted seaweed \u2013 with a fine dashi broth. That was followed by slices of sea bass sashimi, arranged as an albino peacock fan tail, each carrying a dot of sticky plum sauce, and on the side a small bowl of ponzu (citrus sauce), which we were invited to pour over. In that combination of the subtle and the sharp, the clean and the precise, it was exactly what lovers of Japanese food get most excited about. There was another bowl of cool dashi broth with, lying at the bottom, thin, slippery soba noodles. Most impressive of all was the sashimi, arranged with exquisite attention to detail: on one side, a hollowed-out lemon, its cut edge serrated, the peel bowl filled with chopped mackerel and tuna. On the other side, slices of sweet scallop brushed with a slick of something that lifted the flavour without declaring itself. We failed to identify it and had to ask: it was truffle oil. Too often merely tiresome, here, used with a light hand, it was perfect. In between there were slices of the best raw fish, deftly sliced. And then the disappointment of the sushi. It looked beautiful and the fish itself really was marvellous. The attention to detail \u2013 the way slices of spring onion were balanced here, or shining balls of bright-orange salmon roe were clustered there \u2013 beggared belief. The eel was especially good. But the rice both here, and on a subsequent course of sliced wagyu beef, seared and presented nigiri style, made us mourn self-consciously. There were compensations: a superb black sesame ice cream, the slate-grey shade of an expensive kitchen floor, and an equally pleasing plum wine sorbet. We despatched a very good bottle of sake from a carefully built list, and hugged ourselves at our cleverness for even being here in the first place. There really is nothing like this in London. And in places it is shimmering with brilliance. The rest, you know.

Peas and beans!&quot; The famous Japanese architect was in his office, high in a Tokyo tower, its walls crowded with framed honours and diplomas. Assistants of exceptional beauty shimmered in with tea, but what he wanted to talk about was pulses. Rising prosperity in China would lead to rising meat consumption, and in turn a global protein crisis. It was the greatest problem, he said, facing mankind today. The solution lay in Kazakhstan, the vast former Soviet republic, for whose president the architect, Kisho Kurokawa, was masterplanning a new capital. This country, to the south of Russia, stretches from the eastern edge of Europe almost to Mongolia. For Kurokawa it offered ample opportunity for growing peas and beans, and \u2013 in a symbolic way \u2013 his plan would help. It was based on the interweaving of city and nature, with swaths of green between the buildings. It represented an idea of interdependence of which pulse-growing on an immense scale would be the practical outcome. This meeting was in 2001, and Kurokawa died in 2007, but his city is now there, more or less following his plan. There are plenty of parks and trees. Called Astana, it is the world&apos;s latest example of a rare but persistent type, the capital from zero. It is in a line that includes St\u00a0Petersburg, Washington DC, Canberra, Ankara and Brasilia and like them it provokes a question: can a city, in all its teeming complexity, really be planned? Or does the attempt lead only to a synthetic simulacrum, a kind-of city that is not quite the real thing? To look at, Astana is so strange that it has one grasping for images. It&apos;s a space station, marooned in an ungraspable expanse of level steppe, its name (to English speakers) having the invented sound of a science fiction writer&apos;s creation. It&apos;s a city of fable or dream, as recounted by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. Except it&apos;s not quite so magical: it&apos;s also like a battery-operated plastic toy, all whirring noises and flashing colours, of a kind sold by the city&apos;s street vendors. Astana&apos;s ornaments include a 62-metre-high silver pyramid, designed by British architects Foster + Partners, giant gold-green cones and a gold orb resting on a structure of erupting white steel. At night its buildings go purple, pink, green and yellow. Astana&apos;s latest, most technically ambitious addition is a 150-metre-high translucent tent, also by Lord Foster. Called Khan Shatyr, a single leaning mast props its roof, which offers shelter from a harsh climate to a shopping and entertainment complex underneath. It follows a familiar Foster strategy, to be seen in the Great Court of the British Museum, or his airports at Stansted, Hong Kong and Beijing, which is to create an impressively engineered roof \u2013 a thing to be looked at and admired but not inhabited \u2013 hovering over a lower, less ordered, zone where the activity of the buildings, in this case shops and theme-park rides, takes place. This strategy, derived from the geodesic domes which the visionary American designer Buckminster Fuller once proposed throwing over whole cities, makes for striking architecture but also for awkward clashes where the two zones meet. Top and bottom seem to be different worlds. Khan Shatyr opened last month with an extravagant celebration which coincided with the 70th birthday of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is the beginning and end of everything that happens in Astana. The building is there &quot;because the idea came from the president&quot;, says its German-born manager: that there were four other malls within a square kilometre &quot;didn&apos;t matter for him&quot;. The gold orb on the white steel tower, which signifies the egg laid annually on the tree of life by the mythical bird Samruk, was designed by Nazarbayev himself. When Nazarbayev commissioned Foster to design his Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, he told them he wanted it pyramid-shaped, which may be the first and only time a client has told the mighty Foster what a building should look like, and been obeyed. Such cities are often the work of a single strong man. There is a museum of the founder in Astana, as there are of Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in Ankara and President Kubitschek in Brasilia, pharaonic insurance against the afterlife that contains such things as Nazarbayev&apos;s grandfather&apos;s seal of office as a local judge. There is the president&apos;s palace, which stands on a long axis linking the two Foster works, the tent and the pyramid, and the golden orb. The palace is a version of the White House, improved by the addition of a blue dome. Also by its dominating location: the American original is placed off-centre from Washington&apos;s Mall, signifying a separation of powers that is not quite the Kazakh style. The common view of Nazarbayev, among those western politicians who have one, is that he is by some distance the best of the extremely bad bunch running the former Soviet republics of central Asia. Margaret Thatcher has written a foreword to Nazarbayev&apos;s book The Kazakhstan Way, praising him for throwing off &quot;the Soviet yolk [sic]&quot;. He established himself as a reformer in the 1980s, enough for Gorbachev to ask him, unsuccessfully, to be prime minister of the Soviet Union. The west was also extremely grateful to him for giving up his ballistic missiles when the collapse of the Soviet Union left him the master of the world&apos;s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal. Kazakhstan may rank 142nd in the world press freedom index, and 120th in the corruption perception index, and he may win elections and referendums with suspiciously high votes of 91% and 95%, but \u2013 goes the pro-Nazarbayev argument \u2013 nobody else could have stabilised his country&apos;s potentially explosive ethnic combinations, and ridden the violent post-Soviet economic storms. This argument is set out in Nazarbayev and the Making of Kazakhstan, an eloquent, if oily, book by the British former minister Jonathan Aitken. Among its gems is a description of the romance between the president and his future wife, which flourished after an accident at a steel works: &quot;While the flames of the blast furnace were damped down, the fires of love ignited.&quot; Aitken reports how his subject, as a young champion of steelworkers&apos; rights, was scathing about both grandiose building projects and the decision to locate a steel plant in a site with an appalling climate. Yet he chose to build Astana, which can fairly be called grandiose, in a place that had been notable previously for its Soviet penal colonies and where the temperature runs from -40C to 40C (-40 to 104F). His logic was that the previous capital, Almaty, was too close to China, too congested, and prone to earthquakes.One can guess that, as for other rulers, building a new capital gave Nazarbayev a place he could control, made on his own terms. In keeping with his status as a better-than-average dictator, this is done subtly: Astana is not littered with statues and images of its maker, and when his followers suggested that it should be named after him, he modestly demurred. (Although the somewhat neutral &quot;Astana&quot; \u2013 it means &quot;capital&quot; \u2013 might indicate that the space is being kept open for a renaming in the future.) Instead you hear, again and again, that things are the way they are &quot;because the president wants it&quot;, which is delivered as a sufficient and unarguable statement. The shopping centre manager says it, as does the waiter serving horse steak. President Medvedev of Russia said that Nazarbayev &quot;has given this city not only his work but also his soul&quot;. He wanted the city, and he specified its monuments in detail. He had his government officials, who initially left their families in more hospitable Almaty, shipped in. David Nelson, of Foster + Partners, describes long design meetings with the president: &quot;He had thought about the building. That&apos;s what&apos;s impressive.&quot; What he wanted he got, thanks partly to oil revenues from the distant Caspian Sea, which Nazarbayev claimed for Kazakhstan in a protracted haggle with Boris Yeltsin \u2013 closing the deal with the help of vodka and a map doodled on a napkin, which is now in the Museum of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Like Gulf cities, Astana floats on an exhalation of petrodollars. Like Gulf cities and new Chinese cities such as Shenzhen, Astana inspires wonder that it is there at all; but while having some buildings of eye-aching ugliness, it has a greater sense of order. At street level in Dubai all is congestion. Here it is trimmed hedges, well-behaved traffic, well-kept paving and a complete lack of litter, or of visible signs of prostitution, drug-taking or beggary. It most resembles the controlled cleanliness of Singapore. The world&apos;s most famous Kazakh is the fictional Borat, but people in Astana are nothing like him. Except, perhaps for a taxi driver who growled like a tomcat whenever he saw a woman. In general Astanans are placid and dignified. They gather in the hour or so around dusk, when the hammering heat of the day gives way to deliciously balmy air, and promenade in the city&apos;s grand avenue. Children career over the pavements in electric cars like unfenced dodgems, while everyone gasps obediently at the pre-programmed fountain displays. The avenue is decorated with topiary giraffes and elephants, and vast swirling carpets of brightly coloured bedding plants. There are artificial trees, made of steel rods, blossoming with pink or orange lights and the plastic roof of Khan Shatyr now joins the display, lit from within with a spectrum of disco colours. Sam Cooke&apos;s Wonderful World plays from the shrubberies. The place offers childish delights, laid on by the unseen hand of a benevolent daddy. There is not, yet, much more to Astana than this. It doesn&apos;t have bohemian quarters, or a rich nightlife, or hidden surprises. It feels sedated. The striking architecture is combined with a lack of excitement in the street life, as if the design of buildings were a cipher for risk and drama. These are very early days, of course, and over the decades Astana might mature into something different."}, {"sentences": ["Similarly, each of the 23 prefectures in Tokyo has its own waste incinerator and there is little collaboration on green issues between different municipalities.Jane Dudman travelled to Japan as the guest of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations."], "tags": ["Public Leaders Network"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-10T07:00:00Z", "title": "A kowtow to cooperation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com//Public/japan-public-sector-squeeze", "article": "Japan&apos;s public sector, like that in the UK, is facing a budget squeeze that has resulted in local authorities facing the need to streamline their organisations and cut the number of people they employ. With Japan&apos;s government debt now standing at a record \u00a5882.9tn, all local authorities in the country have large debt and are struggling to reconstruct their finances, according to Professor Shunsuke Kimura, director of international studies at Japan&apos;s National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.  The number of staff employed by local authorities has already fallen in the past 10 years from 3.2m to 2.9m and further cuts are expected. Salaries have also fallen, but are still higher than average salaries in central government. Local government in Japan oversees more public services than central government, but much of its activity is limited by national law and there are strong demands for a nationwide standard of administration. The standard two-tier structure of local government in Japan, with prefectures \u2013 or regional government \u2013 and municipalities \u2013 or cities and towns \u2013 ensures that prefectures and municipalities enjoy considerable levels of autonomy in administration, budgetary matters and local legislation. Unlike the UK, the governor of each prefecture and the mayor of each municipality also act as chief executive and personally appoint their senior staff. This structure was introduced to Japan following the second world war and is largely based on the US model for local government. Over the past 15 years, there has been greater decentralisation in the Japanese local government system, aimed at making the relationship between central and local government less heirarchical and more equal and cooperative. But a recent report by United Cities and Local Governments on the impact of the global crisis on local governments points out that the global recession has made local authorities with large spending powers, such as those in Japan, more fragile in times of crisis, when national governments are likely to reduce, slow down or simply cut their funding to local authorities. From UK local government, Japan has learned about the UK private finance initiative and about how to evaluate government policy programmes, largely via the work of Clair, the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Clair&apos;s biggest programme is the JET programme, which brings young English-speaking people to the country for two years to act as assistant language teachers in schools across Japan, and which is the world&apos;s largest single exchange programme.  Clair also sends local officials to overseas countries, promotes Japanese government overseas and promotes multiculturalism in Japan \u2013 the number of foreign residents in the country has doubled in the past 10 year to just over 2 million people, 1.8% of the total population. But with Japan, like the UK, facing a budget squeeze, local government is stretched and it has been more difficult for local authorities to give financial support to these kinds of exchange programmes.  As a result, local authorities are now focusing on specific programme areas, such as the environment, where international expertise will be most helpful, while Clair has increased its focus on international cooperation, aiming to maximise the use in other countries of Japan&apos;s expertise in areas such as the environment, agriculture, firefighting, water supply, disaster recovery and so on. One way in which Japanese local government may be able to learn from the UK is in encouraging greater collaboration between different arms of government.  Kindergartens and nursery schools, for instance, do substantially the same thing, but are run by different ministries, which has led to disparities, according to Professor Kimura. There is spare capacity in many kindergartens, while children are waiting to get into nursery schools. Local government wants to use such facilities more efficiently, by bringing them together, but that is not yet happening. Similarly, each of the 23 prefectures in Tokyo has its own waste incinerator and there is little collaboration on green issues between different municipalities.Jane Dudman travelled to Japan as the guest of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations.

In a statement that closely mirrored previous apologies to Asian victims of Japanese wartime aggression given by former prime ministers Tomiichi Murayama and Junichiro Koizumi, Naoto Kan acknowledged the suffering caused in the 1910-45 occupation &quot;It is easy for the side that inflicted the pain to forget, while those who suffered that pain cannot easily forget,&quot; he said in a statement ahead of the 100th anniversary of the start of colonial rule, on 29 August. &quot;I express a renewed feeling of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology for the tremendous damage and suffering caused by colonial rule.&quot; The apology is being seen as an attempt to strengthen ties with South Korea, which have improved amid shared concerns over North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme and its torpedo attack on a South Korean warship in March. Better political ties have been matched by co-ordinated policy during the global financial crisis and strong economic links: South Korea was Japan&apos;s third-largest export market in 2009. A Japanese government spokesman said Kan&apos;s statement was not directed at North Korea, even though Japan had occupied the entire peninsula. Kan&apos;s remarks differed slightly from the groundbreaking 1995 statement by Murayama \u2013 repeated by Koizumi a decade later \u2013 as it was directed exclusively at South Korea and recognised for the first time that the peninsula was annexed &quot;against the will of the Korean people&quot;. Kan, who spoke to his South Korean counterpart, Lee Myung-bak, by telephone, said Japan would return a number of cultural relics, including documents describing court ceremonies during the Chosun dynasty [1392-1910], seized by Japan in 1922. South Korea welcomed Kan&apos;s apology. &quot;We expect all Japanese people to share this view,&quot; said Kim Young-sun, a South Korean foreign ministry spokesman. &quot;We hope that through proper recognition and reflection of the unfortunate history, close bilateral relations can further develop into a partnership for the future.&quot; Conservative politicians in Japan, including members of Kan&apos;s Democratic party, had warned an apology would fuel demands for compensation. Japan insists all compensation claims were dropped when the countries signed a peace treaty and normalised diplomatic ties in 1965. Despite the recent detente, the countries have failed to resolve several long-running disputes. Japan refuses to pay compensation to South Korean women who were forced into prostitution by the Japanese military, before and during the war. Campaigners calling for reparations from Japan over its wartime conduct said the apology did not go far enough. &quot;Kan says Japan apologises and repent, but they are just words,&quot; said Kang Joo-hye, a member of a group representing former sex slaves. &quot;He didn&apos;t mention the victims once, or pledge any action to heal their hurt or pain.&quot; In another move that reflects the recent improvement in ties, no Japanese ministers will visit Yasukuni \u2013 a shrine to Japan&apos;s war dead, including class-A war criminals \u2013 on 15 August, the 65th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war."}, {"sentences": ["Adam Walker, the BNP&apos;s staff manager, is in Tokyo along with 20 MEPs and members of the Alliance of European National Movements, the &quot;europarty&quot; that brings together far-right parties from across Europe.", "Walker arrived in Tokyo today where he will spend the next week attending a congress on &quot;The Future of Nationalist Movements&quot; .", "On Friday, Le Pen will make a keynote speech at a hotel in Tokyo."], "tags": ["BNP", "The far right", "Japan", "World news", "Politics", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-11T16:39:39Z", "title": "BNP attends international far-right conference in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/11/bnp-far-right-conference-japan", "article": "The British National Party is taking part in a week-long conference in Japan organised by Nippon Issuikai, an extreme-right group that denies Japanese wartime atrocities. Adam Walker, the BNP&apos;s staff manager, is in Tokyo along with 20 MEPs and members of the Alliance of European National Movements, the &quot;europarty&quot; that brings together far-right parties from across Europe. Walker arrived in Tokyo today where he will spend the next week attending a congress on &quot;The Future of Nationalist Movements&quot; . According to the BNP, Walker has worked in Japan as a teacher and runs a martial arts academy. During recent election campaigns, the BNP has used images of Winston Churchill and Spitfires in an attempt to broaden its patriotic appeal. However, Issuikai, or the &quot;Wednesday Society&quot;, denies the atrocities perpetrated by Emperor Hirohito and his government, including the Rape of Nanking in 1937, in which hundreds of thousands of civilians were murdered and between 20,000 and 80,000 women raped by soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. John Walker, a spokesman for the BNP, said: &quot;It is not for us to make comment on other parties&apos; views.&quot; Issuikai was founded in 1972 by acolytes of the militarist novelist Yukio Mishima, who committed Seppuku, or ritual suicide, after a failed attempt at provoking a coup d&apos;\u00e9tat by the Japanese Self-Defence Forces to restore the powers of the emperor. Mitsuhiro Kimura, Issuikai&apos;s president since 2000, has long wanted to build an international alliance of far-right parties. A graduate of the prestigious Keio University, Kimura speaks English and counts French rightwing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen among his associates. He was a friend of Uday Hussein, son of Saddam Hussein, and made regular visits to Iraq before the war. &quot;We are holding this meeting in Japan to get to know each other, to talk about how we can protect the national identity in our respective countries and cooperate to win the battle against globalisation,&quot; Kimura told the Guardian. On Friday, Le Pen will make a keynote speech at a hotel in Tokyo. A day later \u2013 on the eve of the 65th anniversary of the end of the second world war \u2013 conference participants will pay their respects at Yasukuni, a Shinto shrine in the capital that honours Japan&apos;s war dead, including 14 class-A war criminals. The conference&apos;s main subject will be the future of the far-right internationally, in particular, &quot;lessons that Japan could learn from the experience and achievements of European movements, some of which have made inroads in recent polls, and ways to maintain ties worldwide&quot;. Philip Claeys, of Belgium&apos;s Flemish separatist group Vlaams Belang, told the Guardian he was not bothered about meeting with sympathisers of Imperial Japan. &quot;The conference is focused on current politics in the 21st Century. We are confronted with Islamic terrorist threats, free trade, and globalism now. I&apos;m not interested in going to a conference focusing on who did what to who in World War Two or which side was guilty of war crimes.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["To British athletics fans, the American 400m runner Antonio Pettigrew will always be remembered for the race he failed to win at the 1991 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, rather the individual 400m gold medal that he had claimed earlier that week for the US."], "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport", "World Athletics Championships", "Olympics 2000", "Drugs in sport", "US sports", "US news", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-11T18:15:58Z", "title": "Antonio Pettigrew obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/11/antonio-pettigrew-obituary", "article": "To British athletics fans, the American 400m runner Antonio Pettigrew will always be remembered for the race he failed to win at the 1991 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, rather the individual 400m gold medal that he had claimed earlier that week for the US. Pettigrew had beaten Britain&apos;s Roger Black by just five one-hundredths of\u00a0a\u00a0second in the final of the individual event, but the British 400m relay team, of Black, Derek Redmond, John Regis and Kriss Akabusi gained spectacular revenge, with the hurdling specialist Akabusi unforgettably coming from behind on the anchor leg to outpace Pettigrew and win gold. Pettigrew has been found dead, aged 42, on the back seat of his car, near to his home in Chatham County, North Carolina. Police say there are no suspicious circumstances. Born in Macon, Georgia, Pettigrew first came to prominence while running as a student for St Augustine&apos;s College, in Raleigh, North Carolina, from where he graduated in 1993. But the considerable achievements of his athletics career were tainted by\u00a0a later admission that he had taken the performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin \u2013 commonly known as EPO \u2013 during the time when he was being coached by Trevor Graham, a name central to the Balco doping scandal that would later consume US\u00a0athletics. Pettigrew gave evidence in 2008 at the trial of Graham, who was also coach to the disgraced American sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, along with many other leading names from the sport. Graham was found guilty and barred from coaching by the US Track and Field Association, while many of his athletes faced jail, bans and\u00a0retrospective action whereby they were stripped of medals. Although he had never tested positive for banned drugs, Pettigrew told the court that he had taken EPO between 1997 and 2003. He was given a two-year ban from competition, a sanction that brought shame, if not a tangible penalty, because by then his running career was\u00a0over. During the time that Pettigrew admitted he had taken drugs, he was part of an all-conquering US 400m relay team, including one which broke the world record in July 1998 in a time of\u00a02\u00a0min 54.2 sec and one that won the 2000 Olympic gold medal in Sydney. The world record was later erased by the International Association of Athletics Federations (the sport&apos;s governing body), while the International Olympics Committee stripped the US athletes of\u00a0the relay medals. Pettigrew was also a part of the US team, along with Chris Jones, Tyree Washington and Jerome Young, that denied Britain a gold medal at the 1997 World Championships in Athens, beating Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch and Mark Richardson into second place. As Pettigrew admitted in\u00a0his court testimony, drugs had improved his performances: &quot;I was running incredible times as I was preparing for track meets and I was recovering better.&quot; By 2008 he had acquired a growing reputation as a coach. It was that, allied to his apparent remorse over the drugs issue, his willingness to speak out against their use and to co-operate with the Balco investigation, that persuaded his employers at the University of North Carolina that he should be allowed to keep his job. Pettigrew issued a statement through the university, admitting his action had been &quot;100% wrong. I have an obigation and duty to speak out against the use of\u00a0banned substances. I want to play a\u00a0role in teaching people, especially young athletes, to know the negatives far, far outweigh the benefits these substances may give you.&quot; Willie Goolsby, a coach who influenced Pettigrew&apos;s development as a young athlete said: &quot;He was an outstanding young man, a great athlete and was concerned about young people. He always enjoyed talking to young people about making it and he was a role model for kids.&quot; Pettigrew&apos;s boss at the University of\u00a0North Carolina, the athletics director Dick Baddour, admitted that keeping Pettigrew on the staff was a difficult decision but added: &quot;I was particularly impressed with the relationships he established with his student athletes and the pride he took in representing the university.&quot; However, many leading figures within\u00a0athletics were less forgiving. To some of his British rivals, he was identified as a cheat who had denied them their rightful places on the podium. One of Pettigrew&apos;s own teammates, Michael Johnson, who was stripped of the 2000 Olympic 400m relay medal after\u00a0Pettigrew&apos;s confession, remarked: &quot;I feel cheated, betrayed and let down.&quot; Pettigrew is survived by his wife, Cassandra, and son, Antonio Jnr. \u2022 Antonio Pettigrew, athlete, born 3 November 1967; died 10 August 2010 \u2022 This article was amended on 12 and 13 August 2010.

The warning comes as a separate international study published this week said that as much as 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be offset by biochar. Biochar involves burying cooked charcoal so that the carbon dioxide absorbed during the tree&apos;s growth remains safely locked away for thousands of years. The technique could remove billions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere every year. But it has divided environmentalists, with backing from Gaia theorist James Lovelock and Nasa scientist James Hansen, but opposition from critics who say there is not enough to land carry out biochar on a large scale. The report, commissioned by the government, looks at the stability and potential benefits of biochar in soil, as well as at the risks, including the danger of contaminants getting into soil. In addition to economic and logistical challenges, the report noted there are many scientific uncertainties about the role biochar might play. It is not clear how long the carbon would stay trapped in the soil or whether it enhances the quality of the soil as supporters claim, said Saran Sohi, leader of the University of Edinburgh&apos;s UK Biochar research centre and one of the report&apos;s authors. However, the report concludes &quot;biochar has a high carbon abatement efficiency&quot; and calls for more pilot schemes that could potentially &quot;advance rapidly the science, engineering, regulation and socioeconomic evaluation of biochar systems in the UK context&quot;. The other study, Sustainable biochar to mitigate global climate change led by scientists in the UK, US and Australia, paints a more positive picture. Biochar could offset 1.8bn tonnes of carbon emissions annually in its most successful scenario, it said, without endangering food security, habitat or soil conservation. &quot;These calculations show that biochar can play a significant role in the solution for the planet&apos;s climate change challenge,&quot; said the study&apos;s co-author Jim Amonette, a soil chemist at the Department of Energy&apos;s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. &quot;Biochar offers one of the few ways we can create power while decreasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. And it improves food production in the world&apos;s poorest regions by increasing soil fertility. It&apos;s an amazing tool.&quot; Separately, biochar experts said last week that global sustainability efforts are being hampered by an emphasis on English language research. At a seminar in Tokyo, Professor Shinogi Yoshiyuki from Kyushu university, said researchers into sustainable technologies around the world needed to share information. &quot;This is a global issue and we need to create a global network [of information],&quot; he commented. Yoshiyuki is vice-president of the Japan Biochar Association, which was set up last year to highlight the results of 30 years&apos; research into biochar technology in Japan. Sohi, who was at the seminar along with sustainability experts from the UK&apos;s Department of Energy and Climate Change, said his team&apos;s visit to Japan was &quot;a real opportunity to collaborate and link up research&quot;. He acknowledged that his report was based largely on English-language biochar research, but said there has been a willingness in both Japan and the UK to collaborate in researching the technology further. \u2022 Jane Dudman&apos;s travel expenses in Japan were paid for by the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations.

The number of people unaccounted for grew this week after officials in Kobe said they had lost track of 105 of the city&apos;s 847 centenarians. They include 18 &quot;super-centenarians&quot; \u2013 among them a 125-year-old woman whose registered address was turned into a park in 1981 and who would be older than the woman recognised as Japan&apos;s oldest citizen, 113-year-old Chiyono Hasegawa. In Osaka, 64 of 857 centenarians are missing. Officials in the city said today that one of them, a man registered as 127 years old, had in fact died in 1966. Japan&apos;s failure to maintain accurate records of its oldest citizens is being blamed on antiquated record-keeping, strict privacy laws and weakening family and community ties. &quot;It is shocking that even relatives don&apos;t know if their parents are alive or dead,&quot; Professor Yoshinori Hiroi, a specialist in public welfare at Chiba University, told broadcaster NHK. &quot;These cases were typical examples of thinning relationship among families and neighbours in Japan today.&quot; The discovery that so many elderly people are missing has sparked fears of widespread pension fraud in one of the world&apos;s fastest-greying societies. The health ministry is investigating the whereabouts of 840 people over the age of 85 in connection with potentially fraudulent pension claims. The inquiry was launched after police discovered the mummified corpse of Sogen Kato, listed as Tokyo&apos;s oldest man, in his family home 32 years after his death. Relatives have been arrested on suspicion of abandoning a body and receiving millions of yen in pension payments after his unreported death. Days later came the discovery that a 113-year-old woman listed as Tokyo&apos;s oldest resident had not been seen by her family for more than 20 years. Welfare officials have yet to locate Fusa Furuya, who was last seen in about 1986. With many of Japan&apos;s 47 prefectures yet to report the results of their search, the number of missing people is expected to rise. The fiasco is partly a symptom of Japan&apos;s impressive life expectancy: 86.4 years for women and 79.6 years for men. The country has 40,399 centenarians, more than triple the number a decade ago. According to one projection, that number will rise to well over half a million by the middle of the century. The gaping hole in local government records came to light as officials attempted to update records ahead of &quot;Respect for the Aged Day&quot; on 20 September, when residents who have turned, or are about to turn, 100, receive a silver chalice and congratulatory letter from the prime minister. This year the gifts, which have often been sent by post in the past, will be handed to the recipients in person. Experts have called for reform of the residency registration system, which does not require face-to-face contact to verify an individual&apos;s address. Japan&apos;s strict privacy laws also prevent welfare officials from entering homes if the occupants object. &quot;We need to be able to identify people with something like a social security number, but there is opposition to that because of privacy concerns,&quot; said Ryuichi Kaneko of the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research in Tokyo."}, {"sentences": ["Earlier today the sell-off that began yesterday spread to Asia, with the Nikkei in Tokyo closing 0.86% lower, having been down 2% early on."], "tags": ["Market turmoil", "Business", "Global economy", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-12T13:38:00Z", "title": "World stock markets on high alert as recession fears remain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/12/world-stock-markets-on-high-alert", "article": "Stock markets around the world remained nervous today after yesterday&apos;s sharp falls, amid lingering fears about the global economy&apos;s recovery from recession.

Fears that Britain could slide into a protracted depression intensified last night after the Bank of England warned of a long and &quot;choppy recovery&quot;, a day after the US Federal Reserve issued a wary economic outlook and amid a slew of gloomy figures on both sides of the Atlantic. China also released weaker than expected economic data. This saw investors flee from equities and into perceived safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold and the yen. Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities said: &quot;Some weaker than expected economic data, combined with the lower growth predictions from both the US and UK and the realisation that maybe the market had got a little ahead of itself in thinking that Mr Bernanke had some kind of magic wand that was going to make all the problems disappear led to a weak day for risk assets yesterday. &quot; The Bank of England&apos;s outlook intensified the debate over whether the economy is heading for a double-dip recession, or at least a period of very slow growth. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank defines depression as a period when output is below its previous peak, and predicts that in the UK&apos;s case this will last until 2012.

Chinese visitors to Japan have jumped 80% over the last year, following a relaxation on visa requirements, providing a much wanted boost in business at Japan&apos;s department stores and luxury outlets, where sales to domestic customers have long stagnated.

There has also been a rise in the number of Chinese employed in the service sector, including fast food outlets, cleaning businesses and small stores. Japanese born during the economic boom of the mid to late 1980s have become a parasite generation, living with and off their parents while shirking manual labour.

The Liancourt Rocks (or, if you are Japanese, Takeshima, or, if you are Korean, Dokdo) is a group of volcanic islets roughly midway between the two countries in the Sea of Japan (or the East Sea, if you are Korean). The politically charged nomenclature says everything about the schism these islands have inflicted on bilateral ties, 65 years after defeat in the second world war loosened Japan&apos;s colonial grip on the Korean peninsula. The islands&apos; symbolic importance, not to mention their rich fishing grounds and untapped gas deposits, still have the potential to drive a deep diplomatic wedge between Seoul and Tokyo. With both united in condemnation of North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme and the March sinking of the Cheonan, the Takeshima question is at its most delicately balanced for years. The competing claims are mired in historical ambiguity, and complicated by several name changes and cartographical evidence from myriad Korean, Japanese and western sources stretching back centuries. Only this month South Korea&apos;s media reported the discovery of a 1949 US military map that, according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, &quot;clearly states that Dokdo belongs to Korea&quot;. South Korea insists the islands were among the territories Japan was forced to return at the end of the war. By the time the sixth and final draft of the treaty of San Francisco appeared, however, confusion reigned. Takeshima had been omitted, along with thousands of other tiny islands. &quot;Dokdo is a Korean territory, so there is no need for a dispute with Japan,&quot; said Shin Yeon-sung, the general secretary of the Northeast Asian History Foundation, a Seoul-based body partly funded by the South Korean government. &quot;As far as we are concerned, Dokdo&apos;s omission from the San\u00a0Francisco treaty was purely for convenience&apos;s sake.&quot; To prove his point, Shin produces a copy of an 1877 map belonging to Japan&apos;s department of the interior that appears to rule out Japanese ownership, then another Japanese map that makes no mention of the islands. The first Japan really knew of the Takeshima, he said, was when imperial forces landed there in 1905 on their way to colonising the Korean mainland five years later. &quot;We have written, historical proof that Dokdo is part of Korea. The islands are first mentioned in 512 in the diary of the king of the Silla dynasty.&quot; At the highest level, the feud is being played down by Seoul and Tokyo. Japan recently postponed publication of its annual defence white paper \u2013 which promotes its claims to Takeshima \u2013 to avoid causing friction with South Korea ahead of the centenary of the start of Japanese colonial rule on 29 August. In another move designed to quell anti-Japanese sentiment, Japan&apos;s prime minister, Naoto Kan, last week expressed &quot;deep remorse&quot; for his country&apos;s 35-year occupation of Korea, a gesture welcomed by his counterpart, Lee Myung-bak, as &quot;a step forward&quot;. But ordinary South Koreans attach huge symbolic importance to Dokdo. Schools are being encouraged to deepen pupils&apos; emotional connection with the islands, while nationalists have toured the world to push Seoul&apos;s claims. Any counterclaim from Japan is guaranteed to provoke an angry backlash. When, in 2005, the Japanese prefecture of Shimane proclaimed 22 February &quot;Takeshima day&quot;, a South Korean mother and son sliced off their fingers in protest outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Today the islets are administered by a South Korean coastguard garrison and government officials, who live alongside the only permanent residents, an elderly fisherman and his wife. Japan, meanwhile, describes this presence as &quot;an illegal occupation&quot;. The Japanese foreign ministry notes that Seoul has consistently refused a 60-year-old offer to settle the dispute at the international court of justice in The Hague. &quot;There is no change in our position,&quot; said Takeshi Akamatsu, a ministry spokesman. &quot;But we don&apos;t want the territorial issue to harm our relations with South Korea. &quot;This is very simple. In light of the historical facts and international law it is clear that Takeshima is an inherent part of Japan. The Koreans have yet to demonstrate that they exercised control over the islands before the Japanese occupation. And we have documentary evidence to prove that they didn&apos;t.&quot; Shin, however, dismisses an international solution as a diplomatic red herring. &quot;We won&apos;t go to The Hague because this is not a legal issue,&quot; he said. &quot;But we also want to avoid this becoming a thorn in the side of bilateral ties. A hundred years after Japan&apos;s colonisation of Korea, it is time to look forward.&quot; Kim Seong-do, who has lived on the islets with his wife for more than 30 years, denies he is part of Seoul&apos;s propaganda machine. &quot;I went there voluntarily,&quot; he told the Guardian during a rare trip to the mainland for emergency dental treatment. &quot;As a Korean citizen, I am free to come and go as I please.&quot; The 70-year-old describes a life of comfortable detachment from mainstream society, but with long periods in which he and his 74-year-old wife, Shin-yeol, are at the mercy of the elements. &quot;Sometimes the wind is so strong we can&apos;t open the door or windows for days,&quot; he said. &quot;But we feel comfortable there. We don&apos;t like coming back to the mainland. Dokdo is such a beautiful place.&quot; After the long sea crossing, with just one quick refuelling stop on Ulleungdo island, 54 miles (87km) away, there are groans when the ferry&apos;s skipper informs us that high waves have made it impossible to dock at Takeshima/Dokdo. But a fleeting glimpse of the two rocks, now cast in silhouette as dusk descends, is enough for Lee Jae-eun. &quot;Even the American occupation forces said the islands are ours,&quot; said Lee, an office worker from Seoul. &quot;They are Korean. There&apos;s absolutely nothing to discuss with Japan.&quot; Rich source of a feud The Takeshima-Dokdo islets, located 134 miles from South Korea and 155 miles from Japan, are the peaks of a 2,300-metre-high undersea volcano. They are made up of two main islands and almost 90 rocks and reefs. Known in the west as the Liancourt Rocks, after a French whaling ship that was almost wrecked there in 1849, the islets appeared above the water about 2.7m years ago. A freshwater lagoon helps sustain about 80 species of plants, and dozens of birds and insects. The meeting of cold and warm water currents has led to a profusion of fish and other marine life. South Korean researchers say they have discovered dozens of new plankton and other species on Takeshima, but the presence of about 50 coastguard personnel, lighthouse keepers and government officials has also brought pollution to the area&apos;s coastline. The islands house people&apos;s accommodation, a dock, helicopter pad, and postbox as well as a solar power station that will provide 30%-40% of the energy needs. Tourists have been allowed to make short visits to Takeshima since 2004. Only a handful of Japanese take the trip each year. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2010. The original referred to the French whaling ship that was almost wrecked in 1949.

In these boringly discreet days such candour is extremely unusual but pantomime villains are rarely painted in more stereotypical colours than Cardiff City&apos;s latest signing. With the possible exception of David Beckham, few British footballers arouse more powerful emotions. Were CS Lewis still around to redraft the Chronicles of Narnia as a 21st\u2011century football fantasy, Becks and Bellers would surely serve as evocative symbols of good and evil. Or perhaps not. Beckham may have Princes William and Harry as well as politicians of all persuasions crowding in his corner, he may have helped win us the Olympics and look like helping secure the 2018 World Cup, yet Bellamy is a wonderful role model too. True he has a few more character blemishes \u2013 if not tattoos \u2013 than Beckham but throwing a chair at the former Newcastle United coach John Carver, attacking John Arne Riise with a golf club, giving Roberto Mancini persistent headaches and sending Alan Shearer abusive text messages do not necessarily make the Wales striker a wrong &apos;un. Instead they reflect admittedly immature manifestations of an intense hatred of hypocrisy, passionate, if sometimes brutal, honesty and an essentially healthy willingness to question authority. On planet football such traits serve as shorthand for subversion but in Sierra Leone they are regarded as heroic. Amid the shanty towns of one of the world&apos;s poorest countries idols do not come bigger than the striker Sir Bobby Robson dubbed &quot;the gobbiest footballer I&apos;ve ever met&quot;. It all started when Bellamy blithely ignored Liverpool&apos;s warning that a summer holiday in Freetown was really not a good idea and, out of glorious curiosity, boarded a west Africa-bound flight. Since then scores of children have seen their lives transformed beyond all measure by the hundreds of thousands of pounds the Welshman keeps pouring into his self\u2011founded Freetown football foundation. Much more than a mere glory factory, it makes stringent academic and social demands of those it rescues from poverty with standards maintained by annual fortnight-long visits from Bellamy. &quot;Sierra Leone&apos;s infra-structure is so weak everyone said Craig was crazy,&quot; recalls Tom Vernon, the inspirational founder of Ghana&apos;s famous Right to Dream academy and the man Bellamy chose to kick-start his project. &quot;Fortunately he didn&apos;t listen \u2013 and I have to say Craig is one of the most businesslike people I&apos;ve ever met.&quot; Such rigour extends to an insistence that potential new African employees are flown to the UK for personal interview by Bellamy. Such diligence does not surprise Eddie Niedzwiecki. &quot;Craig&apos;s a perfectionist \u2013 and he gets frustrated when others don&apos;t meet his standards,&quot; the former Manchester City coach says. &quot;But the thing people often don&apos;t understand is that he&apos;s a team player. It&apos;s not all about him.&quot; England&apos;s former captain is also a perfectionist, but the difference is that, all too often, &quot;Mr Posh&quot; revels in seeing assorted worlds revolve around Brand Beckham. I&apos;ll never forget being in Beijing&apos;s Workers&apos; Stadium \u2013 supposedly a citadel to communism \u2013 alongside thousands of adoring Chinese wearing identical Beckham T-shirts as he made his Real Madrid debut on a pre-season tour. Or, a few days later, standing in the lobby of Tokyo&apos;s Four Seasons Hotel as security guards strained to prevent hundreds of hysterical women from literally getting their hands on him. One girl had even brought her tiny baby along, in the hope Beckham might perform a &quot;blessing&quot;. Later that evening Lu\u00eds Figo and company looked on askance as their new team-mate permitted a Japanese flunkey to protect his head from teeming rain by dashing on to the pitch with an umbrella at the final whistle. Bellamy would have told &quot;umbrella man&quot; where to go \u2013 which probably explains why he lives in south Wales rather than southern California. Joining Cardiff may waste a very real, very precious, talent in much the same way that representing LA Galaxy has hardly enhanced Beckham&apos;s twilight years. Yet at least it is a loan move informed by the romantic idealism implicit in fulfilling a lifelong desire to play for his hometown club.

Fifteen-year-old Beckii, Sam reported,&quot;has big eyes, a sharp chin, fluffy hair and slender limbs. It&apos;s a look that, in the cartoon worlds of anime and manga, is about as cute as it gets. So when Beckii posted a video of herself dancing to a Japanese pop song in her bedroom at home on the Isle of Man, she became an instant internet sensation 6,000 miles away.&quot; As a BBC documentary revealed, many of Beckii&apos;s Japanese fans are probably a decade or three older than her. They like to give her presents \u2013 one particularly generous individual sent her boxes of noodles and a Fender bass guitar for her birthday. Beckii&apos;s studies have probably suffered because of the travelling and the TV and the photoshoots. Still, her dad believes, &quot;It would be a tragedy to miss that 15 minutes of fame.&quot; Would it? Would it really? &quot;I&apos;m not convinced it&apos;s going to work,&quot; Wollaston countered.

At least she was dressed in her promotional pictures and wasn&apos;t having a boob job and aspiring to sleep with a footballer.&quot; That&apos;s one way of putting the teenager&apos;s experiences into context. HoshinoSakura, who according to her profile is a model in Tokyo, offered another. &quot;I think you completely misunderstand the relationship between generations [in Japan],&quot; she suggested. &quot;The virtues of youth, vitality and health and beauty are very esteemed here. We have the &apos;idol&apos; culture where young girls and boys that represent some aspect of these virtues are promoted on TV and in the music industry and become big stars.&quot; If only she&apos;d left it there. Instead, she went on: &quot;Secondly, we are not so oppressed sexually as Europeans seem to be.

Or rather, he was explaining why he couldn&apos;t explain how to write. &quot;When you&apos;re consciously trying to write,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the words just don&apos;t come out. To function efficiently as a writer, 95% of your brain has to teleport off into nowhere, taking its neuroses with it, leaving the confident, playful 5% alone to operate the controls. To put it another way: words are like cockroaches; only once the lights are off do they feel free to scuttle around on the kitchen floor.&quot; That struck a chord with several hundred of you, which might have surprised Brooker.

My answer? &quot;I want to cycle round the world and raise money for charity.&quot; A big &quot;ahhhhh&quot; resounded around the school hall. &quot;So sweet.&quot; Little did they know that 20 years later I would be setting off on a 9,000-mile journey to India. On my own. Carrying everything I needed on my steel-framed bicycle, affectionately known as &quot;Shirley&quot;. I would like to say it was planned to the nth degree and that everything ran like clockwork. In reality, I was arrested twice, chased by wild dogs, beaten (and wined and dined) by the mafia, attacked by bandits \u2026 On my last day I was cycling through the Bandipur wildlife park in southern India. My flowery bike wasn&apos;t great camouflage and startled a number of elephants as I passed. They decided to charge. The advice is &quot;if an elephant charges you, stand your ground, and bow your head to show respect&quot;. What tosh! With 30 tonnes of muscle and bone crashing towards me, destroying small trees and making the ground vibrate under my feet, there was no way I was standing firm. I dropped my bike into third gear and floored it. Another time I ran out of food and water in the desert and was woken one morning to find maggots in my hair and beard. Yet the greatest memories are of so many wonderful people I met in every country, who invited me into their homes to celebrate local festivals, play music, dance, sing, eat, and share each other&apos;s cultures, beliefs, history and way of life. After six months&apos; cycling, I rolled into Chembakolli, a tiny village, my final destination. It was my 31st birthday \u2013 20 years since I had first dreamed up the idea. I was greeted by a carnival of people playing drums, singing, cheering, and waving banners saying &quot;Happy birthday&quot;. All I could do was crouch down and cry tears of joy.

See his blog at mrbent.blogspot.com  Conservation protest camp in Tasmania I was on a year out in Australia, and after a few months in the red centre I decided to go to Tasmania to escape the heat, and to see big trees. The island is home to a vast forest of Eucalyptus regnans, the largest flowering plants in the world. Within a few days of arriving I heard word of protest activity in the Upper Florentine Valley, a pristine corner of virgin forest under threat from various logging projects. I decided to hitch there, and for the last part of the journey I rode with TK, a Canadian biologist who had been living at the Florentine camp for two years. He gave me a brief history of the area as we entered the forest. These Eucalyptus regnans, at 60m tall, may not be the biggest trees in the world \u2013 one California redwood is 98m, for example \u2013 but never, TK assured me, would I feel as dwarfed by nature as when among the giants of the Florentine Valley. The protest has been going on since 2006, when Forestry Tasmania began extending the road into the forest. Protesters live in the trees so that they won&apos;t be cut down, though there has been much confrontation and some arrests. &quot;Don&apos;t ever go in there,&quot; TK said as we passed a lonely, redbrick pub. &quot;If they think you look like one of us \u2013 a week or so at the camp should do it \u2013 they&apos;ll kick the shit out of you.&quot; The local climate is incredibly wet, adding a ghostly white cover to the giant trees. Rain-soaked banners high up in the branches \u2013 &quot;Toot for Tassy&apos;s Forests&quot;, &quot;Still Wild, Still Threatened&quot; \u2013 were visible from the roadside. But no amount of neck-craning can quantify the trees&apos; size. For an eco-friendly backpacker, the Florentine camp provided a cheap and exciting alternative to a volunteer project. Bring food donations, good conversation and a useful pair of hands and the vast Tasmanian wilderness is yours to explore. Camp life was centred on communal meals, firewood runs, clean-ups and lookout reports. Each night, wet hair and cloth steamed by a campfire under a blue tarpaulin. Plates of food were passed around \u2013 curried baked beans topped with fresh parsley. A camp veteran of six months told me how she was humbled by a spectacular light display from the aurora australis. Another veteran had a doctorate in zoology, and used the camp as a base for a statistical project on the Tasmanian devil population. I spent a couple of days on the west coast&apos;s Bay of Fires \u2013 a wild, windswept clash of white-sand beaches, turquoise water, brooding skies and red-stained granite rocks. As well as being a good place to become actively involved in forest conservation, the camp was where people shared travellers&apos; tips \u2013 a valuable resource that is often ignored in favour of a guidebook.Clyde Macfarlane, 23, anthropology graduate/freelance writer, Chichester.

It is two years since I returned from Jeddah, but when I close my eyes on a grey English day I&apos;m walking the city&apos;s ancient streets again, seeking out Bukhari chicken or Egyptian flat bread. Money was my motivation for going to a country famous for exporting oil and terrorism; it has some of the best paid English teaching jobs in the world, and I managed to save \u00a38,500 in just six months working at a boys&apos; school there. I chose my new home city carefully. As the gateway to Mecca, through which the Muslim world passes on the hajj, the port of Jeddah is Saudi Arabia&apos;s most cosmopolitan and liberal city. My new Saudi friends warned me against even visiting the capital Riyadh, home of Wahhabism. In Jeddah I knew Saudis, as well as western women, who walked the streets unaccompanied by a man and with their heads uncovered, something they could never do in Riyadh. Jeddah also boasts some of the world&apos;s best coral reefs. Diving on the Saudi side of the Red Sea offers the same underwater riches as the Egyptian Sinai, but without the crowds. On the downside, I didn&apos;t speak to a woman for my first two months there, but I eventually found a private beach where the sexes could mix. My first lesson on a jetski was fleeing the coastguard. A Palestinian girl had taken me for a ride when we saw their ship approaching. For fear of being caught together we hid in a cove. Women are barred from driving any kind of motorised vehicles so I had to take the controls and when they passed we sped out of the cove and back to the beach James-Bond style. Bizarre experiences inform my anecdotes about Saudi Arabia \u2013 gate-crashing a wedding and ending up on stage in front of 2,000 guests, my Saudi girlfriend&apos;s mother catching us at my apartment together \u2026 But what I long for is visiting the crumbling, centuries-old buildings of Old Jeddah, smoking shisha in coffeshops and sipping sweet Adeni tea with a friend. The kingdom is a harsh place, but the people who live there are the most hospitable I&apos;ve ever met. I went for the riyals but came back richer in so many other ways.David Trayner, 29, news reporter, Leicester  Finding my own volunteer work and inspiration in Asia In October 2008 two friends and I started our gap year in Thailand. We began in Bangkok, where we shopped non-stop on Khao San Road, then moved to Koh Samui to learn Muay Thai kickboxing, and up to Pai for yoga and massage courses. We went across to Laos for cooking lessons, and it was here that I went into a school and helped with English lessons. I&apos;d always been put off volunteering by the idea of having to pay a company to work for nothing, but this was free. We moved onto Vietnam, and back to marathon shopping, but I just wasn&apos;t feeling it. I&apos;d got a taste for doing something &quot;better&quot; and I wanted to do more of it. So I left my mates and went ahead to Cambodia. The day I arrived I found an HIV orphanage called House of Family, where I volunteered. I asked the doctor what happened to all the other orphans \u2013 there were only 30 kids at the orphanage but the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia is among the highest in Asia. She explained that they were living at the rubbish dumps, so that is where I went. I discovered children eating dirt, sleeping on dirt and walking barefoot on burning toxic waste. It was inhumane and unacceptable. So I came back to England, borrowed a video camera, raised \u00a31,000 on Facebook and returned two weeks later to do the first Small Steps project. I gave wellington boots, clothes aid, food and water to the children. Then I came home, edited the film, screened it and got an amazing reaction from the public. I registered Small Steps as a charity and intend to repeat the project \u2013 called Around The World in 80 Dumps \u2013 on inhabited dumps around the world, to create awareness and help people. I am now the director of Small Steps, the next project is in Nicaragua. Amy Hanson, 30, London.

But as I sat in front of the easyJet website this summer I couldn&apos;t quite bring myself to double the size of my carbon footprint for the year with just one click. Instead, I decided I&apos;d rely on my thumb and the kindness of strangers and take a risk on that most controversial form of transport, particularly for women: the hitchhike. A friend would accompany me as far as Zagreb, then I&apos;d go on alone to Israel, through Turkey, Syria and Jordan. Three hours after posting a request on the website Gumtree (gumtree.com) we had a lift from Hounslow East in London to Mannheim in southern Germany. A week and three lifts later, we were couchsurfing (couchsurfing.org) in Berlin. We became pros at working service stations, asking every car that pulled in whether they had space for two travellers: &quot;You go?&quot; \u2026 point at map, smile, get in. There were BMWs, a limousine and a Slovenian rocking out to Pink Floyd. In some cars, especially after a night spent camping just off the hard-shoulder, my head would droop and 12 hours later I&apos;d wake to realise I&apos;d missed an entire country (sorry Slovakia, Bulgaria and northern Israel), but the further east I went, the more unfamiliar the scenery became and the more often my eyes would stay open. Even the worst experience could turn into a high point. We were dropped just north of Munich in the rain as it was getting dark, and were stuck for two hours, soaking wet, our spirits low. A couple in a people-wagon finally saved the day. They planned to drop us at a service station where we could hitch a lift into Austria. We talked and joked about small things \u2013 the scenery, the baptism that they&apos;d been to. I told them about my year as a parish administrator and the reverence that the baptism register commanded. By the end of that conversation they had decided I was a girl with an unambiguous calling who had put faith on hold to struggle against climate change. It turned out the man was a Protestant priest, and rather than drop us at a service station to pitch our tent in the rain, they offered us a night in their spare flat in the Bavarian mountains \u2013 hot water, fresh towels, beds all to ourselves, and for free \u2013 bliss. I spent over a month in the Middle East and saw sights that the guidebooks are yet to discover. Relying on the famed Syrian kindness, I was taken in, fed and cared for by a family for four days. They then drove me most of the three hours to Mar Musa monastery, enjoyed by few travellers. In Israel I lost myself in the carefree parties of Tel Aviv, making friends with kids who&apos;d just finished military service (&quot;Who cares about peace? We just want peace of mind&quot;). The next day I went to Jerusalem to yell in protest with the activists in the West Bank. I was given access to both worlds, the only condition that I would listen to the stories that they told about the other side. And it was this necessity to listen that made my decision to hitchhike so much more than just a cheap way to travel. Each was an invitation to get close to someone. Hitchhiking is the start of a story where anything might happen. You escape the check-in queue and have faith in the moment, in people and yourself. You begin a story with each person you meet. Living another person&apos;s life, if only for one journey, will teach you more about their culture than any guidebook.Tamsin Omond, 25, environmental campaigner, London. Follow her @tamsinomond on twitter Working on a farm in Scotland For many of my generation, the gap year between school and university was spent volunteering in orphanages or sunning on an Aussie beach. Being pretentious but poor I decided instead that my fate lay on a Scottish island. I had been to Mull on holiday and figured I would spend my days wandering the beach, reading epic novels and having flings with strapping farmers. I was a troubled teenager, desperate to escape the woes of life in a remote Kentish village, terrifyingly clueless about my career path. When I told her my plans, my mother, somewhat spitefully, said, &quot;How on earth are you going to do that?&quot;, which galvanized me into asking the tourist office if there were any friendly farmers. Fortune had it that I managed to speak to a girl called Claire, a conversation that changed my life. Claire knew of just the man, a farmer in the south of Mull who periodically &quot;took in&quot; young folk like me to help out on his 22,000 acres. Our brief phone call (he had an impossibly posh accent) went something like this: &quot;Have you ever worked on a farm?&quot; &quot;Erm, nope.&quot; &quot;Know anything about farming?&quot; &quot;Nope&quot; &quot;Are you fit?&quot; &quot;Not particularly&quot; &quot;I like your chutzpah. I&apos;ll pay your coach fare. If we like you, you can stay.&quot; I stepped off the ferry in cropped, dyed red hair, round glasses, ripped jeans and Dr. Marten boots, prompting the farmer to squint at me in disbelief and ask if I was a punk. Lochbuie \u2013 where I lived \u2013 is a 17-house village, beautiful and appealing to holidaying wildlife lovers, archaeologists and photographers. Sites include the uninhabited 15th-century Moy Castle and the impressive (inhabited) 18th-century Lochbuie House, overlooking the loch. Mull remains one of the most beautiful, unspoilt places in the UK. I returned recently and nothing had changed. I hated it for the first few weeks. But the farmer and his wife persevered through my astonishing ignorance about the world and I went from self-obsessed teenager who&apos;d never done a day&apos;s work in her life (bar the sort that you could give up if you didn&apos;t like it) to a useful (ish) member of the community. I emerged at the end of the experience fitter, fatter, better-read and able to sleep. Hazel Davis, 33, journalist, Huddersfield Family gap year We lived in Cornwall in a beautiful barn conversion with stunning valley views and only a short drive to the glorious Atlantic coast: my wife Nicki, with a beauticians business in Wadebridge, 15-year-old Michael, addicted to Xbox games, Emmaline, 13 going on 19, and me, John, full-time artist. Wanting to see the world had been nagging at me for years. In the end we decided to just do it. The kids could be schooled as we travelled and the experiences they&apos;d get would be possibly life-changing \u2013 hell, we might even find somewhere better to live than Cornwall. Having sold everything to fund the trip we had just three weeks to prepare, decide where to go and buy our round-the-world tickets: we opted for Japan, south-east Asia, Australia, New Zealand, a stop in the Cook islands and finally the United States. The furthest we&apos;d ever been prior to this was Bulgaria. We flew to Tokyo the day after Boxing Day, and stayed with a family in rural Japan, eating sushi with them each day and trying to communicate with gesticulations and props \u2013 sake seemed to help the conversations somewhat. Dressed in traditional kimono and samurai we visited Buddhist and Shinto temples on New Year&apos;s Day. We went on to learn to dive in Thailand, helped out at a charitable school in Cambodia, camped in the Australian outback and skied in August in New Zealand. But constantly moving on every few days can be exhausting, especially for kids, so sometimes we&apos;d just slob and watch DVDs in a rented apartment. The experiences have been so many and varied, and has been highly rewarding for the whole family. We&apos;ll have plenty of stories to &quot;entertain&quot; our friends and relatives at Christmas when we return in December.John Tregembo, 52, Cornwall. See his travel blog at johntregembo.co.uk.

And in the 1970s and 1980s, overweight men in leotards wrestled each other for the delight of the nation on ITV&apos;s Saturday afternoon World of Sport, presented by Dickie Davies. The golden age of British wrestling, alas, has long since passed, and American pro-wrestling is in the ascendant. Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks RIP. All hail WWE. Critics complain that wrestling is not what it used to be, and that it&apos;s all just a fake. But this is to miss the point. As Roland Barthes pointed out long ago, wrestling is not a sport, it&apos;s a spectacle. In their book, Between the Ropes: Wrestling&apos;s Greatest Triumphs and Failures (2006), Brian Fritz and Christopher Murray admit that &quot;the punches and kicks are pulled and the in-ring action is mainly choreographed, but the fakery ends there. Outside the ring, pro-wrestling is much different. Real men. Real women. Real families. Real injuries. Real problems.&quot; And in the world of wrestling there has never been a family more real, more injured, and with more real problems than the Von Erichs. There have been many famous wrestling families: the Briscoes, the Bockwinkels, and of course the Funks, who run the Funking Conservatory wrestling academy in Ocala, Florida, where aspiring pro-wrestlers can go to learn the craft. But according to the wrestling writer Steve Slagle, no wrestling family has known the fame and renown of the Von Erichs, who &quot;experienced fan love and hysteria not unlike what the Beatles provoked when they first arrived on the shores of America&quot;. The story of the Von Erichs is a tale of extraordinary triumph and unparalleled tragedy. Fritz Von Erich was the ring name of Jack Adkisson, who took up wrestling in Texas in the mid-50s. Adkisson&apos;s Von Erich ring persona was a Nazi-sympathising thug whose signature move was called the Iron Claw, a one-handed grip in which he squeezed his opponent&apos;s head until they bled. Von Erich became an immediate success, winning the NWA USA heavyweight title three times. But in 1959, tragedy struck the Adkisson family when Jack&apos;s seven-year-old son Jack Jr was electrocuted and died. It was a terrible blow, but Jack kept on wrestling, and encouraged his other sons to enter the sport. Kevin, &quot;The Golden Warrior&quot;, Von Erich&apos;s second son, entered the ring in 1976, and his brother David, &quot;Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;, soon after. Von Erich&apos;s fourth son, Kerry, &quot;The Texas Tornado&quot;, was perhaps the greatest of them all \u2013 massive, good-looking, a showman. By\u00a0the 1980s, the Von Erichs had achieved worldwide fame with their own syndicated TV show. Fifth\u00a0son Mike was persuaded into the\u00a0ring in 1983. In 1984, tragedy struck the family again. David was found dead in his hotel room in Tokyo. The official report into his death concluded that he had died of acute enteritis. Then, after an injury, Mike developed toxic shock syndrome: he killed himself in 1987. Chris Von Erich, the sixth son, who was only 5ft 5in, attempted to follow his brothers into the ring but could not emulate their success. He killed himself in 1991. After a motorcycle accident in 1986, Kerry had to have a foot amputated, and in 1993, having been convicted for possessing painkillers without a prescription, he shot himself at the family ranch. Five of the six Von Erich brothers were dead. The surviving Von Erich brother, Kevin, lives in Hawaii. Jack died in 1997. The Von Erichs were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009. According to the family website, vonerich.com, Mattel has recently announced that they will soon be releasing action figures of Kerry and Kevin Von Erich in their WWE Legends\u00a0series."}, {"sentences": ["The recognition came early on Monday, when Tokyo said that Japan&apos;s economy was valued at about $1.28 trillion in the second quarter, slightly below China&apos;s $1.33 trillion."], "tags": ["China", "World news", "Economic policy", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-21T23:04:58Z", "title": "China's spectacular ascendance begins to reshape the world economy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/22/china-economic-growth-japan", "article": "After three decades of spectacular growth, China passed Japan in the second quarter to become the world&apos;s second-largest economy behind the US, according to government figures released on Monday. The milestone, though anticipated, is the most striking evidence yet of China&apos;s ascendance and that the rest of the world will have to reckon with a new economic superpower. The recognition came early on Monday, when Tokyo said that Japan&apos;s economy was valued at about $1.28 trillion in the second quarter, slightly below China&apos;s $1.33 trillion. Experts say unseating Japan \u2014 and in recent years passing Germany, France and Great Britain \u2014 underscores China&apos;s growing clout and bolsters forecasts that China will pass the US as the world&apos;s biggest economy as early as 2030. America&apos;s gross domestic product was about $14 trillion in 2009. &quot;This has enormous significance,&quot; said Nicholas Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. &quot;It reconfirms what&apos;s been happening for the better part of a decade: China has been eclipsing Japan economically. For everyone in China&apos;s region, they&apos;re now the biggest trading partner rather than the US or Japan.&quot; But while Japan&apos;s economy is mature and its population ageing, China is in the throes of urbanisation and is far from developed, analysts say, meaning it has a much lower standard of living, as well as a lot more room to grow. Just five years ago, China&apos;s GDP was about half of Japan&apos;s. China&apos;s per capita income is more on a par with those of impoverished nations like Algeria, El Salvador and Albania \u2013 close to $3,600 \u2013 than that of the US, where it is about $46,000. Yet there is little disputing that under the Communist party, China has begun to reshape the way the global economy functions by virtue of its growing dominance of trade, its huge hoard of foreign exchange reserves and US government debt and its voracious appetite for natural resources. China is already a major driver of global growth. The country&apos;s leaders have grown more confident on the international stage and have begun to assert greater influence in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with things like special trade agreements and multibillion-dollar resource deals. &quot;They&apos;re exerting a lot of influence on the global economy and becoming dominant in Asia,&quot; said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell and former head of the International Monetary Fund&apos;s China division. &quot;A lot of other economies in the region are essentially riding on China&apos;s coattails, and this is remarkable for an economy with a low per capita income.&quot; Beijing is also beginning to shape global dialogues on a range of issues, analysts said. Last year it asserted that the dollar must be phased out as the world&apos;s primary reserve currency. &quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; said Wang Tao, an economist at UBS in Beijing. &quot;China is still a developing country. So it has a lot of room to grow. And China has the biggest impact on commodity prices \u2013 in Russia, India, Australia and Latin America.&quot; There are huge challenges ahead, though. Economists say China is too heavily dependent on exports and investment and needs to encourage greater domestic consumption \u2014 something it has struggled to do. Global companies are making a more aggressive push into the country, in some cases moving research and development centres there. Some analysts say that while China is eager to assert itself as a financial and economic power \u2013 and to push its state companies to &quot;go global&quot; \u2013 it is reluctant to play a greater role in the debate over climate change or how to slow the growth of greenhouse gases. China passed the US in 2006 to become the world&apos;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, which scientists link to global warming. But China also has an ambitious programme to cut the energy it uses for each unit of economic output by 20% by the end of 2010, compared to 2006. Assessing what China&apos;s new clout means is complicated. While the country is still poor per capita, it has an authoritarian government capable of taking decisive action \u2013 to stimulate the economy, build new projects and invest in specific industries. That, Lardy at the Peterson Institute said, gives the country unusual power. &quot;China is already the primary determiner of the price of virtually every major commodity,&quot; he said. &quot;And the Chinese government can be much more decisive in allocating resources in a way that other governments of this level of per capita income cannot.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The fractions of seconds flicker past on the CCTV footage from the Exelco store in Tokyo&apos;s upmarket Ginza shopping district.", "Their modus operandi was remarkably similar to that used by other gang members in Tokyo four years later.", "Among them was an earlier robbery in Tokyo \u2013 deemed the biggest in Japanese history \u2013 in which the \u00a317m\u00a0necklace encrusted with 116\u00a0diamonds and known as the Comtesse de Vend\u00f4me was taken.", "Japanese police believe jewels from the Exelco raid were sold by a female Italian jewellery broker who took the same flight from Tokyo to Paris as one of the thieves.", "Earlier this month, Montenegran Rifat Hadziahmetovic, believed to be one of the two Tokyo thieves, was extradited from Spain (where he had been wanted in connection with the theft of \u00a3490,000 worth of luxury watches in Tenerife) to Japan.", "Aware of the gang&apos;s reputation for springing its own members from custody, they ferried him from the airport to Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji police station in a bulletproof vehicle, accompanied by two helicopters.", "A similar meeting had been held in Monaco in 2009, where Tokyo police officers had dazzled their counterparts with their &quot;model&quot; report on the Exelco raid."], "tags": ["Crime", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-23T20:00:06Z", "title": "The hunt for the Pink Panther gang", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/23/pink-panther-jewel-thieves", "article": "The fractions of seconds flicker past on the CCTV footage from the Exelco store in Tokyo&apos;s upmarket Ginza shopping district. As the clock races forward, an elegantly suited, tie-less western man enters through the front door and turns left towards a display cabinet. A second man walks in under an umbrella, his mouth and nose covered by a white anti-contamination mask. He reaches into a small rucksack and takes out a gun. The seconds run by on the clock. The first man calmly opens a cabinet and picks out two items \u2013 a diamond-studded tiara and a jewelled necklace. The second man squirts a short burst of tear gas at the employees. Then they turn around and walk out. The clock shows 36.02 seconds. This is the time it took the Pink Panther gang, the world&apos;s premier &quot;white glove&quot; crooks, to commit one of the cleanest jewellery heists in Japanese history \u2013 netting almost \u00a32m-worth of gold and precious stones. By the time the employees could react, the two men had disappeared. They were already weaving through Ginza&apos;s heavy traffic on their getaway vehicles \u2013 later identified by police as bicycles. Meanwhile, in Dubai, two Audi saloon cars \u2013 one black, one white \u2013 have driven across the polished marble floors of the Wafi mall and smashed into the windows of a jewellery shop. Amazed shoppers watch the scene as men in black balaclavas run into the shop while the alarm rings loudly. Inside, jewellery cabinets are smashed open. One car honks its horn twice. The security cameras pick out three men hurrying back into the cars. They take off, headlights on as they speed through the mall. Another \u00a31.9m-worth of jewellery has disappeared. The Pink Panther gang has struck again. In the era of globalisation, crime knows few frontiers. Jewellery thieves go wherever jewels are to be found, and the Pink Panther gang (so dubbed by the Daily Mail after a London raid in 2003, which mirrored a similar raid in a Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau film) knows where the very best are on display. They strike in Dubai, Japan, Switzerland, London, Paris or Monte Carlo. Interpol estimates that they have carried out more than 150 raids, netting \u00a3200m-worth of jewellery and watches in that time. &quot;They are engaged in high-value jewellery robberies, burglaries and aggravated theft around the globe,&quot; explains Christos Parthenis, a Greek police captain who heads the special Interpol unit that coordinates Project Pink Panther \u2013 the worldwide battle against the thieves. &quot;To our knowledge, no one has died because of their actions, but they can be violent and they carry fire arms to threaten and intimidate. They are itinerant groups of professionals who mainly originate from the former Yugoslavia.&quot; Out of a core of crooks from the mountains and valleys of Montenegro&apos;s Cetinje region, the gang has reportedly morphed into a wider alliance of groups with members mostly from Balkan countries. Unfortunately for Interpol and police forces in the two-dozen countries where they operate, the Pink Panther gang possess a certain style and glamour. The casual insouciance with which they walk into the world&apos;s greatest gem stores \u2013 used only to greeting the very, very wealthy \u2013 and walk away with whatever they want is at once breathtakingly audacious and coolly simple. In one raid in St Tropez, they wore flowery summer shirts and escaped in a speedboat. &quot;They are very well organised and they know exactly what they are after,&quot; says a detective in Switzerland, where the Panthers have struck at least a dozen times in three years. &quot;The proof is that they simply ignore some valuable stuff on display and take what is beside it.&quot; Their jobs rarely last more than three minutes \u2013 which they have repeatedly proven is easily enough time to lift more than \u00a31m-worth of loot. Their Raffles-style techniques have earned them something of a global, romantic legend, heightened by their having emerged from one of the poorer corners of Europe to steal only from the impossibly wealthy. Indeed, when a recent report in the New Yorker suggested the Panthers&apos; inventive ways of escaping the poverty of their home regions in the Balkans inevitably provoked sympathy, Interpol felt it necessary to write a complaint. &quot;The victim is not the man wielding the gun, however colourful his alleged derring-do,&quot; wrote Interpol&apos;s Pietro Calcaterra. &quot;The victim in an armed robbery is the person lying on a shop floor with a\u00a0gun pointed at his head. It&apos;s the shop assistant shot in the face in Vienna in November 2005, during a robbery attributed to the Pink Panthers.&quot; The latter robbery, Calcaterra told me, was at the Hohensteiner jeweller&apos;s shop in Eisenstadt. &quot;One of the offenders shot an employee in the mouth with a pistol, causing him serious injuries.&quot; Awareness of the Pink Panthers as an international phenomenon was born in London. It was here, in May 2003, that Nebojsa Denic and a second man, believed to be called Predrag Vujosevic, walked into Graff&apos;s on New Bond Street. Their modus operandi was remarkably similar to that used by other gang members in Tokyo four years later. Their tools included smart suits, wigs, an umbrella, a pistol and a hammer. In three minutes they grabbed 47 pieces of diamond-studded jewellery worth \u00a323m. Shop assistants recalled Denic pulling out a large Magnum pistol. &quot;It was like a Dirty Harry gun,&quot; one said later. &quot;It was so long his arm went up in the air as he pulled this pistol out.&quot; Unfortunately for Denic, security man Simon Stearman decided to ignore the gun and give chase. Denic fired a shot, but Stearman bundled him to the ground and sat on him. &quot;After I had taken him to the floor I was in a rage,&quot; the Falkand Islands veteran told a court later. &quot;The worst thing I could think of to do was to pull his wig off. I did and I told him he looked stupid \u2013 with a lot of expletives.&quot; The second man had fled on a motor-scooter with much of the loot, but Britain&apos;s biggest ever jewellery-heist was half-solved almost before it had begun. The search for his accomplices led Scotland Yard detectives to Paris, where French and British police jointly identified up to 20 robberies that seemed to involve a similar gang of eastern Europeans. Among them was an earlier robbery in Tokyo \u2013 deemed the biggest in Japanese history \u2013 in which the \u00a317m\u00a0necklace encrusted with 116\u00a0diamonds and known as the Comtesse de Vend\u00f4me was taken. Police now believe the gang has some 150 members and has been working since the late 1990s.     Rifat Hadziahmetovic was extradited from Spain to Japan this month. Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images    It took until four years after the Graff robbery, however, as the gang returned to Ginza and struck in Dubai, for Interpol to set up a special project to track the Pink Panthers as they moved across the globe. &quot;We are talking not about one gang, but about many gangs with links between them,&quot; explained Parthenis. &quot;The makeup of the groups changes as new people come in, but there are some core criminals. There are key figures who are involved in several robberies, but we cannot really talk of a pyramid or leader.&quot; In a spectacular 2003 escape, gang member Dragan Mikic was sprung from a prison at Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne in France. His liberators fired rounds from a Kalashnikov at the prison tower and came equipped with wire cutters and sets of ladders. &quot;They can be very violent when they engage with the police or liberate fellow comrades from jail,&quot; warned Parthenis. The Pink Panthers know what they are looking for. In police jargon, their raids are often &quot;pre-targeted&quot;. It is as if they already have buyers for their loot. Investigators speculate that often they are working as contractors for black-market jewellery dealers, who commission them to carry out raids. So where do the jewels end up? &quot;That is the million-dollar question,&quot; says Parthenis. So far, catching the thieves has proved easier than recovering the goods. The delicately worked pieces of jewellery they steal are almost certainly broken up. A tiara or necklace rapidly becomes a collection of precious stones and melted-down platinum or gold. &quot;When the jewellery has diamonds and so on, it is very easy to extract them and put them separately in the legal market. The main body of the gold can be melted down and you quickly lose track. There are several ways you can try to track the loot but it is not that easy,&quot; he\u00a0explains. Police believe they are finally getting close to those who &quot;fence&quot; the loot on the black market \u2013 where a \u00a365,000 watch may go for a third of the price \u2013 although Parthenis does not want to be too specific. &quot;Let&apos;s say we can speculate that this goes to illegal markets in Europe, and some of the loot seems to be pre-targeted. It could be in eastern Europe, or in some countries in southern Europe. Every country has this kind of illegal market.&quot; Police from other countries told the New Yorker&apos;s David Samuels that the gang moved with surprising impunity around Italy and parts of the former Yugoslavia. Japanese police believe jewels from the Exelco raid were sold by a female Italian jewellery broker who took the same flight from Tokyo to Paris as one of the thieves. Detectives suspect they were sold at a shop near Rome. The stones are sometimes handed over at a roadside rendezvous soon after a heist, explained one gang member, with some buyers reportedly turning up in vans with their own specialised diamond-grading machines in order to value the goods. Stones can be recut and then reintroduced into the market via Holland and Israel. The net is slowly tightening, however, on the Pink Panthers. Earlier this month, Montenegran Rifat Hadziahmetovic, believed to be one of the two Tokyo thieves, was extradited from Spain (where he had been wanted in connection with the theft of \u00a3490,000 worth of luxury watches in Tenerife) to Japan. A large squad of Japanese detectives arrived to accompany him home. Aware of the gang&apos;s reputation for springing its own members from custody, they ferried him from the airport to Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji police station in a bulletproof vehicle, accompanied by two helicopters. Hadziahmetovic had originally been arrested in Cyprus on a Spanish warrant. In May his suspected accomplice, 39-year-old Montenegran Radovan Jelusic, was arrested in\u00a0Rome. Police do not want to say how the men were found, but Interpol&apos;s growing DNA and fingerprint database of Pink Panther members has been crucial to recent arrests. Police are also closing in on the Panthers&apos; home territory, which is centred around the historic city of Cetinje, in Montenegro \u2013 though the gang has, over the years, incorporated members from elsewhere. Earlier this year, some 100 detectives from 20 different countries gathered in the Swiss city of Berne for three days. Their sole reason for coming together was to talk about the Pink Panthers. Many of those present already knew each another. A similar meeting had been held in Monaco in 2009, where Tokyo police officers had dazzled their counterparts with their &quot;model&quot; report on the Exelco raid. Although the detectives came from three continents and operate in very different legal systems, the common culture of police work apparently overcomes other cultural differences. Having a common enemy in the Pink Panther gang also helps. &quot;We are all police officers so we are interested in the same goal, to apprehend criminals,&quot; says Parthenis. The Pink Panthers seem to have realised that police are getting closer. When Samuels arranged a clandestine meeting with a gang member in a restaurant in the mountains of Montenegro, his interviewee held his beer glass with a napkin and constantly wiped the lip clean. When the interview was over, he walked off with the napkin in his pocket. The gang member spoke English, Serbo-Croat, Russian, Italian, French, German and Czech. He explained that the gang&apos;s byword was discretion, wherever they were. &quot;When we go out, we dress nice, in suits,&quot; he told Samuels. &quot;Here we are quiet.&quot; The Panthers had evolved into four main groups that emerged from the original Cetinje gang, with orders for robberies being placed with different teams. A technician provided alarm-busting equipment, the Panther said, while tipsters kept an eye on potential targets and a computer specialist scoured the web for more. Smugglers&apos; speedboats ferried them across the Adriatic. Serbian security services had, at one stage, provided protection. Sanctions imposed during the Balkan war had apparently helped drive them to crime. &quot;We grew up together,&quot; the gang member told Samuels. &quot;We all come from normal families. Our parents are normal people. They are not in this kind of life.&quot; So does that make it all right to steal diamonds from wealthy shop-owners? &quot;I don&apos;t agree that there is a romantic air about them,&quot; says Captain Parthenis. &quot;This is crime. It creates profits and some people do it professionally. And we have to address it professionally. We will continue doing our job until most of those people have been arrested.&quot; That, however, may take rather longer than upbeat police officers claim. After all, Swiss police, the hosts at the Berne meeting of international detectives, estimate the Panthers have struck on their patch between 10 and 15 times in the last two years alone. In the meantime, the gang has earned a place not just in the folklore of the Balkans, but in the history of crime.

So, it&apos;s likely many of you have not heard of the man \u2013 doubly likely since his films were all animated. There has long been an argument regarding the validity of animation as a medium for adults. It&apos;s easy for many to dismiss animated film as being automatically for kids or, worse, for teenagers. But for myself and others, animation is just another way of telling a story or getting a message across to an audience. This is why I referred to Satoshi Kon as a &quot;director&quot; in the opening paragraph: his films are so involving and cinematic it&apos;s easy to forget that they are constructed one frame at a time. What&apos;s more, they are definitely not for kids. These days, rather than give unbelievers in the power and potential of animated features the short thrift they clearly deserve, I&apos;ll point them in the direction of Kon&apos;s slim catalogue. Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika are all extremely accomplished films. Like many, I first encountered Kon&apos;s work upon the release of his 1998 directorial debut, Perfect Blue. The early 90s had seen a glut of anime releases over here following the success of Katsuhiro Otomo&apos;s Akira. I managed to catch most of them on video, enjoying a crash course in a culture and artform offering much that was novel to the western viewer. But precious few were anywhere near Akira&apos;s level of achievement, and plenty were simply hideous, so my interest waned. When Perfect Blue came along, I wasn&apos;t in any hurry to sit through another hard-to-follow story of ultra-violence and tentacle rape. Concerning a J-pop sensation trying to go solo, it seemed designed to keep audiences away. But the reviews and rumours kept referencing Hitchcock, Lynch and Scorsese. This was clearly not a run-of-the-mill production. Based on a novel, Perfect Blue was allegedly intended as a live-action feature, but with money hard to raise it was downgraded to direct-to-video, then direct-to-video-animation. When Satoshi Kon took the reigns, it was no one&apos;s idea of a hit \u2013 which is probably why he was able to get the gig in the first place. But when his vision took hold it was soon headed for theatrical release. Without giving too much away, the film starts off in stylish yet straightforward fashion as pop singer Rumi leaves her successful band to pursue an acting career. Her fans are in uproar; her stalker goes over the edge. As the pressure and trauma mount, Rumi&apos;s grip on reality becomes fractured \u2013 and then things start to get really interesting. It was special enough for Darren Aronofsky to secure the rights, and though his live-action remake never got past the starter&apos;s gate he did lift two very striking shots for Requiem For A Dream, while the trailer for his forthcoming Black Swan seems to have a little flavour of it, too. Kon&apos;s next films surpassed all expectations. It became clear with Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers that he was doing something very different from his peers. The first, which tells the story of a popular film star who withdraws from public life, proved he was a director-aficionado with a deep knowledge and even deeper love of cinema. Chiyoko&apos;s narrative is interspersed with memories/clips from her films that blur together \u2013 telling not only her own history but also a potted history of Japanese cinema. The actress was based on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, muses of the great directors Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse respectively. Millennium Actress also touched on Kaiju Eiga, the Japanese monster-movie genre. There aren&apos;t any other animated films I can think of that assimilate such a range of references. Kon&apos;s brief sojourn in the world of television also yielded spectacular results, with the bizarre Paranoia Agent. This series, again best approached with as little foreknowledge as possible, starts with a designer of cutesy characters trying to come up with a new creation to match the popularity of her iconic pink dog, Maromi, as a series of seemingly random people are brutally attacked by a kid wielding a golden baseball bat. Reality is not to be trusted and the oft-employed comparisons to the work of David Lynch are not too wide of the mark. For me, his finest work was his last: Paprika. Again it&apos;s completely unfair to condense it into a brief synopsis, but it deals with a machine that can place an avatar into another person&apos;s dreams. I wasn&apos;t the only one to notice, when the first trailer from Christopher Nolan&apos;s Inception hit, that it looks a bit like the 2006 animation \u2013 though I wouldn&apos;t call it a rip-off, there are enough similarities to suggest he has at least seen it. For my money, Kon&apos;s is the better film \u2013 the Japanese director really wasn&apos;t afraid to &quot;dream a little bigger&quot; . Paprika is more spectacular, imaginative, fun and emotional than Nolan&apos;s hit. Now, there&apos;s a live action version with director Wolfgang Peterson mooted. Satoshi Kon left us with one final film, The Dream Machine, still in production. Little is known about this project other than that it concerns robots and is aimed at younger viewers \u2013 though we know how little that really means. Beside my sympathy for his family and friends, Kon&apos;s death did shock and sadden me on a personal level because in him I had found a director who didn&apos;t disappoint, one I could trust wholeheartedly \u2013 which is incredibly rare. To speak selfishly, I feel sadness that I will never see him complete a new film. Here was a director I felt I could depend on to reaffirm my faith in cinema \u2013 a faith that gets a good battering almost daily as I sit through films that do little more than waste my time. But Kon&apos;s films are ones I foresee myself returning to many times in the future. And as for those children, the supposed target audience for his animations? Well, they have plenty of time to grow into them."}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty    Much of Kon&apos;s animation combines realistic drama (usually set in present-day Tokyo) with dreams and fantasy.", "In it, another starlet \u2013 who resembles the reclusive Setsuko Hara, star of Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story (1953) \u2013 obsessively searches for her lost wartime love, racing through movies and memories as if they were the same thing.", "Tokyo Godfathers (2003) proved to be another change of direction, a Frank Capraesque Christmas comedy about three homeless people trying to return an abandoned baby girl to her family.", "Despite its humour, Tokyo Godfathers was upfront in showing its characters&apos; harsh situation.", "This social commentary was also overt in Kon&apos;s Paranoia Agent (2004), a 13-part late-night miniseries, in which Tokyo is terrorised by a homicidal little boy with a baseball bat.", "After graduating from high school, he moved to Tokyo and took a course in visual communication design at Musashino Art University."], "tags": ["Animation", "Animation", "Culture", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-26T17:12:25Z", "title": "Satoshi Kon obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/satoshi-kon-obituary", "article": "Satoshi Kon, who has died of pancreatic cancer aged 46, was one of the boldest and most distinctive film-makers to specialise in animation. His main body of work \u2013 four completed feature films and an acclaimed television mini-series \u2013 was playful, sophisticated and adult. Tired of the cliches of mass-produced Japanese animation \u2013 &quot;robots and beautiful little girls,&quot; as he once put it \u2013 Kon sought to make animation that used ambitious and often disorientating editing, intercutting and scene-shifting. &quot;In animation, only what is intended to be communicated is there,&quot; he once said. &quot;If I had a chance to edit live-action, it would be too fast for audiences to follow.&quot; Kon made only sparing use of CGI in his mostly drawn films, relying on such superb animators as Shinji Otsuka and Toshiyuki Inoue.     Kon, above, thought that people lived in multiple realities. Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty    Much of Kon&apos;s animation combines realistic drama (usually set in present-day Tokyo) with dreams and fantasy. This approach culminated in his dazzling 2006 film Paprika, which received a standing ovation at the Venice film festival. Four years before Christopher Nolan&apos;s Inception, Paprika portrayed a puckish &quot;dream detective&quot; shimmying through the subconscious fantasies of other people. Nolan has acknowledged Paprika as an influence, but Kon&apos;s film has far more fun with its dream worlds. Its titular heroine dashes through paintings and signboards while transforming into everything from a fairy to a mermaid to Pinocchio. Kon thought that people lived in multiple realities, such as those of television, the internet and the realm of memory. &quot;The human brain is mysterious; we can&apos;t share the time axis in our memory with other people,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m interested in trying to visualise those nonlinear ways of thinking.&quot; The first feature he directed was a Hitchcockian psycho-thriller, Perfect Blue (1997), about the mental disintegration of a young actor after she takes part in a lurid rape scene. Perhaps the only effective horror film in animation, Perfect Blue was graphically explicit and psychologically disturbing. Asked about its 18-rated gore, Kon said he was not particularly interested in the violence. &quot;However,&quot; he said, &quot;if the story or the character or the expression of a mental state requires a violent expression, then I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to use it.&quot; In contrast, Kon&apos;s next film, Millennium Actress (2001), was a lyrical magic-realist romance. In it, another starlet \u2013 who resembles the reclusive Setsuko Hara, star of Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story (1953) \u2013 obsessively searches for her lost wartime love, racing through movies and memories as if they were the same thing. Tokyo Godfathers (2003) proved to be another change of direction, a Frank Capraesque Christmas comedy about three homeless people trying to return an abandoned baby girl to her family. The film also had the same basic plot as 3 Godfathers, John Ford&apos;s 1948 western. Despite its humour, Tokyo Godfathers was upfront in showing its characters&apos; harsh situation. This social commentary was also overt in Kon&apos;s Paranoia Agent (2004), a 13-part late-night miniseries, in which Tokyo is terrorised by a homicidal little boy with a baseball bat. Coming after a wave of much-publicised youth crimes in Japan, this was a near-the-knuckle subject for television animation. The darkly funny show soon turned fantastical, with shades of Twin Peaks and The X-Files, and macabre subplots about suicide clubs and repressed housewives. Kon was born on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. His father was an office worker for a delivery company. After graduating from high school, he moved to Tokyo and took a course in visual communication design at Musashino Art University. While a student, he drew a manga (comic) strip which won a runner-up prize in a magazine competition. Subsequently, Kon became a struggling manga artist, sometimes assisting his hero Katsuhiro Otomo, the creator of the manga Akira and its film adaptation. Later, Kon began a manga collaboration with Mamoru Oshii, best known as the director of Ghost in the Shell, but the project fell apart through creative differences. Kon&apos;s first animation credit was on the feature Roujin Z (1990), a science-fiction comedy for which he drew the backgrounds. By the time of the lavish anthology Memories (1995), Kon had a writing credit on the film&apos;s sublime opening segment, Magnetic Rose, about a spaceship haunted by a reality-warping opera singer. Both Roujin Z and Memories were produced by Otomo, who recommended Kon to direct Perfect Blue. Since then, Kon&apos;s work has been feted far beyond the niche fandom of Japanese animation. After Paprika, Kon began The Dream Machine, which promised to be his biggest departure \u2013 a film suitable for both adults and children, set in a fanciful future with an all-robot cast. It seems likely that the film will be completed by Kon&apos;s artists and released by the Madhouse studio, which has handled all of his work since Perfect Blue. Kon is survived by his wife, Kyoko. \u2022 Satoshi Kon, animation director, born 12 October 1963; died 24 August 2010"}, {"sentences": ["By the late 1980s not only was Polly Peck the only European company to be listed on the Tokyo stock exchange \u2013 thanks to its stake in Sansui electronics \u2013 but Vestel, its Turkish television manufacturing arm, was the largest company on the Istanbul exchange and its fruit distribution business was the third largest in the world."], "tags": ["Asil Nadir", "Law", "Business", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-26T20:09:09Z", "title": "How Polly Peck went from hero to villain in the City", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/26/polly-peck-business-asil-nadir", "article": "Asil Nadir&apos;s return to Britain contrasted somewhat with his flight from the UK at dead of night in May 1993, when he took off in a small charter aircraft from an airfield in Dorset, landed in Beauvais, northern France, and then headed in an executive jet back to his villa in northern Cyprus. It was an ignominious denouement to a decade in which the Turkish Cypriot-born business tycoon had become seen as first the darling and then the villain of the City of London as shares in his Polly Peck empire dived and soared, surrounded by rumours and innuendo about Nadir and his financial practices. He was alternately feted for his success and the amazing, exponential growth of Polly Peck and sneered at for his Turkish roots and the way he did business. The protracted Serious Fraud Office investigation after the collapse of the company only fed the gossip. Polly Peck&apos;s collapse with the then colossal debts of \u00a31.3bn came at the height of an era of spectacular City booms and scandals. It was a period when the Thatcher government was selling off public utilities and urging the public to buy shares, when \u2013 in the words of Gordon Gecko, the character in the Hollywood blockbuster Wall Street \u2013 greed was good, and when young men in red braces in deregulated City offices flaunted their wealth and supposed acumen. Business bubbles rose out of nowhere and some of them collapsed just as rapidly, taking small shareholders and their money with them, and shady businessmen sometimes came to grief: Peter Clowes spending \u00a3100m of his clients&apos; money on yachts and fast cars instead of investing in government stock, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International which specialised in labyrinthine ways of avoiding regulation, Barings&apos; venerable bank, brought down when its junior trader Nick Leeson contrived to lose \u00a3827m in unsupervised dealing. Asil Nadir, born in Farmagusta, northern Cyprus, had a reputation in the late 80s as a ruthless businessman, feared rather than liked, it was said, a workaholic with no time for a social life, yet who charmed women and had mistresses. His business career had started when he sold newspapers in the street at the age of six. Later he studied economics at Istanbul University, before moving to Britain with his parents and sister in 1960. Invasion In the East End of London he bought a small clothing business. His break came following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 when the government in northern Cyprus invited him to launch a processing and packaging business, collecting the citrus fruits from the orchards left by the previous Greek residents when they fled. Within 10 years Polly Peck had diversified, making colour televisions in Turkey, computers and electrical components, but also buying up the US fruit exporter Del Monte in an audacious coup when its parent company, Nabisco, was broken up. Nadir also bought newspapers in Turkey, supportive of the government there, and hotels and a bank in northern Cyprus. By the late 1980s not only was Polly Peck the only European company to be listed on the Tokyo stock exchange \u2013 thanks to its stake in Sansui electronics \u2013 but Vestel, its Turkish television manufacturing arm, was the largest company on the Istanbul exchange and its fruit distribution business was the third largest in the world. In 1989 the company was worth \u00a31.6bn and had been catapulted into the FTSE 100. Nadir was by then said to be worth \u00a3200m and was listed as the 36th richest person in Britain in the Sunday Times&apos;s annual rich list. He had an office in Berkeley Square, furnished with Turkish and French antiques, owned a number of racehorses and gave generously to the Spastics Society. Media profiles were generally adulatory. But the City remained suspicious of Polly Peck&apos;s exponential growth and wary of its reliance on uncertain Middle Eastern and specifically Turkish markets. The growth was certainly phenomenal: in early 1990 it was said that anyone who had invested \u00a31,000 in the company in 1980 would by then be holding shares worth \u00a31.3m. Rumours circulated of opaque accounting methods and boardroom rows, of a company too dependent on its jumped-up parvenu Levantine boss. Fluctuations in the company&apos;s value were certainly destabilising: when the Financial Times criticised Polly Peck in 1983 it lost a quarter of its share value in 20 minutes; in 1985 when its profit forecast was too high \u00a3100m was wiped off its market value. Then in 1990 with the SFO inquiry and the collapse of the company, Nadir was changed from City hero to villain, sued by the company&apos;s administrators for \u00a3378m, facing 13 charges of theft and false accounting and granted \u00a31.5m bail against the advice of the SFO, which pointed out Britain had no extradition agreement with northern Cyprus, a country it did not recognise. When Nadir absconded two days before an Old Bailey hearing and four months before his trial, Sir David Hopkin, the magistrate who had granted bail, remarked urbanely: &quot;He has been here for two years \u2026 which doesn&apos;t exactly show he had an immediate intention to bugger off, does it?&quot; Laughter Nadir&apos;s reappearance in northern Cyprus, giving defiant and unrepentant interviews to the sceptical British media, not only aggravated the SFO and harmed his image back in Britain, but also revealed the powerlessness of the British authorities. Representations by the Foreign Office were met with a shrug by Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader: &quot;How can we deliver Mr Nadir to the British unless we organise a kidnapping? Legally, we can&apos;t do it because he is protected under our constitution. He has committed no crime in Cyprus.&quot; British journalists found Nadir happy to talk. &quot;I am sure the British public which is renowned for fair play and protecting the innocent will judge me more accurately now the truth is not suppressed,&quot; he told the Daily Mail, which noted that the limp and walking stick Nadir had used in London because of a bad back had been replaced by laughter and a grin in the Cypriot sunshine. Nadir argued that he could not receive a fair trial in Britain, because the SFO had confiscated all his papers. The SFO responded that he had had copies. The trustee in bankruptcy declared his allegations of unfairness offensive and insulting. And then, extraordinarily, came the intervention of Tory minister Michael Mates, an upright former soldier who was revealed to have written letters about Nadir&apos;s plight to the attorney general and to have given him a \u00a350 watch inscribed &quot;Don&apos;t let the buggers get you down&quot;. With that, the Nadir saga seemed closed and forgotten. The SFO&apos;s case was dormant, but finally the 80s tycoon has found northern Cyprus too constraining and now feels prepared to take his chance with British justice."}, {"sentences": ["I&apos;ve eaten in Catholic / Goth themed Christon Cafe in Tokyo, me and a million giggling teens, but compared with what else is actually out there: pah!"], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-27T12:30:00Z", "title": "The 'cannibal restaurant' and other themed eateries", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/aug/27/cannibal-restaurant-hoax", "article": "To my gallows amusement, rumours abounded early this morning of an alleged &quot;cannibal restaurant&quot; soon to open in Berlin and based on the Wari culture of endocannibalism, the respectful consumption of a member of one&apos;s own society after they have died. According to this video interview with the restaurant&apos;s supposed owner, it was to have been his second restaurant, the original, Flim\u00e9, being located in Brazil near a Wari reservation. The illusion was bolstered by this website where members are presented with a health questionnaire and asked to decide which body part they want to donate. Despite laying themselves wide open to accusations of crass insensitivity, the people behind it have scored a major publicity coup around what would have been the ultimate theme restaurant. In fact, whether there&apos;s any substance to this story or not, the reality is in many ways even worse. Just what is it about this curious subset that appeals to restaurant-goers? There&apos;s a new restaurant called Shaka Zulu just opened in Camden that has had the more schadenfreude-inclined of the capital&apos;s restaurant-watchers in something of a lather. Improbably vast and elaborate, it purports to offer the authentic taste of Africa (seared ostrich carpaccio with peppadews, anyone?) in an atmosphere of Zulu extravagance. We restaurant critics are all happily sharpening our knives because, oddly, there&apos;s nothing anyone loves more than a truly venomous review. I haven&apos;t been yet, because I like a place to find its level before piling in, but the only thing to properly astonish me about the place would be if the food were any good. Have you ever had a decent dinner in a theme restaurant? I know I haven&apos;t. From the purgatory endured by taking children to the Rainforest Caf\u00e9 (sub-TGI&apos;s food heavily reliant on the deep fryer and dodgy animatronics that actually put the fear of Armageddon into the kids) to the hilariously awful Dans le Noir, the words &quot;theme restaurant&quot; usually have me blanching with horror. As the Flim\u00e9 story demonstrates, Britain&apos;s most outr\u00e9 offerings are positively vanilla compared what happens overseas, especially in Asia. (Having said that, there is now an outfit in London offering the revolting practice of nyotaimori \u2013 literally, &quot;female body plate&quot;, or eating sushi off the body of a naked woman. Deepest joy.) I&apos;ve eaten in Catholic / Goth themed Christon Cafe in Tokyo, me and a million giggling teens, but compared with what else is actually out there: pah! A bit of research throws up (pun intended) the kind of thing that would profoundly, even permanently, put me off my dinner. Who needs Weight Watchers when all you have to do is call to mind Marton, a &quot;Modern Toilet Diner&quot; in Taipei? Here, customers sit on seats shaped like lavs, scarfing carefully sculpted chocolate ice-cream \u2013 I don&apos;t have to spell it out, surely? \u2013 out of mini toilet bowls.  The Taiwanese do seem particularly keen on the furthest reaches of acceptable taste. The curiously monickered DS Music Restaurant in Taipei is themed round hospitals, with cute, sexy nurses squirting drinks into your gob from IV-type apparatuses. Fortunately, the city&apos;s Holocaust restaurant didn&apos;t last. Also unsurprisingly out of business is Sehnsucht (&quot;Longing&quot;), the Berlin outfit that catered for, yes, anorexics.  Death is a recurring topic for some entirely bizarre reason, with the likes of the demised Eternity in the Ukraine, which was cosily located inside the world&apos;s largest coffin, or the restaurant in Ahmadabad, India which is actually inside a Muslim cemetery. Its name? The New Lucky. Perhaps reminding ourselves of our inevitable end adds a little piquancy to dinner.  See also, randomly, prisons: Chain Cool in Beijing, The Jail in Taiwan (again), and even in the UK, the likes of The Clink where not only are you dining inside an actual prison (High Down), but you&apos;re served and catered to by actual inmates. The Clink&apos;s aims are entirely admirable, providing rehabilitation opportunities for offenders, but if you&apos;re looking for something more tasteless, how about The Hobbit House in Manila? Owned by a Lord of the Rings freak, it&apos;s staffed entirely by, um, people of restricted growth. Mind you, the Ukraine also has the Masoch Caf\u00e9, dedicated to that cheery inventor of masochism, so it&apos;s up there with Taiwan.  Of course, themed outfits aren&apos;t new, but once upon a time they were a little cooler than they are today, like the heavenly Le Macabre in swinging 60s Soho. Nowadays, there&apos;s something about theming that just screams impossibly naff. The maddest thing is how many of these extraordinary gaffs not only survive, but thrive (see the aforementioned Dans le Noir and Manchester&apos;s Hellfire Club, whose menu items include Creature of the Swamp and Cannibal Holocaust, &quot;served with a selection of garnish vegetables and potatoes or chunky chips&quot;). Am I and my foodie muckers just being the most insufferable snobs and does everyone really love this kind of thing? Can it really be true that the quality of the food is less important than being served by someone dressed as a schoolgirl brandishing a whippy little cane?

Gabriel Brockwell is an anti-globalisation activist whose daddy never loved him, a booze- and cocaine-partial sybarite in his 20s. His sanctimonious rehab guru, &quot;Spread, creased, and folded by culture into a clever likeness of a man&quot;, insists: &quot;Gabriel . . .

An implosive neophyte chef \u2013 &quot;the epicurian underworld pulled him into its rarest bowel&quot; \u2013 Smuts is bound for the blessing of a Michelin star. Smuts&apos;s promise has been sponsored by a sinister party organiser and international playboy, Didier Laxalt, &quot;the godfather of high-octane catering&quot;. And it is wine lore that sets up this brilliant satire: Marius is a vine so precious it grows with the assistance of virgins&apos; pheromones and transports the imbiber with visions of its Cote d&apos;Azur slope; the grape is &quot;an ovary inseminated with dreams&quot;. It is accompanied by highly toxic blowfish, cut &quot;so thin you could watch porn through it&quot;. Gabriel enters a night of gangsters, a teenage girl, a vast fish tank and an octopus. Amazingly, he fails to poison himself in scenes of visionary and comic brilliance. Smuts believes Gabriel has travelled to Japan not to kill himself, but to invite him to chef in a decadent Berlin nightclub in which Gabriel&apos;s father holds a share. However, Smuts is detained in a Tokyo jail on a possible murder charge, giving Gabriel the sudden purpose to free his friend. The social signifiers of fine wine and exclusive dining have been trumpeted with great solemnity in the last few decades of our culture, but this novel renders it all ridiculous. Pierre shreds the pretentious sophistication and fake joyousness of our Michelin-starred palaces, driving them to the ultimate conclusions of hedonism with a ferocity worthy of de Sade. The action moves to a finely portrayed and morally complex Berlin, that shimmering borderline where totalitarian capitalism&apos;s unsteady contradictions still appear everywhere. Gabriel stakes out Gerd Specht \u2013 his father&apos;s erstwhile partner \u2013 but, hilariously, the mythical nightclub turns out to be much less than envisioned. Here the novel blossoms into a sort of insane, rococo wedding planner for a tumultuous and orgiastic banquet in the bowels of Nazi-built Tempelhof airport \u2013 all organised by Gabriel and Laxalt; they will cater for bankers whose Lear jets taxi to the very gates of Tempelhof and into a double bluff. Lights Out in Wonderland is an allegory and admits &quot;the improbability of the scheme&quot;, but Gabriel is not given over to hedonism; he is a suffering penitent, &quot;Ebenezer Scrooge on a moral tour of Culture Present&quot;, and it is the fluency and symphony of fine writing which convince, his waking with daily remorse to one&apos;s &quot;mental jury, that tribunal to which we plead and present our mitigations&quot;. As with the dextrous ventriloquism in Vernon God Little, Gabriel&apos;s living and very beautiful voice carries this convulsive novel: a girl&apos;s &quot;buttocks locomote in denim&quot;; a Burger King sign becomes &quot;a delicate graduation of reds from hot capsicum to dry blood&quot;; high intoxication itself is &quot;a glycerine Tibet where you whirl under stars, arms outstretched, free of yourself&quot;. And lurking in such a brazen tale, who would expect such penetrating and subtle Frankfurt School analysis: &quot;Consuming went from being a privilege, to a right, to a duty . . . The fantasy theatre of the markets became our vernacular, till governors themselves pressed ever more spectacular fictions into their service . . . all the evil terrorist men couldn&apos;t frighten us together again.&quot; Didier Laxalt depressingly confirms that &quot;Capitalism was never a device for societies, it is a rocket, the people who built the rocket are way up in space. Nothing will ever touch them or their descendents for five hundred years.&quot; The wild plot teeters as it ascends to its Grand Guignol climax \u2013 a little too in love with the decadence and grand hotels it ultimately condemns, but the point is that decadence itself is not our problem so much as the fact that we can never all practise it. Only the people in that rocket can feast on Caramelised, Milk-Fed White Tiger Cub and Giant Panda Paw with Borlotti Bean &amp; Baby Root Vegetables. Such a culinary obscenity \u2013 not so very unrealistic \u2013 becomes an exclusive signifier of social superiority.

Why we should stop the series at this specific, wholly arbitrary number is the sort of issue that would have delighted some of the more annoying authors in the series but, setting that aside, we have now published five sets of 20 and it is time to stop and do something different. Nobody is saying that these are the 100 Great Ideas \u2013 just a 100, with plenty of shameful omissions, insulting inclusions and unthinking biases trailing in a vast cloud behind them. Like all successful publishing concepts, Great Ideas was a straight steal from another publisher. I was standing on a haggard, rural Umbrian station platform in 2003 and was alarmed to see that the kiosk selling lollies, puzzle magazines and plastic guns also had a little rack of works by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, which seemed a bit visionary by British standards. These were titles in Adelphi&apos;s famous and long-running Piccola Biblioteca series and I immediately thought that Penguin could do something similar. Again, as with all successful publishing concepts, my own ignorance and failure to focus properly accidentally transformed the Piccola Biblioteca. On the basis of the little kiosk rack (perhaps put there in a spirit of the most acrid satire by the kiosk&apos;s owner), I thought that the Adelphi series was entirely filled with short works of philosophy and politics \u2013 it was only later I found out that it also included many distinguished novels, and indeed that some of the books were not even all that piccolo. In any event, ripping off yet at the same time misunderstanding a famous series previously unknown to me, I returned to London filled with truffle oil and missionary zeal. The first 20 Great Ideas were published the following year, the start of a series that has now sold more than 2.5m books. The idea was to republish books mostly already available through Penguin Classics in a form that might have been recognisable to their authors \u2013 to strip away the accretion of prefaces, introductions and notes so important in studying an author, in favour of presenting only the text itself, so that once more the reader could open The Social Contract and simply read &quot;Man is born free, and he is everywhere in chains&quot;. Looking back, I cannot really remember how the list was put together. Colleagues and authors have throughout made various important, ingenious and unhelpful suggestions. My own hope had been to smuggle through the back door various more-or-less doomed, non-selling favourites while all attention was focused on the obvious crowd pleasers coming through the main entrance. This has worked \u2013 but not as planned, as the popularity of the series swept up the most implausible figures. We had hardly been able to keep in print John Ruskin&apos;s selected writings, but a tiny group of my favourite essays suddenly sold some 70,000 copies. William Hazlitt enjoyed a similar dizzy success. We were selling so many books that an entire generation of students were radicalised by Paine, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft and Marx completely by accident. We suddenly found a format in which tremendous numbers of readers started for the first time reading George Orwell&apos;s essays. I hit the ground with a crunch, though, with Sir Thomas Browne&apos;s Urne-Burial, which, despite being my favourite piece of English prose, even in Great Ideas managed to find no audience whatsoever. A key aspect of the series has been their look. Messing around with different period typefaces and with a similar stripped-down atmosphere to the content (two colours, mostly just lettering \u2013 with the occasional loopy exception), the jackets transformed the books&apos; fortunes. I remember standing in Foyles watching as wave on wave of morbid, sexually confused students came capering up to a ziggurat-like display of Great Ideas, snatching them up like penny candy. Of course, the authors were crucial to this \u2013 but it would be an austere figure indeed who did not react to the beguiling designs for Hume&apos;s On Suicide or Schopenhauer&apos;s On the Suffering of the World. Two serious criticisms of the series rapidly emerged. The first was that it was all a Eurocentric disgrace \u2013 the reheating of a pile of bewigged old monsters, emperors, Catholic saints and so on who had done quite enough damage already. The second was that it was all a phallocentric disgrace \u2013 that women had been shoved aside in favour of the usual suspects and that an obvious opportunity had been missed to reshape what should be considered Great Ideas and who had written them. Both these criticisms were awkward, because they were obviously valid. My top moment of burning shame in the whole enterprise was throwing into the series Sun-tzu&apos;s The Art of War, which may not be Eurocentric but is certainly phallocentric. It fits the category of &quot;just because it is old doesn&apos;t stop it from being stupid&quot; \u2013 an unintentionally comic sequence of military injunctions much loved by business school students who imagine that this Zhou-era nonsense about ambushes and chariots throws an interesting light on modern management. Anyway, it sold huge numbers. A more considered response to the Eurocentric issue might be that it was never plausible for Great Ideas to fake what great ideas might be. A UN-backed, multilingual publisher orbiting the Earth could come up with a quite different set of Great Ideas, but a London-based one with an English-speaking audience had to reflect the writers who had historically most shaped the majority of that audience. A similar series published in, say, Rangoon or Cairo or Moscow or Tokyo would have a small overlap with a London-based one, and each would have no choice but to reflect their own society&apos;s expectations and mores. The inclusion of writers as various as Confucius, Achebe or Tagore reflected their European impact, not their (in many cases) almost unrelated impact in their home countries. A similar problem emerged with the small number of women writers \u2013 a series beginning 2,500 years ago (with the soldierly aper\u00e7us of Sun-tzu) had little choice but to reflect the patriarchy that prevailed for most or all of that period. If women were shut out from most discourse, whether abused (by Schopenhauer) or lauded (by Mill), there was no context (outside the obvious exceptions, such as Christine de Pizan and Mary Wollstonecraft) to pretend otherwise. In the 20th century the series crashed into the copyright problem of Penguin not publishing most of the major figures who would otherwise have been included, with obvious writers outside our reach. Having said that, it was stupid not to have included Betty Friedan, whom we do publish. Aside from the ceaseless arguments about who is in and who is out of the series, one enjoyable constant was ridiculous discussion within Penguin of some imaginary launch tea party at which all the authors would be present. They of course influenced each other in a myriad of unpredictable ways, but equally they in many cases hated each other, and the launch tea party would have been a pretty rugged, if not homicidal, event. Gibbon and St Augustine would not have hit it off, and St John of Patmos would almost certainly have been reduced to tears by other writers, such as Voltaire and Trotsky, making fun of his Revelation. This is a game that can go on indefinitely: a straight fistfight between William James and Thomas Hobbes might have attracted betting men. Several figures in the series would have had the power to execute everybody else present, which would presumably have wound up the catastrophic event in short order. Perhaps, then, what is most curious about the series is that it has introduced so many readers to wildly clashing ideas and has provoked an interest in levels of abstraction not usually associated with the British Mind. Great Ideas has all kinds of omissions and failures, but anything that has provoked unprecedented numbers of people to read Hazlitt or Woolf or Stevenson has to come out ahead. My favourite book in the whole series is a small group of essays by John Berger called Why Look at Animals? Each of the essays is a masterpiece, and the collection includes some of the best writing of the 20th century on the human relationship with the natural world. Berger added to the book a short fable, &quot;A Mouse Story&quot;, and a lovely page of his drawings of mice. But it is the last essay that most sticks in my mind: an account of Berger spending the day in the Austrian countryside with the Marxist critic Ernst Fischer. This proved to be the last day of Fischer&apos;s life, and many of the themes of the whole series are brought together in a meditation on history, stoicism, friendship and the overwhelming importance of ideas and argument. It is a great piece of writing and, for me, just to have encountered it has made the whole Great Ideas enterprise worthwhile. Over to you: what did we miss out? It is worth anxiously emphasising that the series is called Great Ideas, not Good Ideas. Before everyone starts writing about how disgusting it is that reactionary maniacs like Joseph de Maistre are included, the wish was to create a list of books which were influential and which are, in general, still interesting to read. Figures such as John Duns Scotus or Avicenna were not included because, while their influence has been colossal, they are not now read by anyone exception a tiny handful of specialists. The useful thing about the word &quot;Great&quot; is that it is sufficiently vague as to encompass ideas which might in practice be mendacious, boring, damaging or even profoundly hateful.  Penguin Books will give a complete set of series five of the Great Ideas to the person who comes up with the most ingenious, well-argued example of a writer whose work should have been included."}, {"sentences": ["Our three offices \u2013 Tokyo, Dublin and Culver City in California \u2013 are all eight hours apart, so we can cover 24 hours across all three regions.&quot; We take lunch in the canteen, an enormous space as big as a football pitch containing an array of food stalls as well as a huge projector screen in one corner (on which Fitzgerald and colleagues recently watched World Cup football games) and a pool table."], "tags": ["Data and computer security", "Technology", "Malware", "Viruses", "Worms"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-27T23:05:47Z", "title": "A working life: The computer virus expert", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/aug/28/computer-virus-expert-working-life", "article": "The open-plan office in which I&apos;m standing is buzzing, because a new type of threat has emerged in the past 24 hours. Excited young men and women (though mostly men) chatter beneath wall-mounted TV screens showing maps of the world overlaid with pulsing dots and scrolling information \u2013 the world&apos;s major cyber-security threats in real time. I&apos;m in a humdrum business park a mile or two outside Dublin city centre (not the first place you would think of when visualising cyber-crime detectives playing hi-tech cat and mouse games with criminal masterminds) to meet Patrick Fitzgerald and the team at computer security experts Symantec. Dublin&apos;s own Silicon Valley has long been home to the likes of AOL, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and IBM. Symantec fits in nicely as the parent company of software protection specialist Norton. Once past security, the interior broadens out to reveal a huge workspace, all high ceilings and brick fused with bright, painted steel. The effect is startling, reminding me a little of Pixar&apos;s headquarters in California. After further checks I am admitted to Symantec&apos;s inner sanctum, where the security response and threat intelligence departments are housed. Fitzgerald, a youthful 31-year-old in comfy blue jeans, red T-shirt and trainers, tells me about the sudden and ambitious attack they are tackling today. &quot;We&apos;re calling it the W32.stuxnet worm,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was effectively targeting Scada, which is software used by companies to control industrial processes in, say, a car manufacturing plant or an energy plant. The attackers in this case could have been looking to steal intellectual property or even to destabilise an entire plant.&quot; Isn&apos;t this all a bit like the plot of Die Hard 4.0, I suggest, in which Bruce Willis&apos;s John McClane takes on an internet-based terrorist organisation that is tapping into energy plants to try and shut down the US? &quot;If you&apos;d said that last week I would have laughed, because this is the first one I&apos;ve seen that targets industrial processes,&quot; he says. &quot;With this one, we have no idea of the source. There&apos;s so much more to it and it has the potential to hit many of our customers.&quot; We go to a secure room housing Symantec&apos;s servers \u2013 thousands of red and green lights blinking and twinkling as a roar of fans keep the servers cool. It&apos;s enough white noise to put even the grizzliest of babies to sleep. He tells me the servers do not just house Symantec&apos;s data; by acting as a firewall they protect the rest of the world from viruses that Symantec analyses. &quot;We use closed networks so that if anything bad tries to get out it can&apos;t. If we download a nasty worm, we can control it,&quot; Fitzgerald explains. When we re-enter the main office, everyone is still talking in hushed tones about the Stux worm and Fitzgerald is quickly at the centre of it in his guise as security response manager (SRM). He also performs the threat intelligence officer (TIO) role, rotating duties so that he is TIO when someone else is the SRM and vice versa. Security response takes care of all the operational, day-to-day stuff, ensuring that if customers encounter any type of problem, Symantec will make sure it has detection in place and can protect them. &quot;If customers get downtime with their machines, they are losing money and that&apos;s what we&apos;re here to prevent. SRM is very reactive.&quot; The threat intelligence department&apos;s job is more proactive, to remain on top of the threat landscape, to get ahead of the attackers by analysing trends and building technology to combat them. &quot;It&apos;s a complete cat and mouse game,&quot; he explains. &quot;It can be very difficult.&quot; In both roles, Fitzgerald essentially distills any issue to help prioritise what needs to be done, from analysis of the threat to the response. &quot;It&apos;s like a relay-race around the world, following the sun,&quot; he says. &quot;At the end of the day a different office rings us when they are starting their shift and ours is ending. Our three offices \u2013 Tokyo, Dublin and Culver City in California \u2013 are all eight hours apart, so we can cover 24 hours across all three regions.&quot; We take lunch in the canteen, an enormous space as big as a football pitch containing an array of food stalls as well as a huge projector screen in one corner (on which Fitzgerald and colleagues recently watched World Cup football games) and a pool table. After I&apos;ve eaten a risotto and he has downed a pint of milk (in less than 15 seconds), he tells me more about his career. &quot;My older brother got a ZX Spectrum 48K, the one with the rubber keys, and I loved it,&quot; he recalls. Then we got a Commodore 64, then the Commodore Amiga, then games consoles came along.&quot; His love of games inspired him to do a computer science degree at Trinity College in Dublin and he went into a computer graphics job after graduating, before travelling around Australia for a year. On his return Fitzgerald joined Symantec, spending his first four years in quality assurance, a department that makes sure any updates Symantec develops to protect clients against malware do not damage people&apos;s computers: &quot;We don&apos;t want to be worse than the viruses themselves.&quot; Fitzgerald&apos;s additional training in computer forensics and networking (paid for by his employer) has also helped him keep on top of the world&apos;s cyber baddies. In this industry, the language says it all: infection, worms, malware, attacks, viruses, poisoning, spam zombies, and hackers. The number and types of threat are legion. A trojan is a piece of software that installs itself on a system. A phishing attack is where an email or link will try and trick you into visiting a website or giving away your log-in credentials. A worm is a piece of malware that, when it gets in a machine, tries to spread to others. Also among this rogues&apos; gallery is the fake AV, a scam anti-virus report that perpetrators hope you will decide to protect against by paying them to remove it. They often use branding that mimics Norton or Microsoft&apos;s anti-virus software. With a fake AV threat, attackers have been using &quot;search engine optimisation poisoning&quot; \u2013 the practice of hijacking popular search terms to bring fraudulent links to the top. On the day I visit, one of the poisoned terms is Anna Chapman, the recently exposed Russian spy. When a user clicks on the bad link, they are automatically served the fake AV malware. &quot;My friends have fallen for it,&quot; says Fitzgerald. &quot;They link to a site that is a simple transactional credit card site where people hand over their details, but the real trick is getting them there in the first place. There&apos;s a whole professional industry behind it.&quot; Malicious activity mainly originates in the US (with 19% of all such activity seen by Symantec in 2009), followed by China (8%), Brazil (6%), Germany (5%) and India (4%) \u2013 Brazil has shot up the rankings recently, reflecting its growing internet infrastructure and broadband usage. Where they originate from is less important than discovering and dealing with the threats quickly. &quot;We&apos;re constantly monitoring feeds around the internet, talking to contacts within the industry and using technology to watch out for certain things. Our consumer products also have software that helps us detect attacks as they happen,&quot; Fitzgerald explains. &quot;Hobbyists, who often have as much, or more, knowledge than us, also alert us. We have a &apos;honeypot&apos; system where we attract malware to come to us, and we monitor Twitter.&quot; But who are the bad guys? &quot;They are known as black hats, and they call us (the good guys) &apos;white hats&apos;,&quot; Fitzgerald explains. Black hats are not always the nerdy teenagers epitomised by Matthew Broderick in the 1980s hacker film WarGames, or more recently Kevin Smith in Die Hard 4.0; attacks just as often come from sophisticated criminal networks or &quot;the underworld&quot;. People in the middle are, with suitably monochromatic logic, called grey hats. They&apos;re the people who are doing good and bad work legitimately or on the black market, where live viruses and &apos;exploits&apos; are traded,&quot; he says. &quot;Exploits are merely a way of taking advantage of a vulnerability or weak spot in software used by millions.&quot; Fitzgerald cites a popular vulnerability analogy of someone having a secure front door but a weak window. In that case, the exploit would be a crowbar. A &quot;zero day vulnerability&quot; is when you would have spent a fortune doing up your house and beefing up door security, only to leave the window open. &quot;A zero day makes the attackers&apos; job a lot easier \u2013 it&apos;s the holy grail for them.&quot; For most of us, all this talk of worms and viruses is a tad disconcerting, but for Fitzgerald it&apos;s like living the dream. &quot;I&apos;ve been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember, so at times this feels more like a hobby than a job,&quot; he smiles. You might say he&apos;s been well and truly bitten by the bug. Curriculum vitae Pay The typical salary range for Fitzgerald&apos;s position is \u20ac40,000 \u2013 \u20ac60,000 (\u00a333,000 \u2013 \u00a349,000), depending on experience.

So it hardly seemed hyperbolic that the dramatic home run hit by Bobby Thomson of the New York Giants baseball team to win the National League pennant from their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, would be dubbed &quot;the shot heard round the world&quot;. The phrase came from Ralph Waldo Emerson&apos;s poem Concord Hymn, celebrating &quot;the embattled farmers&quot; of Massachusetts, whose firing on British soldiers had sparked the American revolution. Baseball&apos;s shot came off the bat of a player born in Glasgow. Thomson, who has died aged 86, was two when he moved from Scotland to Staten Island, New York, where his father, a cabinet-maker, had emigrated. Baseball became his passion, and he signed with the Giants straight from high school in 1942. Wartime service in the air force interrupted his career, but he joined the Giants in 1947. The 1951 season became known as the Miracle of Coogan&apos;s Bluff, the site of the Giants&apos; stadium, known as the Polo Grounds. Down by 13 games in mid-August, they won 37 of their last 44 matches to tie with Brooklyn and force a three-game playoff. Thomson was the key; his manager, Leo Durocher, a former Dodger, switched him to third base, adding more power to the outfield. The Giants won the first game, at the Dodgers&apos; ground, Ebbetts Field. The Dodgers won the second at the Polo Grounds, and led 4-1 in the final inning of game three. Then, with the score 4-2 and two Giants on base, the Dodgers&apos; manager Charlie Dressen called on Ralph Branca to pitch to Thomson. Thomson drove Branca&apos;s second pitch into the left-field seats; the three-run homer won them the game. The radio announcer Russ Hodges&apos;s frantic repetitions of &quot;the Giants win the pennant!&quot; became almost as renowned as the hit itself. Red Smith, of the New York Herald Tribune, wrote: &quot;Now it is done. Now the story ends. And there is no way to tell it. The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangl- ed invention. Only the utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible again.&quot; Broadcast nationwide and to the Armed Forces network, as far away as Korea, Thomson&apos;s shot was indeed heard around the world. That night, he was offered $500 to appear on Perry Como&apos;s television show, but wanted to get home to see his family in Staten Island. The offer was then promptly raised to $1,000. &quot;For a thousand bucks, the family can wait,&quot; he said. In the World Series the Giants faced the Yankees, whose stadium loomed across the Harlem river from the Polo Grounds. They lost, 4-2. Thomson continued as a hitter, but after his best season, 1953, he was traded to Milwaukee, and promptly broke an ankle, depriving him of speed and power. Traded back in 1957, for the Giants&apos; last season before they left New York for San Francisco, he then played briefly for three more teams before ending his career in 1963 in Tokyo. Thomson was later a salesman for a paper-products company. In later years, he and Branca appeared as a travelling double act, donating much of their earnings to charity and becoming close friends. The ball he hit disappeared; its fate forms the core of Don DeLillo&apos;s novel Underworld (1997); the game itself can be heard on the car radio as Sonny Corleone is gunned down in the 1972 film The Godfather. In 2001, it was revealed that the Giants had stationed a coach in centre field with binoculars, to watch for the signs opposing catchers used to call for specific pitches. Thomson always denied being aided in this way against Branca. He said: &quot;I can remember feeling as if time was just frozen. It was a delirious, delicious moment.&quot; Thomson&apos;s wife, Elaine, predeceased him in 1993; a son, Robert, died in 2001. He is survived by two daughters, Megan and Nancy, and six grandchildren. \u2022 Robert Brown Thomson, baseball player, born 25 October 1923; died 16 August 2010"}, {"sentences": ["The chosen tracks were, of course, impeccable, beginning with the Smiths, and taking in Belle and Sebastian, Tokyo Police Club, Smashing Pumpkins, the Strokes and so on."], "tags": ["Radio", "Television & radio", "Culture", "6 Music"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-31T07:00:13Z", "title": "Shaun Keaveny | Radio review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/31/shaun-keaveny-radio-review", "article": "It was over to us, yesterday, on 6Music for a 12-hour Listener Takeover.

Yet, it&apos;s all over now. Finished.&quot; You can tell that Neary is more than pleased that attitudes to education in Britain are changing now that politicians and educators have finally realised that the brutal, roller-coaster ways of global capitalism are no friends to learning. And yet, over the last decade, many universities have invested in eye-catching architecture aimed, he says, at attracting investors and business, as a way of transforming places that should be free-thinking and outside the immediate commercial equation into marketing-driven &quot;brands&quot;. Students have become &quot;customers&quot; in business-style machines for teaching; these are expected to serve the economy by slotting graduates neatly into profitable jobs. To counteract this tendency and help re-think what universities are, what they are for and how they might build, occupy and use space intelligently \u2013 even critically, Neary has spent much of the last three years leading the research for a project called Learning Landscapes in Higher Education. This was set up at Lincoln with Professor David Chiddick, former vice-chancellor of the university, in the chair. Chiddick is the town planner, urban and transport economist who led the University of Lincoln from its old home in Hull to the cathedral city in the 1990s. He has been responsible for some fine-looking buildings on the new Lincoln campus, not least the elegant new school of architecture designed by Rick Mather in the long Gothic shadow of the medieval cathedral. The Learning Landscapes project probed the ways those who commission university buildings, those who run them, as well as those who teach, learn and research in them actually relate to built space. What role, if any, do students and academics play in the design and use of lecture theatres and other conventional teaching spaces? To what extent are new buildings simply supplied, something that staff and students blindly accept? Is there a growing gap between the concerns of academia, architecture and estate management? Working with the architects and space-planners DEGW, Neary and his colleagues visited 12 universities in Scotland, England and Wales, conducting extensive interviews in each. The team asked their hosts, including student representatives, what buildings on their campus they would like to &quot;keep, toss or create&quot;. What sort of buildings and spaces did they think might live up to Neary&apos;s &quot;three Es&quot; \u2013 &quot;efficiency, effectiveness and expression&quot;? As John Worthington of DEGW puts it, the practical aim of this research has been &quot;to dissolve the division between estate departments and teaching and learning that so often results in silos of responsibility and a lack of understanding of each others&apos; work and needs.&quot; Neary, though, believes that the research \u2013 published in the spring \u2013 is only a stepping-stone on the way to campuses that function as well as they should. &quot;It&apos;s been an academic exercise,&quot; he says, &quot;and this is just what it needs to have been. Universities are academic. What we need to do is to think of the ways in which the process of research, of critical, academic thinking by students and teachers alike can shape the physical environment around them. A university&apos;s architecture and the spaces within it, though, might adopt many different forms and models.&quot; Before I get the chance to ask how such buildings and spaces might possibly look, and how they might be used, Neary points me to Virginia Woolf&apos;s advice on how to build a university in Three Guineas, a book-length essay published in 1938. Seeing, during the heyday of totalitarianism in Europe, that our universities had done precious little to breed either a respect for liberty or a hatred for war, Woolf believed such institutions should go back to true basics. &quot;Let it be built on lines of its own. It must be built not of carved stone and stained glass, but of some cheap easily combustible material, which does not hoard dust and perpetrate traditions. Do not have chapels. Do not have museums and libraries with chained books and first editions under glass cages. Let the pictures and books be new and always changing. Let it be decorated afresh by each generation by their own hands cheaply.&quot; &quot;The most convincing new university buildings&quot;, says Neary, &quot;are those where students are given real responsibility for managing and supervising the spaces within which they learn, as well as acting as support for other students&apos; learning. The Learning Grid at the University of Warwick is the most developed form of this new kind of space.&quot; Neary was at Warwick before Lincoln. Designed by the university library with architects MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, the Learning Grid is, according to its manager, Rachel Edwards, &quot;a technology-rich, flexible and informal learning environment, open 24/7 with a capacity for 300 people&quot;. Essentially, this is a fusion of a library and a common room. It allows disciplines to cross. It encourages students to help one another as well as themselves. It is generating fresh lines of research. &quot;It&apos;s been breaking down the gap between students and teachers,&quot; says Neary, &quot;with students becoming part of the academic project rather than consumers of dispensed knowledge.&quot; Now that Neary had given me a concrete, and successful, example of what a new &quot;learning landscape&quot; might be, my mind flashed back to the visit I made a few months ago to the new Rolex learning centre at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland. Designed by the Tokyo-based architects, SANAA, this extraordinary curved and light-filled building, with its garden courtyards, its continually shifting floors, its almost complete rejection of conventional rooms, its lack of corridors and doors, and its gentle spirit of playfulness and inquiry, has been built to bring students from all faculties together. Here is a happily uncertain place of research, of academic inquiry, of debate, research and new thinking. Everything seems possible here. No restrictions on physical movement or thought. &quot;Our focus&quot;, says SANAA, &quot;is always to find different relationships.&quot; This is very much what Neary and his colleagues are rooting for, too. It implies, though, nothing less than a quiet revolution in the ways British universities are designed and run. It also demands fresh and original thinking. &quot;One thing I noticed as we travelled from university to university&quot;, says Neary, &quot;was how there&apos;s a tendency to copy or clone what other universities have already done. While this leads to some incremental learning about what makes teaching and learning spaces work, it does point to a rush to conformity rather than experimentation.&quot; &quot;You can&apos;t contain a university,&quot; says Neary, meaning that its academic mind should always be expanding and that architecture and space planning within buildings need to respond to this idea. &quot;I suppose you could sum up my approach, in headline terms, as a damning critique of the neo-liberal university. It is, but it&apos;s far from impractical. In fact, as Woolf implied, you could create a new, innovative and academically challenging environment in buildings designed in a spirit of poverty.&quot; Neary doesn&apos;t demur when I suggest that is what certain orders of medieval monks tried to do. The austere beauty of a Cistercian monastery was no real bridle to thought, although, of course, such places were there to serve God before anyone or anything else. So, has much of new university building been carried out in vain over the past decade? &quot;Of course there&apos;ve been some beautiful and excellent buildings&quot;, says Neary. &quot;What&apos;s been wrong is the whole approach to treating universities as businesses, as an appendage to the economy, rather than places where ideas can be dangerous.&quot; Learning Landscapes in Higher Education makes the point that while academics have been able to make an important contribution &quot;as clients and customers of the project management process&quot;, they need to inject academic ideas into the shaping of university buildings and campuses. The Learning Grid at Warwick and the Rolex learning centre at Lausanne give some idea of what may yet be done, and yet, as Neary would say, these examples, no matter how alluring, are not there to be copied. Universities must work things out for themselves. Meanwhile, as Morag Schiach, pro-vice chancellor for teaching and learning at Queen Mary, University of London and one of Neary&apos;s interviewees, bluntly reminds us, &quot;the extent to which higher education should foster intellectual and cultural liberty in the face of pressing economic demands from industry and government is still unresolved.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Besides Tous les Matins du Monde, further departures were Nocturne Indien (1989), a psychological drama of a man seeking a lost friend in India, and Stupeur et Tremblements (Fear and Trembling, 2003), about the cultural shock of a Belgian woman working in Tokyo for a large Japanese corporation."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "France"], "publicationDate": "2010-08-31T15:39:46Z", "title": "Alain Corneau obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/31/alain-corneau-obituary", "article": "It is fair to say that the majority of audiences who saw the film Tous les Matins du Monde (All the Mornings of the World, 1991) \u2013 directed by Alain Corneau, who has died of lung cancer aged 67 \u2013 had previously never heard of (or\u00a0heard) the music of the baroque composer and viola da gamba virtuoso Marin Marais. However, the lacuna was soon filled after this sensitive, painterly and vivid recreation of 17th-century French musical life had won seven C\u00e9sars (France&apos;s Oscars), become an international success and\u00a0resulted in a bestselling CD of the soundtrack by Le Concert des Nations ensemble. Starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu as the older Marais, looking back on his reckless younger self (played by Depardieu&apos;s son, Guillaume), it remains Corneau&apos;s biggest success outside France. In fact, Tous les Matins du Monde, one of the few films to deal with the making of classical music, was the director&apos;s ninth film and untypical of\u00a0his oeuvre, which was dominated by\u00a0polars \u2013 French crime-thrillers. He was born in the Loire valley and studied editing and direction at\u00a0L&apos;IDHEC (the Institute for Advanced Cinematographic Studies) in Paris. After graduating in 1968, Corneau, who was a\u00a0keen jazz drummer, co-directed a\u00a0short film in the US called Is There Jazz in Harlem?, and was assistant director on a quickie Roger Corman movie called Target: Harry (1969). He continued as\u00a0assistant or second unit director on his return to France, most notably on Costa-Gavras&apos;s L&apos;Aveu (The Confession, 1970), on which he met the actor Yves Montand, who was later to appear in\u00a0three of Corneau&apos;s police dramas. Corneau&apos;s ambitious first feature, France, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme (France Inc, 1974), was overly influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, and sat awkwardly between crime thriller, political satire and science fiction. For his second film, the more successful Police Python 357 (1976), Corneau&apos;s direct influence was Dirty Harry. He even got Montand, as a\u00a0maverick cop, to wear a similar jacket to that worn by Clint Eastwood in the Don Siegel movie. Montand again starred in La Menace (1977), another taut crime thriller, this time less intertextual. S\u00e9rie Noire (1979), based on Jim Thompson&apos;s novel A Hell of a Woman, but moved from LA to\u00a0a\u00a0dreary Paris suburb, was Corneau&apos;s best noir, in which his influences, including Jean-Pierre Melville, had become more absorbed into his own style. The low-key film has since gathered an additional shadow because its two leads, Patrick Dewaere and Marie Trintignant, both died young. (Corneau was the partner of\u00a0Marie&apos;s mother, the director Nadine Trintignant.) Le Choix des Armes (Choice of Arms, 1981), a\u00a0perfectly paced, atmospheric gangster movie \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, had a trio of great French stars \u2013 Montand, G\u00e9rard Depardieu and\u00a0Catherine Deneuve. With the latter two in tow, Corneau decided to try a different genre with the colonial adventure Fort Saganne (1984), which cost more than $6m, making it among the most expensive French films. Shot on location in Tunisia and Mauritania, it followed Depardieu as an officer at a garrison in French Sahara who finds some comfort in the arms of a sophisticated journalist, Deneuve. Enhanced by superb CinemaScope photography, it\u00a0was directed by Corneau with enough panache and sense of period (pre-first world war) to overcome most of the cliches. Besides Tous les Matins du Monde, further departures were Nocturne Indien (1989), a psychological drama of a man seeking a lost friend in India, and Stupeur et Tremblements (Fear and Trembling, 2003), about the cultural shock of a Belgian woman working in Tokyo for a large Japanese corporation. There were also attempts at\u00a0broad comedy (Le Prince du Pacifique, 2000) and melodrama (Les Mots Bleus, Some Kind of Blue, 2005), but Corneau was more at home with films such as Le Cousin (1997), about a\u00a0police informer, and, more significantly, Le Deuxi\u00e8me Souffle (The Second Breath, 2007). Based on a crime novel by his friend Jos\u00e9 Giovanni, the latter was a film Corneau had wanted to make for 30 years, even though Melville had filmed it in 1966. Corneau obviously felt he could bring something different to the story. But despite an interesting cast headed by Daniel Auteuil, Monica Bellucci, Michel Blanc and Eric Cantona, the film could only suffer by comparison with the earlier masterpiece. Corneau&apos;s final film, Crime d&apos;Amour (Love Crime, 2010), starring Ludivine Sagnier and Kristin Scott Thomas, proved that he could also deal with the world of women, in this case powerful female executives. The film, full of black humour and suspense, opened in\u00a0France a few weeks ago to public and critical approval. Corneau is survived by Nadine and the two children of Marie Trintignant whom the couple had adopted. \u2022 Alain Corneau, film director, born 7 August 1943; died 30 August 2010"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Before the crisis, one of our main concerns was London and Tokyo - were they taking away financial industry from the US and was excessive regulation doing that?&quot;  2.20pm: Bernanke&apos;s back on the sheer size of banks and on the need for a mechanism to wind down failed institutions in an orderly way: &quot;The most important lesson of this crisis is we have to end &apos;too big to fail&apos;.&quot;  2.24pm: Now we&apos;re beginning to zero in on the failure of Lehman Brothers."], "tags": ["Ben Bernanke", "Financial crisis", "Credit crunch", "Business", "US news", "US politics", "US Congress", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-02T12:57:24Z", "title": "Ben Bernanke quizzed by financial crisis inquiry panel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2010/sep/02/ben-bernanke-financial-crisis-inquiry", "article": " The man at the helm of America&apos;s central bank, Ben Bernanke, will spend the morning under examination over his actions to steady the US economy at the height of the global financial crisis back in September 2008. Starting at 9am ET (2pm UK), Bernanke will be questioned by a bipartisan panel chaired by Phil Angelides, a former Democratic state treasurer of California, as part of a series of evidentiary sessions entitled &quot;too big to fail: expectations and impact of extraordinary government intervention and the role of systemic risk in the financial crisis&quot;. Following up from yesterday&apos;s appearance by the former Lehman Brothers boss Dick Fuld, the panel are sure to ask Bernanke about the US government&apos;s controversial path in allowing Lehman to file for bankruptcy - despite putting together rescue packages for other banks including Bears Stearns, Wachovia and Washington Mutual. A cerebral figure, Bernanke has a habit of speaking in tortuously lengthy sentences. But I&apos;ll be following and interpreting his remarks here live, to see what new insights can be gained about the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  2.01pm: Bernanke&apos;s taking his seat, pouring himself a glass of water and the proceedings are about to start. Phil Angelides is gavelling us in. Bang, bang.  2.04pm: The Federal Reserve boss has 10 minutes to make some opening remarks.  He kicks off immediately by talking about big banks: &quot;So called too big to fail financial institutions were both a source, although by no means the only source, of the financial crisis, and an impediment to resolving it.&quot; The most prominent factor, he recalled, in precipitating the crisis was the prospect of big losses in subprime mortgages - but although mortgage losses were large, they weren&apos;t large enough to account for the entire crisis. The effect was greatly increased by existing weaknesses in the system, plus gaps in the government&apos;s &quot;tool box&quot;.  2.07pm: Financial institutions, says Bernanke, were too reliant on unstable short-term funding - the &quot;shadow banking system&quot; - which made them vulnerable to classic &quot;run on the bank&quot; situations. Poor risk management, excessive leverage of households and firms, misuse of certain financial instruments all played a part. Plus, in the public sector, gaps in the statutory framework and &quot;flaws in the performance of regulators and supervisors&quot; both in the US and elsewhere. Bernanke says there weren&apos;t enough oversight powers over the shadow banking system - including big Wall Street broker-dealerships (a clear reference to Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns). He says bank capital and liquidity standards were insufficiently stringent.  2.09pm: In the longer term, the existence of &quot;too big to fail&quot; firms creates severe moral hazard problems - and an uneven playing field between large firms and their smaller competitors. In other words, Bernanke is saying you can&apos;t have a situation where big banks take risks in the knowledge that, at the 11th hour, they will always be bailed out by the government in extremis. That&apos;s not fair on smaller financial institutions which can&apos;t rely on such a backstop.  2.10pm: We need a framework providing an appropriate mix of &quot;prudence, risk-taking and innovation&quot; in the financial system, Bernanke concludes in his opening remarks.  2.13pm: The panel&apos;s Democratic chairman, Phil Angelides, kicks off the questioning. Angelides is a clever fellow and he takes his role seriously - his questions tend to probe matters of detail, rather than to elicit grand expressions of emotion from his witnesses. He&apos;s waffling on for rather a long time. But the essence of his question is - &quot;was this a substantial miss&quot; for regulators? Did the Fed fail to see weaknesses in the system in the run-up to the crisis?  2.15pm: Bernanke says &quot;too big to fail&quot; institutions were popping up not only in the US but globally - as financial supermarkets grew - classic examples being Citigroup or firms in the UK such as RBS. He says there wasn&apos;t sufficient anticipation of the systemic risk of these huge institutions. &quot;There was a combination of the structure of the system, the underlying trends towards greater and more complex firms, together with some mistakes and shortcomings on the part of regulators.&quot;  2.18pm: A blunt point, now, from Bernanke on the international race towards deregulation - he says Wall Street and the City engaged in a damaging race to offer the lightest touch in financial oversight. &quot;Before the crisis, one of our main concerns was London and Tokyo - were they taking away financial industry from the US and was excessive regulation doing that?&quot;  2.20pm: Bernanke&apos;s back on the sheer size of banks and on the need for a mechanism to wind down failed institutions in an orderly way: &quot;The most important lesson of this crisis is we have to end &apos;too big to fail&apos;.&quot;  2.24pm: Now we&apos;re beginning to zero in on the failure of Lehman Brothers. Reviving a topic of discussion from yesterday&apos;s hearing with Dick Fuld, panel chairman Phil Angelides wants to know whether it was an active policy decision by the US authorities to allow Lehman to fail - or, presumably, just a cock-up. Angelides isn&apos;t buying previous claims that the Fed didn&apos;t have the legal authority to backstop Lehman&apos;s liabilities. What were the factors the Fed was weighing up?  2.29pm: The Federal Reserve boss says before he took the job, he was an academic and that he studied the Great Depression. He believed &quot;deeply&quot; that a failure of Lehman would be catastrophic: &quot;I never, at any time, wavered in my view that we should do absolutely everything possible to prevent the failure of Lehman.&quot; But on the fateful Sunday in September 2008 when Lehman failed, Bernanke says he was told there was a run on the bank - and that Lehman fundamentally didn&apos;t have enough capital.  &quot;Lehman did not have enough capital to allow the Fed to lend it enough to meet that run. Therefore, if we lent them money, all that would happen would be the run would succeed because it wouldn&apos;t be able to meet those demands, the firm would fail and not only would we be unsuccessful but we would have saddled the taxpayer with tens of billions of dollars of losses.&quot; In other words, the patient was dead on the operating table and no amount of blood infusion would bring it back to life. He bluntly adds: &quot;Any attempt to lend to Lehman within the law would be futile and would only result in loss of cash.&quot; Its going concern value, he adds, was melting away as customers deserted.  2.32pm: Legally speaking, Bernanke says, the Fed was not allowed to lend without a reasonable expectation of repayment. This was before the days of bail-out funds and &quot;Tarp&quot; investments. The Fed chief says Lehman simply didn&apos;t have enough collateral to backstop any injection of  &quot;It wasn&apos;t just a failure of legality it was a question of whether there was anything we could conceivably do to prevent the failure of the firm.&quot; He describes it as a &quot;myth&quot; that the government could have saved Lehman and adds: &quot;If I could have done anything to have saved it, I would have saved it.&quot; This is a bluntly opposing view to the agitation of Dick Fuld, who insisted to the panel yesterday that Lehman was &quot;mandated&quot; into bankruptcy by the government, which refused to give it access to cheap liquidity from the Fed&apos;s discount window.  2.34pm: By the way, the text of Bernanke&apos;s written testimony has been posted on the FCIC&apos;s website here. It&apos;s fairly dense stuff though and I wouldn&apos;t recommend it for bedtime reading.  2.38pm: So what&apos;s changed? Well, nowadays, Bernanke says, firms will have &quot;living wills&quot; giving instructions on how to wind them down. But a key problem, he says, is the international dimension - one bank supervised by the Fed has offices in 109 countries, each with its own bankruptcy rules and codes. Bernanke wants more global co-operation: &quot;We&apos;re going to need to develop the moral equivalent of tax treaties&quot; with other countries, frameworks on how to wind down firms. This should be a &quot;top priority&quot;, says Bernanke.  2.41pm: There are 4 or 5 countries which are the most important that the US has to work with on solving the problem of &apos;too big to fail&apos; banks, Bernanke says. Presumably (hopefully) that includes the UK. &quot;There a lot of work to be done and I think we have a way to go&quot; but there&apos;s plenty of co-operation and goodwill from international partners.  2.44pm: Meanwhile, outside the Washington inquiry panel room, there&apos;s an interesting report today on an extension of Bernanke&apos;s powers. Bloomberg Markets magazine says that the Fed is going to oversee two non-bank firms which are considered systemically important to the US economy - General Electric and Warren Buffett&apos;s Berkshire Hathaway. That&apos;s on top of its oversight of top banks and 440 &quot;thrift holding companies&quot;, the magazine reports.  2.47pm: How was Lehman Brothers&apos; failure different from AIG, which was bailed out by the government? The question is asked by panel vice-chairman Bill Thomas. Bernanke says there was a &quot;fundamental difference&quot; - while Lehman lacked collateral, AIG was in trouble because only a relatively small part of its business had gone up the creek (a financial insurance division largely based in London). He insists the Fed will be paid back for its $185bn plus bail-out package of AIG. A bit of mutual loving as Thomas thanks Bernanke for his &quot;bravery and willingness&quot; in taking such political risks during the financial crisis. Bernanke smiles wanly.  2.54pm: Suddenly an uncharacteristic dig at Wall Street &quot;rewards for failure&quot; from Bernanke. &quot;For capitalism to work, you have to have incentives tied to performance,&quot; declares Bernanke. &quot;One of the things people are very upset about is the fact that it seems like a lot of people who drove their companies into the ditch walked off with a lot of money and that&apos;s not good capitalism - it&apos;s not a good ethical outcome, either.&quot;  3.04pm: Republican panelist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President Bush, wants to know Bernanke&apos;s view of the factors behind the housing bubble. Bernanke is saying something opaque and academic about the &quot;interaction of expectations, optimism on the one hand and innovation of mortgage instruments on the other&quot;. That&apos;s a posh way of saying that homebuyers&apos; greed was matched by lenders&apos; greed. He says there were &quot;increasingly sketchy instruments&quot; such as Option ARM and interest-only mortgages, previously reserved for sophisticated investors, which became available to first-time buyers. When house prices stopped rising, the whole pack of cards came tumbling down.  3.06pm: It would have been &quot;questionable&quot;, says Bernanke, to raise interest rates in 2003 or 2004 to deflate the mortgage bubble, given what was going on in the broader economy. It would have been better, he says, to have addressed it through tighter regulation on homeloans.  3.09pm: The Fed boss is asked why, in the early days of the credit crunch, he kept insisting that the fallout could be &quot;contained&quot;. He says it&apos;s because the cost of delinquent mortgages was only going to reach about $300bn to $400bn - Bernanke admits he didn&apos;t expect reverberations to spread further. &quot;What I did not recognise was the extent to which the system had flaws and weaknesses in it that were going to amplify the initial shock from subprime and make it into a much bigger crisis.&quot;  3.18pm: Former Lehman trader Lawrence McDonald, author of &quot;a colossal failure of common sense&quot; which chronicles the collapse of Lehman, is tweeting outrage at Bernanke&apos;s testimony. McDonald is adamant that it was contradictory for the Fed to let Lehman fail, yet bail out the insurer AIG: &quot;Mr. Ben Bernanke, just like Lehman $AIG did NOT have the collateral to justify using tax payer funds to save it, not $180 bln!&quot;  3.25pm: Under questioning from former Florida governor Bob Graham, the Fed chairman says in principle, he&apos;d like to see capital surcharges on firms that are systemically critical - which would &quot;both make them safer and would make it more onerous to be a systemically cricial firm&quot;. Plus greater discipline imposed by the authorities. This would reduce the incentive for huge mega-banks to become &quot;too big to fail&quot;. And he adds that under its new power, the Fed theoretically has the power to break up firms it believes are threatening the financial system.  3.35pm: Bernanke concedes there were two areas in which the Fed could have done more to ease the crisis - in enforcing standards at the mortgage underwriting level and in the general risk management of firms to help them understand their own potential losses. &quot;One of the lessons of the crisis is that innovation isn&apos;t always a good thing,&quot; the Fed chief adds.  3.40pm: One of the panellists, John Thompson, asks a blunt question: &quot;In hindsight, would you have preferred to have saved Lehman?&quot; &quot;It&apos;s really hard to know what would have happened, um, I mean one possible scenario is that...,&quot; begins Bernanke, then he switches tack. &quot;The only way we could have saved Lehman would have been by breaking the law and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m willing to accept those consequences for the Federal Reserve and for our system of laws. I just don&apos;t think that would have been appropriate,&quot; he says. &quot;So, I wish we had saved Lehman but it was beyond our ingenuity and capacity to do it.&quot; He&apos;s re-asserting his earlier view that the Fed isn&apos;t allowed to lend when there isn&apos;t a realistic possibility of getting its money back - and that Lehman didn&apos;t have the collateral to back a loan of public money.  3.52pm: A bit of scepticism here on the Fed&apos;s claim that it couldn&apos;t have bailed out Lehman because it lacked collateral. A Republican panellist, Peter Wallison, wants to know if the Fed did an actual study on Lehman&apos;s capital at the time.  Unusually, Bernanke looks a bit uncomfortable and starts muttering about stress tests. Then he admits that he doesn&apos;t have any actual hard evidence to back up his assessment of Lehman&apos;s capital shortfall: &quot;To my knowledge, I don&apos;t have a study to hand you but it was a judgement made by the leadership of the NY Fed and the people who were charged with reviewing the books of Lehman that they were far short of what was needed to get the cash to meet the run. That was the judgement that was given to me.&quot; The debate about whether Lehman should have been rescued is coming down to this - was this simply a short-term liquidity crisis caused by a run on the bank? Or did Lehman have a bigger, broader, underlying capital hole that justified the panic by customers?  4.04pm: Here&apos;s a take on Bernanke&apos;s performance from Reuters:   Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday he could not have legally saved Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy and the firm&apos;s catastrophic failure in 2008 was a source of sadness.   4.06pm: Democrat panellist Brooksley Born wants to know if inter-connected derivatives positions were a key concern in the decision over whether to rescue Lehman. &quot;It was a significant concern,&quot; says Bernanke, who says the Fed worked hard with over-the-counter markets to try to &quot;put foam on the runway&quot; in preparation for winding down thousands of complex positions on Lehman&apos;s books.  4.13pm: Did Lehman and Bear fail only because of &quot;unjustified liquidity runs&quot; or were their genuine insolvency problems, asks Keith Hennessey, a Republican former Bush White House economist. Bernanke says there were &quot;clearly losses and liquidity issues&quot; at both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. He says Lehman had struggled to raise additional capital over the spring and summer of 2008. &quot;It was a combination of general fear, certainly, but also some legitimate concerns about both the asset position of the company, its balance sheet, but also some concerns about the longer term viability of the firm, its business model. &quot;It&apos;s the nature of financial institutions that they live on confidence. When their counterparties and customers and creditors don&apos;t believe they are sustainable, then the pressure mounts very quickly.&quot; The phrase &quot;legitimate concerns&quot; is key. It&apos;s Bernanke-speak for a slapdown of Lehman&apos;s boss Dick Fuld, who claimed yesterday that the run on his bank was caused by &quot;uncontrollable market forces&quot;, incorrect perceptions and rumours.  4.20pm: Here&apos;s a slightly off-beat question - what are the best books and speeches to read about the crisis? It&apos;s a chance for Bernanke to endorse a few works! &quot;Not to sound too professorial, there is some academic work,&quot; says Bernanke, mentioning research on bank runs done by a Yale professor, Gary Gorton.  He&apos;s also a fan of Markus Brunnermeier, a Princeton economics professor, for his scholarship on panic in the Repo market. And for a historical perspective, Bernanke recommends Lords of Finance - a Pulitzer prize-winning history of the Great Depression by Liaquat Ahamed.  4.29pm: &quot;A lot of the Wall Street guys are like greased pigs - they&apos;re hard to catch,&quot; remarks the panel&apos;s Democratic chairman, Phil Angelides, apropos of nothing in particular. Nice phrase. Angelides wants to know if the Fed has sufficient resources to police Wall Street. Bernanke doesn&apos;t really answer directly - he&apos;s meandering off on a soliloquy how much experience and expertise there is in the Fed, and his organisation&apos;s multi-disciplinary approach. He adds, though: &quot;It&apos;s never going to be the case that the government can pay what Wall Street can pay.&quot;  4.32pm: Bernanke on toxic mortgages interacting with the US economy: &quot;The e.coli got into the food supply and that caused a much bigger problem.&quot;  4.41pm: Mark-to-market accounting &quot;exacerbated somewhat&quot; the financial crisis, Bernanke says. It&apos;s the nature of the market that asset prices move up and down at times of stress. &quot;I don&apos;t think we should conclude from that we should abandon mark-to-market accounting.&quot;  4.42pm: That&apos;s it - it&apos;s all finished - Phil Angelides is thanking Bernanke for his appearance before the commission. The Fed chairman is getting up and leaving the room. I&apos;ll wrap up the main points of Bernanke&apos;s testimony in a few minutes but things seem to have gone relatively smoothly for old Ben - there haven&apos;t been too many flashpoints or embarrassing gaffes.  4.57pm: Ben Bernanke&apos;s appearance before America&apos;s financial crisis inquiry commission clocked in at two and three quarter hours. It&apos;s been a typically calm and measured performance by the Federal Reserve chairman who isn&apos;t known for intemperate outbursts - perhaps thankfully, given that he&apos;s in charge of the stability of the world&apos;s largest economy. Bernanke did produce a few gems, though, largely on the subject of Lehman Brothers&apos; collapse and the Bush administration&apos;s decision not to step in with a rescue. \u2022 It would have been &quot;illegal&quot; for the Federal Reserve to bail out Lehman Brothers because the bank didn&apos;t have collateral to back a loan from taxpayers&apos; money: &quot;The only way we could have saved Lehman would have been by breaking the law and I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m willing to accept those consequences for the Federal Reserve and for our system of laws.&quot; \u2022 Bernanke doesn&apos;t agree with Lehman&apos;s boss Dick Fuld, who testified yesterday that the run on his bank in September 2008 was unjustified and irrational panic. The Fed chairman says there were &quot;legitimate concerns&quot; among customers and counterparties about Lehman&apos;s asset position, balance sheet and business model. \u2022 The demise of Lehman was a different situation from the crisis that gripped insurer AIG. Bernanke argues that the government was legitimately able to rescue AIG because it had solid insurance assets to put up as collateral for bail-out funds. He says AIG was undermined by problems in a relatively small financial products division. \u2022 In future, banks considered systemically important will have a &quot;living will&quot; making an orderly wind-down easier, and there could be capital surcharges on financial supermarkets that get too big - all measures to stop any firm being &quot;too big to fail&quot;. \u2022 Lehman&apos;s demise was a source of &quot;sadness&quot; for Bernanke and he wishes he could have saved the bank with &quot;cheery words&quot;. \u2022 And an autumn reading list recommended by the Fed chairman - work by Princeton economist Markus Brunnermeier, Yale professor Gary Gorton and Liaquat Ahamed&apos;s book on the great depression, &quot;Lords of Finance&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["U571&apos;s setting crimes may soon be dwarfed, however, if rumours of a live-action Akira set in Manhattan, rather than nuclear-afeared Tokyo, are true."], "tags": ["Film", "Action and adventure", "Edgar Wright", "Canada", "Culture", "Americas"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-02T15:36:59Z", "title": "Location location location: Scott Pilgrim's love letter to Canada", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/sep/02/scott-pilgrim-canada-film-setting", "article": "Near the end of Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, Comeau, the guy who &quot;knows everybody&quot;, can be overheard having a conversation about which is better, the movie or the comic book. Lest I be out-meta&apos;ed, then, let me carefully sidestep the issue of whether Bryan Lee O&apos;Malley&apos;s graphic novel is superior to its big screen adaptation (or vice versa) and just say this: Hollywood nimbly dodged a fireball and landed a 64-punch combo by staying so true to Scott Pilgrim&apos;s strange, funny and very deep-rooted Canadianness. Which is not an easy thing to define. A surefire dinner party conversation starter with Canadians (and a quick way to send everyone else home early) is to ask: &quot;But what ... exactly does it mean to be Canadian?&quot; Try it. If you come up with anything other than single-tier universal healthcare, ice hockey and a sort of vague licentiousness, I have a 1kg bottle of Quebec Medium No 1 maple syrup with your name on it. But Scott Pilgrim has Canada \u2013 or at least Toronto \u2013 down. It nails the city&apos;s confident but self-conscious sense of humour, the love of bad puns (&quot;I was just a little bi-curious!&quot; &quot;Well honey, I&apos;m a little bi-furious&quot;), the self-deprecating jokes (&quot;What&apos;s the website for Amazon.ca?&quot;), and the very malleability of being Canadian (&quot;When I&apos;m around you, I kind of feel like I&apos;m on drugs. Not that I do drugs. Unless you do drugs, in which case I do them all the time.&quot;) Many Canadians feel towards their country exactly what the Scott Pilgrim comic/film feels towards its protagonist: fond contempt. Not taking yourself too seriously seems to be key when you&apos;re lying in bed with a cultural elephant that could not only squash you, but doesn&apos;t even know you&apos;re there. This wary jokiness about America is also a key element of the plot. In search of bigger US box office takings, Edgar Wright could well have set Scott Pilgrim in, say, Seattle, but only at the expense of the comic&apos;s wonderfully pitched attitude towards the States. Scott&apos;s love interest, Ramona Flowers, is an American, and so is the No 1 big boss ex-boyfriend, music promoter Gideon. The latter makes various disparaging remarks about Canada, but Scott (or, as Ramona calls him in the comic, &quot;Canada boy&quot;), fights right back: &quot;You&apos;re pretentious, this club sucks, I have beef. Let&apos;s fight.&quot; With a light touch, the film captures Toronto&apos;s paradoxical, smug inferiority towards the US, and specifically New York. Torontonians know they&apos;re less important, less powerful and generally less stylish than New Yorkers, but take a perverse pride in not caring. It shows off what I&apos;ve always loved about Toronto: its beautiful marriage of big-city sheen and quiet, empty, snow-muffled desolation. Toronto is a romantic city, especially in winter, especially if you take romance with a grain of salt. If you can set a romcom in coffee chains in Seattle, it&apos;s about time we had one on snowy park swings at midnight. Not all film adaptations are as faithful to setting \u2013 with often disastrous results. Fever Pitch transposed Nick Hornby&apos;s novel about his solitary, girl-free obsession with Arsenal into a romcom starring Jimmy Fallon as a Boston Red Sox fan. The US remake of the Australian comedy Kath and Kim inexplicably made the two characters educated, middle class and attractive, thus inherently negating the &quot;bogan&quot; hilarity of the original. Also, in its American, Richard Gere-led incarnation, Shall We Dance? was an embarrassing misstep. This makes sense when you understand that what made the original Japanese film a hit is that ballroom dancing, and the public male-female physical interaction it requires, is fairly taboo in Japan. But my vote for worst locale-changing in film goes to U571. This ping-and-periscope schlock about the boarding of a German U-boat in the second world war had the gall to state it was American submarine officers who captured the famous Enigma cipher machine from the Nazis, thus changing the course of the war and helping to defeat Hitler. It was, of course, British naval officers who captured the first Enigma, not to mention British codebreakers at Bletchley Park, led by Alan Turing (British), who cracked its secrets. The movie&apos;s only saving grace is that Jon Bon Jovi gets swept overboard. U571&apos;s setting crimes may soon be dwarfed, however, if rumours of a live-action Akira set in Manhattan, rather than nuclear-afeared Tokyo, are true. (See this artist&apos;s rendering of Akira USA for further evidence.) But that&apos;s just my precious little Canadian opinion.

Weirdly, the movie looks like an acidly satirical comedy about LA celebrity but with all the acidly satirical comedy removed, so that all that is left is a skeleton outline, a series of scenes and locations \u2013 hotel rooms, lobbies, swimming pools, luxury automobile interiors \u2013 in which essentially gentle, forgiving dialogue takes place. In her tremendously funny breakthrough movie Lost in Translation (2003), Bill Murray played an ageing, lonely actor on a trip to Tokyo, who finds fleeting companionship and even a kind of redemption in the friendship he strikes up with young and vulnerable Scarlett Johansson; their relationship morphs from platonic flirt to a touchingly paternal care. Here, Stephen Dorff plays Johnny Marco, a pampered movie actor, holed up in the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles \u2013 a self-absorbed guy who is fawned upon by assistants, producers and especially beautiful women. He is vaguely troubled by a suspicion that his life is going nowhere \u2013 a fact ironically signalled by the title and by the opening, pedantic sequence showing Johnny driving his Ferrari round and round in circles. Yet he is more borderline asshole than anything else, and never does anything really bad. Then his troubled ex-wife shows up, announces that she needs time for herself and leaves him to look after their 11-year-old daughter Cleo, played by Elle Fanning. In another type of movie, this girl would be a sharp-tongued, feisty, wise-beyond-her-years cutester who would cheerfully wreck Johnny&apos;s selfish adventures in boozing and womanising, and after a few screaming matches, force him to find the real spiritual values of fatherhood. But this never happens. Adorable Cleo just smiles sweetly at him and goes along with everything \u2013 more or less like everyone else in his life; there is only the blandest and most lenient recrimination right at the end. Occasionally, Johnny gets angry texts from women he has bedded and forgotten about, and there&apos;s even a confrontation, but this is smoothed over without any fuss. He goes along to Cleo&apos;s skating lessons and beamingly applauds in much the way he applauds the two strippers who poledance for him in his suite. Yet his louche lifestyle never contaminates his relationship with his daughter. Cleo actually shares a bed with Johnny, but there is never the smallest suggestion of anything unwholesome or inappropriate in the arrangement. Somewhere is a movie which just floats through its running time without any sort of crisis, other than the subtle, insidious crisis of identity creeping up on Johnny. The movie is, arguably, far truer to life than a more obviously scripted account, and there are some nice touches \u2013 for his &quot;old man&quot; makeup, Johnny has to endure a plaster mould slathered all over his head with breathing holes left for his nostrils. Like some monster or Egyptian mummy, we see him stifling with loneliness. Cocooned in celebrity, he can make contact with no one. Coppola is arguably very indulgent to both daddy and daughter, and to the rich and famous generally, and audiences may be bemused or exasperated, according to taste. For all the similarities, this does not have the brilliant seriocomic moments of Lost in Translation.

Not only has he lived the life \u2013 his 20s were, by his own account, a decade devoted to disastrous financial punts and druggy self-destruction in his family&apos;s Mexican mansion \u2013 but he has the Rabelaisian prose style to match. His sentences are toxic assets, often built on wild speculation; his metaphors complex derivatives that you love or hate for their indulgent bravado. From the Booker-winning Vernon God Little on, he has been trading in futures that come into focus every now and then as a skewed and psychotic version of the\u00a0present. These sometimes compulsive, sometimes alienating liberties are contained here in the voice of another of his neurotic escapees from the culture, which in Pierre&apos;s terms is a &quot;nimbus&quot; of blasted morals and unchecked market forces. Gabriel Brockwell, 25, is in limbo, &quot;firstly because I decided to kill myself. And then because of this idea: I don&apos;t have to do it immediately.&quot; He is also, when we meet him, in rehab, though not for long. The self-determined gap between life and death is above all a liberation, and his freedom extends to his grip on reality. He is all baroque gesture and paranoid symbolism. His confinement has been brought about by his less than heroic part in an anti-capitalist demo at which he excused himself from the riot by taking out his cash card and letting himself into a bank&apos;s lobby. He will end it all, he decides, only after he has organised one final great bacchanal, a bonfire of the bankers, a last supper to end all last suppers. His plan requires the assistance of his comrade Nelson Smuts, an anarchic chef, a sort of Baader-Meinhof with Michelin aspirations. Smuts is currently resident in Tokyo, where he is dicing with blowfish poison. To raise the funds, Brockwell cleans out his anti-capitalist collective&apos;s war chest, fills his pockets with drugs and takes leave of his squat: &quot;an early twenty-first English household \u2013 which is to say a tri-sexual household of unparented narcissists where, in the twenty minutes I was there, cash and products were transacted four ways to a sum of four hundred pounds, and no fewer than five laws were broken&quot;. What follows is a sort of addled odyssey fuelled by comic self-aggrandisement and rage against the various machines of money-making. This whirlwind narrative is punctuated with extravagant set pieces, climaxing, literally, in Smuts having violent sex with his teenage stalker in a restaurant fish tank, a scene that acts as a kind of hors d&apos;oeuvres for the decadence that\u00a0follows. In the midst of Pierre&apos;s soupy plot you either sink or swim, clinging to vivid passing phrases, holding your breath for moments of minor revelation. His writing falls somewhere in a spectrum between William Burroughs and JP Donleavy, a sort of narco-blarney. At its best it captures some of the rigorous circumlocution and comedy of Iain Sinclair in full rant mode, but there are plenty of duff notes and a good deal of baffling rhetorical nonsense. &quot;Euro teens gaggle like piles of socks,&quot; he will write. Arguments occasionally nose into view. The novel&apos;s undercurrent is a discussion of whether greed and excess is hardwired into nature, whether humans are born to consume. Brockwell gets his education from the various stooges who assist his efforts to stage his farewell dinner \u2013 Didier and Gerd and Gottfried, none of whom emerges quite into the shape of a character. &quot;Capitalism was never a device for societies,&quot; one of them explains. &quot;Here&apos;s the analogy. Think of a space rocket. Ninety nine per cent of the rocket is just a fuel can \u2013 and when the fuel is used up it just falls back to earth. What you see now in the economy is just that \u2013 the can falling down empty. The people who built the rocket are way up in space. Nothing will ever touch them or their descendants again, not for five hundred\u00a0years...&quot; Brockwell&apos;s apocalyptic banquet is designed for exactly those quantum individuals who have lately escaped the tether of the world; and when he has secured Hitler&apos;s derelict Tempelhof airport in Berlin for the feast, they fly in from the world&apos;s four corners, the accumulators of wealth, the billionaires, the &quot;camel herders and the ruthless bourgeoisie&quot;, the &quot;bacteria in suits&quot;. Smuts&apos;s feast magnifies the fall of Rome, with its hummingbird broth and its panda paw and its white tiger cub with silken tofu and eggplant.

Its three-day vernissage is a mighty schmoozefest of architectural clans, eased by a diet of bellinis and dinners on rooftop terraces. The vernissage, in truth, usually seems the point of the thing, rather than the three succeeding months when the humble paying punters can see the exhibition for themselves. Architects, you might think, should know something about making pleasurable spaces. It&apos;s their job. Yet the paradox of the biennale is that, bellinis apart, it is usually a physically awful experience. You are battered with strident images and turgid texts, and your vital forces drain into countless flickering screens. The Corderie dell&apos;Arsenale, the 300m-long former ropeworks where a large chunk of the biennale is shown, becomes an exhausting slog through mounds of ego and assertion. One of the good things about this year&apos;s biennale, the 12th, is that it is delightful. It alerts the senses and the mind. It has life. The content of the Corderie has presence, but is not too densely packed, and skilfully mixes up heavy and light, light and dark, cool and warm, image and object. You come early to giant beams installed by the Spanish architect Ant\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Abril, precariously balanced. Later a light metal bridge takes you on a looping journey up into an artificial cloud. An Olafur Eliasson installation of water sprays, momentarily arrested by flickering lights, is relief from the sweltering summer heat. There is another installation of delicate steel threads, so delicate indeed that an unfortunate accident with a spectator left it in need of restoration. Then there is a room with photographs of the Iranian city of Isfahan, simply presented, and another with finely crafted drawings of some fairly humble buildings. There is another room packed with talking heads, examples of the 2,000 hours of interviews that the art curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist has carried out in his life. Here you can get your ordeal-by-screen over with, once and for all. The delightfulness of the biennale has something to do with the fact that it is, unusually, directed by a practising architect, and a good one. She is also the first female director. She is Kazuyo Sejima, one half of the Tokyo-based practice Sanaa, whose works include the recent Rolex learning centre in Lausanne. The director&apos;s job is to set a theme, and decide the content of the Corderie and of a large building called the International pavilion. Individual countries then present their own shows, more-or-less following the theme. Bigger, more established countries show these in purpose-built pavilions in the biennale gardens. Others, including Ireland and Singapore, find locations elsewhere in Venice. The theme is tricky, as it has to be both wide-ranging and focused. Usually directors settle for titles that can mean almost anything or, as in 2004&apos;s &quot;Metamorph&quot;, nothing at all. Once it was &quot;Less Aesthetics, More Ethics&quot; and turned out to be the precise opposite. Sejima chose &quot;People Meet in Architecture&quot;. It sounds a bit soggy, and also guilty of architects&apos; common pretence that they are not obsessed with buildings when, in fact, they always are. But its vagueness allows her to exercise her impeccable judgment in selecting exhibitors, while also creating an overall experience in which architecture is the main but not the only ingredient. There is also art, film and, indeed, people. So her exhibit in the International pavilion contains Fray Foam Home, a baffling but charming cloud of coloured stuff, by Andr\u00e9s Jaque Arquitectos, somehow abstracted from the contents of a typical home. There is a straightforward display of the great postwar Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi, whose lightness of touch prefigures Sejima&apos;s. There is a very serious, but subtle, plan by the Architectural Research Unit of London for a series of Korean new towns built on reclaimed land. There is a huge model of a piece of Japanese landscape, in which nestles a dewdrop-like Sanaa project. Together these exhibits, ranging from Korean cities to bits of fluff, create an atmosphere, or a series of sensations, or tastes. Architecture is the thing that makes this atmosphere possible, but it does not dominate. Outside Sejima&apos;s immediate control, the place that most responds to her spirit is the British pavilion. It is curated by Vicky Richardson of the British Council and the architect/artist practice muf. It is about cultural traffic between Britain and Venice, represented by the writings and drawings of John Ruskin and institutions such as Venice in Peril. The pavilion aims to be not just a thing to gawp at, but also a place of use to Venetians while it is there, with events, drawing classes and debates, held in a scale model of a section of the 2012 Olympic stadium. It is also about what muf call &quot;close looking&quot;, which means paying attention to the particular and specific. Examples include Ruskin&apos;s small notebooks of Venice, returned to the city for the first time since he made them, and an archive of photographs, taken over two decades, of everything in the city from palaces to gas holders. A section of salt marsh is created, of the kind that surrounds Venice and is integral to its ecology, but of which you are unaware when you are in the city. Implicit in the promotion of close looking is a criticism of the kind of masterplanning, as in London&apos;s Olympic project, which starts by sweeping away what is already there. Not everything in the biennale follows the director&apos;s lead. There is a display of the West Kowloon cultural district \u2013 a plan to correct Hong Kong&apos;s perceived lack of culture by building 15 venues all in one go. Three architects are competing for this plum job, and present their ideas in videos of stunning banality. Norman Foster promises streets that are &quot;familiar but different&quot;, before displaying spaces that look like a very undifferent kind of mall. Even the legendary brain of Rem Koolhaas has dumbed down for the purposes of this project, but he still deserves to win for having done so the least. Meanwhile, Audi presented their lavish Urban Futures project, in which an interested group of architects were asked to imagine what cities might be like in the future, especially in relation to transport. Luckily for the sponsors, the future still seems to include cars, albeit driverless ones, which use space more efficiently and allow city streets to be more actively used by pedestrians. The technology is all there, apparently: the show could be either one of those fantasies that will look quaint in 20 years&apos; time, or genuinely prescient. But it is Sejima&apos;s spirit that makes this biennale one of the best in years. The architectural world is currently in the grip of a predictable reaction to the boomtime cult of the icon, when symbols of architectural genius garnished the works of rampant capital. There is a tendency now to think the only valid form of architecture is to help earthquake victims, or do something to solve the Palestinian problem, a tendency that has its own pomposity and vanity. Sejima steps to the side of this opposition, and shows what architects should spend much of their time doing. Which is to make spaces. With people in them."}, {"sentences": ["Born in Tokyo, Kawamoto became entranced by puppets as a youngster after being shown how to make them by his grandmother."], "tags": ["Animation", "Animation", "Japan", "Film", "Television", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-05T16:44:07Z", "title": "Kihachiro Kawamoto obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/05/kihachiro-kawamoto-obituary", "article": "Kihachiro Kawamoto, who has died aged 85, was best known in Japan for creating the vast array of puppets populating the live-action historical television series Romance of the Three Kingdoms (1982-84) and Tale of Heike (1993-95). He was also highly regarded internationally for haunting stop-motion animations, such as Dojoji Temple (1976) and House of Flame (1979), in which the figures are manipulated and photographed frame-by-frame so that they appear to move on their own. Like his one-time collaborator Tadanari Okamoto, with whom he toured his independent films from 1972 to 1980, his exercises in stop-motion puppetry were influenced by European practices. But Kawamoto&apos;s ornate works are also deeply rooted in Japanese folklore and aesthetics, with an overarching philosophy based on Buddhism. They are a powerful reminder of the more artisanal traditions within Japanese animation that are often ignored by western commentators&apos; focus on commercial anime. Kawamoto completed a total of 10 short works and the features Rennyo and His Mother (1981) and A Book of a Dead Person (2005), as well as overseeing the 2003 omnibus Winter Days, which brought together 35 of the world&apos;s leading independent animators, including Yuri Norstein, Alexandre Petrov, Bretislav Pojar and Koji Yamamura, to visually interpret a verse by the haiku poet Matsuo Basho.     Briar-Rose or The Sleeping Beauty (1990), a dark fantasy with Freudian undercurrents, directed by Kihachiro Kawamoto    Most of Kawamoto&apos;s animations used puppets that he created. The Demon (1973), about a terrifying encounter deep in the forest, adheres closely to the pared-down presentational style typified by bunraku puppet theatre, with its plain black backdrops and minimalist designs. House of Flame (1979), based on a Noh drama, is a stunning tale of a ghostly maiden confined within the purgatory of her earthly desires. He also experimented with collage techniques in films such as The Trip (1973), a surreal rendition of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Prague, drawing on Buddhist concepts of suffering. In 1988, he made To Shoot Without Shooting, a co-production with Shanghai Animation Film Studio, in which an ambitious Chinese archer&apos;s quest for perfection presents an allegory for the nuclear arms race. Born in Tokyo, Kawamoto became entranced by puppets as a youngster after being shown how to make them by his grandmother. He made figurines of popular stars of the day and staged them in dramatic tableaux. Despite being an avid movie fan, he originally had no plans to make a career out of his hobby. He was drafted after graduating in architecture from Yokohama National University in 1944, although he remained stationed in Japan for the remainder of the second world war. In 1946, after an introduction from an old school friend, he entered Toho film studios as an assistant in the art department, but lost his job in 1950 after a series of labour disputes rocked the company. Kawamoto supported himself until 1953 by making dolls of popular western movie stars, which were photographed for the magazine Asahi Graph. This brought him to the attention of Tadasu Iizawa, a playwright and journalist who enlisted Kawamoto to provide the puppets for a series of photo storybooks for children, several of which were issued in English-language editions. &quot;Even though these were really dolls, I call them puppets because they were actors within the books,&quot; Kawamoto said. Under the mentorship of the veteran animator Tadahito Mochinaga, Kawamoto and Iizawa produced Japan&apos;s first stop-motion works with a series of television commercials and the critically lauded Beer, Those Were the Days\u2026, a 12-minute colour promotional film for Asahi Breweries that was shown in cinemas in 1956. During this time, Iizawa introduced Kawamoto to the film The Emperor&apos;s Nightingale (1949), made by the Czech animator Jir\u00ed Trnka. Kawamoto was impressed by the way Trnka &quot;was able to tell a story in a poetic style through the use of puppets&quot;. While it kept him gainfully employed, Kawamoto soon became disillusioned with advertising work and creating puppets for children&apos;s television. He took the bold step of writing to Trnka out of the blue, inquiring about the possibility of studying at his studios in Prague to come closer to his ambition of creating more personal animations. Kawamoto was invited to spend a year at Trnka&apos;s studios in 1963. Several years after returning to Japan he completed the short film The Breaking of Branches Is Forbidden (1968). Kawamoto later revisited Trnka Studios to make Briar-Rose or The Sleeping Beauty (1990), a dark fantasy with Freudian undercurrents set in a fairytale world of castles and exuberant medieval pageants. The film evoked Trnka&apos;s works as well as the magical tales of the Brothers Grimm. In 2005, after the completion of A Book of a Dead Person, Kawamoto was honoured with a retrospective of his work at the Karlovy Vary film festival A number of other high-profile international retrospectives have been held, including a British touring programme in 2008, which I organised. I had met Kawamoto in 2004, in the makeshift studio space donated by Tama Art University for the production of A Book of a Dead Person, on which he was then working with the university&apos;s students. I was struck by his intellectual sharpness, his generosity and the general air of tranquillity with which he went about his work. Kawamoto was the president of the Japan Animation Association from 1988 until his death.

The meat, worth about 60,000 yen, was part of a much larger quantity habitually taken from the Nisshin Maru, the fleet&apos;s mother ship, and sold for personal profit, they said. &quot;This sentence is totally disproportionate and completely undeserved,&quot; Suzuki said after the ruling at Aomori district court. &quot;We set out to reveal the truth about the government&apos;s whaling programme, but instead have been punished, while those behind the misuse of public money walk free.&quot; The Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo, a quasi-governmental body that organises the annual hunts, insists that members of the crew traditionally take home small amounts of meat as gifts for their families after spending months at sea. The International Whaling Commission permits Japan to kill about 950 whales a year for &quot;scientific research&quot;, despite a 1986 ban on commercial whaling. The meat from the culls is sold on the open market in Japan. Suzuki, 43, and Sato, 33, who were alerted to embezzlement by a member of the whaling crew, took their findings to the authorities in May 2008 after a three-month Greenpeace investigation into the whistleblower&apos;s claims. Some whalers would take home up to 10 boxes of whale meat, which fetches about 20,000 yen a kilo when sold legally, the whistleblower, known only as &quot;Kujira-san&quot; (Mr Whale), told the Guardian in an interview. Prosecutors decided not to pursue the case and instead arrested the activists. They were held for 23 days without charge, during which they were interrogated while strapped to chairs, and were compared  to members of Aum Supreme Truth, the doomsday cult that carried out the fatal gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. &quot;In the international court of public opinion, Junichi and Toru were acquitted a long time ago,&quot; Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International, told reporters in Aomori. &quot;Their actions were not of a criminal nature. They were acting in the public interest and to expose the mass theft of Japanese taxpayers&apos; money. &quot;We appeal to the Japanese government to launch an independent commission of inquiry to explore the initial allegations made by Junichi and Toru.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;I am aware of the news reports, but all I can say is that we are collecting information from various fronts and rushing to analyse it,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, told reporters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-06T13:20:57Z", "title": "Kim Jong-il set to anoint youngest son at North Korea party congress", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/06/kim-jong-il-name-successor", "article": "   A picture believed to be of the North Korean leader's son Kim Jong-un, taken in Berne. Photograph: Yonhap/AFP/Getty Images    Members of North Korea&apos;s ruling party were gathering in Pyongyang for a rare meeting that could see the country&apos;s leader, Kim Jong-il, name his youngest son as his successor. Although the exact date of the congress, the first of the Korean Workers&apos; party for 30 years, had yet to be announced, reports in South Korea said troops had moved into the capital, apparently in preparation for a parade to mark the event. In recent days, North Korean schoolchildren have taken to the streets to sing Footsteps, a song many believe was written for Kim&apos;s third son, Kim Jong-un, who is tipped to become the third member of the dynasty to rule the communist state. In addition, thousands of people waving plastic flowers spent the weekend rehearsing for a parade, according to China&apos;s Xinhua news agency. The city is reportedly decked out in posters announcing the meeting. &quot;Let&apos;s make this a festive event that will shine in the history of our country and people,&quot; read one seen in footage from AP Television News. The Rodong Sinmun, the party&apos;s newspaper, said delegates from across the country were poised to approve key policies and personnel changes at the heart of the regime&apos;s leadership. The meeting coincides with the 62nd anniversary, on 9 September, of North Korea&apos;s founding by Jong-un&apos;s grandfather, Kim Il-sung. In a typically colourful commentary, the Rodong Sinmun said: &quot;The people&apos;s hearts awaiting the revolutionary, festive occasion heat up due to their joy and happiness.&quot; Speculation that Kim Jong-un will eventually succeed Kim Jong-il has intensified since his 68-year-old father suffered a stroke two years ago. Kim Chan-gyong, an assistant professor at the North Korean academy of social science, said the conference signalled a turning point for the regime. &quot;I think it will serve as an important occasion amid our efforts to build a powerful socialist nation ... at a time when there is historic demand for a new turning point,&quot; he told APTN. The international community will use what information it can glean from reports of the secretive meeting to piece together an idea of how North Korea might behave under a new leader. &quot;I am aware of the news reports, but all I can say is that we are collecting information from various fronts and rushing to analyse it,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;Japan&apos;s biggest interest lies in whether the meeting produces a regime that could help pave the way for breaking a stalemate in the six-party talks on North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme.&quot; The meeting is the first party congress since 1980, when Kim Jong-il was confirmed as Kim Il-sung&apos;s successor, although he did not become leader until his father&apos;s death in 1994. It comes at a time of rising tensions in the region: relations with Seoul quickly deteriorated after international inspectors said a North Korean torpedo had sunk the Cheonan, a South Korean naval ship, in March. While Pyongyang has indicated it is willing to return to nuclear talks \u2013 with conditions \u2013 the US, Japan and South Korea say they will only consider reopening negotiations if the regime apologises for the Cheonan sinking. North Korea denies involvement in the incident, in which 46 sailors died. Little is known about Kim Jong-un. He is thought to be aged 27 or 28 and was educated at the prestigious International School of Berne, in Switzerland. A widely circulated, but unconfirmed, photograph of him appears to have been taken when he was in his teens. Kim Jong-il&apos;s recent visit to China is being seen as part of efforts to win support for the power switch from North Korea&apos;s only ally and biggest aid donor. There has been no confirmation of rumours that Kim Jong-un accompanied his father on the trip. Reports from the South say the country&apos;s fearsome propaganda machine has already begun building a cult of personality around Kim Jong-un, including the release of poems and songs extolling his virtues as a leader. His ascent to the Workers&apos; party hierarchy is thought to have begun last year when he was reportedly rubber-stamped as a member of parliament. North Korea experts believe Kim Jong-il will place his son in a key party post, giving him a base from which to emulate his father&apos;s rise through the ranks of the country&apos;s military and political elites. While little progress has been made in resolving the Cheonan incident or restarting nuclear talks, North Korea has made what it called &quot;humanitarian gestures&quot; that analysts say are intended to improve its international standing. Last month, it released aUS man who had entered the country illegally, following an intervention by the former US president, Jimmy Carter. Today, it said it would release seven members of a South Korean fishing vessel, including three Chinese, who apparently strayed into North Korean waters in early August. The state-run Korean Central News Agency said the fishermen would be sent back to South Korea after they &quot;admitted the seriousness of their act and gave assurances that they would never repeat it&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Two series of photographs \u2013 Protest, Tokyo, 1969 and Eros, Tokyo, 1969 \u2013 record the often turbulent youth cultural changes of the time.", "Shinjuku, named after a shopping district in central Tokyo, chronicles the rise of a young and rebellious Bohemianism that, as an older outsider, he saw \u2013 as he later put it \u2013 &quot;through the eyes of a stray dog&quot;."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Photography", "Culture", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-06T13:41:10Z", "title": "Shomei Tomatsu: the man who changed Japanese photography for ever | Sean O'Hagan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/06/shomei-tomatsu-japanese-photography", "article": "At first glance, it looks like a skinned cat or dog, perhaps even a suckling pig hanging outside a roadside restaurant. On closer inspection, it could be the corpse of a mutant creature from the depths of David Cronenberg&apos;s imagination. It is, in fact, a beer bottle that has been fused into a misshapen, almost muscular, form by the unimaginably intense heat of a nuclear blast. Shomei Tomatsu&apos;s most well-known photograph, simply entitled Melted Bottle, Nagasaki, 1961, is also one of his most surreal. It was taken while he was on a magazine assignment to photograph the reconstruction of the devastated city. Tomatsu, then 31, had, like many Japanese people, chosen not to confront the trauma of Nagasaki, but what he found there made him rethink his attitude to his country&apos;s history as well as to photography. He set out to try and record a city that, like the country as a whole, was intent on building its future while wiping out many traces of its past.     A detail from Melted Bottle, Nagasaki, 1961 (from series Nagasaki 11:02). Photographer: Shomei Tomatsu/Marta    The melted bottle was just one of several sad, strange relics of the atomic devastation that he found on display in a small museum of remembrance, which Tomatsu wandered into on one of his many walks around Nagasaki. He immediately recognised the object&apos;s power and mystery. Like many of his most powerful images, Melted Bottle possesses a strange, almost dreamlike power that intrigues and unsettles, taking the viewer into an unfamiliar terrain far beyond the parameters of reportage. He also photographed a wristwatch whose hands were frozen at 11.02am on 9 August 1945, the moment the A-bomb exploded, and the blasted remains of statues of angels from a Christian church in the city. The American curator and critic Leo Rubenstein described Tomatsu&apos;s Nagasaki photographs as &quot;sad, haggard facts&quot;, noting that, as Tomatsu wandered with his camera, &quot;beneath the surface there was a grief so great that any overt expression of sympathy would have been an insult.&quot; Tomatsu did, though, summon up the lasting horror of Nagasaki in portraits of the dreadfully scarred skin of survivors of the blast \u2013 pictures that suggest the psychological as well as physical cost of the nuclear attack. Though still relatively unknown outside Japan, Tomatsu, now 80, is arguably the greatest and most influential of all the photographers that emerged during his country&apos;s turbulent postwar era. Over a span of 50 years, his work has reflected, often obliquely, the changes in Japanese culture as the American military presence and then the unstoppable spread of American popular culture, helped shaped a new outward-looking, consumer-driven nation. Two series of photographs \u2013 Protest, Tokyo, 1969 and Eros, Tokyo, 1969 \u2013 record the often turbulent youth cultural changes of the time. His book, Oh! Shinjuku, named after a shopping district in central Tokyo, chronicles the rise of a young and rebellious Bohemianism that, as an older outsider, he saw \u2013 as he later put it \u2013 &quot;through the eyes of a stray dog&quot;. Those words seem prophetic. Tomatsu was one of the giants of Japanese photography that a younger generation of photographers who came to prominence in the late 60s reacted against. Known as the Provoke Movement, after the magazine that published their work, it included Daido Moriyama, Takuma Nakahira and Koji Taki. In its founding statement of intent, Taki wrote: &quot;We photographers must use our own eyes to grasp fragments of reality far beyond the reach of pre-existing language, presenting materials that actively oppose words and ideas ... materials to provoke thought.&quot; Forty years on, though, Tomatsu&apos;s radical approach \u2013 his freeform, expressionist style, odd camera angles, strange cropping and framing \u2013 has been reappraised and he is now seen, ironically enough, as one of the pioneers of the Provoke era. What he makes of all this is anyone&apos;s guess; he is famously reclusive and has never ventured outside Japan. In 2006, a retrospective of Tomatsu&apos;s work, entitled Skin of the Nation, was held at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco, shocking and enthralling many visitors who were unfamiliar with his work, its shifts in style and subject matter as well as its double-edged treatment of Japanese traditions and symbols. Alongside Nagasaki and its traumas, Tomatsu&apos;s abiding subject is the collision of the east and the west, and the cultural \u2013 and moral \u2013 tremors that resulted. For all these reasons, his work is complicated and even contradictory. Often, for instance, Tomatsu pointed his camera down at the earth itself, capturing the debris and detritus of humanity: a shoe embedded in mud, a discarded cigarette end. The runic imprints of human activity \u2013 and time itself \u2013 on asphalt and tarmac. In all of this, Tomatsu transformed the very idea of photography in Japan. His willingness to take formal and emotional risks reverberates to this day in the work of his great friend and admirer, Daido Moriyama and in the often explicit imagery of Nobuyoshi Araki. It was Moriyama who noted Tomatsu&apos;s &quot;awesome tenacity&quot; in following his photographic vision, but that vision is awesome, too, in its range. He is a capturer of life in all its intense, often baffling, intimacy; a visionary who looked anew at skin and sky, earth and street, hair and concrete, as well as all manner of ephemeral-seeming things. His camera caught and remade them all. Now see thisLeonce Raphael Agbodj\u00e9lou is a studio photographer from Porto-Novo in Benin. In a new exhibition of his portraits of friends, family members and customers, on at the Jack Bell Gallery in London, wildly coloured textiles abound: backdrop fabric clashing with the patterned floor and the bright clothing of his subjects.

He was 6ft 6in (1.98m) tall, weighed in at around 120kg (18st 13lb) and was, according to his British contemporary Tony Sweeney, &quot;so strong that he could have thrown you over his shoulder like a rubbish bin if he wanted to&quot;. But that was not Geesink&apos;s way. &quot;He\u00a0was superbly fit and very, very subtle \u2013 a real technician,&quot; said Sweeney. Geesink won the open (unlimited weight) title at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, when judo was featured for the first time. For the Japanese, judo transcends sport. Success at the Tokyo Olympics was an endorsement of the national identity. Japanese fighters duly won the first three titles (lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight), but this was no compensation when the Dutchman Geesink won the fourth, and most important, crown. The Japanese were mortified, but Geesink&apos;s victory effectively reshaped the future of the sport. The 1964 Games were the first to be televised live by satellite and the image of the giant Geesink towering over his opponent, Akio Kaminaga, went around the world. &quot;That moment was not just good for Dutch sport, but for the sport of judo,&quot; said Jos Hell, president of the Dutch Judo Federation. &quot;Without Anton&apos;s victory, judo would not have become so\u00a0popular as an international sport.&quot; Geesink was born in Utrecht and brought up in Wijk C, the bustling, energised heart of the city. His family was poor and he started work as a\u00a0labourer on building sites aged 12. He took up judo when he was 14 and progressed quickly, competing in his first European championship at 17 (winning a silver medal). By the time of his retirement, in 1967, he had amassed 21 European titles, a record unlikely to be broken. In the world championships, Geesink&apos;s breakthrough came in Paris in 1961, when he beat the reigning champion, Japan&apos;s Koji Sone. For judo purists, this was the seminal moment; the first non-Japanese world champion. But the world did not watch judo championships, unless they were in the Olympics. Geesink had previously trained with Yasuichi Matsumoto at Tenri University in Nara. Matsumoto put him up against Japanese judokas in training, in the hope that one of them would beat him, but in the knowledge that it was unlikely. Geesink would later say that this was his finishing school. In the preliminary rounds of the Olympic competition, Geesink met and defeated Kaminaga. Sweeney was in the packed Nippon Budokan Hall when Geesink and Kaminaga met again in the final. &quot;When Kaminaga came out there was a shrill, almost hysterical, scream from somebody in the crowd, and Kaminaga glanced up. He looked really grey and subdued,&quot; said Sweeney. It took nine minutes and 33 seconds for Geesink to win by kesa-gatame, a\u00a0ground hold where one arm goes behind the opponent&apos;s neck and the other secures his arm. At the victory, a Dutch official rushed on to the mat but turned back as\u00a0Geesink raised an imperious arm. The\u00a0two fighters bowed to each other and to the referees. According to Jim Bregman, who was in the American team in Tokyo, the Japanese returned to\u00a0their changing rooms and wept. Geesink would win one more world title, in Rio de Janeiro in 1965, when he won the 80kg event. The Dutchman withdrew from the open event because of a leg injury. In later life both knees would be replaced by artificial joints, caused by the wear and tear of judo. After his retirement, Geesink was a part-time professional wrestler for five years. He also appeared in advertisements (he was the face of Fyffes bananas) and films, the most notable being I Grandi Condottieri (1965), an Italian version of Samson and\u00a0Delilah. He also taught in his own judo club in Utrecht. In 1987 Geesink became a member of\u00a0the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, had deemed that Geesink should become one of the Dutch representatives, but some members of\u00a0the Dutch national Olympic committee thought he was not the obvious candidate. Geesink did not always help himself in such circumstances, as he was inclined to say exactly what he thought, irrespective of\u00a0the consequences. He was one of 13 IOC members investigated in a vote-buying scandal in 1999, in the run-up to the 2002 winter Olympics. He admitted that his Anton Geesink Foundation had received a\u00a0cheque for $5,000 from the bank account of the president of the bid committee for Salt Lake City, which went on to host the 2002 event. It was accepted by the IOC that Geesink had used the money to promote his Dutch Olympic academy and not for personal gain. He was let off with a warning. He is survived by Jans, his wife of\u00a0more than 50 years; his sons, Willy and Anton; and his daughter, Leni.  \u2022 Antonius Johannes Geesink, judoka, born\u00a06 April 1934; died 27 August 2010"}, {"sentences": ["James Webb, Tokyo, Japan Is a feminist who wears make-up a\u00a0hypocrite?"], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2010-09-07T13:03:00Z", "title": "Poverty and prolixity", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/07/guardian-weekly-notes-and-queries", "article": "Which language has the most limited vocabulary?

In less than a day, the blob had spread throughout the entire city, concentrating itself along major transport routes. Fortunately for the citizens of the great Japanese metropolis, the blob did its work on a model. Flakes of oats stood in for the major urban zones and the scientists involved were no B-movie villains. Rather, they were biologists studying the sophisticated behaviour of a slime mould, an oozing blob of goo that performs feats of apparent intelligence despite being completely brainless. The slime mould Physarum polycephalum spends most of its life as a yellow mat, sliding among the leaf litter in its search for food, such as bacteria and fungal spores. This mat is a gigantic single cell, called a plasmodium, which forages by sending out dozens of tendrils from a central mass. The branches of this living network grow and shrink, emerge and vanish, according to what they encounter. Without a brain, Physarum makes decisions by committee. The plasmodium is a single sac but it behaves like a colony. Every part rhythmically expands and contracts, pushing around the fluid inside. If one part of the plasmodium touches something attractive, like food, it pulses more quickly and widens. If another part meets something repulsive, like light, it pulses more slowly and shrinks. By adding up all of these effects, the plasmodium flows in the best possible direction without a single conscious thought. It is the ultimate in crowdsourcing. Despite its lack of a nervous system, Physarum can still solve problems such as mazes, finding the shortest path between two exits baited with food. At first, it extends its tendril network throughout the entire labyrinth before trimming away the dead-end branches, leaving behind a single thick tube that covers the most direct path. If parts of the maze are bathed in unpleasant bursts of light, Physarum will find an alternative route that sticks to the shadows. Here&apos;s where miniature Tokyo comes in. Physarum is so good at finding quick routes between different places that Atsushi Tero from Hokkaido University wanted to see if it could match human town planners. He placed the mould in his food-based model of Tokyo, with patches of light representing impassable terrain. Sure enough, the mould filled the entire area before thinning out into selective connections between the food sources. These final networks were strikingly similar to Tokyo&apos;s actual railway system, and comparable in terms of efficiency and resistance to problems. Physarum accomplishes all of this without any forethought. It behaves like a town planner who cakes a city in rails before strengthening what works and demolishing what does not. It seems haphazard but this technique, honed by millennia of evolution, allows the giant cell to efficiently shunt nutrients from one end to another. The result is a biological network that matches the best man-made efforts. Physarum is also a skilled decision-maker. At the University of Sydney, Tanya Latty and Madeleine Beekman found that it can weigh up different options to make the best possible choice. If it encounters several food morsels of varying nutritional quality, it devours them in the right proportions to get a balanced diet. The slime mould is also vulnerable to problems that plague human decisions. Latty&apos;s latest studyin the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, shows that when choosing between foods, the moulds that make the quickest choices also make more bad decisions, while those that take their time are more accurate. Its preferences can also be swayed through simple marketing tactics. Physarum has no inclination towards either a hefty food chunk bathed in light or a medium-sized piece in shadow; both options have pros and cons. But Latty and Beekman changed the slime mould&apos;s behaviour by giving it a third option that makes one of the originals seem more attractive \u2013 a small morsel in shadow, say. Human businesses use the same tactics to influence their customers too \u2013 unattractively basic products can make expensive ones seem more desirable, while even expensive products look like a steal if they&apos;re placed next to even more costly alternatives (think vintage wine). Despite the gulf of intelligence that separates us, both humans and slime moulds like to compare our options, rather than paying attention to their absolute values. Whether any of this actually counts as intelligence, though, is debatable. Physarum will not be challenging chess grandmasters any time soon but in a 2001 paper, Toshiyuki Nakagaki, who worked on the Tokyo and maze-solving studies wrote: &quot;I consider that the Physarum&apos;s maze-solving is smart or something like primitive intelligence.&quot; But he added that, by these standards, &quot;all biological systems must be rather smart&quot;. Andy Adamatzky from the University of West England agrees. &quot;Physarum&apos;s intelligence is not higher than intelligence of a stone rolling down a hill (the stone &quot;chooses&quot; a shortest path downhill) or a plant orienting itself towards the sun,&quot; he says. &quot;Physarum just obeys physical, chemical and biological laws.&quot; Studying the slime mould may seem like a spot of trivial fun. Indeed, for his maze study, Nakagaki even won an Ignobel prize, an award given to research that makes you laugh, then think. But there is no denying that its simple behaviour can lead to complex feats. Some scientists are trying to tap into this ability for a variety of practical uses. Take the Tokyo experiment. Tero thinks that the slime mould&apos;s abilities could help planners to design better networks by using biological principles, and he has created a computer model to simulate the mould&apos;s style of decision-making. Adamtzky describes Physarum as a living computer, which is driven by a massively parallel core processor and can be controlled by food or light. These properties can be used to integrate the slime mould into machines. Klaus-Peter Zauner from the University of Southampton managed to control a six-legged robot using a slime mould grown in the shape of a six-pointed star. He used beams of light to move each of the mould&apos;s branches, and a computer translated these movements to the robot&apos;s own legs. It was the first time that a robot had been driven by living cells. Other groups have used moulds as sensors to sniff out chemicals, engines to drive miniature boats with rhythmic pulses, or conveyor belts to transport liquids and small particles. Adamtzky also sees Physarum as an inspiration for artificial robots, which would be very different from conventional designs with electronic hardware driven by central programmes. These new robots would be able to change their shape and run off the collective actions of their various parts, just like a living slime mould. Adamatzky calls them &quot;biological amorphous robots&quot; or, more affectionately, &quot;bloboids&quot; or &quot;plasmobots&quot;. They are like a team of employees who work together for the common good without the direction of a manager. Despite any central intelligence, they would still produce efficient behaviour, which would give them one up over many governments.

Reports said Zhan Qixiong could face up to three years in prison if found guilty of causing the collision on Tuesday, but that he could be released without charge within days if he admitted obstructing coastguard officials. No one was injured in the incident and the Japanese boats sustained minor damage. Zhan, 41, was handed over to prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Ishigaki for questioning after his boat struck two coastguard ships near Senkaku, a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. The territory, known as Diaoyu in China, is a focal point for competing territorial claims as Tokyo and Beijing step up their search for resources in the area. The Japanese-controlled islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and, possibly, oil and gas deposits. The 14 other crew on the Chinese fishing boat were not arrested, but are being questioned as witnesses. China said today it had sent a maritime law enforcement vessel to the area, but it was not clear whether it would patrol the islands or collect the stranded fishermen. Japan&apos;s coastguard said the collision occurred after Zhan ignored requests to leave the area and then refused to allow Japanese officials to inspect his boat. China&apos;s state media warned that Japan&apos;s handling of the incident risked escalating tensions. &quot;A wave of indignation is brewing in Chinese society, which might snowball into a major public outcry if the Japanese authorities continue to take a hardline stance,&quot; the China Daily said. China summoned Japan&apos;s ambassador twice in 24 hours to protest about Zhan&apos;s arrest and a small group of Chinese nationalists demonstrated yesterday outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Internet chatrooms have been buzzing with messages condemning Tokyo&apos;s response, with some calling for a boycott of Japanese goods. A foreign ministry spokesman in Tokyo said Japan had a duty to investigate the collision, adding that its sovereignty over the islands was an &quot;undeniable fact&quot;. Both sides, however, said the incident would not affect diplomatic ties. &quot;We will handle the matter firmly in accordance with the law,&quot; Yoshito Sengoku, Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, said. &quot;It is important that in Japan we not get overly excited.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["An official from the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a pro-Pyongyang organisation in Tokyo, told the Guardian that the congress should begin within days.", "&quot;As we go into a period of uncertainty it would be best for us to be ready and to be prepared for any contingency,&quot; Admiral Patrick Walsh, commander of the US Pacific fleet, said in Tokyo."], "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-09T13:09:22Z", "title": "North Korea marks 62nd anniversary and awaits next Kim off the rank", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/09/north-korea-62nd-anniversary-kim", "article": "North Korea has marked its 62nd anniversary today amid speculation that its dictator, Kim Jong-il, is not well enough to open a rare meeting of ruling party members that could see his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, effectively named the country&apos;s leader in waiting. As North Koreans made pilgrimages to a giant statue of the country&apos;s founder, Kim Il-sung, Korea watchers speculated on the precise timing of the congress, the Korean Workers&apos; party&apos;s first major gathering for 30 years. Some had expected the meeting to begin early this month, but new reports from South Korea suggested it had been postponed due to Kim Jong-il&apos;s health. The 68-year-old is widely believed to have had a stroke in 2008 and is said to be suffering from kidney trouble and diabetes. Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based group with a network of informers in the north, attributed the apparent delay to the start of the meeting to Kim Jong-il&apos;s physical condition. &quot;There is no other reason,&quot; the station&apos;s president, Ha Tae-Keung, told AP. &quot;He has to be in the conference at least five hours, even though he will be sitting most of time. I think he&apos;s trying to find a day when he is well enough to do that.&quot; Other groups that monitor the north said the problem could be logistical, with the arrival of delegates hampered by recent floods that have reportedly blocked roads and affected rail services. Kim had reportedly planned to name Jong-un as his successor in 2012, the centenary of the birth of his own father, Kim Il-sung, but was forced by ill health to speed up the process. The secretive regime is unlikely to make a formal announcement about the succession: the clearest sign that Jong-un, who is believed to be 27 or 28, has been anointed the third member of the Kim dynasty to rule the communist state will come when, as many expect, he is named to a senior party position. Jong-un&apos;s father took the first steps to power when he was given a senior position in the party at the last congress, in 1980, although he did not become leader until Kim Il-sung&apos;s sudden death from a heart attack in 1994. Local party representatives have been arriving in the capital, Pyongyang, but reports by monitors in South Korea say there is no sign the meeting has started. An official from the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a pro-Pyongyang organisation in Tokyo, told the Guardian that the congress should begin within days. &quot;We have heard nothing to indicate that it has already started,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect it will begin by the 15th of this month.&quot; A resident of Pyongyang interviewed by Associated Press Television News suggested the party had decided to open the meeting shortly after the anniversary. The broadcaster showed footage of soldiers and civilians, including women in traditional dress, bowing and offering floral tributes before a giant statue of Kim Il-sung, while party officials paid homage at a museum in the capital where his embalmed body lies in state. Giant billboards have appeared across the city describing the congress as an opportunity to make the country&apos;s &quot;history shine forever&quot;. The party&apos;s newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, urged the country&apos;s 24 million people to support Kim Jong-il&apos;s military-first policy, while state television broadcast patriotic songs and referred to him as a &quot;great, friendly general&quot;. The US said it was monitoring the transition of power in Pyongyang and again urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. The north walked away from six-party nuclear talks in April 2009 after the UN imposed sanctions in response to a long-range missile test. The American secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said Washington was looking to China, North Korea&apos;s only ally, to lead efforts to restart negotiations and &quot;convince whoever&apos;s in leadership in North Korea that their future would be far better served by denuclearising&quot;. The US navy, meanwhile, has said it is on heightened alert as North Korea appears to enter a period of political change. &quot;As we go into a period of uncertainty it would be best for us to be ready and to be prepared for any contingency,&quot; Admiral Patrick Walsh, commander of the US Pacific fleet, said in Tokyo. Tensions in the region have increased since the March sinking of a South Korean naval vessel by a North Korean torpedo. Some analysts believe the attack, in which 46 sailors died, was part of attempts by Kim Jong-il to bolster domestic support as he prepares to groom Kim Jong-un for power."}, {"sentences": ["I join the company in rain-lashed Tokyo \u2013 should airline pilots use words like &quot;typhoon&quot; when talking passengers through a final approach?", "(Tokyo is eye-poppingly expensive; the most popular retail outlet for the tour party appears to be the shop around the corner from the Bunka Kaikan which sells everything for 100 yen, or roughly 80p.)"], "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Stage", "Music", "Culture", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-10T15:22:05Z", "title": "Royal Opera Japan tour diary: Scrimping and singalongs in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/10/royal-opera-japan-tour-diary", "article": "&quot;We&apos;re sending you out east. You&apos;re going to be embedded.&quot; Not words that often crop up on the books and arts beat, but despite my incredulity \u2013 and insouciantly disguised apprehension \u2013 it was indeed true. So here I am, planted deep within the Royal Opera company as it prepares to open the 2010/11 season on tour in Japan \u2013 its first visit to the country for 18 years. You may have noticed that the Royal Opera is also opening its 2010/11 season in London this weekend with revivals of Jonathan Miller&apos;s productions of Cosi Fan Tutte and Don Pasquale. Yes, via a thoughtful division of labour, and some crafty repertoire scheduling, it has indeed managed to be in two places at once. On top of that, Cosi will be screened live across the UK and in cinemas all over the world, although not in Japan. Antonio Pappano, the company&apos;s music director, begins his ninth season in charge on the tour and will conduct four performances each of Manon and La Traviata, as well as a concert performance of Handel&apos;s Messiah \u2013 the last a special request from the Japanese promoters, for whom nothing says England quite like (German-born) Handel. That it will be performed in the rarely heard Mozart arrangement is neither here nor there. The tour logistics are deeply impressive. Two hundred and fifty people have made the trip, including a full orchestra, chorus, stage crew, make-up, dressers and admin staff. The practicalities of transporting personnel and equipment have been a triumph, with the only major hiccup coming on the eve of departure when Angela Gheorghiu, who sang Violetta in La Traviata in the 1992 tour of Japan, had to withdraw for family reasons and was replaced by Albanian soprano Ermonela Jaho. But my first day is all about Manon. I join the company in rain-lashed Tokyo \u2013 should airline pilots use words like &quot;typhoon&quot; when talking passengers through a final approach? \u2013 in time for the dress rehearsal at the Bunka Kaikan theatre. From the outside, the building is a blandly antiseptic modern concert hall; backstage, it&apos;s more like a rundown underground carpark \u2013 albeit one withspectacularly highbrow graffiti on the walls. Visiting orchestras and opera and ballet companies from the Met and the Bolshoi downwards have scrawled their names on every available surface \u2013 so I feel a small surge of national pride to see &quot;Millwall Lions FC&quot; in amongst the jokes in Cyrillic script and ballerinas&apos; tags. In the rehearsal, star soprano Anna Netrebko&apos;s red-hot Manon burns up the stage just as it did at the London premiere in June, a spectacle all the more impressive in its professionalism: she is playing to a sea of empty stalls seats. Everyone seems happy enough, the most enthusiastic response coming from members of the female chorus, who can barely contain their excitement that 22 of them effected a full costume change, in a tiny dressing-room, in just four minutes 25 seconds. A record. But a tour of this scale isn&apos;t just about the performances. The flag is being flown for the UK in general, and Covent Garden in particular. In the interval Cormac Simms, the Royal Opera&apos;s general manager, gives a talk to a convention of Japanese travel agents planning package tours to the UK that will include opera tickets. As things stand, ballet is probably more popular than opera in Japan and London apparently lags behind Salzburg and Paris as an obvious classical music venue. But London&apos;s stock is rising and the exchange rate with the yen is currently favourable. (Tokyo is eye-poppingly expensive; the most popular retail outlet for the tour party appears to be the shop around the corner from the Bunka Kaikan which sells everything for 100 yen, or roughly 80p.) The package tour industry, however, is not without its pitfalls. One old hand recalls another Japanese company who tried to organise a trip for opera buffs to Bayreuth in Germany: &quot;I don&apos;t remember all the details, but I know the upshot was their clients ended up getting off a plane in Beirut.&quot; Apocrypha of that quality are in plentiful supply at the tour hotel, whose corridors echo pleasingly to the sound of the sound of singers running up and down scales. Intriguingly, the company noticeboard set up in the foyer has started to attract Japanese fans, who hang around in the hope of seeing a star. No one mentions the word &quot;groupie&quot;, but while the tour is not quite analogous to, say, Led Zeppelin&apos;s jaunt round the US in in 1972, it does have its moments. In a what might be an exquisite extended joke \u2013 or maybe because it&apos;s the closest bar to the hotel \u2013 the company has chosen a tiny karaoke joint as its late-night meeting place of choice. No sightings of any professional singers in there so far, but to be honest they&apos;re not much missed. Everyone from stage crew to company managers is in fine voice, banging out Carpenters, Tom Jones and Sex Pistols numbers. There is time yet for a pro to take them on, I suppose, but in the meantime it&apos;s off to Yokohama for La Traviata."}, {"sentences": ["The nationwide survey was launched in August after police discovered the mummified corpse of Sogen Kato, who at 111 was listed as Tokyo&apos;s oldest man, in his family home 32 years after his death.", "Soon after came the discovery that a 113-year-old woman listed as Tokyo&apos;s oldest resident had not been seen by her family for more than 20 years."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Older people", "Society", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-10T16:41:51Z", "title": "Thousands of Japanese centenarians may have died decades ago", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/10/japenese-centenarians-records", "article": "More than 230,000 Japanese people listed as 100 years old cannot be located and many may have died decades ago, according to a government survey released today. The justice ministry said the survey found that more than 77,000 people listed as still alive in local government records would have to be aged at least 120, and 884 would be 150 or older. The figures have exposed antiquated methods of record-keeping and fuelled fears that some families are deliberately hiding the deaths of elderly relatives in order to claim their pensions. The nationwide survey was launched in August after police discovered the mummified corpse of Sogen Kato, who at 111 was listed as Tokyo&apos;s oldest man, in his family home 32 years after his death. Kato&apos;s granddaughter has been arrested on suspicion of abandoning his body and receiving millions of yen in pension payments after his unreported death. Soon after came the discovery that a 113-year-old woman listed as Tokyo&apos;s oldest resident had not been seen by her family for more than 20 years. Welfare officials have yet to locate Fusa Furuya, who was last seen in about 1986. Japan&apos;s failure to maintain accurate records of its oldest citizens is also being blamed on strict privacy laws and weakening family and community ties. &quot;It appears that these people were isolated, given that it is unclear whether they are dead or alive despite the family registration system,&quot; the justice minister, Keiko Chiba, told reporters. The survey uncovered 234,354 centenarians who are listed as still alive but whose addresses could not be confirmed. Ministry officials suspected some deaths went unreported in the confusion that followed the end of the second world war, while other people may have lost touch with relatives or moved overseas without informing the authorities. The discovery has proved a major embarrassment in a country that supposedly reveres its oldest citizens. Every September people who have just turned, or are about to turn, 100, receive a congratulatory letter and a trophy from the prime minister. The debacle is partly a symptom of the bureaucratic struggle to maintain accurate records in one of the world&apos;s fastest-ageing societies: more than one in five Japanese are aged 65 or over. According to the health ministry, the country has 40,399 centenarians with confirmed addresses, more than triple the number a decade ago. Japanese women can now expect to live an average of 86.4 years \u2013 the longest life expectancy in the world \u2013 while the average among men is 79.6 years. The government said the findings would have a minimal impact on longevity figures, which are based on census data collated during home visits. In addition, men over 98 and women over 103 are not factored into life expectancy calculations."}, {"sentences": ["Sony&apos;s Japan Studio has contributed Kung Fu Rider (Sony, cert 16), which sees a flustered salaryman attempting to escape a group of yakuza by sliding down busy Tokyo streets on an office chair."], "tags": ["PlayStation", "Sony", "Nintendo", "Wii", "Games", "Technology", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-11T23:02:17Z", "title": "PlayStation Move | Games review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/12/playstation-move-launch-review", "article": "Sony&apos;s new motion controller, the PlayStation Move, may ostensibly be seen as jumping on Nintendo&apos;s bandwagon, though it is anything but. This late entry into the field is no mere imitator \u2013 it was in development well before the Nintendo Wii was launched. The unusual design \u2013 one imagines &quot;futuristic sex toy&quot; wasn&apos;t quite the look Sony was trying to pull off \u2013 doesn&apos;t give the greatest of first impressions, though it&apos;s more comfortable than a Wii remote to hold.The glowing orb on the end of the controller allows the PlayStation &quot;Eye&quot; camera to track its movement more accurately, meaning that its position in 3D space and its orientation can be read; in that regard, it comfortably trumps its Nintendo rival. And while the early software leaves a little to be desired, it is instantly clear that this is a piece of hardware to be reckoned with. It&apos;s more precise and responsive than a Wii remote, even with the Wii Motionplus attachment factored into the equation, and gestures are more easily read. Though it is not until you start playing a game such as Sports Champions (Sony, cert 12) that the differences become more pronounced. Table tennis, in particular, offers an extraordinary level of fine control, requiring true-to-life movements for success, particularly on the higher levels. It&apos;s a revelatory moment when you catch yourself stretching forwards to reach a shot close to the net. Bocce, a member of the boules family, sees deft flicks of the wrist translated perfectly into top-, side- or backspin. Archery and disc golf feel little different from their Wii equivalents, though reaching into an imaginary quiver to pull out arrows in the former is curiously satisfying. Volleyball and &quot;gladiator duel&quot; are less impressive, both being more reliant on gesture than nuance, while it&apos;s clear Sony still has some lessons to learn from Nintendo: the charmless and cliched characters and sterile presentation make it less instantly appealing, even if the depth will keep players coming back for more. Start the Party (Sony, cert 3), meanwhile, is a throwback to the PlayStation 2&apos;s EyeToy camera, though the augmented reality technology further demonstrates the capabilities of the hardware. A series of minigames turns the Move controller into a paintbrush, a fan, a torch and a giant fly swatter and again the player&apos;s movements are perfectly replicated onscreen. While the controls are hard to fault, it&apos;s disappointing that two players can&apos;t compete simultaneously. Perhaps Sony thought the hardware was costly enough, without forcing people to splash out on an additional controller for arguably the most family-friendly title of Move&apos;s launch line-up. The game&apos;s presentation is also a little too self-consciously wacky, with a commentator&apos;s repetitive and irritating interjections likely to be turned off at the earliest opportunity. Sony&apos;s Japan Studio has contributed Kung Fu Rider (Sony, cert 16), which sees a flustered salaryman attempting to escape a group of yakuza by sliding down busy Tokyo streets on an office chair. Its concept is undoubtedly more interesting than its execution, which conspires to make the Move controller feel sluggish and inaccurate. There&apos;s some initial amusement to be had with such an unusual idea, mainly thanks to the slapstick appeal of the protagonist getting unexpectedly clobbered or thrown violently from his ride. But as the levels get busier, control shortcomings become ever more frustrating. The Shoot turns the Move wand into a light-gun, challenging the player to blast enemies and targets across several themed shooting galleries, while previously released titles such as EyePet and Heavy Rain are set to arrive in new Move-compatible varieties, with downloadable updates for existing owners. Surprisingly, a digitally distributed title is probably the highlight of the early line-up. Modest block-stacking puzzler Tumble is the perfect showcase for the Move&apos;s remarkable abilities, allowing players to position and manipulate objects in 3D space with remarkable precision. The Move hardware is much tougher to fault. Calibrating the device is quick and simple, with the only foreseeable problem being a lack of living room space \u2013 Sports Champions requires a distance of 8ft between the player and the TV. While few other titles will be as spatially demanding, it might be time to consider repositioning that coffee table. It&apos;s early days yet, but Sony&apos;s versatile device is a thrilling glimpse into the future of motion gaming. Whether it will attract an audience that is large enough, or the publisher support for its potential to be fully realised, remains to be seen, but with around 30 Move-compatible games planned for release between now and Christmas, early signs are promising. While Microsoft has already earmarked millions of marketing dollars for its own Kinect motion-sensing technology, Sony is relying more on word of mouth for Move to take off and, on this evidence, it should have every success."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;This leadership election was just a sideshow,&quot; said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University, in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Yen", "Currencies", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-14T10:08:24Z", "title": "Japan's prime minister sees off leadership challenge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/14/japan-naota-kan-leadership-vote", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Naoto Kan, has secured the overwhelming backing of his party after easily seeing off a leadership challenge that exposed deep divisions over economic policy. Kan, who became prime minister three months ago following the resignation of Yukio Hatoyama, beat Ichiro Ozawa by a wide margin, of 721 to 491, in a weighted voting system involving MPs and rank-and-file members of the ruling Democratic party of Japan [DPJ]. As leader of the biggest single party in the lower house, Ozawa would have become Japan&apos;s third prime minister in a year had he won today&apos;s vote. Despite indications that Ozawa, a political bruiser whose alleged penchant for backroom deals earned him the nickname Shadow Shogun, was gaining ground, he has effectively been abandoned by the party he once led. Kan appealed to the DPJ to unite behind him as he confronts mounting economic problems. &quot;Japan is currently in serious difficulty,&quot; he said. &quot;We must rebuild Japan to make it healthy again and hand it to the next generation. I will stake my life on doing that job and on winning support from the people.&quot; In recent opinion polls Kan has easily outperformed Ozawa, who is embroiled in a political funding scandal that could see him indicted next month. Ozawa resigned from the party&apos;s No 2 position when his ally, Hatoyama, stepped down in early June. The leadership campaign exposed deep differences of opinion on the handling of the economy. Kan, a former finance minister, has called for fiscal discipline and job creation in an attempt to avoid a debt crisis comparable to that experienced by Greece. Ozawa, however, favours old-fashioned government stimulus and appeared more eager to intervene to rein in the soaring yen and bring relief to Japanese exporters. Even with his nemesis sidelined, Kan cannot afford to be complacent. His victory coincided with the yen hitting a 15-year high against the dollar, adding to fears that the Japanese currency&apos;s rise was harming the country&apos;s export-led recovery. &quot;The big question is whether Kan can jump beyond his shadow and actually prove himself as a reformer, as somebody who can entice risk-takers, entrepreneurs who actually go out and create jobs,&quot; said Jesper Koll, at JPMorgan Securities Japan. Kan also faces tricky political challenges. The DPJ suffered a big setback in July&apos;s upper house elections over its handling of the relocation of a US marine base on the southern island of Okinawa. It must now work with other parties in the chamber to push through legislation but, say analysts, is likely to encounter more of the gridlock that has stifled Japan&apos;s reform attempts in recent years. &quot;This leadership election was just a sideshow,&quot; said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University, in Tokyo. &quot;Kan needs to work with other parties, but the prospects for that don&apos;t look good. There could be more policy gridlock, for which he may pay a hefty price. He&apos;s not out of the woods yet.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Peter Ford Tokyo, Japan \u2022 If British development aid is to be geared towards British security (as Nicholas Watt reports, 3 September), then those in most need of it had better pose a real threat."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2010-09-14T12:59:45Z", "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 17 September", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/14/weekly-letters-17sep", "article": "Getting power together  In her analysis of &quot;smart&quot; power grids (US playing smart power game; 20 August) Colette Lewiner displays thinking that is so 20th century.

I have felt thoroughly de-skilled by today&apos;s sophisticated electronic devices \u2013 how do I stop the oven timer from beeping? \u2013 and completely baffled by Facebook. But now I am assured that I still have something to offer. Having grown up with rationing, I know how to make a little go a long way, how to make do and mend (except I can&apos;t find anyone selling darning wool) and how to ensure nothing gets wasted (all those papier mache &quot;ornaments&quot;). Such principles have remained with me. So perhaps in these economically hard times that we are told are coming, I will have my uses? Frances Wilson Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Unpleasant games Your article on the new face of soccer hooliganism (Britain&apos;s 21st-century Hooligans, 27 August)) struck a chord. In 2007 I went as an All Blacks supporter to the 2007 rugby world cup. We lost in the quarter final and so by the time of the Paris final, half of our group had sold their tickets on, mostly to England fans. So there we were, a large block of several thousand, half disappointed New Zealanders who had nevertheless come to see an exciting game, and some half astonished English who had paid large amounts, with last minute match tickets for upwards of \u00a3500 ($775), as well as last minute bookings for Eurostar trains and last minute accommodation, to get there. It was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. Even on the metro out to the stadium the group in our compartment, who were looking for confrontation, were boasting that they would be much worse after the match. In the stadium, as soon as it became apparent to the English fans who they were amongst, they started attacking (&quot;not many f***ing All Blacks out there, are there !&quot;) and trying to provoke fights. The appearance of the Springbok team unleashed streams of invective, particularly against the black wingers. The referee got a continuous barrage. I went to the back of the stand to escape the atmosphere but the security official insisted I return to my seat. When it became obvious that England would lose, the supporters turned the same vilification on their own players. It made me question what they, the fans, thought they were doing by being at the match at all. And also this attitude showed a complete failure to understand both the game and their team. England had done amazingly well. They were short on talent but long on character and that was how they played the final. Quite admirable. For the only time in my life I left an important match before the end. Those exiting England fans were to be avoided. I haven&apos;t lived in England for more than 30 years but I read about it in the GW and elsewhere, and friends and relatives live there. What should this incident tell me about the present state of the country where I was born and raised? I don&apos;t know. Paul Barker Auckland, New Zealand Self-revealing gods I found Eric Priest&apos;s apology for God in the face of Stephen Hawking&apos;s recent assertions about the strictly physical origins of the universe (We\u00a0ask both how and why, 10 September), lacking in vigour as well as being beside the point. Priest claims that since what he calls a &quot;God of the gaps,&quot; a kind of teleological filler for the building blocks of scientific theory, is out of date, that belief in God can be regarded as separate from science and a matter of personal, spiritual choice. And yet, the description he offers of faith sounds suspiciously similar to his &quot;God of the gaps&quot;. At the beginning of the last century, Albert Einstein and Edmund Husserl wrote from their various scientific (relativity theory) and philosophical (phenomenology) perspectives, that all knowledge is affected by, and partially the result of, the subject who possesses such knowledge. Science is a methodology and a description of reality based on verifiable observation and theoretical calculations. The business of philosophy is to question assumptions and posit ideas based on observation and speculation. One does not leave off where the other begins, but rather they are both approaches to the study of human knowledge.\u00a0 There are two aspects to the concept of God. A personal God who listens and answers, assumes a super-human intelligence. As does the idea of a God that created all things for a purpose. It&apos;s obvious that this anthropomorphic concept is a more sophisticated version of the old man with a white beard sitting and watching from the clouds and passing judgment.\u00a0 Eric Priest is right about one thing \u2013 the limitations of knowledge. Our ideas of God reveal something about us as humans, and our ability to see and recognise ourselves in a mirror. Nancy Roberts-Moneir Cairo, Egypt Briefly \u2022 I am concerned about the future of the Guardian Weekly. Take the recent issue of 27 August. It had too many articles of excellent quality and insight \u2013 both opinion pieces and full reports. What can this mean? Indeed this has recently been a regular and questionable approach to your journalism. The possible answer: after so many years of quality reporting, you are &quot;blowing the wad&quot; on a last few issues!

The fact that it did appear to catch traders unawares meant there is a good chance of the policy working \u2013 but probably only in the short-term. The good news for the Bank of Japan is that it tends to be easier to stop a currency going up than it is to put a floor under it when it is falling. Policymakers in Tokyo also know that they can wade into the markets again if they need to and without any real risk that the prospect of flooding the system with yen will lead to higher inflation. Indeed, deflation is so entrenched in Japan that a bit of inflation would do the economy a power of good. There are, though, significant factors pulling in the other direction. Traditionally, intervention works best when central banks act together to correct a misalignment of exchange rates. That unanimity of purpose is not there at present for the simple reason that almost every nation on earth desires a weaker currency so that they can enjoy export-led growth. Europe has no desire to see a stronger euro; the Americans are putting pressure on the Chinese to allow the yuan to appreciate; Mervyn King told the TUC today that Britain needs to switch the focus of growth from domestic demand to exports. As a result, the Bank of Japan will have to go it alone at a time when the yen has been a safe haven from problems elsewhere and there is speculation that the Federal Reserve will embark on a new wave of quantitative easing. That prospect is weighing on the dollar and will continue to do so until concerns about a double-dip recession in the world&apos;s biggest economy are finally banished."}, {"sentences": ["Fearful that a rising currency would damage the country&apos;s export-led recovery plan, Tokyo took the financial markets by surprise with its first bout of intervention in six years.", "No other central bank took part in the attempt to hold down the yen, which according to reports in Tokyo involved the central bank selling more than $1bn of yen in three separate bouts of intervention.", "On the Tokyo stock market, the fall in the value of the currency had an immediate impact on the share prices of Japan&apos;s biggest exporters, with Toyota and Sony rising by around 4%."], "tags": ["Yen", "Financial crisis", "Currencies", "Business", "Japan", "Yoshihiko Noda", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-15T18:03:00Z", "title": "Japan acts to weaken surging yen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/15/japan-acts-to-weaken-yen", "article": "The dollar rose sharply on the foreign exchanges today after the Bank of Japan took unilateral action to halt the rise in the value of the yen. Fearful that a rising currency would damage the country&apos;s export-led recovery plan, Tokyo took the financial markets by surprise with its first bout of intervention in six years. The move came the day after the prime minister, Naoto Kan, won a party leadership election and saw the yen lose almost 3% against the dollar. The US currency saw its sharpest rise in two years, climbing from a 15-year-low of just under 83 yen to more than 85.5 yen. No other central bank took part in the attempt to hold down the yen, which according to reports in Tokyo involved the central bank selling more than $1bn of yen in three separate bouts of intervention. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshito Sengoku said that the Japanese government took the decision after the yen strengthened to \u00a583 to the dollar, and indicated that it was determined not to allow it to go through the \u00a582 barrier. And Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, said the yen&apos;s strength had become a problem &quot;that could not be overlooked&quot;. On the Tokyo stock market, the fall in the value of the currency had an immediate impact on the share prices of Japan&apos;s biggest exporters, with Toyota and Sony rising by around 4%. The Nikkei 225 stock index, which was down before the intervention, closed 217 points higher at 9,516.56 points. But the lack of support from the other leading central banks \u2013 the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss Central Bank \u2013 led some analysts to question whether the action would have any real impact. Billionaire financier George Soros told Reuters that Japan was right to weaken the yen, but currency analysts said authorities would struggle to keep the yen weak, particularly if markets suspect the Federal Reserve decides to pump more money into the US economy this year to prevent a faltering economic recovery from stalling. Weak US manufacturing data today kept alive the possibility that the Fed will extend its quantitative easing programme under which the central banks seeks to boost demand by creating electronic money. China, the US, the euro area and Britain are all trying to secure a bigger share of global markets for their exporters, making them unwilling to take action that would push up the value of their currencies. Washington has been putting pressure on Beijing in recent months to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate. &quot;Japan&apos;s intervention to weaken the yen is unlikely to make a major difference to the outlook for the currency,&quot; said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. &quot;The key driver of the yen&apos;s recent rise has been demand for a safe haven from problems elsewhere, meaning that there may soon be more willing buyers to snap up any yen that the Bank of Japan is ready to sell.&apos; David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC said: &quot;The Japanese authorities need to be aggressive now and hit the market hard, fast and furious because as time goes on, the announcement effect will dissipate. The amounts become so large they start to work against international acceptance of this policy. For this to actually work what is needed is global co-operation.&quot; &quot;The intervention will only help ease the yen&apos;s sudden surge,&quot; predicted Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan&apos;s third-largest bank. Kirby Daley, senior strategist at Newbridge Group, agreed that Japan was unlikely to be able to drag the yen back to the \u00a590 level, and might soon have to defend the \u00a580 that was reached in 1995. &quot;As always, the ministry of finance has offered traders a fabulous opportunity,&quot; Daley said, a suggestion that the BoJ may face a protracted battle with speculators. Other analysts pointed out that around \u00a32.6tn of currency is traded on the foreign exchanges each day, questioning whether Japan&apos;s intervention would have a major impact. Consumer electronics company Sony said it welcomed the move, and urged the Japanese government to weaken the yen again if needed. &quot;While we welcome the latest currency intervention by the government and Bank of Japan \u2026 we hope they will continue to closely monitor foreign exchange trends and take appropriate measures,&quot; the company said."}, {"sentences": ["Co-curated by British artist Julian Opie, the exhibition of woodblock prints by 18th century Japanese artist Kitagawa Utamaro portrays images of women, particularly the courtesans of Edo (modern Tokyo)."], "tags": ["Extra"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-16T11:08:44Z", "title": "ikon gallery extra", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/extra/2010/sep/15/extra-offer-ikon-birmingham", "article": "Extra members are entitled to a 15% discount at the Ikon Shop at the Ikon gallery in Birmingham.

As befits the school-trip atmosphere that the tour occasionally, and perhaps inevitably, topples into, everyone was thoughtfully issued with a sheet of paper and instructions for how to construct an origami Mount Fuji to occupy their time on the three-hour journey. Other trips out of Tokyo have met with mixed success. Star baritone Simon Keenlyside, a keen naturalist who read zoology at Cambridge, is enthusing about a planned two-day trek to find giant cedar trees, but a group who journeyed along the coast to find a decent beach returned home with jellyfish stings. For the handful of people who stayed behind in Tokyo, there was a reception at the British embassy (the run-up to which saw at least five Ferrero Rocher references ), where Antonio Pappano gave a masterclass with tenor Ji-Min Park, a former member of the company&apos;s young singers&apos; programme who is singing Gastone in La Traviata on tour. Entering the imposing embassy building, situated in front of the Imperial Palace, we were greeted by a David Hockney photo-collage of a lunch held there in 1983, its now historical nature evident by the prominence of spirits being served and cigarettes smoked \u2013 although I suppose the fags have become a Hockney signature. The ambassador, David Warren, quickly revealed himself as a man of impeccable artistic and literary sensibility, by which I mean he is an avid and knowledgeable reader of the Guardian Saturday Review. Warren provided his own simultaneous translation of a few opening remarks, which pleased local and visiting dignitaries with reference both to the Royal Opera&apos;s achievements and the contribution made to the reception by Berry Bros and Rudd, &quot;and their royal warranted wines&quot;. Pappano and Park began work on Rodolfo&apos;s aria Che Gelida Manina (&quot;your tiny hand is frozen&quot;) from La Boh\u00e8me. &quot;Just tell me what you&apos;re thinking,&quot; urged Pappano. &quot;Talk to me as if I were a real person, not a conductor.&quot; Apparently Park&apos;s enunciation of the word &quot;manina&quot; gave the impression that &quot;Mimi has an enormous hand, not a tiny one&quot;. His sliding between phrases made him sound &quot;drunk&quot; and, Pappano added, he needed more &quot;to go to town on that note if you want the money. At the moment it&apos;s half-price.&quot; But it all sounded pretty wonderful, and Pappano ended by telling the entranced audience, &quot;You&apos;ve no idea how good this kid is. He&apos;s really going to be something.&quot; Meanwhile, the impact of Ailyn P\u00e9rez&apos;s triumph the evening before in stealing the show as the understudy in La Traviata continued to reverberate. The Japanese supporter who made the official welcoming toast \u2013 &quot;kampai!&quot; \u2013 apologised for not speaking for longer, but apparently his voice was still hoarse from too many &quot;bravas!&quot; for Ms P\u00e9rez. The embassy visit is a fixture of tours of this sort, but for some of the old-timers, not much else is the same. Stage crew who remember the 1979 tour to Japan and Korea recall how colleagues surreptitiously stuffed the flight cases not only with food from home \u2013 baked beans, HP sauce, English tea and even bacon \u2013 but also stowed away their own calor gas stoves to cook up the contraband. Now everyone seems au fait with miso soup and sushi, to such a degree that Japanese hosts can seem slightly deflated that what was once exotic, their guests now take in their stride. It is looking increasingly likely that, all things being equal, the company will return to Japan in 2015, but before this tour is over they still have to negotiate three more productions of La Traviata and two of Manon, and a concert performance of Handel&apos;s Messiah, in the Mozart version, which is the cause of some trepidation because of its heavy rehearsal schedule. Not that everyone is complaining: Canadian principal baritone Russell Braun, who is singing Lescaut in Manon, has asked whether he can sneak in at the back and join in with the chorus. Apparently he &quot;just fancies having a really good sing&quot;, though it has yet to be decided whether he will be allowed to join in. But for me, the tour is over. Memorable moments include a successful impersonation of Antonio Pappano&apos;s wife \u2013 I had to use her hotel breakfast vouchers \u2013 and acting as Ailyn P\u00e9rez&apos;s minder to get her through a crowd of over-excited new fans and on to the tour bus after her Traviata triumph. But most impressive was the close-quarters observation of a crack outfit operating at full throttle. It&apos;s said that if you like sausages then you should never visit a sausage factory. I&apos;ve been knee-deep in the blood and guts of opera production (Blood? Guts? You get the gist, even if I have contracted a small dose of Stockholm syndrome , over-identifying with my captors).

It&apos;s a hot afternoon in a London restaurant. He orders a steak, no fries, sauce on the side. He doesn&apos;t touch the sauce. Lunch is just a slab of meat. This is somehow exactly what you would expect of No\u00e9. His films slap you round the face, and they demand a strong stomach. The first scene of his first film, the 40-minute Carne, showed a horse being killed and butchered. The second was of a steak on a plate, much like the one in front of him now. No\u00e9&apos;s notoriety was sealed by his subsequent features, Seul Contre Tous and Irr\u00e9versible, both of which were punishing ordeals of brutality, misanthropy and sexual violence, all delivered with undeniable technical brilliance. &quot;Before being humans with morals, people are mostly animals, fighting for domination and survival,&quot; he says, between mouthfuls of steak. With his bald head, dark eyebrows and handlebar moustache, No\u00e9 looks like an underfed circus strongman. He says he had a terrible night, but he doesn&apos;t seem tired, and he&apos;s used to getting little sleep. Shooting his latest movie, Enter the Void, in Tokyo, he says he barely slept at all. &quot;In Japan we work 14 hours a day, then I&apos;d go back to my hotel room, all stressed. The actors would bring me out to have some drinks \u2013 I&apos;d sleep three, four hours max. After a while you start having visual hallucinations during the daytime.&quot; Again, this is comes as no surprise with No\u00e9, especially when you see Enter the Void. This one is less a slap in the face than a spiked cocktail. Shot in the sleaziest parts of Tokyo, mostly at night, it&apos;s a psychedelic movie that goes far beyond the usual acid-trip cinema shorthand, using digital effects, swooping cameras, computer graphics and optical tricks to untether the viewer from reality. The screen crawls with computer-animated tendrils, flashes pure white or at one point goes black for a full minute. At times we&apos;re flying high above the city so the streets resemble a lit-up toytown, or we&apos;re gliding across the ceilings of blacklit strip clubs in which everything looks fluorescent. All of this we observe through the eyes of a lost, young American drug dealer, Oscar \u2013 even after he is killed, at which point his &quot;spirit&quot; floats free from his body and swoops across Tokyo, voyeuristically watching over his sister, flashing back to their damaged childhood, and going over the events leading up to his own murder. Narratively, it&apos;s a long, bleak melodrama, but visually it&apos;s like a mix of Kubrick&apos;s 2001, Tron and Google Earth. As usual with No\u00e9, reactions to the film have been polarised since it first played at Cannes in 2009. &quot;Its obsessive emphasis on sex and drugs makes it virtually unwatchable,&quot; moaned the Hollywood Reporter. &quot;The work of an artist who&apos;s trying to show us something we haven&apos;t seen before,&quot; enthused the New York Times. &quot;Not clever enough to be truly pretentious,&quot; sniffed Variety. &quot;I&apos;ve had the very best reviews I ever had and the very worst,&quot; says No\u00e9. &quot;I didn&apos;t expect it, but it&apos;s ended up being more contoversial than Irr\u00e9versible or Seul Contre Tous; not because of the story but because of the feelings or perceptions that come out of it. People don&apos;t know how to respond to it.&quot; One thing nobody could dispute about Enter the Void is its sheer labour intensity. Even the title sequence feels like about 10 movies&apos; worth of work. Making it was a four-year labour of love, No\u00e9 says, but the gestation period was even longer. The story came to him when he was 25 (he is now 47), as a result of watching The Lady in the Lake \u2013 the gimmicky 1940s noir thriller shot entirely in point-of-view \u2013 while under the influence of magic mushrooms. &quot;Since then, from time to time, I&apos;ve tried psychedelics, almost in a practical way because I knew I wanted to do some psychogenic movie,&quot; he says. He&apos;s taken LSD four or five times in his life, he says, but doesn&apos;t smoke joints any more &quot;because I get paranoid every time.&quot; He&apos;s smoked DMT (dimethyltryptamine), and even went to the Peruvian jungle once to drink ayahuasca, the psychoactive brew of the native Indians (&quot;it&apos;s extremely powerful&quot;). &quot;They&apos;re not recreational drugs,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;re mind-opening, and that can be extremely scary, so it was kind of work. Research.&quot; Nice work if you can get it, some might say, but No\u00e9 doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;s been living it up, and he gave up all drugs except alcohol the moment he started on the movie, he says. &quot;The life of directors seems easy, funny, full of sex from the outside, but most of the ones who do good movies, it&apos;s because they are workaholics.&quot; He says he worked so hard, for so long, on Enter the Void, that he can barely watch more than a few seconds of it now. Nor does he relish talking about it again. &quot;I need to detach myself from this movie, and it&apos;s weird doing promotion,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s like giving birth to triplets, then being told there&apos;s a fourth kid inside the belly, and you have to do it all over again.&quot; So, changing the subject, does he believe in life after death? &quot;Personally, no.&quot; So why make film about it? &quot;I think life after death is in the mind of the people around you. It&apos;s what&apos;s left in this world in the memory of others, but when the flesh starts rotting, the spirit disappears. When you&apos;re dead, you&apos;re dead. I believe in shapes \u2013 you&apos;re not conscious of it, but you&apos;re like a tree that grows but takes a particular shape that is prewritten.&quot; Does he believe in destiny? &quot;Yeah \u2026 kind of. But you&apos;re participating in writing it.&quot; The factors that shaped No\u00e9&apos;s destiny might include his father, Luis Felipe No\u00e9, a renowned Argentinian artist (his paintings feature in Enter the Void); a childhood spent between Buenos Aires and Paris; and seeing 2001: A Space Odyssey at the age of seven, which made him want to become a film-maker. Thanks to a friend whose uncle worked in a cinema, he watched films almost every day in his youth, he says \u2013 often things he wasn&apos;t supposed to be watching. He went to film school in Paris when he was 17 (&quot;I was considered a crazy guy&quot;), and at 27 he won a prize at Cannes with Carne. By contrast, No\u00e9&apos;s characters struggle to write their own fates. Often their lives are altered by a single, catastrophic event. In Carne, it was a butcher&apos;s mistaken suspicion that his daughter had been raped, and his decision to act on it. In Seul Contre Tous, the same butcher, played by Philippe Nahon, attempts to wrest control of his life but again descends into horror. In Irr\u00e9versible it was the rape of Monica Bellucci; and in Enter the Void it&apos;s a car crash that kills Oscar&apos;s parents, and bends his and his sister&apos;s lives out of shape. Then there&apos;s his recurring preoccupation with sex. As well as his feature films, he&apos;s also shot music videos and shorts that verge on pornography, including an explicit French anti-Aids ad and films of model Eva Herzigova writhing around with not much on. The suspicion No\u00e9 is a bit of a perv won&apos;t be dispelled by Enter the Void. Between the protagonist&apos;s all-seeing vision, his breast fixation and the sex-club milieu, No\u00e9 again finds plenty of opportunities for explicit visuals, including, at one point, a view of sexual intercourse from inside the vagina. &quot;Why would you be ashamed of shooting things that you do in your own life?&quot; he asks as soon as the subject comes up. &quot;I have a penis. All the girls I loved had a vagina. What&apos;s the problem?&quot; Is he happy for his work to be described as pornographic? &quot;People use words,&quot; he says. &quot;If I hear that some art movie is pornographic nowadays, I don&apos;t trust it. I know what pornography is. I was a huge consumer of porno movies when I was a teenager \u2013 maybe because that was when I had the highest level of testosterone. And then you get excited and you have to masturbate \u2013 in a way it&apos;s an interactive movie. Some are good and some are bad, but you&apos;re not passive watching porno \u2013 you become active. But what&apos;s actually missing in cinema is clear or proper or joyful presentation of adult love.&quot; His next project, he says, is an &quot;erotic love movie&quot;. Possibly filmed in 3D. Would he ever consider doing a movie without lots of sex in it? &quot;Yeah, of course. I also want to do a kids&apos; movie.&quot; He&apos;s probably not joking. But as well as being a social provocateur in the tradition of Bu\u00f1uel or Pasolini or Fassbinder, No\u00e9 is a showman like Hitchcock or horror director William Castle, who would install buzzers under cinema seats and warn the audience to leave before the gory finale (a trick No\u00e9 borrowed for Seul Contre Tous). No\u00e9 doesn&apos;t just use cinema to provoke an emotional response, he wants a physiological one too. &quot;Life can be a game and when you make movies, you want to play with the audience,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s part of the fun.

Designer Toru Iwatani said he wanted Pac-Man to be &quot;the simplest character possible, without any features&quot;; whereas the team of several hundred responsible for fashioning the sprawling Western epic have a life-like protagonist in reformed outlaw John Marston. But in certain fundamental aspects, such games have barely changed at all \u2013 because the action still takes place on a 2D screen, using a controller like a joystick. That is now changing, and within the next five years any firm concepts of what constitutes a computer game will require radical revision. In fact, in time for this Christmas, there is the launch of new motion control systems for Sony&apos;s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft&apos;s Xbox 360 consoles. Although the Nintendo Wii has used motion tracking for four years, the new devices are noticeably more sophisticated: PlayStation Move still involves a hand-held controller, but a player&apos;s movements can now be tracked in 3D space with incredible precision using its own &quot;Eye&quot; camera placed near the screen. The Xbox Kinect is a wholly hands-free device that employs a camera and infrared depth sensors, translating any movement into game action. Both systems also feature microphones that allow voice input. Created by British design pioneer Peter Molyneux at Lionhead Studios in Surrey, a demo for Kinect called Milo and Kate suggests what the future holds. Milo is a virtual boy with whom players interact using voice, gesture and facial expressions. A sophisticated artificial intelligence system lets the character learn words and actions from the player as well as interpret emotions in the user&apos;s voice. Milo can apparently even recognise different people, introducing himself to anyone he hasn&apos;t met before.You can teach him about art by drawing a picture and holding it up to the Kinect camera and he will then copy your masterpiece. In one scene, Milo is in a garden and asks whether he should stamp on a snail; his moral future is in the hands of the player.            &quot;What Kinect gives you is a computer that can see and hear you, and that&apos;s pretty fundamental,&quot; says Andrew Oliver, chief technology officer of UK developer Blitz Games Studios and an expert in 3D and motion technologies. &quot;It&apos;s really good as a natural user interface but it&apos;s up to designers to work out how we can interpret that.&quot; In this future, there will be detective games in which players verbally interrogate computer-controlled characters \u2013 who themselves respond differently to an aggressive tone or placating physical gestures. Realistic relationships in games will emerge, with players having to charm intelligent artificial beings. &quot;Your reactions will be directly perceived by the system, expanding your input capabilities,&quot; says Richard Marks, who leads PlayStation&apos;s research and development department. &quot;What you&apos;re doing with your body and your face will actually matter. You&apos;ll be able to have a very rich communication with the game and with other players.&quot; Bringing the likes of Milo to life will also be 3D technology. Sony has already launched a range of 3D titles for the PlayStation\u00a03 that are compatible with its latest Bravia 3D TV sets, while companies such as NVIDIA are creating graphics cards for PC users that allow players to experience a huge range of titles in three dimensions. While 3D at the cinema still feels like something of a gimmick, 3D technology brings with it tangible benefits in gaming. Andrew Oliver cites the example of a demo of a game called Crysis 2, a first-person shooter due for release next year that will be entirely playable in 3D. &quot;The developers showed a screenshot of a forest and said, &apos;spot the sniper&apos;, and in 2D you couldn&apos;t see anything,&quot; he says. &quot;But with the same shot in 3D, you could instantly see him lurking in the foliage. And, that&apos;s important \u2013 that&apos;s sort of the difference between life and death!&quot; Such systems require viewers to wear &quot;active shutter&quot; glasses to generate a 3D image. These are typically controlled by an infrared or Bluetooth transmitter that sends a signal that allows the glasses to alternately darken over one eye, and then the other, in synchronization with a TV display that runs an image from two different perspectives \u2013 creating a 3D stereoscopic effect. But Nintendo recently announced its 3DS console, due next year, that dispenses with glasses altogether through a process known as autostereoscopy, while Sony has demonstrated a prototype that creates a totally three-dimensional holographic image that viewers can walk around and see from any angle. The device can be plugged into a PC \u2013 allowing it run holographic 3D games. During a demonstration at the recent SIGGRAPH exhibition in Los Angeles, Sony showed off an image of a woman&apos;s head that reacted to the viewer&apos;s hand movements, orientating itself accordingly. Researchers at Tokyo University, meanwhile, are developing touchable holograms. Using ultrasonic waves to give the sensation of pressure, users are able to feel 3D holographic characters running about on their hands, or touch holographic rain drops as they fall. This still feels like the stuff of science fiction, but such technology will surely soon filter into the market. Before that point is reached, though, through a combination of motion controls and 3D display technology, games will appear in which, for example, a virtual sword can be projected into the player&apos;s room to &quot;grab&quot; and wield. &quot;We&apos;re applying this technology to games like shooters,&quot; says Marks. &quot;In our research we&apos;ve looked into head tracking, so players can actually move their heads to peek around corners. And with a 3D display, the viewpoint can also be modified and tilted as you move your position, so you get a really strong motion parallax \u2013 there&apos;s a very convincing feeling of 3D from lots of different cues.&quot; Using our bodies to control games may in fact be only the beginning of our transmogrification into walking joypads. The next step involves mind control. Already there are several consumer headsets that use electroencephalography, or EEG, to monitor brainwave patterns and which allow gamers to control elements of the action through the power of their thoughts. Priced at $199 (\u00a3129), the Mindset \u2013 from the futuristically named NeuroSky \u2013 is an EEG headset that comes bundled with its own game demo, NeuroBoy. &quot;You play a boy with telekinetic powers,&quot; says the company&apos;s Tansy Brook. &quot;You still use traditional mouse and keyboard controls to move and select objects, but there are a number of features that you have to use your mind for: you can relax to levitate an object, or concentrate to set it on fire \u2013 which is very popular.&quot; A key problem with brain-computer interfaces in the past was that it took a long time to calibrate the sensors to pick up on each user&apos;s neural activity, but companies such as NeuroSky and its rival Emotiv have solved this with proprietary algorithms that spot patterns of activity. NeuroSky has a new headset due later this year at $99, and is already working with game makers including Sega and Square Enix. The latter has produced a demo of a shooting game, Judecca, in which players have to focus their thoughts to see invisible demons. This is likely to be how mind control slips into the marketplace \u2013 as an added feature for conventional games. Peripherals that can read our physical states are also being introduced. A forthcoming game titled Innergy from French publisher Ubisoft involves a biofeedback sensor that clips on to the player&apos;s finger and checks their stress levels. Meanwhile, Valve, the US developer behind the massively successful Half-Life series of shooters, is experimenting with biometrics and ways of analysing player pulse rates to redevelop the gaming experience. &quot;The last 20 years have all been graphics, graphics, graphics,&quot; says Nam Do, the co-founder of Emotiv. &quot;The next five years will be about new interfaces \u2013 and brain-computer interfaces will play a major role in giving users new experiences. Harry Potter will perform true magic in a game, it won&apos;t be about pushing buttons. Headsets can also read the player&apos;s emotions, bringing in a totally new dimension. Games will be able to constantly measure your level of excitement, boredom or fear, and tailor the action to make it challenging and exciting all the time.&quot; Soon the distinction between the virtual and real may disappear, too. Developers working with consoles like Kinect as well as with camera-equipped smartphones are creating augmented reality games that merge computer graphics with real-life footage. In TagDis, for example, you can leave virtual graffiti on real walls. &quot;As you leave more &apos;tags&apos; you become the king of an area and earn points as others view your work,&quot; says Lester Madden, an alternate reality game (ARG) researcher. It is his belief that a technology called &quot;natural feature tracking&quot; will be a huge element of ARGs in the future. &quot;Developers could use it to have hordes of zombies walking up your stairs and though your doors or climbing through your windows,&quot; he enthuses. Beyond even this lies an era of what is known as pervasive digital entertainment \u2013 in which, once we&apos;ve signed up to a gaming experience, we&apos;ll never truly leave it. The action will take place in our living rooms, on the street and on social network sites. And, via the omniscient interconnectivity of the web, all our friends will be there too. This is the future that many game pundits are expecting. But it won&apos;t just be about what we now consider to be games, and it&apos;s not all about cool technologies such as 3D displays. What is emerging in all areas of consumer technology is a process known as gamification \u2013 from global-positioning software to financial services websites, everything is becoming more game-like, because we as a species like to play. Last month, mobile entertainment company Booyah launched InCrowd, a location-based social game for the iPhone that asks users to &quot;check in&quot; when they visit real-world places, and hands out points for sharing experiences. Employing the new Facebook feature Place, which lets you see where your friends are, it speaks of a future in which shopping becomes a multiplayer &quot;deathmatch&quot; against rival players. Together with services such as FourSquare and Gowalla, this is just the beginning. &quot;With gamification, we&apos;ll find boring things fun \u2013 like paying our taxes, getting regular checkups, buying groceries or checking the weather,&quot; says gamification expert Gabe Zicherman. &quot;When fun becomes a principal design requirement or objective of all kinds of industries \u2013 from healthcare and government to finance and transportation \u2013 the effect on our happiness will be unprecedented.&quot; This is a utopian vision \u2013 a vision of all-encompassing, multi-sensorial gaming \u2013 that to some will sound more terrifying than fun. It&apos;s certainly a long way from Pac-Man."}, {"sentences": ["Utamaro was probably born in 1753, possibly in Edo (now Tokyo), may have been married, may have lived in one of Edo&apos;s licensed brothels, but certainly died in 1806."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-18T23:05:30Z", "title": "Kitagawa Utamaro | Art review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/19/kitagawa-utamaro-ikon-gallery-review", "article": "The man who loved women: this was Kitagawa Utamaro. It would be hard to think of an artist more intent on the opposite sex. Or one who left more images of women working, waiting, arranging their faces, combing their hair, readying themselves for the day&apos;s performance (or the night&apos;s trade) or simply thinking, feeling, watching. Perhaps the only contender is Degas, who learned from the Japanese master, prizing and collecting his prints. Utamaro was probably born in 1753, possibly in Edo (now Tokyo), may have been married, may have lived in one of Edo&apos;s licensed brothels, but certainly died in 1806. His fame reached the west some decades later when writers such as Baudelaire and Edmond de Goncourt began to buy his woodcuts, followed avidly by Manet, Monet and Toulouse-Lautrec. He is the artist of the floating world, &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;, and if that has brought him some boilerplate criticism in recent years for failing to represent the misery of ukiyo-e courtesans \u2013 never alluding to poverty, oppression or venereal disease \u2013 then perhaps this show will shift the focus. Not only does it include images of lonely nights, brutal clients and even an attempted rape, it has been selected by Timothy Clark, peerless Japanese section curator at the British Museum, and the artist Julian Opie, the cool elegance of whose drawings owes a good deal to Utamaro, to emphasise the exceptional subtlety of Utamaro&apos;s images of women. A geisha holds up a letter, coral sleeves falling back to expose pale forearms. The scroll opens sideways; her body tilts backwards; the ribboning pattern on her dress runs in an opposing direction. Her lips form a tiny triangle, as if murmuring aloud. The drama of the unseen words is all there, written in the smallest of angles. Another girl holds the edge of her kimono between her teeth, as if stepping across a river. But the descending line of cloth leads to the very bottom of the image where you discover something else. She is delicately, suggestively, fingering the fabric; a secret gesture aptly hidden in less than an inch. Utamaro&apos;s exquisite lines sweep and undulate across the page, so that shape and flow are almost always what one sees first before the eye is drawn in close. Delicate fingers gather swaths of cloth about a female form, leaving a crucial millimetre of print and body naked. Women are seen through paper screens or gauze or fine-gauge netting, even through diaphanous, polka-dot chiffon. Mists and veils are created with finely ground mica and Utamaro uses the subtlest of half-tones. His colours run through black and white to all shades of grey, plum, umber and softest ochre, as if everything was taking place in a fading dream. Each print plays upon different kinds of image: silhouette, shadow, reflection, illusion, reality, the eye having to play hide and seek to find the meaning of a scene. It is an art of obscuring and revealing, precisely exemplified in Model Young Women Woven in the Mist, where one girl appears spectral behind a screen and the other is in plain view, both transfixed by something unseen and neither less mysterious. Perhaps they are prostitutes, perhaps not. Unlike Toulouse-Lautrec, for example, Utamaro&apos;s prostitutes are presented with just as much dignity as his aristocrats. There is a particularly beautiful image of a streetwalker in a black kimono, the straw mat under her arm indicating her end of the market, waiting it out in the gloom, solitary and even tragic. Did Utamaro live among them? The catalogue suggests not and in any case the sense that the artist is right there is one of his greatest gifts; that he is watching his women, looking over their shoulders, scenting their powdered skin, almost touching their fingers is implied in every ingenious viewpoint. A kimono flows out of the picture. A hand is tucked below the frame, as if beneath a counter. Fine threads of combed hair float towards you at the hairdresser. Utamaro produced half-length figures, close-ups and large portraits, most famously of the waitress Naniwaya Okita and the shop girl Takashima Ohisa. Indeed, he made such pin-ups of both that people came in droves to see them. To modern eyes, the distinctions between the two girls (and he sometimes pairs them) are so minimal as to be nearly invisible; a slightly more aquiline nose or less angled eyebrows; perhaps it is true that they are variations on his template of beauty. But this is the essence of Utamaro, in a way: inflections so small it makes one marvel that a whole image can be defined, or redefined, by them. Look at the lower lip of the married woman in Reflective Love (the telling clue is the shaved eyebrows, implying that she is no longer available). It droops ever so slightly, not very much more than a millimetre. But it is the tilting point of the picture, by which we are to understand that love has declined. The most famous image in this show is also the most erotic (as opposed to pornographic, which was sometimes Utamaro&apos;s graphic suit). It shows a man and a woman in an upstairs chamber, two half-dressed bodies coming together in a surge of roiled clothing. Her back is turned to us. His face is invisible, except for a fraction of one eye that is absolutely intent upon her. The contours of her chin and his appear to unite in a single face. The only explicit gestures in the whole marvellous image are her hand delicately touching his face and his upon her bare shoulder. The exact act of penetration is veiled by chiffon in the woman&apos;s case \u2013 what else? \u2013 and a raised fan in his. What the print does not show is precisely what the gorgeously patterned fabric is doing: intermingling, twisting, twining, sheathing, in a sort of liquid harmony."}, {"sentences": ["Maehara, who is thought to be more hawkish on China than his predecessor, repeated Tokyo&apos;s call for Beijing to handle matters calmly, stressing it was being dealt with according to Japanese law."], "tags": ["China", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-19T18:33:59Z", "title": "China cuts Japan contacts over detained trawler captain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/19/china-japan-contacts-detained-trawler-captain", "article": "China stepped up its maritime dispute with Japan today as it halted high-level exchanges over the extended detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain. State broadcaster CCTV said Beijing had suspended ministerial and provincial-level contacts, including talks on increasing flights, and postponed a meeting on coal. The row began more than a week ago, when a trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard ships near uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries. The two countries have a long history of tensions over territory, resources and other issues. But after several years of improving relations and increasing trade, they have more to lose if ties are damaged, meaning they will be wary of letting the spat get out of hand. A foreign ministry statement read out on television said Japan&apos;s refusal to release the captain had &quot;already caused serious damage to Sino-Japanese bilateral contacts&quot;. Earlier, in a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry website, spokesman Ma Zhaoxu warned: &quot;If Japan insists on making one mistake after another, the Chinese side will take strong countermeasures, and all the consequences should be borne by the Japanese side.&quot; Xinhua news agency added that Chinese vice foreign minister Wang Guangya had expressed &quot;strong indignation&quot; and made &quot;solemn representations&quot; to the Japanese ambassador, Uichiro Niwa, who has been summoned repeatedly since the row began. &quot;Regarding individual issues, what is needed is to respond calmly without becoming emotional,&quot; Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for the Japanese prime minister&apos;s office, told Reuters. Takeshi Matsunaga, assistant press secretary for Japan&apos;s foreign ministry, said the unilateral steps China had taken were &quot;regrettable&quot;. The court in Okinawa, Japan, said Zhan Qixiong could be held for another 10 days for further questioning. Authorities have released the other 14 crew members. He was arrested on 8 September and under Japanese law prosecutors can hold him for up to 20 days while deciding whether to charge him. Japan has accused the captain of deliberately striking a patrol ship as it tried to intercept his vessel, and obstructing officers. But China has said the detention is illegal and has repeatedly demanded the authorities free him. The dispute led to small-scale anti-Japanese protests in China yesterday, the anniversary of 1931&apos;s Mukden incident, which led to occupation by Japan. But a huge police presence protected the Japanese embassy in Beijing and buildings in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and Japan&apos;s new foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, praised China&apos;s &quot;considerable efforts to restrain them&quot;. Maehara, who is thought to be more hawkish on China than his predecessor, repeated Tokyo&apos;s call for Beijing to handle matters calmly, stressing it was being dealt with according to Japanese law. But he added that the isles \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands in China and Senkaku islands in Japan \u2013 were an &quot;integral part of Japanese territory&quot;. &quot;Territorial issues do not exist in this region,&quot; Maehara told broadcaster NHK. The Nikkei business daily reported earlier today that Japan may start drilling near a gas field in another disputed part of the East China Sea if China does so. Japanese officials said on Friday that China had moved drilling equipment to the area, having scrapped scheduled talks over joint exploration in the wake of the trawler incident.

But during Microsoft&apos;s TGC conference, it was announced that Radiant will be coming to Xbox Live next year, complete with enhanced visuals and online co-op.  Xbox 360 is certainly turning into the platform of choice for fans of Japanese shmups. Ikaurga is already on Live, and Treasure&apos;s Bangai-O HD is arriving in November. Meanwhile, maker of insane &apos;bullet hell&apos; epics Cave, is bringing several fresh titles and arcade conversions over to the format for both retail and digital release. Deathsmiles and Espgaluda II are out (though not in the UK at present) with Guwange coming to Xbox Live worldwide soon.            Mikami + Suda 51 = Shadows of the DamnedIt&apos;s long been known that Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami has been collaborating with Grasshopper Manufacture, the crazed developer behind Killer 7 and No more Heroes; and at TGS we discovered the project. Due to be published by EA next year, Shadows of the Damned is described as a psychological action thriller, follow hard-bitten, motorbike-riding demon hunter Garcia as he rides into Hell to save his lover.  Okay, so it sounds a little like Devil May Cry meets Ghost Rider, but with Mikami and Suda 51 at the helm, we can at least expect stylised visuals, weird ideas and gore aplenty. Plus, revered Silent Hill scorer Akira Yamaoka is providing the soundtrack. There&apos;s a trailer here.            The Japanese Kinect exclusivesMicrosoft hit TGS with some style and purpose this year, announcing a string of fresh Kinect titles. At the top of the list for many will be Codename D, another dark, offbeat project from Suda 51, set in an evil amusement park. Judging by the brief trailer \u2013 it couldn&apos;t be more unlike the family-friendly daytime fun we&apos;re getting from most Kinect developers.  Also sounding promising is Haunt, due out next year from NanaOn-Sha, the studio run by Pa Rappa creator, Masaya Matsuura. From the trailer, it looks to be a haunted house adventure, with the player challenging cartoon ghosts with a torch. Project Zero meets Luigi&apos;s Mansion? Stranger things have happened. It&apos;s out next year. Then we have Project Draco, a new dragon-riding game from Yukio Futatsugi, who previously worked on the legendary Panzer Dragoon series of on-rails, erm, dragon-riding shooters. It&apos;s out next year. And finally, Body and Brain Connection is a motion controlled brain training game from Namco, which combines physical and mental exercises \u2013 so if solving logic, memory and maths problems wasn&apos;t always fun enough, next year you&apos;ll be able do it by waving your arms about and jumping up and down. Is anyone else thinking of Dr Magnus Pyke or are you all too young?      The Ico and Shadow of the Colossus collectionGreg covered this last week, but just to re-cap, Team Ico announced that it would be releasing the catchily titled &apos;Ico and Shadow of the Colossus Collection&apos;, containing the developer&apos;s two wondrous adventures, now re-mastered in HD. You do know that drool will eventually damage your keyboard don&apos;t you?            The thing about Yakuza and zombiesFans of Sega&apos;s Yakuza series didn&apos;t know what to do with themselves when the publisher announced the latest iteration in the series, subtitled &apos;Of The End&apos;. Instead of a contemporary drama of gangland strife, it&apos;ll be set in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, infested with zombies. The game still stars orphanage-owning hard nut Kazuma and will feature the trademark mini-games\u2026 but now they&apos;re mini-games with zombies. Incredible.

Zhan Qixiong was arrested on 8 September after his boat and a Japanese coastguard vessel collided in waters near a group of uninhabited islets administered by Japan but claimed by China. On Sunday a court in Japan extended his detention on the southern island of Okinawa to 29 September, prompting China to announce that it was halting ministerial and provincial-level contacts. A spokesman in Japan, which is today observing a national holiday, claimed Tokyo had not been informed of the decision to cut off ties. &quot;If China did make such a decision, then it is truly regrettable,&quot; Noriyuki Shikata, a spokesman for the prime minister, Naoto Kan, told Associated Press. &quot;We call for calm and prudent action by China in order not to further escalate the situation,&quot; Shikata said, adding that the investigation into the collision was legally, not politically, motivated. The row over the maritime collision is unfolding against a backdrop of rising tension over China&apos;s military spending, simmering historical resentments and competing claims to territories and possible energy sources. Despite hopes that relations would improve under Japan&apos;s centre-left government, which took office a year ago, they have quickly sunk to their lowest level since 2005, when riots erupted in protest at visits to a controversial war shrine by the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. The two countries halted ministerial-level defence talks for three years from 2003. Although Japan has released the ship and its 14 other crew, the prospects of an early end to the row dimmed amid reports that China was preparing to start drilling in natural gas fields in another disputed area of the East China Sea, despite a 2008 agreement to conduct joint explorations. Media reports said Kan was considering countermeasures, including the start of unilateral test drilling by Japan. Earlier, Japanese officials said China had moved drilling equipment to the area, having scrapped scheduled talks over joint exploration in the wake of the trawler incident. Although known reserves appear to be relatively modest, it is thought that there may be more to be found. China&apos;s state broadcaster CCTV said yesterday that Beijing had suspended contacts, including talks on increasing flights, and postponed a meeting on coal. The decision came after a day of protests across China to mark the start of Japan&apos;s invasion of China in 1931. The row began more than a week ago, when a trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard ships near the Senkaku islands, known as the Diaoyu in China. However, after several years of improving relations and increasing trade, China and Japan have much to lose from a prolonged deterioration in ties, and will be wary of letting the spat get out of hand. Dr Shogo Suzuki, a specialist in Sino-Japanese relations at the University of Manchester, said neither side wanted the situation to get out of control. &quot;If China frightens Japan too much, it will just draw it closer to America, which is certainly not something China would like.&quot; He suggested that both sides had learned from the dispute in 2005, pointing to Beijing&apos;s determination to avoid large protests this weekend and suggesting it was aware it did not face &quot;a Koizumi type, using nationalism for domestic purposes&quot; in Tokyo. But Suzuki added: &quot;The question is how they can get out of this game of chicken.&quot; He suggested that if the captain were released with a fine or reprimand it might allow both countries to save face."}, {"sentences": ["The centre-left administration in Tokyo has repeatedly called for calm on both sides, having made closer ties with China a key part of its foreign policy since taking office a year ago.", "Gao suggested that Tokyo could offer to release the captain, whose mother died following his arrest, on humanitarian grounds, and because tomorrow&apos;s mid-autumn festival is traditionally a time for family reunions in China."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T11:00:58Z", "title": "Japan counsels against 'extreme nationalism' in row with China", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/21/japan-china-trawlerman-row-nationalism", "article": "Japan today warned that a deepening row over its detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain should not be allowed to fuel &quot;extreme nationalism&quot; on either side. The remarks follow Beijing&apos;s abrupt suspension of high-level contacts. China announced the measure in protest at Japan&apos;s decision to extend its detention of trawler captain Zhan Qixiong, whose ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels a fortnight ago near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both countries and which the Chinese call the Diaoyus. &quot;What is most important is that government officials in Japan, China and other countries try not to fuel narrow-minded, extreme nationalism,&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, told reporters. &quot;For the peace and development of east Asia and the Asia-Pacific, we want to use all available means of communication to ask that this be resolved without the situation escalating.&quot; Sengoku said there were no plans for the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to discuss the crisis with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York later this week. China&apos;s foreign ministry said a meeting between the two leaders would be inappropriate. &quot;This matter has already seriously damaged China-Japan relations,&quot; Jiang Yu, a ministry spokeswoman, told reporters. &quot;The key to solving this problem is in Japan&apos;s hands.&quot; The US voiced concern at the prospect of a prolonged estrangement between China and Japan, which are engaged in long-standing disputes over the islands as well as drilling rights in oil and gas fields in the East China Sea. A US state department spokesman, Mark Toner, said Washington expected the row to be &quot;resolved through appropriate diplomatic means&quot;. Japan&apos;s refusal to release Zhan has fuelled anti-Japanese sentiment among Chinese internet users and led to cultural exchanges being called off. Chinese travel agencies have cancelled package tours to Japan, affecting thousands of tourists, while a youth association withdrew an invitation to 1,000 Japanese youngsters to attend the World Expo in Shanghai. The Japanese band Smap, which has a huge following in mainland Asia, has postponed two concerts in China after a local ticket agency suspended ticket sales over the weekend, according to the Sports Nippon tabloid. The boyband was scheduled to play in front of 80,000 fans at the expo venue next month. The centre-left administration in Tokyo has repeatedly called for calm on both sides, having made closer ties with China a key part of its foreign policy since taking office a year ago. The finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said Japan would respond in a &quot;level-headed manner&quot; to avoid any impact on the countries&apos; economic ties. China became Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner last year, with bilateral trade reaching 12.6tn yen (\u00a395bn) in the first half of this year, up more than 34 percentage points compared with the same period last year. Analysts said it was in both countries&apos; interests to defuse the crisis, given the strength of their economic ties and shared concerns about North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. &quot;They have all the reasons to improve bilateral relations and co-operate further in economic and other relations, especially when China&apos;s economic growth is very fast and when Japan&apos;s is slow or even contracting,&quot; said Victor Gao, director of the China National Association for International Studies in Beijing. &quot;Improving relations between the two countries is in their mutual interest. It is crucial for both to exercise maximum restraint and avoid anything which may escalate tensions.&quot; Nationalist messages flooded internet forums. On one popular portal, Netease, a user from Ningxia, north-west China, wrote: &quot;Our national humiliation can never be forgotten. As an ordinary common person, all I can do is be angry and boycott Japanese goods; if there is a war, as a reserve officer, I will not hesitate!&quot; Others attacked the Chinese government for not taking a stronger line. Aside from the anti-Japanese vitriol flooding online forums, protests in China have been low-key. A strong police presence ensured that demonstrations in Beijing on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the start of Japan&apos;s occupation in 1931 passed off peacefully. China&apos;s decision to suspend contacts at the ministerial level and above came after a Japanese court approved a request by prosecutors to hold Zhan until 28 September, when they must either indict or release him. Gao suggested that Tokyo could offer to release the captain, whose mother died following his arrest, on humanitarian grounds, and because tomorrow&apos;s mid-autumn festival is traditionally a time for family reunions in China. &quot;It could be an expedient way to wind this down without causing anyone to lose face or requiring either to compromise their principled position on the Diaoyu islands,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Kim Jong-il thought Kim Jong-chul &quot;too girlish&quot; to become leader, while the eldest brother, Kim Jong-nam, ruled himself out when, much to his father&apos;s embarrassment, he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, claiming he wanted to visit Disneyland in Tokyo."], "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T17:34:28Z", "title": "Kim who?

It seems only fair to confer a similar accolade on North Korea&apos;s dictator-in-waiting: the Phantom Leader, perhaps. As the party that has ruled the secretive state for more than six decades prepares to anoint Kim Jong-un as its next leader at a rare gathering of cadres in the capital, Pyongyang, the world is still some way off establishing the facts about communism&apos;s crown prince. So little is known about Kim Jong-un, the third and youngest son of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, that even the characters used to write his name and his date of birth are disputed. Aged 27 or 28, he was born to his father&apos;s &quot;favourite consort,&quot; Ko Young-hee, a Japanese-born dancer who emigrated with her father in the 1960s. Shortly before her reported death from breast cancer in 2004, the state media began referring to her as the Respected Mother, confirming the theory that she is the closest the country has ever come to a first lady.     The Phantom Leader? Kim Jong-un at his Swiss secondary school. Photograph: Yonhap/AFP/Getty Images    Like his elder brother, Kim Jong-chol, he received an expensive education under an assumed name in Switzerland. While his brother attended the International School of Berne, Kim Jong-un is thought to have gone to a school in nearby Liebefeld from 1996 to 2000. After rumours of the younger Kim&apos;s anointment began circulating last year, Ueli Studer, the town&apos;s director of education, would only confirm that a &quot;North Korean youth&quot; had been on the school&apos;s rolls. The pupil had been a speaker of English, German and French, Studer said, as well as &quot;integrated, industrious and ambitious&quot;. Kim Jong-un&apos;s expected appearance at the Korean Workers&apos; party assembly next week, reportedly delayed because of concerns over Kim Jong-il&apos;s health, will offer the world the first verifiable images of the younger man. The main photograph in the public domain shows a cherubic, smiling 11-year-old with a predisposition for his father&apos;s chubbiness. Now, he is the subject of a propaganda offensive aimed at securing him a place in the affections of the country&apos;s citizens amid signs that last year&apos;s disastrous currency revaluation and tough international sanctions are fuelling popular discontent with the regime. The Daily NK, an anti-Kim online newspaper in Seoul, published an internal propaganda document praising Jong-un for his skill at organising a fireworks display and his expert handling of military vehicles. &quot;He is a genius of geniuses,&quot; the document said. &quot;He has been endowed by nature with special abilities. There is nobody on the planet who can defeat him in terms of faith, will and courage.&quot; His induction into the personality cult surrounding North Korean&apos;s ruling dynasty has also been marked by the composition of poems and a song, Footsteps, extolling his virtues as a leader. His name is routinely prefixed by the titles Young General or Our Commander. The authorities will distribute 10m portraits to be hung next to those of his father and grandfather in every home, factory and office once his succession is official. Every one of North Korea&apos;s 24 million people will be expected to wear a lapel badge bearing his likeness. But what of his personality? The more generous accounts tell of a charismatic figure who honed his natural leadership skills during his five years at Kim Il-sung Military University in Pyongyang. Others say Kim Jong-un, who holds a mid-level position in the National Defence Commission, has inherited his father&apos;s mercilessness. &quot;He is more engaging with other people, but then others say he can be cruel,&quot; says Ha Tae-keung, president of Open Radio for North Korea in Seoul. &quot;He has already purged people in the defence commission he regards as opponents.&quot; Kenji Fujimoto, Kim Jong-il&apos;s former Japanese sushi chef, confirms the image of the younger Kim as a chip off the old block, describing him as the &quot;spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality&quot;. In his bestselling 2003 account of his 11 years chez Kim, Fujimoto \u2013 the name is a nom de plume \u2013 recalled meeting a seven-year-old Kim Jong-un, who was dressed in a military uniform: &quot;He glared at me with a menacing look when we shook hands. I can never forget the look in his eyes, which seemed to be saying, &apos;This is one despicable Japanese guy.&apos;&quot; The older Kim Jong-un reportedly shares his father&apos;s interest in movies \u2013 the martial arts expert Jean-Claude van Damme is a favourite actor \u2013 can hold his drink and drives around the family&apos;s estate in a converted Mercedes. The son is a keen basketball fan, says Fujimoto, who allowed his ideological mask to slip with his admiration for Michael Jordan, the US player. Kim Jong-il thought Kim Jong-chul &quot;too girlish&quot; to become leader, while the eldest brother, Kim Jong-nam, ruled himself out when, much to his father&apos;s embarrassment, he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, claiming he wanted to visit Disneyland in Tokyo. The gap between Kim Jong-un&apos;s anointing and enthronement could be much shorter than the 14 years Kim Jong-il spent preparing for power, a wait that ended abruptly with the death of his father, North Korea&apos;s founder and &quot;eternal president&quot;, Kim Il-sung, from a heart attack in 1994. Given the state of Kim Jong-il&apos;s health, some observers believe the transition may be completed as early as 2012, the centenary of Jong-il&apos;s father&apos;s birth, and a year the official media are referring to as a defining moment in the country&apos;s history. &quot;Kim Jong-il doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;ll be around 10 years from now,&quot; says Bradley Martin, author of a seminal book on the Kim dynasty, Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. &quot;Some reports say that he feels pretty low and has a reason to name his successor.&quot;The two-day party congress has twice been postponed this month, adding to speculation that Kim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke two years ago, is too weak to attend. Next week, Kim Jong-un&apos;s rise to the upper echelons of the Workers&apos; party is unlikely to be met with universal approval. &quot;It is hard to know what the other party elites have in mind,&quot; says Ha, who says he has sources inside the North Korean military and ruling party. Recent reports speculated that disquiet among political and military elites over Kim&apos;s choice of successor was the real reason behind the meeting&apos;s delay. &quot;Officially they have to support Jong-un, or they risk being executed,&quot; says Ha. &quot;But some are worried, particularly older members who have been loyal to Kim Jong-il, and wonder how his son will treat them.&quot; Confirmation that North Korea has begun the transition to a third member of the Kim dynasty will come with Kim Jong-un&apos;s expected elevation to senior posts in the Workers&apos; party, including that of secretary of the feared organisation and guidance department, which monitors senior officials. &quot;If he gets that position he will be at the party&apos;s centre and able to pick and choose his minions,&quot; says Martin. Under Kim Jong-un, many analysts expect a continuation of the current military-first policy and, despite the country&apos;s frequent dalliances with economic meltdown and pressure for reform from China, absolute adherence to central planning. As he confronts his own mortality and surveys the impoverished, isolated state he has ruled for 16 years, Kim Jong-il&apos;s apparent choice of heir sits easily with the gross egotism of a man who is desperate to ensure it lives on in his image, whatever the economic, social and diplomatic costs. &quot;Kim Jong-il chose Jong-un because he reminds him most of himself,&quot; says Martin. &quot;Some people have high hopes for change because he was educated abroad, but so were Arab oil sheikhs, and it didn&apos;t turn them into liberal democrats. He was chosen because to be a good dictator, you have to be a mean son of a bitch.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["So Murray went off to work for Newsweek in Hong Kong, but soon moved to Tokyo.", "They abandoned the fleshpots of Tokyo and lived in a small town on the slopes of Mount Fuji, sleeping on tatami mats and living simply in the Japanese manner."], "tags": ["Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "UK news", "Australia news", "World news", "Books", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T17:42:24Z", "title": "Murray Sayle obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/sep/21/murray-sayle-obituary", "article": "Murray Sayle, who has died aged 84 after suffering from Parkinson&apos;s disease, was a journalistic legend, but he was also much more interesting than most of that breed. He was a complex, self-contradictory character, sardonic but warm, cynical but principled, who lived in several avatars and in three very different cultures: Australia, where he grew up and to which he returned in old age; Britain, where he made his reputation as the most forceful of Fleet Street&apos;s finest; and Japan, where he spent more than 30 years of his life and did some of his best work. He was an adventurer, an autodidact and a man of many parts, an intellectual who climbed Everest and sailed the Atlantic single-handed, and was always willing to have an argument on almost any subject, on or off licensed premises. Murray&apos;s professional reputation was established by a number of memorable scoops. From a plane he had parlayed himself on to, he spotted Francis Chichester&apos;s globe-girdling yacht as it rounded Cape Horn. He tracked down Che Guevara in the Bolivian jungle. Most memorably of all, having the insight to guess that the communist spy Kim Philby would, ideology notwithstanding, collect his dividend cheques from London at Moscow&apos;s central post office, he waited until he was able to step forward and greet the middle-aged English gent the world&apos;s press was hunting with a Livingstonian &quot;Mr Philby?&quot;. Large, shrewd and with many of the characteristics of an armoured vehicle, Murray had plenty of the &quot;rat-like cunning&quot; advocated by his colleague Nick Tomalin when it came to that basic reportorial talent of getting oneself in the right place at the right time. Later he developed a graceful writing style and an instinct for seeking out the larger, less obvious truth. His work as a war reporter, in Vietnam and in the India-Pakistan war of 1971 (flavoured occasionally, some thought, with imaginative obbligati) was always courageous and colourful. Near the end of his life, he had the belated satisfaction of seeing his documentary novel of life on a Fleet Street Sunday \u2013 A Crooked Sixpence (2008), banned for almost half a century as a result of a libel action \u2013 hailed as a classic. Perhaps his very best work was his reporting of Japan, controversial and original as ever, with the insight that came from living in a small Japanese town, in a Japanese house, where his English wife taught in the Japanese school that their three tall, blond children \u2013 two sons and a daughter \u2013 attended. A short film about the odd taste of the Japanese for eating as close as they dared to the poisonous parts of the fugu fish was a masterpiece of the recherch\u00e9. His contrarian account of the role of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima in hastening Japan&apos;s surrender, which took up an entire issue of the New Yorker in 1995, exemplified his passion for detail and his willingness to shock, which it certainly did. Friends and colleagues remember him for conversation that was rich in humour, erudition and paradox, and for his invention of some of the ruling catchphrases of journalistic culture. It was Murray who first cited a reporter (a fictional version of himself), assigned to expose a prostitution racket, insisting that he &quot;made excuses and left&quot;; it was Murray, too, who laid down that there were only two basic stories \u2013 &quot;We name the guilty man!&quot; and &quot;Arrow points to defective part&quot;. He was born in the west Sydney suburb of Earlwood and the aura of middle-class convention. His father was a railway executive and his mother a keen ballroom dancer. He attended Canterbury boys&apos; high school, Sydney, where he was an officer in the cadet corps, a useful introduction to the military whom he observed with such quizzical understanding in Vietnam and elsewhere. He studied psychology at Sydney University and edited the university newspaper, the Honi Soit, where he attracted early attention by unmasking a fraudulent poet, an Aussie Ossian called Ern Malley. He left university after two years and became a journalist, first undergoing the stern discipline of a cadetship on the Sydney Daily Telegraph, then writing a column for the Sydney Daily Mirror and becoming a radio reporter. In 1952 he left Australia for London, following his then girlfriend, the zither-playing singer Shirley Abicair. He found work on the People, where he was the legman for Duncan Webb. Murray helped Webb expose the notorious Messina gang, fearsome Maltese pimps and brothel owners. His technique and his attitude to the work are laid bare in The Crooked Sixpence. He left the People to go to Paris, as one did in those days, to write the novel. Unfortunately his landlord and supposed friend, one Michael Alexander, thought he could make himself a few thousand harmless quid by suing Murray for libel. The result was that the book was injuncted and eventually pulped. Only a few copies survived, cult objects cherished by Murray&apos;s growing army of admirers, until it reappeared for good 47 years later. Down those mean Soho streets, in the best noir tradition, a young man went, easily identifiable as Murray, who was not himself mean, nor certainly \u2013 in Raymond Chandler&apos;s words, &quot;tarnished nor afraid&quot;. In The Crooked Sixpence, he also laid out his personal theory of journalism. It was something less than idealistic. There were two kinds, he explained: one was public service journalism, useful but uninteresting; the other, the kind that interested Murray, was a branch of the entertainment industry. In Paris, while writing his novel and afterwards, he supported himself by writing for Agence France-Presse and others. He also sold encyclopedias and Bernie Cornfeld&apos;s dodgy investment programmes (later exposed by his Sunday Times colleagues) to American servicemen in Germany. In 1964, Murray was fixed up by his Australian mate Phillip Knightley with a job on the Sunday Times, which Harold Evans was then transforming from a staid establishment organ into an aggressive but serious paper, featuring starry reporting and audacious investigations. Murray fitted like a glove and became something of a mentor or role model for other Australians, among them Knightley, Bruce Page, Tony Clifton and Alex Mitchell, though he was always a lone wolf, unhappy with group journalism. In late 1966, Murray went to Vietnam. It was the first of many visits, and of highly individual reports from many war zones. He left the Sunday Times after the Bloody Sunday mass killing in the Bogside area of Derry in January 1972. Sayle reported, correctly, that the British paratroopers had not been fired on by republicans. He also wrote that the whole affair had been the result of deliberate British government policy. Colleagues were outraged and persuaded Evans that he was wrong about that. So Murray went off to work for Newsweek in Hong Kong, but soon moved to Tokyo. He had been married, briefly, to Maria Theresa von Stockert, an Austrian countess, and enjoyed a relationship with a famous female novelist. Now, to the happy surprise of most of his colleagues, he married one of Evans&apos;s secretaries, Jenny Philips. It was the greatest success. If ever a man was softened by marriage, it was Murray. They abandoned the fleshpots of Tokyo and lived in a small town on the slopes of Mount Fuji, sleeping on tatami mats and living simply in the Japanese manner. When their house burned down, colleagues started a whipround to replace their lost possessions, only to find that the Sayles were so popular locally that their neighbours had already helped them out. Those were happy years, and Murray contributed affectionate, if unorthodox, interpretations of Japan to publications from the Spectator to the New York Review of Books and others in Australia, where in 2004 he moved for medical treatment, and where his children went to university. He is survived by them and by Jenny. Martin Woollacott writes: Murray Sayle was the most engaging, charming and infuriating companion along the rocky road that was foreign reporting in the second half of the 20th century. Intellectually able and instinctively contrarian, he treated every story as a puzzle whose real meaning had to be drawn out from the cloud of cliches, simplifications, lies and misunderstandings with which others, including some of his colleagues, had enveloped it. He believed that within weeks, even days, of a big story developing, a received view emerged to which most journalists then unthinkingly conformed. Not he. He was of course a tough, enterprising correspondent who physically rushed all over a story, and he had numerous scoops to his credit, but it was the scoop of interpretation that was his true grail. As he wrestled with what can be called &quot;the story of the story&quot;, he ruthlessly enlisted fellow reporters as sparring partners. He could lecture and argue for hours on end, essentially putting forth his theories about the story in question for analysis and opposition. His forehead, both broad and high, and his questing nose gave him a baronial look, and he was always referred to by the Corsican proprietor of the small Saigon hotel where he stayed as &quot;le Sayle Murree&quot;, much as if it were a title of high Scottish nobility. He had one uncanny technique, which was gradually to appropriate, without acknowledgment, some of the better arguments of his opponents. They would then find themselves in the extraordinary position of being lambasted for not understanding points which they themselves had first put forward. Why did they put up with it? Well, Murray was magnetic, witty, possessed of a remarkable turn of phrase, and erudite in unexpected ways. He acted on the somnolent psyche of the average foreign correspondent rather like an alarm clock. He woke you up. Finally, there was about him something very lovable. As he talked he chewed, usually toothpicks, but if bird&apos;s eye chilis were available, he would pop them like boiled sweets. In this way Murray refined and expanded his understanding of a story. It was that underpinning of intellectual work that gave his journalism a special force and coherence. Sometimes his cleverness led him astray, as in his insistence, until pretty close to the end, on the unlikelihood of victory for the north in Vietnam. Usually it did not \u2013 his level-headed chronicling of the rather limited nature of the clashes between the Jordanian army and the Palestinians in 1970, for instance, made the apocalyptic reports of some colleagues look very silly indeed. Read The Crooked Sixpence for a picture of the young blade who scored on Fleet Street while still in his early 20s, full of charm, cheekiness and determination, coupled with a total lack of deference. He was one of a remarkable collection of reporters who brought their specifically Australian virtues into Anglo-American journalism in the 1950s and 60s. Lacking both the post-imperial complexes of their British opposite numbers and the stodgy consciousness of power which afflicted some of the American press corps, they moved in on the stories of the era, both home and abroad, like dingos closing for the kill. They were, at their best, magnificent, and Murray was perhaps the most magnificent of all. \u2022 Murray Sayle, journalist, adventurer and writer, born 1 January 1926; died 18 September 2010"}, {"sentences": ["A few years ago, he published a lavishly illustrated guidebook called Art Space Tokyo."], "tags": ["Social trends", "Philosophy", "Psychology", "Tim Berners-Lee"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T19:30:46Z", "title": "Inspiring talk: the mini festival that urges you to do it", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/21/do-lectures-festival-that-inspires", "article": "Not for the first time, I&apos;m lying in bed overcome by a sense of inadequacy. This is partly because I have brought a sleeping bag that is functionally useless in the 4am late-September chill of my tent. Despite wearing two hats, all my clothes and walking boots, I&apos;m freezing. Maybe if I turned on my laptop and folded it over my chest, that would help. I am considering tearing up my paperback and stuffing it down my trousers like some literary thermal codpiece. Instead, I get up and walk to the toilet block. That only makes the feelings of inadequacy worse. Around me, I hear the snoring of some of the world&apos;s leading geniuses, adventurers and innovative entrepreneurs who have come to this beautiful corner of west Wales for a weekend event called the Do Lectures 2010. In a tent over there sleeps Ed Stafford, the ex-British army captain who dodged arrows and machetes to become the first human to hike the length of the Amazon from source to shining sea. There&apos;s sleeping Jay Rogers, the CEO of Local Motors, who aims to make cars that last so long that they become family heirlooms. Oh yes, and over there dozes Tim Berners-Lee, the guy who invented the world wide web. The point of this weekend is to galvanise everybody involved, even self-pitying baldsters like me, to do more than whine. &quot;We set up the Do Lectures because I like ideas and if we share ideas enough we can accelerate change,&quot; says David Hieatt who, with his wife Clare, four years ago launched an annual speaking event in these very woods, originally called Little Big Voice. For the last three years, these have been known as the Do Lectures and take place two miles south of Cardigan in the Fforest campsite of their friend James Lynch. The blurb says: &quot;The idea is a simple one: that people who Do amazing things can inspire the rest of us to go and do amazing things too.&quot; The Do Lectures weekend is an intimate, homespun affair. It takes place on a former chicken farm. There are lectures in a rustic teepee, acoustic sets around the campfire, a scramble over dinner for the vegan beetroot option, and a long wait in the morning queue for the showers. I missed the jam-making and bakery workshops, as well as the guided walk through the woods to hone my biomimicry skills (no, I&apos;m not sure what that means either), but many participants dutifully attend all of them. They are here, after all, not just to listen. They are here to get inspired and to do. The Hieatts are unlikely people to run this lecture series. David is an ex ad-man who, in 1995, set up Howies, an award-winning sports clothing company. The business was so successful that they were able to make a long-sought move from London to west Wales a few years ago. More recently, Howies has been bought by Timberland. Last year the Hieatts left the company. For the time being they are concentrating on running the lectures. What&apos;s their point? &quot;The notion of the man in the shed having a eureka moment is not what really happens,&quot; says David. &quot;I want these talks to be watched a million times online. I want this to be an event which gives a eureka moment to 1 million people. What really happens and has always happened in innovation is about the power of many. You can harness that on the internet. &quot; Coincidentally, these ideas are explored in a new book about the nature of innovation. Steven Johnson, author of the bestseller Everything Bad Is Good for You, has written Where Good Ideas Comes From, arguing that radical innovation is made more likely when exhilarating doers from several disciplines hang out together, serendipitously influencing each other. Johnson&apos;s book could serve as a manual for the Do Lectures. In the teepee, I hear my first lecture. Conservationist and social entrepreneur Alasdair Harris is haranguing a 100-strong audience from his lectern (a sawn-up tree trunk) with an all-too-plausible dystopian vision of fishing. By 2012, the blue-fin tuna will be extinct. By 2048, commercial fishing will be over. Britain and Europe&apos;s fishing policies are premised on ignoring these truths and subsidising ever-deeper trawls into the oceans for what weirdo species remain. Harris counsels that we Europeans should stop this madness and learn from Madagascar&apos;s Vezu people. These fishing communities have, under the guidance of Harris&apos;s Blue Ventures marine conservation organisation, temporarily stopped fishing on sustainability grounds.     David and Clare Hieatt, founders of the Do Lectures. Photograph: Gareth Phillips for the Guardian    Each speaker has to conclude their talk with a &quot;Big Do&quot; \u2013 a practical notion that the audience could take away and enact. Harris asks us to eschew cod and chips and sushi. &quot;None of us would suffer in the west by giving up fish,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s not the case in the developing world, but to what extent do we here need to maintain the flow of fish to our table?&quot; Next up is former US marine Jay Rogers, billed as a 21st-century Henry Ford. &quot;We make it fun to own a car,&quot; says the CEO of Local Motors. He claims to do this by encouraging customers to design and contribute to the building of customised, low-emission, fuel-efficient cars at micro-factories dotted around the US. He reckons the company can take a new vehicle from sketch to market in 18 months, about the time it takes traditional car manufacturers to change the specs on door trim. &quot;My vision of a car company was not to make cars that become obsolete. It&apos;s one where parts get reused and the cars will be driven by the original customers&apos; grandchildren. The obsolescence of our business is part of what we have planned.&quot; You hope Rogers didn&apos;t tell his bank manager that. It&apos;s dusk outside the teepee when I interview Maggie Doyne, whose talk earlier in the day left many in tears. During her gap year, Doyne went to war-torn Nepal and found a phenomenon that changed her life: hundreds of orphaned children who didn&apos;t have the basics to live on. Suddenly, going on to university as planned seemed ludicrous. &quot;I remember looking into the eyes of this girl aged 12 and I saw myself 10 years before with the world of opportunities before me. She had nothing and nothing to look forward to. I thought: Is this really what the world is like? Like, what the heck \u2013 is this a joke?&quot; What Maggie did was to go home and raise funds (&quot;including my $5,000 life savings&quot;) in order to build with local people the Kopila Valley Children&apos;s Home in a remote part of Nepal ravaged by Maoist insurrection. She now lives there with 30 children, the youngest of whom is two, and runs a school for 200 children. She learned Nepalese, integrated herself into the community and, three years on, lives there without (so far) a significant other. &quot;There&apos;ll be time for that,&quot; she says. &quot;My aim is that every child has a safe home, decent education and medical care.&quot; But she is trying to overturn something more entrenched than war&apos;s ravages: &quot;I don&apos;t know a woman in my village who can write or add up. Women are held down from the get go. That can&apos;t continue. What I do is a drop in the ocean, but it might serve as a model.&quot; Doyne wanders off for supper. Truly, I have looked on the face of youthful idealism and found myself wanting. That said, there is such a thing as being too exposed to inspiring people, so I head off to the onsite pub hoping to find a fellow underachiever for a quiet drink. The man I start talking to, though, has just come home after cycling around the coast of Ireland. The year before, he rode around the coast of Britain. Is there no one on this campsite without a stirring tale of achievement to reinforce my inadequacy? It&apos;s a rhetorical question. In a nearby field, there is a bonfire ringed by earnest people discussing today&apos;s lectures. &quot;So I should really give up sushi,&quot; says one bloke to his girlfriend. &quot;But,&quot; she replies, &quot;think of the livelihoods of fishing communities, especially those from the developing world.&quot; &quot;But haven&apos;t they got to stop fishing so species don&apos;t become extinct?&quot; &quot;Maybe it&apos;s not that simple.&quot; Sheez, I think, lighten up. Nearby, an old mobile library van has been converted to provide the night&apos;s entertainment. Inside, Heavenly Records boss Jeff Barrett is at the decks before one of the world&apos;s smallest dance floors \u2013 the library&apos;s former reading area. More bad news for underachievers: twentysomething geeks can throw some excellent shapes, damn them. The following morning, I settle down in the communal breakfast hall with David Spiegelhalter, Cambridge professor of the public understanding of risk. He is very exercised by the story of the Lincolnshire dad who was reprimanded by the local authority for allowing his seven-year-old daughter to walk 20m from her home, across a road, to get a school bus. He cites the story as showing how risk-averse social policies thwart rather than protect our children. &quot;Going to school should be an adventure,&quot; he argues. The day&apos;s first lecture is delivered by Tim Berners-Lee. If only the awe in the teepee could be harnessed for public good in some way. &quot;I am a geek, by the way,&quot; he tells his audience, &quot;and proud of it.&quot; Cue whoops from the like-minded. Who has ever written a computer program? Very few hands go up. Berners-Lee looks sad. &quot;But programming computers is really very creative and what&apos;s disappointing is that kids at school tend to see computers like a fridge,&quot; he says. More depressing for him is that only 20% of the world&apos;s population use his invention. One of the aims of his World Wide Web Consortium is to get the remaining 80% connected. One questioner suggests this would destroy older, purer ways of being.     The eclectic itinerary of events at the Do Lectures. Photograph: Gareth Phillips for the Guardian    Later, I tell Berners-Lee he crops up in Steven Johnson&apos;s book as an example of a scientist whose innovation was based on a slow-developing hunch and on being connected, when he worked at CERN, to other clever people from different disciplines, and that, most importantly, he was working in a not-for-profit network where ideas are freely exchanged \u2013 ideal circumstances for innovation. &quot;That&apos;s all probably right \u2013 there was no eureka moment, even though I know journalists want there to have been.&quot; Isn&apos;t that very similar to what the Do Lectures should ideally, erm, do? &quot;Well, having people from different disciplines criss-crossing each other here can be inspiring,&quot; he says. &quot;But what really stimulates me is being in this beautiful rural environment.&quot; Berners-Lee is followed to the teepee lecture stump by Ed Stafford, who five weeks ago completed a two-and-a-half-year walk down the Amazon from source to sea. It&apos;s an amazing story of cheating violent death, as well as the manly struggle to get online in the jungle. &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid of taking risks,&quot; he says. &quot;Don&apos;t listen to negative people. Don&apos;t be afraid. If you&apos;re positive and visualise you can really achieve your dreams.&quot; The audience has its collective head down, taking notes. This theme is echoed by Daniel Seddiqui, who left home to do 50 different jobs over 50 weeks in each of the US&apos;s 50 states. He married a couple in Las Vegas (&quot;not sure if they&apos;re still together&quot;) and was a stiltwalker at Florida&apos;s Universal Studios. &quot;In California, I was living in a bubble,&quot; he says. &quot;My project was about going outside my comfort zone and taking risks.&quot; Words to warm the cockles of Prof Spiegelhalter&apos;s heart. Seddiqui&apos;s Big Do? &quot;Find something that&apos;s worth pursuing and go for it.&quot; Small do? &quot;Finish what you start.&quot; The audience furiously takes notes again. It&apos;s nearly time for me to leave. But before I do I hear Craig Mods, a vexingly smart and irritatingly young publisher and writer, on what digital technology will do to the book. Mods explains by telling his own story. A few years ago, he published a lavishly illustrated guidebook called Art Space Tokyo. When the original print run sold out last spring, he considered his options: &quot;The national distributors were saying you have to price this niche book at mass-market rates.&quot; That meant selling his book for $29.50, which he thought was ludicrously cheap. Instead, he decided to fund and distribute another run himself using Kickstarter, a website that facilitates the microfinancing of creative projects. Anyone who pledged him $25 received a pdf edition and access to all updates to the book; those who pledged $65 received a hardback book as well as a pdf and access to updates; those pledging $850 or more received a signed original drawing by a Japanese artist too. By May this year, 265 backers had pledged $23,790 \u2013 nearly $9,000 more than Mods sought. With the proceeds, he bankrolled a new print run. He also funded iPad and pdf editions \u2013 both of which he can regularly update. His story hardly implies the book is dead: rather, it suggests that the future publishing ecology may feature fewer but better made books and that we will use digital technology to develop currently unforseen ways of reading. iPads and Kindles will, he thinks, doom paperbacks to extinction, but that is no bad thing. Maybe I should have torn up that paperback and stuffed it in my trousers for warmth last night after all. I find Mods&apos;s speech especially inspiring since it envisages publishing as sidestepping the whims of an innovation-averse industry, still less as something to be subsumed entirely by Steve Jobs&apos;s empire. It offers, as the best of these Do Lectures have done, a suggestion of how you can be the change in your own life, and a bracing challenge to those of us who spend too much time in bed feeling inadequate. This year I leave feeling inspired. Next year I&apos;ll bring a better sleeping bag. The 2010 Do Lectures will be available online from next Monday at www.dolectures.com"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo, meanwhile, called for high-level bilateral talks, but said it would continue its investigation into the captain despite Beijing&apos;s demands for his immediate release."], "tags": ["China", "World news", "Japan", "Wen Jiabao", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-22T07:11:11Z", "title": "China prime minister demands captain's release", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/22/china-demands-captain-release", "article": "China&apos;s premier Wen Jiabao has threatened further retaliation against Japan unless it releases a fishing boat captain, as the maritime dispute between the two countries escalates. Wen is the most senior Chinese leader to comment on the row, which began earlier this month when a Chinese trawler collided with a Japanese patrol ship near disputed islets \u2013 known as the Diaoyu islands in China and Senkaku islands in Japan. Tokyo, meanwhile, called for high-level bilateral talks, but said it would continue its investigation into the captain despite Beijing&apos;s demands for his immediate release. Speaking to overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans on the sidelines of a United Nations summit in New York last night, Wen warned: &quot;The Japanese side has paid no heed to China&apos;s numerous serious representations, and so China cannot but take necessary countermeasures. &quot;If Japan acts willfully despite advice to the contrary, China will take further actions, and Japan must accept full responsibility for all the severe consequences.&quot; The incident had &quot;stirred up anger for the entire Chinese people at home and abroad&quot;, Wen added, in comments carried on the website of China&apos;s foreign ministry. The ministry had already said Wen would not meet Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan in New York because the atmosphere was not suitable. Beijing suspended ministerial and provincial level contacts after a Japanese court extended the captain&apos;s detention on Sunday. Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, said: &quot;It would be good to have high-level talks as soon as possible, on issues including broad, strategic matters.&quot; Foreign minister Seiji Maehara said he would be willing to meet Chinese officials in New York to explain Japan&apos;s response to the collision. &quot;China is an important neighbouring country,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;We will have to build a strategic reciprocal relationship.&quot; While he did not offer details, Sengoku conceded that Japan might have to take a &quot;broader view&quot; over Zhan Qixiong&apos;s detention to avoid inflicting further damage to ties with China. Some analysts expect Japan to release the captain without charge before his term of detention ends on 28 September, a move that would allow both sides to save face. Yesterday, Sengoku said both countries should prevent the dispute from being exploited by extremists. &quot;We should be careful not to stir up narrow-minded, extreme nationalism,&quot; he said. Despite long-running tensions between the two countries, relations have been good on the whole over the last four years. Analysts say China will not want to risk pushing Japan closer to the US again and neither side will want to damage trade. Kan told the Financial Times in an interview: &quot;I think that if this is dealt with calmly, it is entirely possible this will be a temporary problem.&quot; But Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University, Japan Campus, told Reuters: &quot;It shows how fragile the relationship is even if on the economic side, it is all gung-ho, the diplomatic-political side remains fragile. &quot;Cool heads will probably prevail but the hard part now is for both sides to back down. One side has to compromise and I don&apos;t think it is going to be China.&quot; The two countries are also at odds over resources in the East China Sea. The suspension of high-level exchanges risks derailing ongoing talks over drilling rights to potentially vast oil and gas deposits in disputed areas. The counties agreed in 2008 to conduct joint explorations, but China broke off talks to formalise the deal following Zhan&apos;s arrest. Earlier this week Japan said it had evidence that China was preparing to drill unilaterally from a platform in the Chunxiao gas fields, known as Shirakaba in Japan. Beijing insisted it had simply brought in equipment to repair the platform."}, {"sentences": ["A shrine to a fictional character killed off in BBC Wales&apos;s sci-fi series Torchwood has been gathering size there for some time now, with letters and items adorning the wall left by people from Arizona to Tokyo."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2010-09-22T07:45:49Z", "title": "Bassey, business and buildings: Marketing Cardiff on international stage", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/2010/sep/21/marketing-cardiff-shirley-bassey-cardiff-and-co-international-fame", "article": "Have you ever wondered who is behind marketing the city of Cardiff to the wider world? I recently did, on a trip to Amsterdam, when I had to explain to some otherwise intelligent backpackers from Berlin where exactly the city was.  &quot;Cardiff.&quot; Blank expression. &quot;In Wales.&quot; Confused expression. &quot;Anthony Hopkins? Catherine Zeta-Jones?&quot; A glimmer of recognition, if you&apos;re lucky... Looking at media coverage of some of the world&apos;s more obscure towns, you may be forgiven for thinking a city&apos;s fame only comes with its traumas. Bridgend is still trying to patch up its sombre media coverage with rebranding initiatives such as ourbridgend.com.  In an age where it seems like our geographical knowledge is only improving because there are more war zones to read about, a young company based in the heart of the Hayes is seeking to buck this trend. Operating out of The Old Library, the office of Cardiff &amp; Co is almost like J.K. Rowling&apos;s Platform 9-3/4 in its subtlety, going unseen amidst the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The man working the magic is Richard Thomas, managing director of the company. Founded in 2007, its aim is to market the city to the world, be it as a leisure, tourism or business destination.  One of the company&apos;s challenges is to promote a positive new image of Cardiff in the modern world. What, then, does Thomas make of the hackneyed clich\u00e9 of using somebody such as Shirley Bassey as a poster child of the city?   &quot;Sometimes there&apos;s nothing wrong with a hackneyed clich\u00e9. Other nations often exploit clich\u00e9s and stereotypes rather well,&quot; &quot;As long as they&apos;re constructive, positive and have a modern and up-to-date feel to them, I think that&apos;s fine.&quot;   He cites the male voice choir Only Men Aloud as an example of this new, hybrid representation of Cardiff: a totemic, choral image but with a &quot;modern twist&quot;. On the subject of the arts, Thomas is adamant Cardiff now has more than enough happening to sate the appetite of visiting culture vultures. He said:  &quot;Our cultural offer is developing year on year. Now we&apos;re fortunate in having the Wales Millennium Centre, which is not only an iconic building, but the things that go on there are fantastic as well. With it being home to the Welsh National Opera, but also more populist things like Mamma Mia!, for example, I think we&apos;re now seriously on the cultural map.&quot;  Perhaps through stereotypes in the media, many of my non-Welsh friends now living happily in Cardiff initially had certain apprehensions about moving to the capital city. They are now loath to leave; one of the main reasons unanimously being that people here are friendlier than in most cities, British or otherwise.  Thomas concurs: the city likes to prove its naysayers wrong. He highlights the case of the Ashes in 2009, held in the brand new Swalec stadium, as an example. He said:   &quot;Beforehand, the media were largely negative about the prospect of the Ashes coming to Cardiff, with doubts about the pitch, doubts about the capacity of the city to cope and to organise such a big sporting occasion. &quot;They were proved wrong on all counts, and in fact were very positive about it afterwards and were pleased to admit that they were wrong. When (people) come to the city, they&apos;re pleasantly surprised and tell other people about their experiences and want to come back.&quot;  Thomas added: &quot;The proof is in the pudding. People come here and they love it.&quot;      Display rafts at White Water, Cardiff Photograph: Hannah Waldram/guardian.co.uk    On the subject of sports, Cardiff is also increasing its portfolio in this field, with the recent opening of its International White Water centre (&quot;an excitement- and thrill-packed session,&quot; he assures me) and the council recently secured a contract to build a new ice rink - both in the prosperous Bay area.  Concordantly, Cardiff &amp; Co are putting notable emphasis on the business front. He cites the relocation of the BBC Wales studios from Llandaff to the Roath Basin as a major boost for the city.     Matt Smith as Doctor Who. Photograph: BBC Photograph: BBC    The move would bring the likes of Holby City, Doctor Who and Sherlock to the once-derelict docklands. Thomas said:   &quot;It will really put Cardiff at the forefront of drama development for the BBC across the UK and further builds on the city region&apos;s position as a major employer with the media and creative sectors.&quot;   One need only wander down to the waterside of Mermaid Quay to see how influential these homegrown TV shows have been in attracting tourists to the city.

Those who have seen it may wonder about No\u00e9&apos;s personal influences. In his interview with the director, my colleague Steve Rose asked him about the pornographic nature of Enter the Void. No\u00e9 replied: &quot;I was a huge consumer of porno movies when I was a teenager.&quot; Well, Enter the Void looks like the work of a director whose porn consumption may not be entirely a thing of the past. The other thing, of course, is drugs. No\u00e9 is a great experimenter with hallucinogens. He has famously said that he drew his inspiration from a time in his 20s, when he watched the 1947 noir Lady in the Lake on magic mushrooms. This movie, directed by and starring Robert Montgomery, is a hardboiled Philip Marlowe tale, and filmed strictly from the point of view of Marlowe himself. We see kisses, punch-ups and even a car chase from the protagonist&apos;s viewpoint. So I decided to recreate No\u00e9&apos;s famous experiment. I myself sat down to watch Lady in the Lake. And, being the rock&apos;n&apos;roll bad boy of film criticism that I am, I did so having drunk almost an entire bottle of Waitrose Chablis \u2014 on an empty stomach. The POV motif is in some ways more strictly enforced in Lady in the Lake than in Enter the Void \u2014 and yet in some ways less strictly. Lady in the Lake begins and ends with its subjective &quot;experiencer-narrator&quot; Marlowe appearing conventionally in shot. At first, he introduces the tale \u2014 and challenges us to solve it along with him, experiencing only what he experiences, which is the rationale behind this technique. At the end there is a coda, in which Marlowe addresses us conventionally once more. There&apos;s nothing like that in Enter the Void. We stick with Oscar&apos;s standpoint. But what this character is able to experience, as he floats over the city and switches back into the past, is far more liberated than the ordinary private eye \u2013 so liberated, in fact, that the restrictions of his viewpoint chafe a good deal less. In Lady in the Lake, Montgomery plays Marlowe, who submits a true-crime short story to a magazine publisher specialising in steamy pulp. When he is invited to visit their offices, Marlowe&apos;s gaze lingers on a gruesome promotional poster for its horror imprint. I can imagine young Gaspar No\u00e9&apos;s whacked-out expression gradually assuming one of pleasure as he gazed at that strange, stark, monochrome skull. And the shot is held for quite a while. The magazine&apos;s sexy editor, Adrienne, tremendously played by Audrey Totter, makes it clear that she has no great enthusiasm for Marlowe as a writer. But she is impressed by his obvious real-world expertise, and has called him into the offices to solve a delicate case. Her proprietor&apos;s wife has gone missing, apparently at a lakeside resort in which a woman has met a watery grave. Is she the murderer? Like in Enter the Void, there are moments when our hero (along with the audience) glimpses himself in the mirror: in Lady in the Lake, it is paradoxically more disconcerting, because we know perfectly well what Montgomery&apos;s Marlowe looks like. Somehow, when Marlowe starts narrating the movie, from behind the camera, we think of him as a separate character. When Oscar&apos;s face appears in Enter the Void, it is the first time we have seen it. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I could say that this is almost the Lacanian mirror-stage moment in a POV sequence: the seeing &quot;I&quot; experiences him or herself as an external reality, accentuated by the viewpoint of the audience for whom the narrator&apos;s face is unfamiliar or indeed entirely unknown. There is a similar &quot;mirror&quot; moment in the opening point of view scene of Rouben Mamoulian&apos;s 1931 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Lady in the Lake has a powerful scene, when Marlowe, having found himself in a suspect&apos;s house and bluffed his way past a woman who querulously announces herself as the landlady, searches the premises. He works his way through every room \u2014 and of course we, the audience, accompany him. Finally, he finds himself in the bathroom. He pulls the shower curtain back and without any dramatic music on the soundtrack, finds a corpse, dead from bullet wounds. It&apos;s a great sequence. Lady in the Lake, with its self-imposed technical gimmick, is perhaps comparable to Hitchcock&apos;s Rope \u2013 but I don&apos;t think Rope had anything quite as ingenious as that moment. And I wonder if it indirectly inspired Gaspar No\u00e9 to create his horrible scene in which Oscar is shot in the nightclub lavatory. But I don&apos;t think it was this which made such an impression on the young No\u00e9. It is simply the weird convention of getting the characters to talk and look into the camera. When these crisp, intense, well-dressed black-and-white characters look directly and piercingly at you, their eyes a-glitter, holding your gaze, it really is very disturbing, like something by Magritte. In fact, my intake of Waitrose Chablis might have dulled the impact; it would have been more disquieting if I had been stone-cold sober. When Marlowe comes into the publisher&apos;s offices, and finds himself ogling the blonde secretary, who stares coolly back at him (and us) \u2014 well, it&apos;s supposed to be rakish and comic.

Jean-Pierre Amoreau, owner of Ch\u00e2teau le Puy in the Bordeaux region, was &quot;very happy and surprised&quot; when he saw Japanese orders for one of his wines rocket several months ago. His agent in Tokyo explained that in March, a cartoon spin-off of the wildly successful Drops of God (Kami no Shizuku) manga comic series had plucked his vintage from obscurity. But instead of revelling in his new celebrity, Amoreau decided to take action to keep his wine for the discerning and worthy few. &quot;We immediately withdrew this vintage from sale through our agents across the world in order to avoid speculation because we wanted this wine, which had been chosen as a mythical wine, to remain within reach of everyone,&quot; he told French radio today. Begun in 2004 in a Japanese magazine, the Drops of God series has since become a phenomenon in the international wine market, boosting Asian interest in a previously overlooked drink and giving unprecedented attention to various bordeaux tipples that suddenly found themselves the drink du moment in Tokyo bars. The comics, which recount the quest of a young man to inherit his wine critic father&apos;s vast collection, see him attempt to identify the 13 wines chosen by his father in his will. They are all real-life vintages \u2013 such as the 1994 Ch\u00e2teau Lafleur and 1999 Ch\u00e2teau Palmer \u2013 and the wines have experienced a surge in sales after being featured in the books. &quot;The effect has been enormous and rather impressive,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Gl\u00e9nat, the publishing house that has printed the translated volumes since 2008, adding that some of the winemakers chosen had seen their Asian exports double or even triple. She said: &quot;The authors did not expect this phenomenon. They were quite surprised that they were able to influence the French market like this, as the choices are based on their personal tastes.&quot; The upturn in sales seen by Ch\u00e2teau le Puy in March, after the broadcast of a spin-off television show, is likely to pale in comparison with what lies in wait for the lucky wine chosen as the 13th and final vintage of the original manga series \u2013 not due to be published for several years. Amoreau had 150 orders for his 2003 vintage the day after the cartoon&apos;s finale was shown, and even received Japanese fans who had travelled from Paris to buy some. For him, however, that was enough to take steps to combat speculation. He said he wanted the wine to be &quot;sold for the accessible good of everyone and not only be reserved for people who buy luxury wine.&quot; He keeps &quot;a small stock&quot; for those buyers he deems genuine connoisseurs, and has only raised the price from \u20ac15.50 (\u00a313.20) to \u20ac18."}, {"sentences": ["Irr\u00e9versible had a horrific club called the Rectum; this one has a bar in Tokyo called the Void, where Oscar is shot by cops.", "This brother and sister have a strange and tragic story, which might in other circumstances have interested authors like Ruth Rendell or PD James: orphaned as kids, they were fostered separately, and on becoming 18, the older child Oscar apparently enters into some modest trust-fund inheritance which enables him to travel to Tokyo \u2013 a long-lost childhood longing for exotic travel \u2013 and later makes enough through drugs to bring his adored sister over, and live&nbsp;with her in an atmosphere of &nbsp; incestuous yearning.", "He revisits in horrified anguish, primal scenes from his childhood, including the death of his parents in a car wreck, which has seeded in Oscar this obsessive closeness to his sister and a sexualised longing for his lost mother, which finds expression in an affair with an older woman in Tokyo.", "No\u00e9's most startling achievement in Enter the Void is his vision of Tokyo: he reimagines it as a branching, crystalline network of neon laid out starkly against the night sky."], "tags": ["World cinema", "Drama", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-23T21:00:38Z", "title": "Film review: Enter the Void", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/23/enter-the-void-review", "article": "It has been eight years now since Gaspar No\u00e9 released his notorious rape-revenge film Irr\u00e9versible, an ultra-violent, ultra-extreme movie that effortlessly exceeded in shock value anything, by anyone, at any time. I myself, having admired his previous feature, Seul Contre Tous, reacted fiercely against it as a piece of macho provocation. Rereading my review now, I find none of its points wrong exactly, but I have to concede the possibility that I was just freaked out in precisely the way No\u00e9 intended. Having staggered out of the auditorium, my eyeballs still vibrating from the director's trademark sado-stroboscopic white light display, I&nbsp;may well have succumbed to a convulsion &nbsp;of&nbsp;disapproval. \nEnter the Void is, in its way, just as provocative, just as extreme, just as mad, just as much of an outrageous ordeal: it arrives here slightly re-edited from the version first shown at Cannes. But despite its querulous melodrama and crazed Freudian pedantries, it has a human purpose the previous film lacked, and its sheer deranged brilliance is magnificent. This is a grandiose hallucinatory journey into, and out of, hell: drugged, neon-lit and with a fully realised nightmare-porn aesthetic that has to be seen to be believed. Love him or loathe him \u2013 and I've done both in my time \u2013 Gaspar No\u00e9 is one of the very few directors who is actually trying to do something new with the medium, battling at the boundaries of the possible. It has obvious debts, but Enter the Void is utterly original film-making, and No\u00e9 is a virtuoso of camera movement. \nWe get the classic No\u00e9 tropes: throbbing ambient soundscape, murky lighting design bursting into unwatchable vortices of dazzling, flickering light, explicit sex and violence, colossal sans-serif lettering for the title- and end-credits. This film, however, has a new motif: what we see is purely the point of view of its leading figure; we watch everything through his eyes. He is a small-time drug-dealer called Oscar (Nathaniel Brown). Irr\u00e9versible had a horrific club called the Rectum; this one has a bar in Tokyo called the Void, where Oscar is shot by cops. His spirit hovers over the city, an unquiet ghost unable or unwilling to leave, watching over his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta), a pole-dancer now utterly alone in the world. \nThis brother and sister have a strange and tragic story, which might in other circumstances have interested authors like Ruth Rendell or PD James: orphaned as kids, they were fostered separately, and on becoming 18, the older child Oscar apparently enters into some modest trust-fund inheritance which enables him to travel to Tokyo \u2013 a long-lost childhood longing for exotic travel \u2013 and later makes enough through drugs to bring his adored sister over, and live&nbsp;with her in an atmosphere of &nbsp; incestuous yearning. \nHe revisits in horrified anguish, primal scenes from his childhood, including the death of his parents in a car wreck, which has seeded in Oscar this obsessive closeness to his sister and a sexualised longing for his lost mother, which finds expression in an affair with an older woman in Tokyo. Through some bizarre karmic influence, Oscar's spirit now sets out to part Linda from her current boyfriend, sinister tough guy Mario (Masato Tanno) and to get her together with his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), an amiable, dishevelled artist and the nearest thing this film has to a normal, sympathetic human being. \nOscar's dead-man floating-eye view gives us a ringside seat at scenes of unending horror, violence, squalor and pain. Yet there is a kind of barking mad spiritual dimension in No\u00e9's film. Enter the Void is about life after death. Specifically, it's about the life after death that troubles all of us atheists and rationalists most of all: the life after death that we all believe in \u2013 other people's lives in this busy and unhappy world carrying on heedlessly after we are dead. \nThe POV-style changes as the film progresses. When Oscar is still alive, we see strictly what he sees, and the view is periodically impeded by his blinks \u2013 as the initial scenes continued, I found my own blink-rate coming into synch with Oscar's, and so this became invisible. His&nbsp;thinking mind is represented by a whispered, paranoid soliloquy. After his death, this falls silent and he sees the past partly impeded by the back of his own head. \nThen, this disappears as his spirit floats everywhere and anywhere: death as the ultimate out-of-body experience. It's like a psychedelic innerspace version of Kubrick's 2001, and the film even finally presumes to offer a version of the star-child rebirth. Like Kubrick, incidentally, No\u00e9 has a fondness for trad classical \u2013 he brings Air on a G String on to the soundtrack. As for the overhead visions of violence and claustrophobic horror, they are clearly influenced by the climactic sequence of Scorsese's Taxi Driver. \nNo\u00e9's most startling achievement in Enter the Void is his vision of Tokyo: he reimagines it as a branching, crystalline network of neon laid out starkly against the night sky. The city is never seen in daytime. It is not real, but has merged with an illusory vision of the neon-model created by an artist friend of Victor's, and it is also an architecturalised version of those spiralling, kaleidoscopic snake-shapes that Oscar sees while tripping. \nSome may find Enter the Void detestable and objectionable, though if they affect to find it \"boring\" I will not believe them. For all its hysterical excess, this beautiful, delirious, shocking film is the one offering us that lightning bolt of terror or inspiration that we hope for at the cinema."}, {"sentences": ["Japanese prosecutors have released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, two weeks after a collision in disputed waters sparked a dramatic deterioration in ties between Beijing and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T08:54:49Z", "title": "Japan releases Chinese fishing boat captain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/24/japan-free-chinese-boat-captain", "article": "Japanese prosecutors have released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, two weeks after a collision in disputed waters sparked a dramatic deterioration in ties between Beijing and Tokyo. Zhan Qixiong was arrested on 8 September, a day after his ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries. Prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, where Zhan was detained, said they would monitor both governments&apos; response to their decision before deciding whether to indict him, but that course of action is looking increasingly unlikely. They said the row caused by Zhan&apos;s detention and the possible impact on Japan-China ties had been a factor in their decision. They accepted that Zhan had not intended to damage the Japanese vessels, but said he had been to blame by ignoring repeated requests to leave the area. &quot;We have decided that further investigation while keeping the captain in custody would not be appropriate, considering the impact on the people of our country as well as Japan-China relations in the future,&quot; the district&apos;s vice-prosecutor, Toru Suzuki, said. The Senkakus, which are controlled by Japan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits. Analysts say that underlying the dispute is rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic reasons and for control of the area&apos;s natural resources. Japanese officials had earlier warned that the swift deterioration in bilateral ties posed a threat to the economies of both countries. China was Japan&apos;s largest trading partner last year and Japan was China&apos;s third largest. Bilateral trade reached $147bn (\u00a393.6bn) in the first half of this year \u2013 a jump of 34.5% over the same time last year, Japanese figures show. &quot;A cooling of relations between Japan and China over the Senkaku problem would be bad for Japan&apos;s economy, but it would also be a minus for China,&quot; Japan&apos;s finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said. &quot;It&apos;s desirable that both sides respond in a calm manner.&quot; Liu Jiangyong, an expert on China-Japan relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said the prosecutors&apos; decision could go some way towards repairing the damage to bilateral ties."}, {"sentences": ["But then how do I know the truth about the Rio of City of God, the Tokyo of Enter The Void, or the Missouri of Winter&apos;s Bone?"], "tags": ["Ben Affleck", "Thriller", "Crime", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T11:10:25Z", "title": "Were Boston critics right to go to town on Ben Affleck's crime thriller?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/sep/24/boston-the-town-ben-affleck", "article": "Picture the scene. You meet someone new and exciting, perhaps at the kind of free-spirited get-together you young people seem to be throwing these days. They tell you in vivid and flavoursome detail about where they&apos;re from, complete with a host of thrilling stories set there which paint a rich, seductive portrait of home. It&apos;s wonderful. They even have a crazy accent. All in all you&apos;re so taken with the sound of the place that some time later, you pay a visit. At that point it goes awry. The stories turn out to be nonsense. The landmarks aren&apos;t where they&apos;re meant to be, there&apos;s a Primark and Starbucks on every street, and the accent, you find, was bollocks. How do you feel now? That&apos;s the risk we run every time we fall for a film in which the setting is as much the star as the cast. One notable example would be Ben Affleck&apos;s new heist-o-rama The Town, in which Boston at its most fiercely clannish remains front and centre throughout. Of course, the film&apos;s only following a route well-trodden since Affleck and Matt Damon set Good Will Hunting in the city, with fellow travellers now including The Departed, Edge of Darkness, Mystic River and in 2007 another Dennis Lehane adaptation, Gone Baby Gone, which gave Affleck his debut behind the camera. In The Town, as with its predecessor, its director&apos;s own Bostonian roots have hardly been undersold. Now, sheltered limey that I am, it&apos;s not for me to say whether or not the town of The Town \u2013 in fact, the traditionally Irish-American neighbourhood of Charlestown \u2013 is authentic or not. But while newcomers have revelled in its geographical realism, critics in the city itself have been more suspicious (kudos to Green Cine Daily and Cinetrix for flagging this up). Even in the middle of a good review the Boston Phoenix felt bound to point out that &quot;one of the least convincing elements in Affleck&apos;s re-creation of the Boston criminal demi-monde is his own erratic accent&quot;, while the Boston Globe&apos;s much-respected Ty Burr was sterner still, claiming the film took place in a &quot;sub-Scorsese landscape of stubbled men walking down mean Suffolk County streets that exist primarily in the minds of good pulp novelists and bad screenwriters&quot; \u2013 before again raising the issue of accents and pointing out that Affleck is actually not from Charlestown but nearby Cambridge. In other words, for all its grizzled, tattooed reek of authenticity The Town might just be the aforementioned stranger at the party. Or perhaps it&apos;s simply a brawny thriller with no obligation to be anything more. So does it matter if it&apos;s real or not? I know people whose stock response on this question is that no fictional film ever has to get the little things right \u2013 and no, I&apos;m not suggesting anyone cares whether Marmaduke presents us with a verit\u00e9 account of life for a freakishly large dog in California. But when a movie knowingly trades on the specific tang of its locale, it does imply a certain honesty and accuracy. Which is why it&apos;s unsettling to hear that with The Town you might actually only be seeing what Burr calls &quot;Movie Boston&quot;, just as Goodfellas might be Movie New York, or Chungking Express Movie Hong Kong. To do so is to sense you&apos;ve been treated as a dopey tourist, lured into an Aberdeen Angus Steak House by Leicester Square tube on the grounds that it&apos;s where fashionable Londoners eat every night of the week. You would think the fantasies are easy to spot. There is, surely, no one out there who really expects modern Paris to resemble the dainty picture of it Am\u00e9lie provides \u2013 is there? The thing is, without the frame of reference that comes with spending a great deal of time in a place, we&apos;re all of us taking an awful lot on trust. Speaking of dainty, I was righteously up in arms at the questionable picture of contemporary west London offered by Richard Curtis in Notting Hill, not least at the thought of audiences abroad mistaking it for the real thing. But then how do I know the truth about the Rio of City of God, the Tokyo of Enter The Void, or the Missouri of Winter&apos;s Bone? At least I can rest easy that my own neck of the woods has done well lately, because let no one tell you that the portrait of Wandsworth&apos;s Southside shopping centre in the recent Streetdance 3D was anything other than flawlessly authentic. And as all the rudeboys in SW18 say, ta-ta for now."}, {"sentences": ["For autumn, sow main-crop varieties such as Green Top Stone or Green Globe, and in late winter sow early varieties such as Snowball (pictured), Purple Top Milan or the Japanese Tokyo Cross or Tokyo Top (when young, those last two are sweet enough to be eaten raw in salads)."], "tags": ["Gardening advice", "Gardens"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T23:03:06Z", "title": "Alys Fowler: Turnip tops", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/25/alys-fowler-turnip-tops", "article": "A month ago I went to a Korean restaurant with the express desire to eat a lot of kimchi (fermented vegetables). I\u00a0ordered three pickles \u2013 the traditional version made with Chinese cabbage, one with radishes and one made predominately from turnip greens. I&apos;ve had kimchi made with turnip roots, but never the greens before. It\u00a0was a revelation. I dined alone, and well-dressed Korean ladies looked on in surprise. One leaned over and praised my choices. It was a delightful, if slightly odd scenario, and those pickles were so perfect I&apos;ve dreamed of them since. Turnip greens (the leafy tops of turnips) have fallen out of favour, perhaps because turnips in general aren&apos;t revered \u2013 in the shops they&apos;re often too big and bitter. Turnips should be no bigger than a tennis ball, but are much better golf ball-sized, when they&apos;re sweet and nutty. Anyhow I&apos;m not here to defend the root, I want to talk tops. There are many ways to eat this green: Italian-style, lightly boiled, rinsed, wrung and dressed in olive oil and garlic; south American-style with bacon, sausage or ham and Cajun seasoning; southern Indian-style in a poriyal (a fried vegetable dish); northern Spanish-style with potatoes, sweet paprika and a touch of red-wine vinegar; or fermented, Asian-style, as pickles. Turnip tops appear in many cuisines for good reason: they fill a very hungry gap. A turnip sown now will give you plenty of leaves from January to March. You can sow for another two weeks without cover, but come mid-October you may need to cloche. For autumn, sow main-crop varieties such as Green Top Stone or Green Globe, and in late winter sow early varieties such as Snowball (pictured), Purple Top Milan or the Japanese Tokyo Cross or Tokyo Top (when young, those last two are sweet enough to be eaten raw in salads). Autumn soils are warm and wet, so germination is quick. Broadcast in broad drills or singularly in lines about 10cm apart. Protect from slugs\u00a0and cover with enviromesh to\u00a0keep flea beetles at bay. The best leaves are the youngest, so start harvesting from around 10cm high. If you wait much longer, they become tough (these can be used for pickling). Turnips are pretty hardy, but covering with cloches will keep the leaves tender. If you pick early, they will resprout numerous times before running to seed in spring. You have two choices when this happens: you can eat them much like a stronger broccoli raab (or cime di rapa) just before they come into flower, or dig them in as\u00a0a\u00a0green manure. Alys on penstemons Penstemons make excellent cut flowers. I favour the deep dark colour versions such as the sinister &apos;Raven&apos; (blackish purple) or &apos;Sour Grapes&apos; (deep purple with a greyish blue base and throat) with lots of &apos;Blackbird&apos; (deep purple) and &apos;Port Wine&apos; (red-purple). Penstemons flower from midsummer, and can keep going into early autumn. They&apos;re not completely hardy, and a winter like the last one will have smashed many to ground, except perhaps the hardiest, &apos;Garnet&apos;. Leave the foliage on until April as buffer against the weather. If you become seduced at the garden centre, keep them somewhere protected this winter and plant out in spring. Take semi-ripe stem-tip cuttings from non-flowering shoots. The stems should be soft and the base should be starting to ripen. The cutting should bend without snapping. Take cuttings 5-10cm long, trim each just below a set of leaves and remove the lowest leaves (perhaps two sets) so there is sufficient length to plunge into good quality seed-and-cutting compost. Put the cuttings somewhere around 15C and they&apos;ll root in two weeks. Pot up in free-draining compost and protect from\u00a0frost.."}, {"sentences": ["Following an American loser through the sleazy side of Tokyo, mostly after his death, it&apos;s a long, miserable tale, but the execution is amazing."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T23:06:08Z", "title": "This week's new films", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/25/this-weeks-new-films", "article": "Enter The Void (18) (Gaspar No\u00e9, 2009, Fra/Ger/Ita) Nathaniel Brown, Paz de la Huerta, Cyril Roy. 143 mins No\u00e9 adjusts your set from the inside with a film so hallucinogenic you might need to check into rehab afterwards.

At the end of his stay, the penniless Spiers enlisted a fellow athlete to help him build a man-sized wooden box, in which he then air-freighted himself back to Australia. Hunkered inside his crate, Spiers duly made it to Perth, despite having almost dehydrated on the runway during a stopover in Bombay. It is interesting to contrast the heroic \u2013 albeit borderline delusional \u2013 gumption of Spiers with Phillips Idowu&apos;s announcement this week that he would not be travelling to the Delhi Commonwealth Games in the wake of complaints about the athletes&apos; village and the collapse of a stadium footbridge.\u00a0&quot;I cannot take any risk whatsoever, no matter how small,&quot; Idowu declared on Twitter, presumably while being winched slowly from his lead-lined sleep chamber by hired ninja guards and strapped into his padded high chair for a breakfast of pre\u2011masticated custard. There are a number of conclusions you may draw from this. The first is that Idowu, in common with a number of similarly minded team-mates, believes there is a genuine chance he will be hit by a collapsing item of city infrastructure while competing in the triple jump. It may be useful to point out here that of all human beings Idowu is perhaps best placed to avoid this hazard, his hopping, skipping and jumping capabilities being ideally suited to escaping falling debris in a track and field scenario. At the same time this may also be a useful safety measure in future: how likely is Idowu to be hit by a falling bridge at this event? Is he only likely to be hit by a bridge for a short period? Or is he likely to be hit by a bridge throughout the early rounds and later stages of competition? If Idowu really did have to be hit by a bridge, I would suggest the best moment for this might be while he stands paused at the end of his run-up, pouting majestically beneath his headband, chest puffed, conducting the crowd, silken shorts hitched thrillingly high, primed for the terribly serious \u2013 the non-negotiable \u2013 business of his sprint and spring. Another conclusion you may draw is that our top-level athletes, many of whom are now effectively boycotting Delhi, are perhaps being a little precious. Supporting Idowu&apos;s stance on the radio the former runner Iwan Thomas intoned gravely: &quot;As an athlete you&apos;re there to do a job and you can&apos;t have any distractions no matter how small.&quot; Really? No distractions at all? Currently I am writing this while being distracted by flu, the pressing question of Chris Tremlett&apos;s precise bowling average, a morose conviction of the basic futility of all human acts and the urge to eat a packet of Skips. Unlike Idowu, though, I soldier on. But we should not condemn, even as Delhi is being condemned for its incompetence and poverty. Stars of track and field are beautiful people with fast-twitch muscle fibres and lovely clear complexions, but they also exist by necessity in a bubble of ascetic absorption. Their lives are a blend of agonising exertion and downtime pampering. They don&apos;t generally travel to broaden the mind, or take gap years or spend four months wearing the same student-issue stripy cotton trousers and living in a beach hut so lowly even the rats are hunch-backed. Photos of grime-encrusted bathroom fittings in the athletes&apos; village \u2013 where, no doubt, the on-site construction workers are currently billeted \u2013 will have troubled these citizens of the international chain-hotel circuit. Plus New Delhi can be a frightening place. I went there last year to watch the Indian Premier League. Outside the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium overhead power lines held up with string brush your shoulders. Crowds swarm inanely. Things break. Taking a very small degree of personal risk, un-Idowu-like, I somehow soldiered through it all, alongside the 18 million other people who happen to live there all the time. There is no doubt the Games have been mismanaged and that India feels duly chastened and humiliated. As a nation it does have plenty to apologise for: those terrible middle-aged hammy male Bollywood stars with their gnarly sunglassed gangster faces; the new moneyed generation of Prada-class goons. But it seems a little sad that India is being forced to apologise for its poverty and its vast, insoluble muddle. It is also sad that our own response may yet be to turn away, as Idowu already has. Instead it would be nice to regain some sense of sport \u2013 and in particular these, the Friendly Games \u2013 as an arm of international relations, an opportunity for personal gain that also comes with obligations. There will be grime. A ceiling or two may collapse. But there is something to be said for simply getting out there and getting on with it.

Here, beneath arching lighting rigs and the hypnotic flickering of monitors, amid thundering music and bellowing megaphones, the game is all about making yourself heard. Understandably, on the eve of the release of their Kinect controller-free motion sensor system for Xbox 360 (out 10 November), Microsoft were keenest to take centre stage, presenting the keynote address. Celebrating the scale of the industry \u2013 Halo: Reach took $200m on launch day \u2013 the manufacturer was intent on proving a commitment to Kinect that has similar targets in mind. Five exclusives were revealed as coming to the platform. Firstly, Killer7 creator Suda 51&apos;s involvement with codename D, placing gamers controller-free in an evil amusement park, then more horror from Sega&apos;s Rise of Nightmares \u2013 both expanding on the genres on offer for Kinect. Haunt was a light-hearted take on the same, while the flying-stood-atop-enormous-dragons of Project Draco will be embraced by fans of Panzer Dragoon. There was also a welcome return for an original Xbox title in Steel Battalion: Heavy Armour \u2013 the original, a mech-battler with a huge, multi-buttoned joystick add-on, upgraded in the sequel for full body control \u2013 an example of one direction the new hardware may take. Aimed at core gamers, the trailer nailed its target audience \u2013 D-Day, on Manhattan island, set in the future. With mechs. Other standouts included a demo of the disarmingly accurate swordplay coming in Metal Gear Solid: Rising and, for Kinect, the spectacular colours and soundscapes of the shooter you &quot;conduct&quot; to play, Child of Eden, while, for old-school fans of the same genre but with classic controls, Radiant Silvergun is to be revived on Xbox Live Arcade. Microsoft are behind rivals Sony and Nintendo (the latter, oddly, do not usually attend their home show and did not this year) in Japan, but came out fighting here with Kinect, and it may be working: Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun reported, with not a little surprise, queues of an hour and a half for hands-on time with Kinect on a day the floor was open only to trade; they were even longer when the public entered. Electronic Arts also joined the fray, with highlights including Suda 51 showcasing his new title for them, Shadows of the Damned, a distinctive but apparently less-than-wholly-serious horror outing; an equally intriguing title for the 3DS, horticulture sim My Garden (tend plants to attract animals \u2013 not everyone&apos;s first guess for 3D) which will be a launch release for the console; and designer American McGee showcasing the sequel to his own Alice, Alice: Madness Returns, due out at the end of next year. Sony, unsurprisingly, were right behind their new controller Move, not least with forthcoming titles like Killzone 3 and LittleBigPlanet 2. They also whetted the appetite of racers in the form of dynamic weather during night racing in the long-awaited Gran Turismo 5 (out 3 November) that looked stunning. 3D demos of the same game were hugely popular \u2013 driving games may benefit from the technology more than most. Real excitement ensued when Sony confirmed that Team Ico&apos;s The Last Guardian will be out at the end of next year and showed more impressive footage \u2013 judging by fans&apos; reactions, it will feel like a long wait. There was also a big buzz as Capcom joined the manufacturer to announce a &quot;dark, more brutal&quot; instalment of the Devil May Cry series. Elsewhere, the team behind Demon&apos;s Souls previewed its spiritual successor with action role-player Project Dark. Capcom&apos;s fighter Marvel vs Capcom 3, which will feature Resident Evil villain Albert Wesker, drew big crowds. Sega revealed a lurch in a new direction for the Yakuza series from goons with guns to hitmen and huuurgh as Yakuza: Of the End pits players against zombies. Ubisoft trailed Michael Jackson: The Experience, no doubt destined for huge sales, and although the most exciting versions for Kinect and Move are only out next year, the DS iteration (out 23 November, along with Wii and PSP versions) plays very much like the marvellous Elite Beat Agents. Square Enix had fun with team-based shooter Gun Loco (360, out next year) in which interstellar criminals have at one another, and offered an enjoyable, frenetic romp. Finally, there was no better place than Tokyo to sample Level 5&apos;s take on animation giants Studio Ghibli&apos;s style in the PS3 version of RPG Ni no Kuni (out next year); featuring beautifully rendered cel-shading, with breathtaking character animation, its evocative, quiet charm amid the pandemonium was a show stealer. Eurogamer ExpoEarls Court, London SW5,1-3 Oct Fortunately for UK gamers some of the titles on show in Tokyo will not remain distant promises delivered some 6,000 miles away but are on offer to view and, most importantly play at the Eurogamer Expo. Part of the London Games festival, a month-long celebration of the industry throughout the capital, the show, organised by independent website Eurogamer, will be offering hands-and-full-body-on with Kinect and other major games from Japan such as Gran Turismo 5, LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3correct, as well as some of the biggest forthcoming releases. Playable titles include: the big football face-off of Fifa 11 and Pro Evo 2011, Gears of War 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fable III, the new Medal of Honor, Assassin&apos;s Creed: Brotherhood, Crysis 2, the throwing shapes and spinning discs of Just Dance 2 and Def Jam Rapstar, Dead Space 2, Vanquish and the Andy &quot;Gollum&quot; Serkis-voiced Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Interestingly, given the increase in numbers of young people who now want to work in gaming, it&apos;s good to see the show (unusually for a games event) also featuring a careers fair offering advice and information for anyone seeking a future in the industry. Professionals from Sega, Microsoft&apos;s Rare studio, Sports Interactive, Crytek and Creative Assembly, alongside representatives from universities and colleges will be on hand to help guide budding young talent towards putting all those hours of joypad bashing to good use.

There have been so many scandals of late: MPs&apos; expenses, tabloid phone hackery, the revelation that X Factor producers digitally enhance the singing voices of their favourite auditionees. So I feel it is only right that, in the interests of journalistic objectivity, I declare that I have been given a pot of Tess Daly Beauty Body Glow moisturiser. &quot;It&apos;s a really lovely consistency,&quot; says Daly when, halfway through the interview, she hands over a bright pink cardboard box emblazoned with a photograph of her face. &quot;Smells fab and gives your skin an amazing shimmer.&quot; Just like her moisturiser, Daly herself is extremely shimmery in person: a glittering confection of glossy hair, highlighted cheekbones and golden-brown skin. When she arrives at the north London studio for her interview and photo-shoot, she is so clean and shiny it is as though she has been freshly dipped in varnish. Even her high-heeled shoes are a gleaming patent leather. &quot;No, don&apos;t look at me!&quot; she cries in mock horror. &quot;I&apos;ve been up since three. I look terrible.&quot; She doesn&apos;t, of course. At 41, the Strictly Come Dancing presenter still looks at least a decade younger: endless legs, plumped-up lips and a slim physique. But what she does look, despite all that shimmer and sparkle, is unavoidably sad. It is hard to pinpoint this sadness. It is not that she is uncommunicative \u2013 far from it. In fact, she talks so rapidly that when I eventually type up the quotes from the hour-long interview, it transpires she has said more than 7,000 words (which works out at an astonishing 116 per minute). Nor is she unsmiling \u2013 as a former model and someone trained in the arts of televisual light entertainment, Daly is accustomed to deploying a warm-hearted grin at precisely the right moment. It is more that her smile never quite reaches her eyes, as if an invisible autocue is prompting her to do it, and there is an underlying weariness to her voice that only seems to dissipate when she is talking about her two daughters, six-year-old Phoebe and Amber, 15 months. In fact, she informs me almost as soon as she sits down, Amber was up in the early hours and Daly has hardly slept. &quot;So, yeah, slightly red-eyed today. I apologise for that.&quot; Perhaps the weariness is simply the exhaustion of a full-time mother \u2013 Daly and her husband, the TV presenter and Radio\u00a01 DJ Vernon Kay, do not employ a nanny at their Buckinghamshire home. (&quot;I just don&apos;t want to hand over responsibility for my kids to somebody else,&quot; she says. &quot;Doesn&apos;t matter how good they are.&quot;) But perhaps it is also a consequence of a bruising few months. In February, Kay admitted sending a series of flirtatious text and Twitter messages to a page-three model he met in a Bolton nightclub. Although physical infidelity was flatly denied, the disclosures came as a shock to Daly, who was just about to publish a pregnancy book and who had, for seven years, seemingly enjoyed one of the most solid marriages in the public eye. Ever the professional, Daly has soldiered on: the marriage is still intact, the couple have &quot;worked through&quot; their issues and she is looking forward to fronting a new series of Strictly Come Dancing, the hit BBC1 show that teams celebrities with professional dancers and then subjects them to the withering scrutiny of four judges. Daly&apos;s role in the show is to act as Bruce Forsyth&apos;s willing sidekick in a dazzling array of sequined taffeta and also to interview the celebrities backstage as they wait for their scores. &quot;I do genuinely give a damn about how the contestants do,&quot; says Daly. &quot;Without sounding twee, I do care about them because I see them petrified in the morning, sitting in make-up, mute and waiting to get it over with. They&apos;ve slogged their guts out most of the time. You get to know them and their families and you see pictures of their kids and they meet your kids. Yeah, you end up rooting for them.&quot; Has she ever come across a contestant she couldn&apos;t stand? &quot;Well, there have been a few egos,&quot; she concedes, &quot;a few door-slammings in the producers&apos; faces and that just doesn&apos;t work \u2013 it upsets the balance, because at the end of the day the more the group of celebrities get along, the better time they have of it. A lot of them make friendships that endure years later.&quot; Last year, Strictly Come Dancing found itself at the centre of an ageism row after producers replaced the judge Arlene Phillips, then 66, with Alesha Dixon, a 30-year-old former winner with no professional experience. The decision attracted a stinging rebuke from the then equalities minister Harriet Harman. How was it for Daly turning 40 in an industry that reveres youthfulness? &quot;I&apos;ve just got to deal with it,&quot; she says, sipping from a mug of tea. &quot;I can&apos;t obsess, I can&apos;t become somebody who grows old disgracefully, I&apos;m not one of those people that tries to pin back the hands of time.&quot; Has she ever encountered ageism or sexism? &quot;Erm, not yet, but there&apos;s still time. Ask me in a few years.&quot; She gives a dry little laugh. &quot;Obvious sexism? No, I haven&apos;t. I mean, obviously, this is a business that favours men as hosts without a doubt and they&apos;re often paid more for the same job so I guess you could call that sexism but, personally, I haven&apos;t come across it yet. Nothing that&apos;s damaged me or left a lasting impression. I&apos;m the sort of person that just believes in getting on and making the most of the opportunity you&apos;ve been given, you know: buckle down, work hard and hopefully you&apos;ll prove your worth. I&apos;ve been working ever since I was 17 years old.&quot; All of which is very admirable, but hasn&apos;t she ever stopped to consider why men in the industry are paid more for doing the same job? &quot;I&apos;ve no idea, it&apos;s just a fact,&quot; she continues, breezily. &quot;I&apos;m not complaining about that, I&apos;m not making myself a martyr.&quot; Clearly, she does not like the thought of whinging rather than just getting on with things. On several occasions, Daly mentions the fact that she has been working since she was 17 and one gets the impression that, as a result, her identity is irreversibly intertwined with her job and how well she feels she is doing it. She has recently branched out, developing her own line of beauty products that has rapidly become a multi-million pound business but, beneath it all, one gets the sense that she does not truly feel that television presenting counts as proper work \u2013 or at least, the hard graft her parents endured. Daly was born in Stockport, the eldest of two girls. Her father, Vivian, worked in a wallpaper factory mixing dyes and her mother, Sylvia, did shifts in a paper mill alongside other jobs to keep the family financially stable. &quot;They worked hard,&quot; she says. &quot;They never complained. It seemed their mission in life was to provide for their kids and make us happy. It&apos;s only when you become a parent yourself you realise just how selfless that is. Their whole lives were geared just towards looking after us. &quot;My mum and dad considered a good job either nursing or working at a bank because, then, a job at a bank was for life and you had an interest-free mortgage and a pension. My mum thought that was the perfect job and tried to persuade me.&quot; In spite of having taken her O-level maths a year early, Daly knew that the bank was not for her. Instead, she was scouted by a model agent outside McDonald&apos;s in Manchester who swiftly dispatched her to Tokyo as soon as she turned 18. Daly, who had only been out of the country once before, suddenly found herself on the other side of the world, friendless, in a place where she could not even understand the road signs or read a menu. &quot;Initially I was terrified\u2026 I could barely speak to anyone from home without crying and having to keep the tears from my voice because you didn&apos;t want them to worry about you. Yeah, it was tough. [I was] penniless as well and then I started to work a little bit and I really enjoyed it. Had to go through the pain barrier though.&quot; She ended up learning a bit of Japanese. When I ask if she remembers any of it, she nods and says something like: &quot;Skalam ska dishda,&quot; which apparently means, &quot;Nice doing business with you,&quot; though she could quite possibly be saying, &quot;A tuna sashimi wrap, thank you.&quot; Still, it sounds good. In fact, Daly turns out to be full of such hidden depths. When, in a roundabout way, we start talking about inheritance tax, she turns out to have outspoken opinions on the matter. &quot;It&apos;s disgraceful. It&apos;s effectively triple taxation because you&apos;ve paid tax on your earnings, you then buy a property, you pay stamp duty for the privilege of buying it, and then you pay for it for 25 years; you want to pass it on to your kids, but you can&apos;t because they have to sell it immediately to pay 40% death duty. To pay taxes on a property that&apos;s been paid for with money that&apos;s been taxed!&quot; Blimey! Does she consider herself political? &quot;No, not really but there are things that I do feel quite strongly about and that is one of them.&quot; From Tokyo, Daly went to New York, where a friend who organised red-carpet events asked her to try her hand at interviewing celebrities. Daly went out and bought a video camera and then, in search of suitable subjects, decided on a whim to call up Quentin Crisp, the author of The Naked Civil Servant was then living on the Lower East Side and listed his number in the phone book. Crisp agreed to be interviewed over lunch. &quot;I loved him,&quot; says Daly. &quot;Amazing guy. So intelligent and had been through so much.&quot; The interview with Crisp ended up on a showreel that Daly sent off to the producers of The Big Breakfast, who offered her a regular slot hosting a model competition. Daly bought a plane ticket back to the UK (&quot;It cost me a fortune!&quot;) and from there her TV career took off. Since then she has presented shows including Singled Out, SMTV Live, Make Me a Supermodel and is now into the eighth series of Strictly Come Dancing, which she describes as her &quot;dream job&quot;. Daly&apos;s father never got to see her on Strictly \u2013 he died of emphysema in 2003, just 18 days after he had walked her down the aisle. Daly was on honeymoon when she got the news. &quot;Honestly it was so difficult,&quot; she says now. &quot;I miss him terribly because he was just such a strong role model in my life. The man by whom I judged all others, really, because he was such an honourable and moral person who would never harm another being. Just a positive, outgoing\u2026 a great guy really and a brilliant father and I do really wish he could have met his grandchildren. That&apos;s my greatest regret, that he never met his grandchildren.&quot; Her voice softens to a cracked whisper. &quot;Oh don&apos;t! I&apos;ll cry.&quot; She sniffs and looks away, embarrassed. &quot;It doesn&apos;t get easier. You learn to live with it as a fact of life.&quot; Her parents had been married for much of their adult lives. Having grown up with such a strong idea of what marriage should be, has Daly&apos;s faith in the institution been shaken by her husband&apos;s indiscretions? She looks at me blankly. &quot;Erm, yeah, well, growing up with a mum and dad who were married for life, you do go into marriage with that expectation \u2013 be it naive because times have changed. But, personally, I would not get married unless I thought, &apos;This is it. We are in it for the long term,&apos; because otherwise there would be no point, you might as well date. So I have gone into marriage with that expectation, but also with high standards. When you&apos;ve lived alongside it, that&apos;s what you expect. &quot;So, yeah, it has, of course, been a difficult year and of course it shakes the foundations of what you believe in, but you learn from it. We were able to move on because we both want the same things \u2013 we want a loving family together. &quot;It&apos;s not easy when people are asking you all the time and you&apos;re trying to deal with something that is so acutely personal. It&apos;s really daunting when people ask you \u2013 people you don&apos;t know, in an interview situation \u2013 because you&apos;re dealing with it at home as best you can and actually we have moved on and things are good. And, being realistic, things will happen and it&apos;s whether or not you can move on from it and so\u2026&quot; She trails off and then nods her head firmly. &quot;We&apos;ve moved on and things are good.&quot; But although I do not doubt her sincerity, I am not totally convinced. Interestingly, when Daly talks about the couple&apos;s children, she unwittingly lapses into the first person \u2013 it is always: &quot;I haven&apos;t got a nanny,&quot; or &quot;I&apos;m looking at nursery as an option,&quot; and never &quot;we&quot;. At one point she refers (albeit jokingly) to her husband as &quot;my night nanny&quot; and I am left with the impression that she is the one who keeps family life on track. Kay is five years younger than his wife and perhaps he is happy to let her assume responsibility, but it must be exhausting trying to keep on top of everything. Is being in control important to her? Daly looks surprised. &quot;In what way?&quot; In the sense that you like to have things planned. &quot;Well, you have to plan your childcare,&quot; she replies. &quot;It&apos;s weird, I spent my adult years rebelling against routine but then, as a parent, kids demand routine, they need it, it makes them feel secure\u2026 So being in control? Nnn\u2026 I try to be organised. Being in control is a bit too strong.&quot; Our allotted hour is drawing to a close and Daly has to go downstairs to have her photograph taken. As she gets up from the sofa, her shoulders visibly relax, her face lightens and she seems relieved the talking part is over. After all, she knows how to pose and smile and sparkle in front of a camera. It is just that I am not sure what happens to her when, out of the spotlight, the shimmer wears off.

The gas is methane hydrate, a sherbet-like substance consisting of methane trapped in water ice \u2013 sometimes called &quot;fire ice&quot; or MH \u2013 that is locked deep underwater or under permafrost by the cold and under pressure 23 times that of normal atmosphere. A consortium led by the Japanese government and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (Jogmec) will be sinking several wells off the south-eastern coast of Japan to assess the commercial viability of extracting gas from frozen methane deep beneath local waters. Surveys suggest Japan has enough methane hydrate for 100 years at the current rate of usage. Lying hundreds of metres below the sea and deeper still below sediments, fire ice is exceedingly difficult to extract. Japan is claiming successful tests using a method that gently depressurises the frozen gas. Tokyo plans to start commercial output of methane hydrates by 2018. At present, Japan imports nearly all its gas \u2013 about 58.6m tonnes of liquified gas annually \u2013 and is heavily dependent on oil imports. In a desperate attempt to secure more oil, for example, Japan recently did a deal with the United Arab Emirates. In exchange for using Japan as a base for Asian oil trading, Japan now has priority to purchase rights to up to 4m barrels of immediately accessible crude. Lucia van Geuns, an energy analyst at the international energy programme of the Clingendael Institute, said: &quot;Methane hydrates could make Japan energy independent. Japan put a lot of R&amp;D into this project because of course the less energy it imports the better. Whether they can commercialise methane hydrates remains to be seen. &quot;If it does succeed, and that&apos;s very much a long shot, it will have a huge impact \u2013 equivalent to the use of gas shales in the US.&quot; Japan&apos;s trade ministry, which is behind the scheme, has requested a budget of \u00a58.9bn (\u00a3667m) for the drilling to start next spring. The huge budget reflects the difficulties of drilling deep offshore. In Japan, hydrates in the Sea of Kumano are found about 30km offshore in about 100 metres of water and at a depth below the seabed of 200 metres, making it difficult to mine the unstable hydrates. Concerns had been raised that digging for frozen methane would destabilise the methane beds, which contain enough gas worldwide to snuff out most complex life on earth. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas which is 21 times as damaging as carbon dioxide and any leakage from wells could be an environmental problem. Professor Gerald Dickens, of Rice University in Texas,a leading researcher into methane hydrates, thinks accidental releases can be avoided.&quot;The only potential issue in regards to drilling would be if there is greatly over-pressured gas immediately beneath the gas hydrate. However, there is growing belief and rationale to suggest that this cannot occur in nature. So, as far as drilling there should be no issue.&quot; Environmentalists, however, are concernedabout the burning of more earth-locked hydrocarbons. Methane may be a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil but will still release many tons of CO2. Jogmec acknowledges the problems, admitting mining of methane ice could lead to landslides and the devastation of marine life in the mining areas. &quot;There are many other technological problems to overcome,&quot; says the Jogmec website. &quot;Not least that when you drill you create heat, which turns the frozen methane into gas, which could then leak uncontrollably through the sea to our atmosphere.&quot; The US, China, Canada and South Korea are among other countries seeking to develop commercially viable extraction technology and each is now exploring the mining of methane hydrates from their own sea beds. &quot;Some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025,&quot; says a US government report on the subject."}, {"sentences": ["While Zhan returned to China to a hero&apos;s welcome on Saturday, the latest round of claims and counterclaims suggest the most damaging row between Tokyo and Beijing for years is far from over."], "tags": ["Japan", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-27T14:12:04Z", "title": "Japan demands China pay to repair damage to coastguard vessels", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/27/japan-china-fishing-boat-row", "article": "Japan demanded today that China pay for repairs to coastguard vessels damaged in a recent collision with a Chinese trawler, a day after it rejected Beijing&apos;s request to apologise and pay compensation for detaining the fishing boat&apos;s captain. Japan had hoped to draw a line under the debacle, and to begin repairing Sino-Japanese relations, by releasing the trawler&apos;s captain, Zhan Qixiong, from custody late last week on the southern island of Okinawa. While Zhan returned to China to a hero&apos;s welcome on Saturday, the latest round of claims and counterclaims suggest the most damaging row between Tokyo and Beijing for years is far from over. Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshito Sengoku, said Beijing had been asked to pay for the damage to the two vessels. &quot;Naturally, we will be asking for the boats to be returned to their original condition,&quot; he said. He said the onus was on China to ease tensions in the relationship between the two countries, which is at its lowest point in years: &quot;At this point, the ball is now in China&apos;s court.&quot; Zhan was arrested on 8 September, a day after his ship collided with two Japanese patrol boats near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea which are claimed by both countries. The islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, are surrounded by fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and natural gas deposits. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Naoto Kan, yesterday dismissed Chinese requests for compensation and an apology over the arrest. &quot;Senkaku is a Japanese territory,&quot; he said. &quot;From that point of view, an apology or compensation is unthinkable. I have no intention at all of meeting the demand.&quot; But he added: &quot;Both sides should first become calm and deepen mutually beneficial strategic ties. What is necessary is for both to cool down and keep in mind the bigger picture.&quot; Zhan&apos;s detention prompted China to suspend high-level contacts and call off talks on joint undersea gas exploration in disputed waters. Chinese commentators unleashed a stream of nationalist invective on the internet while travel agencies cancelled package tours to Japan. In addition, trading company officials believe that China last week imposed a de facto ban on exports to Japan of rare metals used in a range of hi-tech products. Prof Feng Zhaokui, of the Japan Research Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, blamed Japan for triggering the row by detaining the trawler and its crew rather than pursuing its usual policy of chasing boats out of the area. &quot;Releasing the captain was Japan&apos;s first step towards correcting its wrongdoing, but it is not clear how this will develop,&quot; he said. &quot;Neither side is ever going to apologise or compensate. Maybe it will just be left like this, unsolved. But that is OK, because the Diaoyu issue has been there for a long time and Japan and China did not end their relations because of it.&quot; Dr Shogo Suzuki, an expert on Sino-Japanese relations at the University of Manchester, said Japan could emerge the diplomatic victor, despite accusations it had caved in to pressure from Beijing. &quot;Predictably, conservative elements have seen Kan as being too weak. But I think China has paid an enormously high price for one fisherman,&quot; he said. &quot;It has worsened China and Japan&apos;s relations, which were on the mend, it has brought Japan much closer to America again, and other countries \u2013 such as Korea \u2013 have been watching this closely and getting alarmed at how belligerent China can be over territorial issues. China&apos;s attempts to be seen as a benign rising power have been tarnished.&quot; The decision not to prosecute Zhan has drawn criticism from Japanese conservatives. A dozen parliamentarians from the governing Democratic party of Japan issued a statement today criticising Zhan&apos;s release and calling for troops to be stationed on the Senkakus. Nobuteru Ishihara, secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, accused the government of engaging in &quot;tone-deaf diplomacy&quot;. In Beijing the People&apos;s Daily, the communist party paper, accused Japanese politicians of exaggerating the threat posed by China in the wake of the collision. &quot;On issues of sovereignty and territorial unity and integrity, China&apos;s stance is unyielding and there can be no concessions or compromise,&quot; it said. &quot;Japan&apos;s development and prosperity cannot be divorced from China&apos;s development and prosperity, and Japan cannot afford the price of continued contention with China.&quot; Japan has also called for the immediate release of four employees of a construction firm held in China&apos;s Hebei province since last Monday for allegedly filming a military installation. Their employer, Fujita Corporation, said the men were in the area preparing a bid for a project to dispose of chemical weapons abandoned in China by the Japanese military at the end of the second world war.

In the context of recent debates about the &quot;double genocide&quot; thesis in eastern Europe, Snyder&apos;s approach has a particular relevancy to contemporary concerns. Here, he outlines the general theme of his new book, Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. Two response articles will follow this week. It is confoundingly hard to remember that the second world war began with an alliance between Hitler and Stalin. In August 1939, Berlin and Moscow signed a non-aggression pact, including a secret protocol in which they divided the lands between Germany and the USSR into spheres of influence. The next month, the Wehrmacht and the Red Army both invaded Poland, met at a demarcation line, and arranged a joint victory parade. Seventy-one years ago today, on 28 September 1939, the Polish campaign complete, the two powers signed a treaty on borders and friendship, finalising their division of Poland and providing for future economic cooperation. We cannot, of course, know what would have happened had Stalin refused Hitler&apos;s overtures and declined to enable Hitler&apos;s empire in summer 1939. What we do know is that the worst war in history, with its battles and atrocities, with its starvation and its Holocaust, began this way and not another. In summer 1939, Hitler wanted a war, and Stalin wanted a truce. Stalin&apos;s great fear in the 1930s was encirclement by a coalition of Germany, Poland, and Japan. This led him to have more than 100,000 Soviet citizens, most of them members of the Polish national minority, shot on false charges of espionage for Poland in 1937 and 1938. This was the greatest campaign of ethnic executions in the Europe of the 1930s. When Warsaw resisted Hitler&apos;s demands for Polish territory in spring and summer 1939, Stalin saw an opportunity to resolve his Polish problem entirely. The rapprochement with Germany not only led to the elimination of Poland as a state, it also drove Japan and Germany apart. Tokyo saw itself supplanted by Moscow as Hitler&apos;s closest ally. The spectre of encirclement dissolved. Thus the Nazi-Soviet alliance of 1939 might seem to have been a brilliant stroke by Stalin. But in his crafty diplomacy, he underestimated the most obvious threat: the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which followed in June 1941. In the meantime, the Soviet Union supplied Nazi Germany with grain and oil as the Wehrmacht invaded Denmark, Norway, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Soviet supplies made it impossible for the Royal Navy to effectively blockade Germany during the Battle of Britain. The Red Army also moved west, invading Finland, occupying part of Romania, and annexing the three Baltic States. Between 1939 and 1941, as they jointly occupied Poland, Moscow and Berlin each sought to destroy its national elites. Despite differences in ideology, the Nazis and Soviets followed strikingly similar policies in Poland. The Soviets deported about 400,000 Polish citizens to Kazakhstan and Siberia, the Germans a similar number to make room for German farmers. Together, the two powers executed tens of thousands of Polish civilians, many of them educated people. The demographic profiling was similar enough that, in some cases, the Germans murdered one sibling and the Soviets another. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Stalin reversed alliances, beginning the history that is most comfortable to remember in Russia, Britain and the United States: of the common struggle against Hitler. But for the lands and people between Berlin and Moscow, the change in alliances meant the accumulation of horrific and destructive power. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany as allies were destructive enough; Nazi Germany at war with the Soviet Union was more destructive still. The region of Europe most touched by the war was triply-occupied eastern Poland: first, by the Soviets; then, by the Germans; then, by the Soviets again. It was here that the Soviet NKVD made more arrests than in the entire remainder of the Soviet Union in 1940, and here where the Holocaust began in 1941. Entering the lands that they had conceded to Stalin in 1939, the Germans used NKVD crimes as a propaganda justification for the bloody massacres of Jews in summer 1941, in which Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles and others took part. The Germans killed a million Jews east of the line established by the treaty on borders of friendship. Then, they turned their attention to the Jews of Poland and Europe. Because the war began the way it did, its end could not bring closure. Jews could not help but see the return of Soviet power as a liberation. Soviet policy was not especially friendly to Jews, but it was obviously better than a Holocaust. For many others \u2013 above all, Poles and Balts \u2013 the return of Soviet power at war&apos;s end could hardly seem like liberation, since the war itself had begun with a Soviet invasion. A second line of division in memory lay between east and west. In western Europe, occupation meant German occupation, real or threatened. In eastern Europe, it meant double or triple occupation by both the Germans and the Soviets. The major atrocities of both Nazis and Stalinists were committed in the lands between; occupation by both Germany and the Soviet Union was worse than occupation by Germany alone. These divisions in memory, between Jews and non-Jews, and between east and west, are reinforced each May, as we commemorate the war&apos;s end. Overcoming them requires that we recall that war began, one September, with friendship between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. \u2022 Read Efraim Zuroff&apos;s response here"}, {"sentences": ["Rudkin had to fight in front of Harada&apos;s fans in his home city of Tokyo and lost on a unanimous 15-round points decision, even though some observers believed Rudkin had done enough to win."], "tags": ["Boxing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-28T18:16:00Z", "title": "Alan Rudkin obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/28/alan-rudkin-obituary", "article": "It was the misfortune of the boxer Alan Rudkin, who has died aged 68 after collapsing in the street, that his unsuccessful bid to become world bantamweight champion pitted him against three of the outstanding fighters of the 1960s. Undoubtedly one of the finest that Britain has ever produced in his division, he would probably have reached the peak of his profession in any other era. He was a Merseyside sporting hero \u2013 an inspiration to other fighters such as his fellow Liverpudlian John Conteh, a light heavyweight who went on to become world champion and one of the best British boxers of all time. &quot;Alan was a great boxer, a real all-rounder,&quot; said Conteh. &quot;He could punch, but was a great strategist who was also incredibly courageous. He could take a punch and had great endurance, which came from all his hard work in training.&quot; With his mop of sandy hair and all-action style, Rudkin was a familiar and popular figure with television fight audiences. He brought his 10-year professional boxing career to an end in 1972 after winning an epic battle on points over 15 rounds against Johnny Clark. There was only half a point between them on the referee&apos;s scorecard, just a single round under the scoring system of the time, and ringsiders rated it as one of the finest fights of its time. Born in Llangollen, north Wales, after his pregnant mother had been evacuated from her south Liverpool home because of wartime air raids, Rudkin contracted polio as an infant and his family were warned by doctors that he might never walk. Nonetheless, by the age of four Rudkin was walking, and he developed an early affinity for sport, especially boxing. He became a talented amateur, sparring with \u2013 among others \u2013 the young Gerry Marsden, who went on to become the lead singer of Gerry and the Pacemakers and remained a lifelong friend. Marsden joked that the experience persuaded him to be a singer, while Rudkin was good enough to reach an ABA championship final, and box for his country. He had already garnered a considerable reputation by the time he turned professional in 1962, and his early potential was recognised when he was given the Young Boxer of the Year award by the British Boxing Writers association. Having won 18 of his first 19 professional bouts, he floored Johnny Caldwell in the 10th round at the Nottingham Ice Rink in March 1965 to take the British and Commonwealth bantamweight titles. Perhaps Rudkin&apos;s first challenge for the world title against the exceptional Japanese champion Masahiko &quot;Fighting&quot; Harada later in 1965 came too soon, but Rudkin was hungry for success and eager to seize any chance that came his way. Rudkin had to fight in front of Harada&apos;s fans in his home city of Tokyo and lost on a unanimous 15-round points decision, even though some observers believed Rudkin had done enough to win. Harada, perhaps relieved to have hung on to his title, described Rudkin as the fastest moving fighter he had ever met: &quot;Hitting him was like trying to hit a fish in deep water.&quot; Rudkin lost his British and Commonwealth titles to his great rival Walter McGowan in 1966, which was no disgrace since the Scot had won the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight title earlier the same year, but gained his revenge by recapturing the titles in another titanic struggle at the King&apos;s Hall in Belle Vue, Manchester, with the referee awarding it to Rudkin on points after 15 rounds. The win earned Rudkin his second world title shot in March 1969, against the Australian Lionel Rose, who had become the first Aboriginal to gain a world title when he won the WBC and World Boxing Association bantamweight championships the previous year. Again, Rudkin may have been the victim of a hometown decision, losing by a split points decision after 15 rounds at the Kooyong Tennis Stadium in Melbourne. But there were no grounds for complaint when Rudkin challenged the Mexican Rub\u00e9n Olivares after Olivares had beaten Rose to take the titles. Forced to fight in front of a Hispanic crowd at the Forum in Inglewood, California, in December 1969, Rudkin was floored once in the opening round and twice in the second. Rudkin won the European bantamweight title in February 1971, then lost it again in August. He bowed out of boxing six fights later with his win over Clark. Of his 50 fights he had lost only eight, and it is not an overstatement to say few British fighters have shown a greater intensity and will to win in a boxing ring. In retirement, Rudkin ran public houses in Liverpool with varying success. He was a subject of the television show This Is Your Life, and the then Liverpool football manager Bill Shankly was among those who paid tribute. He was a staunch supporter of all ex-boxers&apos; associations and had recently attended a reunion of those who had fought at the Shoreditch Town Hall in the East End of London. Rudkin had been working on his autobiography with the Liverpool Echo writer Nick Peet, who intends to complete it. He was divorced from his wife, Cathy. Of his two sons, he is survived by Timmy; Jeremy predeceased him. \u2022 Alan Rudkin, boxer, born 28 November 1941; died 22 September 2010"}, {"sentences": ["On October 10 \u2013 10.10.10 \u2013 the campaign will hold a Global Day of Doing, involving 180 nations and events such as sumo wrestlers cycling to training in Tokyo, to 10,000 schoolchildren planting trees across Russia."], "tags": ["10:10 climate change campaign", "Climate change", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2010-09-30T18:31:57Z", "title": "There will be blood \u2013 watch exclusive of 10:10 campaign's 'No Pressure' film", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/sep/30/10-10-no-pressure-film", "article": "Our friends at the 10:10 climate change campaign have given us the scoop on this highly explosive short film, written by Britain&apos;s top comedy screenwriter Richard Curtis, ahead of its general release.

They also turn out to be surprisingly good at blowing stuff up,&quot; he said.

Wilson met 10:10 activists on a cross-continent bike ride to the Copenhagen climate change summit last December. The 10:10 campaign was launched in the UK in September 2009 and has already spread to 41 countries. In Britain, 91,000 people, 3,500 businesses and 4,000 councils, school and other organisations have signed up so far.  The Lib-Con coalition has also committed to cut the government&apos;s carbon emissions by 10% in a year, to help combat global warming. On October 10 \u2013 10.10.10 \u2013 the campaign will hold a Global Day of Doing, involving 180 nations and events such as sumo wrestlers cycling to training in Tokyo, to 10,000 schoolchildren planting trees across Russia.

In 2010, though, it&apos;s hard to know what hip-hop&apos;s supposed to sound like. In the late-80s, artists as diverse as Eric B &amp; Rakim, Big Daddy Kane and Public Enemy sampled funk-soul brothers like James Brown, Bobby Byrd and the Meters, before 90s newcomers Gang Starr and A Tribe Called Quest brought jazz cats like Roy Ayers, Weather Report and Grover Washington Jr into the mix. Certain drum breaks became sonic staples (who didn&apos;t sample the Honey Drippers&apos; Impeach The President?), while regional tastes in beats \u2013 the sinewy, P-funk inspired grooves of Dr Dre and his West Coast compadres, for instance \u2013 ensured that hip-hop had variety without ever sacrificing that all-important nod factor. Recently, though, hip-hop seems to have stopped marching to its own beat. A few years back, hipster DJs took delight in mashing up rap vocals with alt-rock or dance beats. Now, rap&apos;s rising stars are cutting out the middle man and rhyming over these backdrops themselves, if they aren&apos;t already busy recording with the artists behind them. Kid Cudi has collaborated with MGMT, Ratatat, Best Coast and Vampire Weekend, while Philadelphia duo Chiddy Bang made liberal use of MGMT&apos;s Kids on their Opposite Of Adults track, taken from a debut album titled The Preview that also packs in samples from Passion Pit, Sufjan Stevens and Radiohead. Then there&apos;s BoB, partial to some (sampled) Vampire Weekend himself, and whose UK chart-topping Airplanes featured Paramore&apos;s Hayley Williams. Perhaps it had to happen. Pop, rock, R&amp;B and dance music have all lifted tics and tricks from hip-hop, whose own aesthetic boundaries have been pushed back from the inside by the experimentalist likes of OutKast and the Roots. Consequently, where hip-hop&apos;s hook-ups with other genres once seemed jarring (think the shotgun marriage of rock and rap acts on 1993&apos;s Judgment Night soundtrack), these days it&apos;s like hip-hop has overdosed on cider and black at the indie disco. Double-O, the producer half of Chicago hip-hop duo Kidz In The Hall, whose 2009 mixtape track The Grizzly Man cannily sampled Two Weeks by Jay-Z-approved psychedelicists Grizzly Bear, feels right at home in a genre-jumbling new world that&apos;s far removed from the aural apartheid of his pre-MP3 formative years. &apos;I think the energy we see in the indie rock world is as close as we&apos;ve seen in recent years to the early days of hip-hop&apos; Double-O, Kidz In The Hall     Double-O    &quot;When I was younger, you would get made fun of for being eclectic,&quot; he remembers. &quot;You could only listen to hip-hop, even if you secretly enjoyed Nirvana or Green Day. Groups like OutKast and producers like The RZA and Timbaland started early, sampling or working with Bj\u00f6rk, and I think once the fanbase saw that, they started to seek out those acts on the internet. Then, with the explosion of DJ culture and the mash-up going mainstream with the likes of Jay-Z and Linkin Park, it was inevitable that sampling would become more eclectic.&quot; One could argue that hip-hop&apos;s actually the genre benefitting most from this sonic free-for-all. Where the music once bristled with the outsider energy that rock sacrificed during its 1980s bad-hair decade, its Puffy-led commercial explosion in the 90s meant that, by the new millennium, hip-hop was the establishment. Fair enough, then, that rap&apos;s new breed might look to their tight-trousered counterparts in the reinvigorated indie scene for style pointers. &quot;I think the energy we see in the indie rock world is as close as we&apos;ve seen in recent years to the early days of hip-hop,&quot; says Double-O. &quot;And most of these indie rock guys have grown up with hip-hop as a part of their musical palate, so you hear the familiarity, whether it be drums or cultural references or even attitude. People are attracted to that, but then there&apos;s the other side that are simply followers. It&apos;s &apos;cool&apos; to be different.&quot; Still, whether you like this new, open-door approach to sampling or think that hip-hop \u2013 for so long the coolest kid at the party \u2013 must be in the midst of a mid-life crisis, one question prevails: is the art of beat-digging heading the way of the XXXL hoodies and oversized denim that today&apos;s hip-hop stars have ditched in favour of cardies and skinny jeans? In the 90s, producers like DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Buckwild and Diamond D routinely braved the deepest, darkest recesses of densely packed record shops in search of a jazz, funk or soul obscurity within whose dust-filled grooves might nestle six seconds of sampling pleasure. Architects of the era&apos;s boom-bap sound, they were also archaeologists (as crew names like Da Beatminerz and the aforementioned Diggin In The Crates&apos; made clear), but while these hip-hop Tony Robinsons would board flights to Tokyo in pursuit of vinyl, a browse of HMV&apos;s CD racks is the nearest some of today&apos;s beatsmiths will ever get to digging in the crates. &quot;I was in college when Napster was invented,&quot; recalls Double-O, whose catalogue with Kidz partner Naledge combines modern electronica with purist-pleasing soul and jazz samples, &quot;so I used that early on. I never really got my hands dirty. I certainly bought a few records, but not at the level those guys did. And initially I only made records from scratch. When I got my first Akai MPC, then I started sampling hard.&quot; &apos;The best thing is finding that magic and chopping it just the right way \u2026 The worst is when someone finds it before you and puts it out&apos; Double-O, Kidz In The Hall     Double-O    But while the newest knob-twiddlers are unlikely to be on first-name terms with staff at New York&apos;s Sound Library or know the thrill of beating Lord Finesse to a box of Cannonball Adderley LPs at a yard sale, many of them are students of their dusty fingered predecessors. Xaphoon, the board-bashing half of Chiddy Bang, cites Premier and the late J-Dilla as formative influences. Ageing hip-hop fans might sneer, but in an era when many producers have ditched costly-to-clear samples altogether, the fact that Chiddy Bang are sampling anything makes them hip-hop traditionalists of a sort. Besides, doesn&apos;t a craftily chopped MGMT sample make a change from the umpteenth use of Bob James&apos;s Nautilus? So has hip-hop abandoned or exhausted samples of a certain vintage entirely? Sure, Just Blaze might have reached no further than his Now 26 CD in gifting Eminem with a Haddaway sample, but Teflon Don, the latest album from big-selling Rick Ross, has Latin jazz maestros Caldera and 70s R&amp;B smoothies Enchantment joining hip-hop perennials the Bar-Kays, James Brown and Willie Hutch in a symphony of samples lush enough to soothe the ears from Rawse&apos;s sandpaper vocals. Likewise, with Premier, Rock, RZA and even LA&apos;s self-proclaimed &quot;Loop Digga&quot; Madlib having submitted material, Kanye West&apos;s forthcoming Dark Twisted Fantasy album may do for traditional hip-hop sampling what his 808s &amp; Heartbreak did for Auto-Tuned self indulgence, although the presence of Bon Iver&apos;s Justin Vernon should ensure that Yeezy keeps the Pitchfork crowd with him.

The party of 250 people included a full orchestra and chorus, backstage staff, technical crew and management support. And indeed, in the time I spent following them around, I duly picked up on the warm and fuzzy feelings engendered by late-night sessions in karaoke bars, excitement over trips to Mount Fuji, the swapping of restaurant etiquette tips and problem-solving sessions involving apparently incomprehensible tube maps. Not that there weren&apos;t operas as well. Performances of La Traviata and Manon in Tokyo and Yokohama were enthusiastically received despite some alarums and excursions involving understudies, and understudies of understudies. And aside from the full-stage productions, the Japanese promoters of the tour \u2013 who accepted all financial risk for the venture, leaving the opera house to break even at worst, also asked for a concert performance that would both show off the orchestra and chorus as well as somehow exemplifying British music for Japanese audiences. &quot;So I spent quite a lot of time planning it,&quot; explained director of music Antonio Pappano over a breakfast of fish, soup and rice at his Tokyo hotel. &quot;We had some Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams. There was a bit of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and a few other things. I think we came up with a pretty lovely programme, but they said no. It turned out what they really wanted was Handel&apos;s Messiah.&quot; Which is what the orchestra, chorus and soloists of the Royal Opera performed, albeit in the expanded Mozart orchestration. The promoters&apos; instincts as to local taste proved sound and, to the slight surprise of the company, a significant portion of the packed audience actually stood up for the Hallelujah Chorus. While this throwback to a Clive James-esque slice of &quot;how others see us&quot; was a minor element of the tour as a whole, it is nevertheless true that Japanese taste \u2013 and Chinese, American, Korean and many other tastes \u2013 will not be irrelevant to the calculations made in London over the coming years. The tour might have marked something of a culmination of Pappano&apos;s successful nine-year artistic tenure at Covent Garden, but it also signified the beginning of a new, and far more ambitious, phase of the company&apos;s development. Although they are bracing themselves for cuts to their grant, which currently accounts for around 25% of their total income, chief executive Tony Hall says, &quot;The really big strategic issue facing us is that in the very near future there will only be three or maybe four big opera houses in the world. There will be the Met in New York, maybe La Scala because of its historic reputation, maybe Paris and a few others you could\u00a0argue over. But we will certainly be one of those world-class venues, and we therefore need Japanese audiences to see just how good we are because they will not just be seeing us on stage. The digital age will make a huge difference. We are already available on big-screen relays to cinemas, on DVD and via our Japanese language website. It won&apos;t be long before people will have, on demand, the world&apos;s great opera houses piped live into their homes. Occasionally people say that audiences for opera are small. That&apos;s not even true in national terms. But when you think in a global sense, the audiences are enormous and we will be available to all of them.&quot; The contrast with the last time the company toured with a full orchestra and chorus, in 1998 to Finland, Germany and Edinburgh, is stark. The music making might have been exemplary under Bernard Haitink (who restricted himself to matters in the pit, the opposite of Pappano&apos;s access-all-areas, hands-on approach), but back then the company was homeless while Covent Garden was closed for renovations and there was a genuine fear that it might not reopen. And while the worst of the management convulsions that had destabilised the company over the previous few years were over, the company still felt organisationally fragile. Of course, the house reopened in 1999 as a far more welcoming building, both to its audience and to those who just fancy a nose around or a drink in a bar. And as well as being less remote to its audience, the organisation is also now better linked to other arts companies and has a kind of mentoring role for groups such as Ballet Black and Music Theatre Wales. But just as the 1990s problems of organisation and access were not solved without pain, so the road to the digital future is already proving bumpy. One night in Japan, the opera company hierarchy were obliged to calm a Twitter storm of protest about their apparently heavy-handed response to a copyright issue on the opera blog Intermezzo. Last week a new row over a perceived &quot;rights grab&quot; as to ownership of work done on Royal Opera productions blew up. &quot;We are in slightly uncharted waters,&quot; Hall admits. &quot;We are in a very different age to a decade or two ago when significant sums of money could be made from studio recordings. That money is no longer there. It is also difficult to keep track of a market that moves very fast. So we are trying to do something with our contracts that allows us to respond, with the artists and with their consent, as fast as we can to exploit our productions in the marketplace, knowing that the returns are much lower than they were two decades ago.&quot; Although the business model remains a work in progress, there is general consensus that in musical terms Pappano has pretty much got it right. &quot;When even Massenet can seem deep, something remarkable is going on,&quot; said one reviewer about the new production of Manon earlier this summer. &quot;Under Antonio Pappano&apos;s stewardship, the Royal Opera is experiencing a golden age of musical sensitivity and dramatic insight.&quot; Another commentator compared the organisation to a big Rolls-Royce &quot;just purring along&quot;. Pappano says it took him five years to feel in proper command of the orchestra \u2013 &quot;to get that feeling you really understand each other, that you are inhabiting each other&apos;s sound world.&quot; He is plainly held in very high regard by his players and singers and while nearly everyone I spoke to in Japan had the decency to admit that the oft-used description of them as a family was cheesy, they also said it did bear some resemblance to the truth. More importantly, this team spirit carried through to the stage, most notably when soprano Ermonela Jaho \u2013 herself a late replacement for Angela Gheorgiou, who pulled out of the tour just a week before departure \u2013 twice had to be replaced after the first act of La Traviata by her understudy Ailyn P\u00e9rez. Potential artistic \u2013 and commercial \u2013 disaster was avoided with impressive ease. Pappano returns to the house next week with a concert performance of Bizet&apos;s The Pearl Fishers. He likes to give the orchestra a chance to play on stage before they disappear into the darkness of the pit for the rest of the season. &quot;And I have a very warm spot in my heart for this work. The orchestral writing is typical Bizet but with an element of the sea \u2013 so a different tumult to Carmen, but still something pretty meaty for the home forces to chew on.&quot; The new season also features a rare production of Wagner&apos;s Tannh\u00e4user and a series of operas that appear to feature &quot;women under duress&quot;: the baroque rarity Niobe (witnesses murder of her 14 children and is then turned to stone), Adriana Lecouvreur (poisoned) and Mark-Anthony Turnage&apos;s new work Anna Nicole \u2013 with lyrics by Richard Thomas of Jerry Springer: The Opera fame \u2013 about the Playboy model and controversial heiress who died aged 39 in 2007 after an apparent drug overdose. &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful season,&quot; says Pappano, &quot;although I&apos;m also aware that 2011/12 could well be a bit tougher financially. But the company has been prudent and we have tried very hard not to make any compromises in the repertoire. All this will be discussed over the next few months, although for me changing a title for financial reasons will really be a defeat. What is good is that all the decisions are thought through from top to bottom of the organisation. Yes, the beans are counted, but that is just part of the equation.&quot; Pappano&apos;s current contract will take him to 2014, but he is already scheduling 2015. He wouldn&apos;t be short\u00a0of offers if he did want to move, and his recent BBC television series Opera Italia, which will be repeated later this month, has seen him increasingly cast as the accessible front man for classical music, a job he admits is both attractive and important. &quot;But I really am very happy here and I am up for the fight that we have ahead of us. In the end, all that matters is what is on stage. It really is all about the work and that makes me optimistic. I know the people I&apos;m working with and I know the capacity they have. You come back from something like this Japan tour and you bring home all the good habits about working together you&apos;ve picked up on the road. Everyone wants to make it work so we have every chance of pulling it off. I&apos;m Italian so I like cooking analogies; when you have top ingredients you have to do something drastically wrong to spoil the meal. I think the chances are we will prepare something that will taste pretty good.&quot; See more photographs from behind the scenes of the tour at theguardian.com/classical"}, {"sentences": ["In a hundred years, Delhi&apos;s population has grown from 400,000 to about 18 million and is expected to grow by another 40% by 2020, when it will be the world&apos;s third-largest urban agglomeration after Tokyo and Mumbai."], "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Sport", "India", "World news", "Commonwealth Games"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-02T06:00:01Z", "title": "Why Delhi is still a contractors' city at heart | Ian Jack", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/02/ian-jack-commonwealth-games-delhi", "article": "&quot;A shameful mess and absolutely typical of that contractors&apos; city,&quot; said a friend in Kolkata when I asked him about the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. He meant that both contractors and politicians had made money, the second through bribes from the first, the first through the wide margin of profit offered by over-invoicing and cheap workers and workmanship. There is more to the mess than that \u2013 Delhi was unlucky this year to have had a prolonged monsoon and outbreaks of dengue fever \u2013 but coverage in the Indian media suggests the human factor should take most of the blame. The acronyms of the Indian government&apos;s anti-corruption agencies crop up frequently. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is keeping &quot;a hawk&apos;s eye&quot; on the 14 projects it has put &quot;under the scanner&quot;. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is looking into alleged financial irregularities that run into &quot;thousands of crores&quot; (a crore is 10 million rupees, roughly \u00a3143,000). Nothing is sacred. Two members of the Games&apos; organising committee were suspended following inquiries into the progress through London of the Queen&apos;s baton relay, which set off from Buckingham Palace in October last year. I was struck by my friend&apos;s phrase: that contractors&apos; city. In a hundred years, Delhi&apos;s population has grown from 400,000 to about 18 million and is expected to grow by another 40% by 2020, when it will be the world&apos;s third-largest urban agglomeration after Tokyo and Mumbai. None of this frightening enlargement would have been, or will be, possible without contractors to build the homes and the infrastructure. London likes to think of its Olympic park as a significant challenge in terms of planning and construction, but London is a city in stasis compared to Delhi. To a Londoner, the word &quot;contractor&quot; suggests nothing very much \u2013 Irish labourers, once upon a time \u2013 but a Delhi-ite has a more concrete picture of individual energy, wealth and political connection. The city&apos;s history partly accounts for it. Which contractors built Victorian London is a question even a well-informed architectural historian might struggle to answer, but ask the same of Delhi&apos;s 20th-century history and many of its citizens will know. When I first saw Delhi in the 1970s, it was still recognisable as the city that the English architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker had planned as the new capital of British India: &quot;The most magnificent as well as the most ambitious architectural project ever undertaken by a British government,&quot; in the words of the writer Gavin Stamp. Delhi, of course, already existed; it was an old capital of the Mughal empire, and as an important place of human settlement it stretched back for centuries before the Mughals arrived. Among the scattered ruins of these earlier rulers \u2013 tombs, forts, mosques \u2013 New Delhi arose as the replacement for Kolkata, to give the British administration a distance from the rising nationalist hubbub in Bengal. King George V announced the move at his Delhi Durbar of 1911 and the nearly finished city was inaugurated in 1931 \u2013 &quot;five minutes before closing time&quot;, as Nikolaus Pevsner once remarked. In 1977, 30 years after the Raj had closed, New Delhi was still characterised by its broad tree-lined avenues and neoclassical bungalows. It was a one- and two-storey kind of town at its centre, remarkably open and green. Sometimes its residents said it was dull \u2013 &quot;too many bureaucrats&quot; \u2013 but it had a cultured class, generous to strangers, which included several notable people called Singh who edited magazines, wrote newspaper columns, ran restaurants and galleries and were socially committed. Few of these activities were very profitable, and yet these Singhs lived well, in the kind of home usually then given over to foreign diplomats and non-governmental organisations. Any mystery in the contradiction was shortlived. Everybody knew that their fathers and grandfathers had made fortunes as the contractors who built New Delhi to the designs of Lutyens and Baker. Several were Sikhs from western Punjab and the most celebrated of them, Sobha Singh, was rewarded with a knighthood for his professionalism. Contractors on the New Delhi project had employed thousands of men (perhaps children, too) to build a city from scratch. Hills had been demolished, railways laid, palaces built, stone in millions of cubic feet cut, transported and erected: in Delhi, to be known as a contractor&apos;s grandchild involved no shame because, si monumentum requiris, circumspice, what they saw around them was their grandfather&apos;s work. Did the contractors offer bribes to win their commissions? There&apos;s no evidence to suggest so. The code of the Indian civil service allowed no gift greater than fruit or flowers and in the 1920s the morality within imperialism was probably at its highest (though, then again, the secrets of the hierarchy in those days were generally better kept). In other ways, however, the story of the Commonwealth Games can find echoes in the past. Lutyens, fretting that his grand viceregal palace would never be finished, complained about the workmanship. &quot;The Indian never finishes anything,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and breaks 50% of what he temporarily fixes so that the amount of making good shall be at least 25% of the work done and at the cost of another 25% \u2026 there is not near enough skilled supervision and no one seems to care so long as they can get to their clubs, gymnasiums and whist and bridge drives.&quot; Lutyens certainly wasn&apos;t the most sympathetic visitor India has ever seen \u2013 &quot;They want me to do Hindu [architecture]. Hindon&apos;t I say&quot; \u2013 but perhaps he was right to fret. In March 1927 a brick fell from the ceiling of the newly completed legislative chamber and nearly brained Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood. A later letter in the Times from the building&apos;s architect, Baker, insisted the fallen object had been merely an acoustic tile that had been insecurely fixed in damp plaster during &quot;the extreme dry heat of an Indian summer&quot;. The same alarm, and the same response, met the news last month that few pieces of plastic ceiling had dropped to the floor of the wrestling venue. In the end, the vistas and public buildings of Lutyens&apos; and Baker&apos;s New Delhi came to be seen as a triumph. Their work gives the modern city its distinction, which the international modernism of sports stadia and athletes&apos; villages will never do. But in tomorrow&apos;s opening ceremony we may also find parallels from long ago. &quot;It would be idle to pretend that the ceremony had any popular support,&quot; wrote the correspondent for the Times in 1931. &quot;The attendance was confined entirely to those admitted by official invitation. All the approaches to New Delhi were plastered with armed police, and little encouragement was given to anyone who desired to offer a demonstration, friendly or otherwise.&quot; Still, the time for churlishness is over. We must forget the collapsed bridge, the excrement in the rooms and ceiling tiles on the floor \u2013 and hope for the best."}, {"sentences": ["Meanwhile, here are a few of the day&apos;s highlights, many at 10:10am local time, listed on the group&apos;s website: Funniest: Sumo wrestlers cycling to practice in downtown Tokyo."], "tags": ["10:10 climate change campaign", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Activism", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-04T10:49:21Z", "title": "Activists across the globe prepare for day of action | Juliette Jowit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/oct/04/10-10-campaign-events", "article": "Last year it was hailed as the &quot;most widespread day of political action in the planet&apos;s history&quot;.

But that chance to stock up is now gone, after prices rose on 1 October. The biggest ever increase in the tax on Japan&apos;s cigarettes is designed to raise extra revenue to pay for rising healthcare costs in a rapidly ageing society, but is also an indication that Japan is attempting to shed its image as a haven for nicotine addicts. Although consumption has fallen every year since 1999, Japan still has one of the highest smoking rates in the industrialised world. Even after this big increase, prices are well below those charged in Britain. The smoking rate among men is 37% compared with 50% a decade ago, while among women it is 9%, according to government data. &quot;The aim is to encourage smokers to quit,&quot; Kosuke Kato, a health ministry official, told Associated Press. &quot;We hope the price increase will discourage smokers from buying cigarettes and eventually help them quit smoking.&quot; The prospect of paying an extra \u00a5100 yen or more per packet sent droves of smokers into stores in the days before the tax increased. Most bought a few extra cartons to see them through the first month; one man in Tokyo reportedly spent \u00a5300,000 on 100 cartons. Kyoko Suwa, a Tokyo waitress, bought 1,000 of her beloved menthol brand late last month. &quot;I have to admit, I&apos;ve smoked them all,&quot; she said during a cigarette break at work. &quot;I think I can put up with paying more \u2013 but no more than this \u2013 and I&apos;ve never seriously considered giving up. &quot;We&apos;re always being reminded of the rights of passive smokers, but the rights of smokers don&apos;t seem to count for anything these days.&quot; While health campaigners welcomed the price rise, they say Japan still lags behind other countries in tackling nicotine addiction and the dangers of passive smoking. Smoking is banned on many Tokyo streets and in taxis, but is still permitted in most bars, restaurants and cafes. The health ministry has asked public buildings and offices to ban smoking but more than half have yet to establish a smoke-free policy. Yet there are signs that attitudes are hardening in a country where smoking-related diseases kill 130,000 every year. Cigarette packets now carry bigger health warnings and ID cards have been introduced to prevent minors from buying tobacco from vending machines. Kanagawa prefecture recently became the first region to prohibit lighting up in schools, hospitals and other public buildings. Japan Tobacco, the world&apos;s third-biggest tobacco firm, said it expected sales to fall dramatically after the rush to stock up. &quot;Most people will buy a month&apos;s supply and then sales will start to fall again,&quot; a JT spokesman said, adding that the firm had forecast a 25% drop in sales over the year starting from October. &quot;We&apos;re against the tax increase, but the government has made up its mind and there&apos;s nothing we can do.&quot; Critics say Japan&apos;s failure to push prices even higher, or to introduce blanket smoking bans, stems from the government&apos;s 50.2% stake in Japan Tobacco, from which it receives about \u00a51 trillion in tax revenue a year. While one survey found that 58% of smokers said they would give up because of the price rise, Bungaku Watanabe of the tobacco problem information entre in Tokyo says cigarettes should cost at least \u00a51,000 a packet. &quot;I don&apos;t think this price hike will prompt many people to give up,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ll just save on food and drink so they can afford cigarettes. The real problem is state involvement in Japan Tobacco. &quot;Tobacco policy is drawn up for the benefit of the finance ministry, as a revenue raiser, not as a public health issue.

But a source close to the process explained the 2018 bid team&apos;s hope that, given English football organisations&apos; recent activity in football-development projects in more than 100 nations, sufficient goodwill towards the bid exists among committee members. Other political considerations could also play favourably for England. As well as having concentrated much of its football-development efforts on Africa, England supported Issa Hayatou&apos;s failed bid to become Fifa president eight years ago. As a Fifa vice-president Hayatou is Africa&apos;s most influential member of the executive committee and there is a feeling that his gratitude for England&apos;s support remains. If that is true, and the Cameroonian can carry the three other committee members from Africa, the votes would be a coup for England 2018. The word on the grapevine is that England 2018 has also worked particularly hard with two senior committee members from the Pacific. The vote of Geoff Thompson, the English Fifa vice-president, is guaranteed and there is believed to be support from at least one other European member. If all those votes come in, England 2018 executives will be a long way towards delivering the tournament that English fans crave. Anson loses his shirt During the heads-of-bids debate at the Leaders in Football conference at Stamford Bridge yesterday the England 2018 chief executive, Andy Anson, gave a considered response to the question: What has your country ever done for the game of football? Apart from the obvious, Anson chose to highlight the history of club shirts in other countries. There is Athletic Bilbao in Spain, whose red and white stripes were first seen on Wearside, he explained. And Juventus, whose black and white shirts stripes inspired by Newcastle United.

Friendly Thai Leicester City&apos;s first assignment under Sven-Goran Eriksson has been to head to Thailand for a friendly against the national team, who are managed by Bryan Robson. The original itinerary would reportedly have taken the team to Phuket but Eriksson oversaw a switch to Pattaya, a town described as the &quot;naughty centre of Thai tourism&quot;. That will no doubt lead to sniggers about Eriksson&apos;s motivations but it is to be recorded that Pattaya is closer to Bangkok, where the match will take place, than Phuket.

The New Zealander Peter Bethune said the futuristic trimaran Ady Gil was salvageable after the crash, but that he was ordered by Sea Shepherd head Paul Watson to scuttle it. Watson denied the claim, saying the decision was Bethune&apos;s. The exchange has exposed a bitter falling out between Bethune, who shot to international prominence because of the high-seas drama, and Watson, the figurehead of Sea Shepherd&apos;s campaign against Japan&apos;s Antarctic whaling programme. The campaign has drawn high-profile donor support in the United States and elsewhere. Bethune was at the helm of the Sea Shepherd boat when its bow was shorn off by Japanese whaling ship Shonan Maru 2 in waters off the frozen continent in January. Bethune later boarded the whaler to confront the ship&apos;s captain over the collision, and was detained by the crew. Bethune was arrested and spent five months in a Japanese jail while being tried on trespassing, assault and other charges. He was convicted and received a suspended prison sentence in July, then deported. He says the Ady Gil was salvageable after the collision but that Watson ordered it to be sunk. Bethune said he and two other activists went aboard the Ady Gill and opened compartments and hatches to let in water, the stuff.co.nz news website reported. Bethune told New Zealand&apos;s National Radio he believed Watson wanted the sinking to &quot;garner sympathy with the public and to create better TV.&quot; &quot;Paul Watson was my admiral. He gave me an order and I carried it out,&quot; Bethune said. &quot;I was ashamed of it at the time and I&apos;m ashamed of it now.&quot; &quot;It was all done in secret. I was ordered not to tell any of the crew, not my family and especially not Ady Gil, the owner of the boat,&quot; Bethune said, referring to the US businessman who funded the vessel. Watson, a Canadian, said the scuttling of the Ady Gil was Bethune&apos;s decision. &quot;Pete is on camera saying &apos;yes, I guess we&apos;re going to have to let it go,&apos; so it was his decision and actually wasn&apos;t mine,&quot; Watson told National Radio. The Ady Gil sank two days after the collision with the Japanese ship. At the time, Sea Shepherd said the Ady Gil was being towed by another of its vessels, the Bob Barker funded by the former US talkshow host when the line snapped and the Ady Gil began taking on water. Fuel and other potential environmental pollutants had been removed from the boat. The Ady Gil a sleek, wave-piercing trimaran that resembled a spider-like stealth bomber set the speed record for a power boat circumnavigating the globe in 2009, when it was called Earthrace. It took 60 days, 23 hours, 49 minutes and ran on biofuel. The vessel then joined Sea Shepherd, which used its speed to chase down elusive Japanese whaling ships in Antarctic waters. Sea Shepherd announced during Bethune&apos;s trial it would not let him participate in further protests, but after his release said the ban was a tactic to help him avoid prison and that he was free to rejoin. Watson said Thursday that Bethune was expelled from the group in October after it discovered the New Zealander had given false information to Japanese authorities about Watson in exchange for leniency. Bethune said he was speaking out now in an attempt to convince Sea Shepherd&apos;s top leaders to show more honesty and integrity. Glenn Inwood, a New Zealand-based spokesman for Japan&apos;s Tokyo-based Institute of Cetacean Research, said both Watson and Bethune had &quot;told so many lies over the past few months it&apos;s hard to believe either of them&quot; on the issue of the sinking of the Ady Gil. Whale conservation groups declined on Thursday to comment on the row. A former conservation minister for New Zealand, which has strongly opposed Japan&apos;s whaling in Antarctic waters, told the Associated Press that Watson&apos;s credibility and Sea Shepherd&apos;s programme &quot;have been compromised by this information&quot;. &quot;It will weaken his position and the campaign against Japanese whaling in the southern ocean,&quot; said the former New Zealand conservation minister, Chris Carter, as well as &quot;the validity of Paul Watson&apos;s arguments about the conservation of species&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["That isn&apos;t the case with Magnetic Man, the name adopted by Croydon producers Skream, Benga and Artwork, whose debut album begins with a stab at indulgent beauty in\u00a0the swelling strings of Flying Into Tokyo."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Electronic music", "Dance music"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-07T22:40:00Z", "title": "Magnetic Man: Magnetic Man | CD review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/07/magnetic-man-cd-review", "article": "Many a supergroup has proved to be a painfully bloated affair.

There&apos;s $5m (\u00a33.13m) at stake and his No4 world ranking, not to mention a chance to revive a season that has witnessed more highs and lows than The Star Spangled Banner. Murray, who turned his game around substantially on the American hardcourt leg (without a coach) before his disappointing exit at Flushing Meadows last month, crashed out of the China Open in Beijing on Friday, the fourth straight day of what international health monitors called &quot;hazardous&quot; smog. The Scot admits he played poorly in losing in straight sets to Ivan Ljubicic, praising the 31-year-old Croat for his solid serve, but no amount of camouflage will disguise his concern at being bested from the baseline to the net by a player 11 places below him in the ATP rankings. Murray, who has one of the best returns in the game, won only 12 points on Ljubicic&apos;s serve, going down 6-3, 6-2 in little more than an hour. He said after his tough first-round win over Albert Monta\u00f1\u00e9s that he had identified the parts of his game he needed to work on; so, apparently, did Ljubicic. The view and the prospects are brighter this week in coastal Shanghai, where Murray has a good chance in the penultimate Masters event to join Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among the eight best players in the world at the O2 Arena in Greenwich from 21 November. To put their seasons in perspective, Nadal qualified as long ago as June, when winning the French Open in his grand sweep of the game&apos;s major clay, grass and hardcourt summer trophies; Federer made his place safe at Flushing Meadows; and on Friday in the horrendously polluted Chinese capital, en route to defending his Open title there today, Djokovic joined them. The rest of the queue is tightly bunched and Murray is at the head of it. While he is only 70 points in front of Robin Soderling, the real dogfight will be between the eighth\u2011placed Fernando Verdasco and his Spanish compatriot David Ferrer. Verdasco leads 7-4 in that series. Murray will make it comfortably enough but he needs to lift his game after arriving in China at the start of the week complaining of jet lag and an unspecified bug. If he slips up in Shanghai \u2013 he is on Nadal&apos;s side of the draw, has a bye in the first round and plays the winner of the world No37, Radek Stepanek, and the Chinese qualifier Bai Yan, on Tuesday \u2013 there are more points on offer in Paris in a month&apos;s time, but that would be an ugly route to the O2. Nadal is still the man. He had to save two match points to beat Viktor Troicki in Tokyo and he plays Ga\u00ebl Monfils in the final there today \u2013 but he served 18 aces; the final pieces of his game are falling pleasingly into place.

Purists will invariably complain. Those who feel ownership of a scene will decry the cheapening of something they hold dear. They will accuse the crossover merchants of selling out and bemoan the entry of new listeners into their coterie. It happened with grunge in the early 90s; it happened with grime earlier this decade. It has been happening again with dubstep, the latest underground sound undergoing overground convulsions. Magnetic Man \u2013 a trio composed of three dubstep pioneers, Artwork, Benga and Skream \u2013 have placed themselves at the centre of this pop-cultural kerfuffle, having made an album of dark electronic music that expands to breaking point the genre strictures that once defined the carnivorous sound from Croydon. Track one is a neoclassical string meditation called &quot;Flying Into Tokyo&quot; that signposts this album&apos;s non-dubness. The first non-music fans probably heard of dubstep was in 2008 when Burial&apos;s brooding album, Untrue, was tipped for the Mercury prize. The Sun went so far as to unmask the previously anonymous musician, suddenly making dubstep a populist concern. The same year, dubstep producer Benga&apos;s equally impressive album, Diary of an Afro Warrior, didn&apos;t make the Mercury longlist, having somehow not ticked sufficient boxes. Now with former pirate station (and dubstep crucible) Rinse FM having gone legit, Benga looks set to have his (shared) day in the sun, something it&apos;s hard to begrudge a man toiling away at black boxes since his teens, for little financial gain. Magnetic Man have already had success in the form of their first single, &quot;I Need Air&quot;, a trancey incursion about the breathlessness of attraction which cracked the top 10 last summer. It lacked bass \u2013 one of the defining pleasures of dubstep proper \u2013 but it made for a promising start. &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot;, its successor featuring Katy B, lacks the same wow factor (and also, bass). Another potential single-to-be, &quot;Getting Nowhere&quot;, with soul man John Legend, is pleasant enough, but sorely lacks innovation (and bass). You could argue that the purists are right. Watering down a sound diminishes its frisson. The sense of belonging to a scene is one of the most joyous and inalienable rights of the dedicated music lover. And now, people in H&amp;M will think dubstep is a bit like tidied-up drum&apos;n&apos;bass, with no bass, and a random singer on top, rather than a vast, innard-rearranging expression of\u00a0our own eternal loneliness in the face\u00a0of the urban void (possibly). But the purists&apos; sacrifice will be for the greater good. Because the other thing that happens when a previously aloof genre comes in from the cold is that mainstream pop receives a shot in the arm. It makes shopping in the high street more aurally invigorating. It is good for us. Mid-album, the thin skitter of &quot;Boiling Water&quot; unfurls into a seriously nagging tune that will sound sweet in H&amp;M. The long-lost Ms Dynamite makes a belated return to form on &quot;Fire&quot;. Best of all, the bass finally drops on tracks such as &quot;Mad&quot; and &quot;K Dance&quot;, continuing to signify menace even on this flawed but likable debut."}, {"sentences": ["Nadal, who beat Ga\u00ebl Monfils to win in Tokyo today and is on the crest of a surreal wave of form, is another late arrival, along with Andy Murray."], "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-10T16:12:10Z", "title": "Nikolay Davydenko will play a better game than he talks in Shanghai", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/10/nikolay-davydenko-nadal-federer-shanghai", "article": "Nikolay Davydenko&apos;s English lends itself to chuckles and he acknowledges his season has dwindled away to irrelevance \u2013 but Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer know the erratic Russian will be one dangerous joker in the Shanghai Masters this week.

David Nalbandian is the only other player to manage that feat in two separate official tournaments. Davydenko&apos;s season, though, has veered between promise and serial disappointment and, although holding on to sixth place in the ATP world rankings, three months out with an injured wrist spiked not only his chances in the major tournaments but any hope of returning to the O2 next month. He had his Chinese audience amused and bemused when he admitted in broken English fractured into further shards, no doubt, en\u00a0route to Mandarin: &quot;I know I will not qualify for London this year [so] just enjoying now my last couple tournaments what I play this year and take rest before early, just practising, preparation for the next season in December.&quot; If that translates roughly as don&apos;t put your rickshaw on my winning here, it would be as well not to take Davydenko seriously; he will be dead keen to resurrect something from the ashes of a wretched summer. He expressed mild surprise that Federer, who has not played since losing to Novak Djokovic at the US Open, had not arrived early to practice for a tournament he has played nine times. The Swiss will need no incentive beyond pride, though, to get his game back to working order when he does arrive tomorrow. He is burning to reclaim his No1 position and a fifth victory here would convince him it is not an unreasonable ambition. Nadal, who beat Ga\u00ebl Monfils to win in Tokyo today and is on the crest of a surreal wave of form, is another late arrival, along with Andy Murray.

So he reached over and grabbed a handful of food off the Sedaris plate. Understandably, Sedaris was not best pleased. In fact, he was downright annoyed, which is not a common reaction from a writer who tends to regard the world in general with wide-eyed affection and his readers in particular with real fondness (&quot;I always think it&apos;s a good policy to like the people who like you,&quot; he says with an almost straight face). It wasn&apos;t the hygiene issue that bugged him. It wasn&apos;t even the loss of the food, although he was a little upset about that (&quot;I&apos;d been looking forward to that salmon!&quot;) \u2013 it was the fact that the man was trying to cheat. &quot;He just did it because he wanted to be written about,&quot; recalls Sedaris, with the distaste of an artist discussing a plagiarist. &quot;It was a gimmick, you know? So I ignored him because I wasn&apos;t going to give him the satisfaction.&quot; For a few moments, Sedaris&apos;s face clouds at the memory. &quot;But then a woman came up to me later after I read the story about the rabbit and the unicorn&quot; \u2013 in Sedaris&apos;s new collection, Squirrel Meets Chipmunk \u2013 &quot;and she said, &apos;You know it&apos;s just wild that you read that story because I went to see my gynaecologist yesterday and he said my uterus is shaped like a unicorn.&apos;&quot; Sedaris leans back in his chair, clouds cleared and replaced with a smile of delight. &quot;I mean, someone handed me a gold coin there.&quot; This tale, like all of Sedaris&apos;s short stories and autobiographical essays, makes wider points beyond its classically Sedaris-esque world-righted-again conclusion. Just as &quot;Go Carolina&quot;, from Me Talk Pretty One Day, isn&apos;t only about his school&apos;s failed attempts to cure him of his lisp but also about his youthful attempts to conceal his homosexuality; and just as &quot;The Sick Rat and the Healthy Rat&quot; in Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk is partly about animal testing but really an exploration of the cruel smugness of the homeopathic set (&quot;I&apos;m sorry to say it, but if you have a terminal illness it&apos;s nobody&apos;s fault but your own&quot;), so this story about Sedaris&apos;s stolen dinner reveals why he is so popular \u2013 his delighted fascination in people&apos;s eccentricities (the real, not the faked ones). His past five collections of essays, When You Are Engulfed in Flames (2008), Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim (2004), Me Talk Pretty One Day (2000), Holidays on Ice (1997) and Naked (1997) have all been bestsellers and have made celebrities out of not just Sedaris, but also the most frequent subjects of his essays: his siblings, his parents, and his boyfriend, Hugh. At a reading in London in March this year, Sedaris himself garnered plenty of happy applause, but it was Hugh who prompted gasps and camera phone flashes when Sedaris pointed him out in the audience, as though Mr Darcy had been suddenly summoned from the wings by Jane Austen. The most unlikely subjects become hilarious in Sedaris&apos;s hands, such as the time his father threw him out of the house when he realised he was gay. He was, however, too embarrassed to say the word &quot;gay&quot;, so the 22-year-old David assumed, with a shrug of fair-enough acceptance, that he was being ejected from the family home because of his fondness for his bong: &quot;I guess I could have pinned him down, I just hadn&apos;t seen the point. &apos;Is it because I&apos;m a failure? A drug addict? A sponge? Come on, Dad, just give me one good reason,&apos;&quot; he wrote in &quot;Hejira&quot;. Yet his delight in eccentricities is often undercut by a sharpness and a darkness that at times can be startling in a writer who enjoys such mainstream success. In &quot;The Smoking Section&quot;, his essay about his eventual, reluctant, abandonment of smoking, he writes about how he was introduced to his favourite brand of cigarettes: &quot;Just after she started chemotherapy, my mom sent me three cartons of Kool Milds. &apos;They were on sale,&apos; she croaked. Dying or not, she should have known that I smoked Filter Kings, but then I looked at them and thought, Well, they ARE free.&quot; That his stories are telling most of all in their detail is also shown in the saga of his pilfered dinner \u2013 the simple fact that he was eating it at a book event: &quot;I just found that if I do an evening book signing I don&apos;t get back to my room until 2am, and then room service takes another 45 minutes,&quot; he explains blithely over cupcakes in a New York coffee shop. &quot;So now I just bring my dinner with me.&quot; It is a rare author whose readers regularly queue until after midnight to get his autograph. In America at least, Sedaris is in the tiny golden circle of writers \u2013 along with Stephen King and Woody Allen \u2013 who commands rock concert-sized audiences in venues such as Carnegie Hall, and whose fans shout their love for him when he walks down the street in New York. &quot;And,&quot; adds fellow humorist and American-abroad writer, Bill Bryson, &quot;he really ought to be as famous here in Britain as he is there. He is the funniest and most original American writer since SJ Perleman.&quot; In fact, it was at least partly to escape fame that Sedaris fled America for Europe several years ago. &quot;I mean, it&apos;s nice to be told that people love you, but you can&apos;t live like that and I can&apos;t write about it. So I had to go.&quot; To where people are rude to him? &quot;Yeah,&quot; he agrees with a smile. His first refuge of rudeness was of course France, but he now lives in Britain \u2013 in London and in a recently bought house in West Sussex. &quot;But I don&apos;t know what that means \u2013 West Sussex,&quot; he says, rolling the words with pleasure on his tongue, his lingering North Carolina accent rendering them even more foreign-sounding. &quot;If someone bought a place outside New York I would know what that said about them. So it&apos;s weird not knowing what West Sussex says about us. But I also kinda like that.&quot; Sedaris was born in New York and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, along with his siblings, Lisa, Gretchen, Amy, Tiffany and Paul. Everyone in the family, he says, had a role, and his was &quot;the drop out&quot;; it was the other members of his family who were funny, particularly his sister Amy and his brother Paul, who, if warned not to wear shorts at a fancy restaurant, would turn up wearing a thong. &quot;And if it embarrassed me, he would think it well worth it.&quot; Amy, also a successful comedian and writer, disagrees with David&apos;s self-deprecation: &quot;We&apos;re all funny in different ways but he was the funniest, and I gravitated to him. If I had to learn about Julius Caesar for school, instead of just helping me memorise the whole &apos;Friends, Romans, countrymen&apos; thing, he would create a talk show with all the characters for the play. He has always been an amazing storyteller, but he also makes you want to make him laugh because he is the most generous laugher you&apos;ll ever meet.&quot; Sedaris knew he wanted to be a writer from the age of 25, when he read a collection of Bobbie Ann Mason stories; he attempted to fulfil his ambition by &quot;writing a lot of bad Flannery O&apos;Connor and Raymond Carver.&quot; It would take almost another decade before he found success. In the meantime, he kept himself busy dropping out of two colleges, going to art school (&quot;I know I didn&apos;t really want to be an artist, simply because I wasn&apos;t jealous of the other students&apos; success&quot;), developing a full-blown drug habit and finding &quot;jobs that needed no skills&quot;, such as cleaning people&apos;s houses and working as an elf in a department store at Christmas. He also wrote a diary and it was while he was working in his odd jobs that Ira Glass, a host on National Public Radio, happened to hear Sedaris reading from his diary in a club in 1992. Glass immediately hired him to read on the radio and suggested that he broadcast a longer piece about his life: Sedaris wrote about his time as an elf (published as SantaLand Diaries). Suddenly, he says, &quot;I went from having 50 listeners to 50 million listeners.&quot; He still contributes to NPR. He insists that he never puts himself in strange and unfamiliar situations just for the sake of writing about them. He does, though, love those initial moments when one is in a new place, that &quot;too short space of time when your eyes are keenly and profoundly open&quot; \u2013 such as when he and Hugh moved to Tokyo for a few months to help him give up smoking (the dislocation of the move did help him break the habit, although trying to learn Japanese nearly drove him back to it). Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk takes him to a terrain almost as novel as Japan. As \u00a0the title suggests, it is about animals\u00a0as opposed to people, plus it is Sedaris&apos;s first entirely fictional collection. Sort of. Ever since he was in his 20s, Sedaris, now 54, has carried\u00a0around a notebook in which he records his observations. When asked how it felt to write a book without the help of these notebooks, he replies that it felt &quot;kinda great! That said, there are\u00a0some things in the stories that came . .\u00a0. Like,\u00a0one time this woman in airport security was just being horrible to me.&quot; Again, his face darkens and then, just as quickly, clears again: &quot;And\u00a0I thought &apos;I&apos;m going to turn you into a rabbit.&apos;&quot; Squirrel seeks Chipmunk is easily his darkest book, featuring baby lambs whose eyes get pecked out by crows and bears who are beaten and captured by circus owners. Yet it is still funny, particularly because it feels as though Sedaris is satirising the kind of sentimentalised anthropomorphism he often sends up in his essays (posters of animals wearing clothes are frequently cited as the nadir of humour). &quot;I&apos;ve never been so unsure about the reaction to one of my books,&quot; he says. &quot;What I like is that you can&apos;t categorise it. Someone suggested that it&apos;s bedtime stories for children who drink, and I thought that was just great.&quot; But Sedaris has long been tough to categorise. While his early essays tend to be straighforwardedly funny, his later ones veer between comedy, darkness and something more moving. The member of his family who readers ask him about the most is his younger brother Paul (when I told friends I was interviewing Sedaris, four asked me to ask about Paul, and a fifth wanted to know what Hugh looks like). The essays about Paul are often extremely touching, such as &quot;Baby Einstein&quot;, in which his brother finds out his wife can&apos;t have any more children. Because of this ability to move between the hilarious and the heartrending, some critics have compared him to Mark Twain and James Thurber. Sedaris himself prefers to invoke early Whoopi Goldberg stand up routines and, in particular, the all-singing, all-dancing American TV show, Glee. &quot;I love Glee. I cry all the time when I watch Glee because I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s satire or melodrama and that makes me feel like the writing is aware of itself, and that makes it OK to cry,&quot; he\u00a0says. A somewhat trickier issue about the categorisation of Sedaris&apos;s work arose in 2007 when the journalist Alex Heard wrote an article questioning whether Sedaris&apos;s stories are as true as he claimed. The fact that he wrote the piece for the New Republic \u2013 a magazine which became infamous when one of its reporters, Stephen Glass, was caught fabricating news stories \u2013 was ironic enough. That Heard pointed out that a hospital Sedaris describes as &quot;gothic&quot; in one story is actually &quot;Tuscan revival&quot; tipped the whole venture into self-parody. Although the furore has since died down it still upsets Sedaris. &quot;I just thought, what do people think this kind of writing is? I&apos;m not a reporter. Do I exaggerate? Boy, do I, and I&apos;d do it more if I could get away with it,&quot; he says, his voice going just that little bit higher. David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker, which regularly publishes Sedaris, is far more sanguine. &quot;As a magazine, it&apos;s important to find a way to publish what David does, or what Thurber did, or what many humorist-memoirists have done, which is to tell the truth even while pushing against the stubborn facts. Our fact-checkers do check his pieces and David cooperates with that. Still, I think readers understand that they should read David Sedaris with a different understanding than the way they read hardcore investigative reporting.&quot;. &quot;I just think,&quot; Sedaris adds, &quot;that the people who say: &apos;That&apos;s not true&apos; when someone tells a story at dinner are the people who didn&apos;t get any laughs when they told their story.&quot; In any event, although he might confuse his architectural terms, he gets the important stuff right. Judging from the few instances his father Lou has appeared in the press, his son seems to have been captured him with little exaggeration. When Sedaris appeared at Carnegie Hall in 2002, a reporter from the New York Observer asked Lou whether he had ever expected to see his son playing Carnegie Hall. &quot;Well,&quot; his dad replied, &quot;I expected to see him cleaning Carnegie Hall.&quot; There is one issue on which Sedaris has recently retracted: technology. Although he still doesn&apos;t have a mobile phone, he recently did what he promised he&apos;d never do: switch from his beloved typewriter to a computer. However, he conflates the words &quot;email&quot; and &quot;internet&quot; and he can&apos;t quite figure out exactly what the white rectangular square in his hand is \u2013 &quot;an iPod, no, it&apos;s an iPad, no it&apos;s an iPod&quot;. At one point, he needs to get an address from his iSomething, but finds he can&apos;t operate it (&quot;Well, this is no good!&quot;) and so reaches for his trusty, battered notebook instead. After all, when the authentic option is there in his pocket, there is no need for anything else."}, {"sentences": ["Info: padlondon.net Low point: &quot;Designing an arts and crafts-inspired house in Tokyo, then finding that the proportions had been changed without my\u00a0permission.&quot;"], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-11T21:29:01Z", "title": "Portrait of the artist: Nigel Coates, architect", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/oct/11/nigel-coates-architect", "article": "Describe the first building that inspired you.

How has the recession affected British\u00a0architecture?  It has dented the courage that goes with architecture, but I&apos;m hoping it will also encourage architectural thinkers to be more radical. Life has changed so much in the last decade \u2013 we now live with our heads half in the virtual world \u2013 but\u00a0a lot of architecture has remained mainstream and predictable. It needs to square up to the challenge of representing the way we live now. Name a building or public space you wish you had designed yourself.  The Diagonal Mar park in Barcelona. Enric Miralles constructed it as a sort of parallel nature: bent tubes and swirling sculptural structures interconnect with vines and plants. In England, the idea of public space tends to be acres of paving slabs with nothing on them. What&apos;s the greatest threat to architecture today? Project managers and dull developers. Architecture requires artistry \u2013 but to save money, that&apos;s often the first thing to go. The windows get smaller, the bricks get cheaper, and gradually the building loses the architect&apos;s details. What advice would you give a young architect? Engage passionately with your surroundings by looking and drawing. The latter is important: when I started to study, I could draw, but by the end, I had been taught to draw badly, with a hard pencil. Take a soft pencil, and draw vivaciously and three-dimensionally. Is there anything about your career you regret? No. I&apos;m very accepting of what fate serves up. What one song would work as the soundtrack to your life?  Io Vorrei... Non Vorrei... Ma Se Vuoi, by\u00a0Lucio Battisti.

This year, we asked: which 100 of today&apos;s private cleantech companies are the most likely to make the most significant market impact over the next 5-10 years? Hundreds of worldwide cleantech experts \u2013 including companies themselves \u2013 nominated the list, which also included so-called &quot;passive&quot; nominations and validations derived from analysing market data, taking votes of confidence in a company&apos;s ability to achieve high growth and high-market impact from market transactions such as investment rounds, and major customer and partnership announcements. To be on the list, companies must be independent, for-profit, cleantech companies that are not listed on any major stock exchange. In 2010, 4,616 nominations were received from 3,260 unique sources, resulting in a longlist of 3,138 companies. A weighting and filter system was then applied to collate the results, score each company, and reduce the candidates to a shortlist of 218 companies to present to an expert advisory panel in a second stage of the process. Here members of the expert panel combine their votes with scores carried through from the first stage. Ultimately firms are scored on three key criteria: their innovation, their market&apos;s size and growth, and the company&apos;s ability and resources to execute its technology. The result is this authoritative guide to the best 100 companies in cleantech. Clearly, there are many, fine companies who are not on the 2010 list. They may be waiting to be discovered, they may be out of favour this year for whatever reason or they may simply have just missed the cut. Only so many companies can be on the list.

When Murray beat J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy 6-3, 6-4 in the third round of the Shanghai Masters today, he confirmed his right to be among the elite eight at the O2 Arena again, alongside Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, who have already qualified. &quot;It&apos;s a great achievement,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I&apos;m very happy to have done it with a few tournaments left. I was happy with the way I played today, too.&quot; While a smiling Murray, Federer and Djokovic made it through to tomorrow&apos;s quarter-finals with plenty to spare, Nadal looked mentally and physically drained losing to J\u00fcrgen Melzer, who stretched him in the semi-finals of the French Open and did so again in front of a stunned audience here, winning 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. The world No1 last lost a set 6-1 a year ago at the O2, to Nikolay Davydenko. That was a humiliation; this was a minor shock, not totally unexpected, given that the Spaniard hinted earlier in the week he was struggling at the end of what has been another demanding if trophy-laden season. &quot;Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and today wasn&apos;t my day,&quot; Nadal conceded. &quot;I didn&apos;t play well. I arrived to this part of the season playing well, but probably a little bit more tired than usual.&quot; Melzer said: &quot;I felt he was uncomfortable after a few games. His backhand was sometimes just dying in the net. The key was to put a lot of pressure on him. You cannot let him play his game. He&apos;s just too good.&quot; Murray, meanwhile, plays another Frenchman, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, tomorrow and said: &quot;I feel way better than I did 10 days ago.&quot; Ten days ago he was as low as he has been all season, struck down by illness that left his head throbbing and robbed his limbs of energy as he staggered away from the China Open in Beijing. But Murray has learned how to come back from adversity. Today his tennis was full of punchy forehands, more drop shots \u2013 a few of them excellent, a couple not so good \u2013 and a nerveless service game that kept Chardy deep behind the baseline. Talented and dangerous, Chardy rarely stretched the relaxed Scot in the 81 minutes their match lasted in front of a small crowd at the 15,000-seat main stadium court at this well-appointed complex on the outskirts of Shanghai. &quot;The two weeks between now and Valencia [where he won last year] will be important for me so that I train properly and get myself in good match shape again,&quot; Murray said. &quot;There&apos;s not much point in trying to get stronger or faster because there&apos;s not really enough time. But I&apos;ll try to improve that little bit by spending more time on the court and then December is when I&apos;ll work really, really hard again. &quot;I know exactly where I&apos;m going to be and what I&apos;m going to do in terms of the Hopman Cup and preparations for the Australian Open. But I&apos;ll sit down after here and talk about what the goals are physically in that period and to make sure I spend enough time on the court, enough time in the gym.&quot; While Nadal chose to play on after the US Open, reaching the semi-finals in Bangkok and winning in Tokyo last week, Federer rested \u2013 and he looks ominously fresh and strong, beating the Italian Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-4 tonight."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo complained about the currency policies being pursued by its neighbour, only to be rebuffed by Seoul."], "tags": ["International trade", "WTO", "Currencies", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business", "World news", "Economic policy", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-14T15:07:17Z", "title": "Threat of 1930s-style protectionism is looming, warns WTO director-general Pascal LOamy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/14/pascal-lamy-wto-1930s-protectionism", "article": "The man responsible for policing global trade warned policymakers today that growing currency tensions risked the return of 1930s-style protectionism. Amid fresh evidence that governments are seeking to boost their own economies&apos; growth by manipulating their exchange rates, Pascal Lamy expressed concern that the next step would be the erection of tariff barriers. &quot;We have been living with this for two years,&quot; the director general of the World Trade Organisation told the Guardian on a visit to London to meet government ministers. &quot;The question is whether this [the anti-protectionist mood] is stable or risks being dented by currency developments. There is a risk and the risk is not nil.&quot; Lamy said: &quot;What should be avoided is a domino effect, where you get a beggar-my-neighbour, or tit-for-tat, chain and it sours and sours.&quot; He added that the existence of the WTO, the fear of a return to the experience of the 1930s and the increasingly integrated nature of global trade had so far deterred governments from raising barriers to imports, but warned that the reluctance to use protectionist measures was now being tested. A currency war and protectionism were the only two problems the global economy had not faced during the crisis of the past three years, Lamy said. Markets are anxiously awaiting the release tomorrow of the US treasury&apos;s half-yearly report to Congress on whether any country has been &quot;manipulating&quot; its currency against the US dollar. Despite strained relations between Washington and Beijing, the US treasury has so far avoided branding China a currency manipulator \u2013 a move that would see an escalation in what some policymakers have already dubbed a &quot;currency war&quot;. Chris Turner, an economist at ING, said: &quot;We believe the White House will still prefer to keep lines of communication open with Beijing, and China will not be named. Were China to be named, US asset markets could come under heavy pressure on fear of a trade war.&quot; Figures released in Washington today showed the US trade deficit with China reaching a fresh record of $28bn (\u00a318bn) in August, up from $25.2bn the previous month, while the overall trade gap widened from $42.6bn to $46.3bn. Paul Dales, a US economist with Capital Economics, said: &quot;The widening in the international trade deficit, and in particular the jump in the bilateral deficit with China to a record high, will only fuel growing speculation of a currency war.&quot; Lamy saw for himself the signs of growing stress in the international currency system when he attended last week&apos;s meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He said there were different ways in which countries were manipulating their currencies. Japan and South Korea were intervening directly; Brazil had used controls on capital inflows; Britain and the US were thinking of pumping more money into their economies . In the 1930s, countries used both devaluation and tariffs to insulate themselves from the impact of the Great Depression. The collapse of the gold standard allowed nations to seek an edge through cheaper exports, which led to retaliation both in the currency markets and through the erection of tariff barriers. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed after the second world war and Lamy said the WTO was studying the Gatt rules to see if they could be used to prevent a new wave of protectionism. Lamy&apos;s comments came as a fresh spat emerged between two of the most important exporting nations in Asia \u2013 Japan and South Korea. Tokyo complained about the currency policies being pursued by its neighbour, only to be rebuffed by Seoul."}, {"sentences": ["1 Edinburgh 2 York 3 Durham 4 Bath 5 Cambridge Favourite overseas city      Rainbow Bridge across Tokyo Bay     Sydney, winner for the previous two years, slips down to third to be replaced by Tokyo \u2013 home of all things hi-tech, modish and online \u2013 which storms in from nowhere in a bold neon blaze 1 Tokyo 2 Berlin 3 Sydney 4 San Francisco 5 Krakow Favourite European country      Yodelay-ee-oo...

Last year it was the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of a recession and a slump in the value of sterling, making holidays more expensive at a time when people could least afford them. This year, the storm was tangible, in the form of the Iceland volcanic ash cloud \u2013 a phenomenon of sci-fi-like proportions that grounded flights across much of Europe in April and threatened to cast a pall over the entire summer. Then there was the more antediluvian threat of the niggling BA &quot;will they, won&apos;t they?&quot; strikes. All of which goes to show that, by now, we should have probably come to expect the unexpected. Travellers are certainly learning to be more adaptable \u2013 witness the ingenuity of many who had to make long journeys by road, rail and boat during the ash cloud shutdown. And travel companies are also making valiant efforts to respond to rapidly changing and often unforeseen circumstances. Despite all of this, survey after survey shows that people continue to regard holidays as a priority. Certainly, our own readership are a well-travelled bunch \u2013 Guardian readers take a total of 4.8 million holidays a year, Observer readers 3.6 million and users of guardian.co.uk 12.4 million.

Now that Shanghai looks in parts like Beverly Hills and Delhi is lighting up with Thai restaurants, there are few cities on the planet that are less western than Tokyo \u2013 even if it&apos;s not necessarily a part of any east that you might recognise. The abiding allure of Japan&apos;s huge network of tiny details is that, like something in a Salman Rushdie novel, it seems to blur all notions of high and low, east and west, old and new into one state-of-the-art global amusement park that is wildly fresh and novel in its best incarnations, and at least zany in its worst. I&apos;ve lived at a safe distance from Japan&apos;s capital for 23 years now, in Kyoto and Nara, three or four hours away by train and several centuries away in terms of their antique pasts. But if I were going to Tokyo tomorrow, I would, on arrival, hold off on the &quot;maid cafes&quot; in the nerds&apos; electronic hive of Akihabara, on the Hysteric Glamour fashions around Harajuku, even on the gleaming shops of the Ginza that have long made Tokyo seem an early visitor from the 23rd century. Instead I&apos;d begin by looking for the old.     Tokyo's Ginza district. Photograph: Alamy    The evergreen riddle of Japan, after all, is that all its revolving-door fashions, fascination with the west and hunger for the new never seem to make it any less Japanese at the core; the place is like a froth of shifting surfaces and flashing images projected on an old, strangely shaped piece of wood that never moves. My Japanese wife is mad for Marilyn Manson and Metallica and used to gun her Honda Hurricane around the winding streets of Kyoto. But every day, before she heads out in her leather jacket, she places fresh water in a bowl around the small shrine she&apos;s set up, and an apple for the gods; she cleans every item of clothing either of us have used the previous day; and then she puts on a CD of monks chanting and sits stock-still in her chair in meditation. Much of Japan is like that still, and if you&apos;re arriving in Tokyo soon \u2013 especially if you&apos;re coming from far away and are jet lagged \u2013 the first place I&apos;d recommend you see is the Tsukiji fish market (tsukiji-market.or.jp) visiting ideally as close to 5am as possible. Nothing will convince you more quickly that you&apos;re not in Kansas (or Hampstead) any more, and the sushi you can try nearby will tell you you&apos;re not at Wagamama either. From there I&apos;d suggest heading to Ueno, a slightly down-at-heel area, built around a park, that still has a\u00a0faintly rural feel and reminds you of what Tokyo used to be when its Meiji refashioners, in the late 19th century, took their cues from London and Paris. Wander through the Tokyo National Museum (tnm.go.jp/en), which has perhaps the best collection of classical Japanese art in the world. At dusk, for this opening immersion, I would head towards Asakusa Kannon Temple, whose great front gate makes you feel as if you&apos;re entering a Hiroshige woodcut. One of the centres of Shitamachi, the old &quot;Low City&quot; of Edo (even by the end of the 18th century the city was the world&apos;s largest in terms of population), it still has echoes of the time when it sat at the heart of a bustling entertainment district, home to the country&apos;s first cinema and first music hall. The power of Japan, for me, lies in everything you find here that you couldn&apos;t imagine seeing in another country, even \u2013 sometimes especially \u2013 when what you think you&apos;re enjoying is something foreign, deliciously lost in translation. Last month, McDonald&apos;s outlets across the nation were serving Tsukimi, or &quot;Moon-Viewing&quot; burgers \u2013 a moon-like fried egg between the buns \u2013 in honour of the harvest moon that has been ritually observed for millennia across east Asia. On your second day, there&apos;s something to be said for going to Kamakura (city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/english), the leafy, temple-filled mini-Kyoto that&apos;s only an hour away from Tokyo by train. Just ramble through its leafy lanes, walk into shrines that look deserted, breathe in the quiet of a place that was Japan&apos;s capital from 1185 to 1333 and has been a kind of resting place ever after. It&apos;s part of the curiosity of contemporary Japan that it presents you with some of the most jangled and mishmashed, unattractive urban landscapes in the world and yet, in many places, every little shop and cafe you enter will be immaculate and exquisite, whether it plays only Beatles records or Mozart. The details are often perfect, even as the whole sounds like 15 languages shouted all at once. And to savour Japan, it makes most sense to seek out its privacies, its secret corners; until I came here, I\u00a0never realised that the society famous for its conformist surfaces is \u2013 for that very reason, perhaps \u2013 a home to wild obsessives, who have collected every King Crimson bootleg in existence or will show you their collection of videos of ancient Hawaii Five-O episodes. In these ways, it&apos;s best to browse Tokyo, to get lost, almost as if you were in some virtual reality; more than any city I know, the place is like a website, alight with odd links, hobbyists&apos; addenda, animated figures and racing graphics. And once you&apos;ve tasted a\u00a0little of the old city, like striking a\u00a0gong or a temple bell before a feast, you can fling yourself into the new. The Mori Art Museum (mori.art.museum/eng) on the 53rd floor of the Mori Tower in the Roppongi Hills complex, say, whose sleek passageways and views over the city and make it look like a high-definition TV screen writ large. There are dog rental stores around town, vending machines selling underwear and whisky, and three-star Michelin restaurants with only a single table and a few seats at the bar (Yukimura, 1-5-5.Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku, +81 3 5772 1610). At the New Otani hotel (newotani.co.jp/en/tokyo) you can enjoy a\u00a0400-year-old Japanese garden and a rooftop rose garden with 2,000 bushes, where fireflies flicker in the summer.     Bar in Roppongi, Tokyo. Photograph: Alamy    The very best side of Tokyo comes out \u2013 though perhaps this is true of every place \u2013 when you can see the strange and the familiar all at once. Go out drinking in Roppongi on a Saturday night and you&apos;ll half-believe you&apos;re in LA, or at least Hong Kong, among the Romanian restaurants and Filipina hostess clubs; then, on Sunday morning, walk down Omotesando street, past all the note-perfect French cafes and high-end boutiques, with the Kings Road of Takeshita street just a short hop away. On Sunday afternoons, on Jingu Bridge, at the end of Omotesando, &quot;cosplay&quot; (a mix of &quot;costume&quot; and &quot;play&quot;) girls from the suburbs come out in their wild outfits, dressed as nurses or goths or dominatrices or Alice in Wonderland. Costumes, you will soon register, are as outlandish as uniforms are constant in Japan, if only because the same people who are dressed down for six days every week get their own back by dressing up on Sundays. Right behind the bridge, wide pathways take you to the Meiji shrine (meijijingu.or.jp/english), where you are back in the thick, textured, slightly elusive place that has altered very little over centuries. Shrine maidens dressed all in white \u2013 traditionally they were virgins \u2013 are selling good luck charms for passing exams to the wild teenage girls in microskirts and fishnet stockings whose hairstyles seem to have been copied from Lady Gaga. Everywhere in Japan there are things that are worth doing just because they can&apos;t be done in quite the same way anywhere else. Try to arrive at a\u00a0fancy department store at 10 am, when it opens, to see the scores of perfectly coiffed employees lined up to call out a formal welcome. Try Isetan (isetan.co.jp) in Shinjuku; you can spend the next many hours lost in the capacious food halls in its basement. Look for the three-course &quot;teishoku&quot; set lunches, which will offer you the same food you&apos;d spend \u00a320 on at dinnertime for a third of the price. And never spurn a convenience store, because there is more in their small heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your philosophy. The first time I came to Japan, as a sightseer 25 years ago, I made sure to take myself to Tokyo Disneyland (tokyodisneyresort.co.jp) so I could see the whole seamless, public and well-organised society in miniature; I could get a (cartoon version, but defiantly partisan) tour of Japanese history in one pavilion, eat melon sorbets in another and see on every side how Japan had taken something deeply American and made it entirely its own (and cleaner, quieter, more efficient). In time though, after I came to live here, I began to see how much of Japan can be enjoyed as a kind of theme park, where most people are dressed up to play a part, as polite, chirpy and eager to please as one of Walt Disney&apos;s Mouseketeers, and inhabiting what looks less like real life and more like a super-synthetic version of The Happiest Place on Earth. There are 35 million people in Greater Tokyo \u2013 more than in all of Canada \u2013 and when you arrive at Tokyo station you may feel that they&apos;re all streaming past you at the same time. Two million souls do indeed pour through Shinjuku station every day. But what ultimately stays with many a\u00a0visitor to the epicentre of Japan are the moments of stillness, of collectedness, of almost mysterious remoteness, where you see the changeless nerve centre from which all the wild changes arise.

Boy, for example, the latest from Taika &quot;Eagle Vs Shark&quot; Waititi is a New Zealand charmer in a Son Of Rambow vein that&apos;s wasted on the youth, while the UK premiere of Moomins And The Comet Chase (with theme tune by Bj\u00f6rk) is as likely to appeal to 30- and 40-year-olds as much as their offspring, and a documentary on Troll 2, followed by the movie itself, is the stuff of adult bad movie events surely? There are actually resources for teachers and school visits, just to reaffirm the child focus, as well as fun workshops and masterclasses. Closing film Neuk\u00f6lln Unlimited, on refugee Lebanese rappers in Berlin, for example, is preceded by a breakdancing masterclass \u2013 not a good idea for over-18s with any sense of dignity. DCA, Sat to 3 Nov; discoveryfilmfestival.org.uk Compass Festival Of Lunacy, Bristol     The Hour Of The Wolf. Photograph: Allstar    More concerned with overabundances of imagination than serious mental health issues, this catchily titled festival retreats from reality in the macabre splendour of the Old Coroner&apos;s Court. There you&apos;ll find mind-altering enhanced screenings such as Richard Linklater&apos;s philosophical animation Waking Life with live music, Bergman&apos;s arresting foray into gothic horror, The Hour Of The Wolf (with intro), Svankmajer&apos;s nightmare fairytale Alice or expressionist silent The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari (plus carnivalesque cabaret). And don&apos;t get carried away at the horror-themed Halloween party. Old Coroner&apos;s Court, Thu to 31 Oct, compassfestival.blogspot.com Africa In Motion, Edinburgh &amp; Touring     Sex, Okra and Salted Butter.    It can&apos;t be the weather, but Scotland in autumn has somehow become a second home for African cinema in the past five years, and the festival is still growing - over 70 films from 28 countries this year. To the fore are musical themes and the 17 nations celebrating the 50th anniversary of their independence. In the former instance, catch up on your next-level beats with documentaries on everything from Moroccan hip-hop and MIA-endorsed Angolan kuduro to Papa Wemba and the designer label-mad clubbers of Ghana (The Importance Of Being Elegant). In the latter there&apos;s Chadian Cannes-winner Mahamat-Saleh Haroun&apos;s latest, Sex, Okra And Salted Butter, Senegalese feminist melodrama Madame Brouette, and fresh angles on Congo in documentaries Congo In Four Acts and The World&apos;s Most Dangerous Place For Women. All this plus a look at emerging east African film industries.

Cure Maid (Gee Store 6F, 3-15-5 Soto-kanda, Chiyoda-ku; curemaid.jp) is one of the oldest cafes, where the girls act like Victorian maids.

Some now offer health treatments, and there is even an &quot;ear cleaning cafe&quot;, where you lay your head in the lap of a pretty lady while she extracts wax from your lugholes. Nightlife Nomihoudai is a magic word to any expats or visitors in Japan; it means &quot;all-you-can-drink&quot;, so you pay for two hours of boozing rather than buying individual drinks. Try Za Watami, part of the Watami restaurants group, with English menus. The Alcatraz ER theme bar (alcatraz.hy-system.com) is a bonkers experience with prison decor and staff dressed as deranged doctors. Or try the childish Kagaya bar (B1F Hanasada Building, 5-12 Shinbashi 2-Chome, Minato-ku; tinyurl.com/37dm9f4) where you choose a country from a list and are brought drinks from that place, sometimes in joke glasses that shake or make noises, by a guy pretending to be a frog. Eating and drinking Meat lovers rejoice \u2013 Tokyo is home to a &quot;meat theme park&quot;. That&apos;s right, not only does the Metrea Meat Theme Park feature seven restaurants (one of which serves a pork tonkatsu ice-cream cone), it also has a meat museum (2-1-6 Minami-Osawa, Hachioji; tinyurl.com/ydgazq5). The Ninja Restaurant is designed on principles relating to the ninja life. They live for war, so dark seating areas are tucked behind fortress-like walls and lit by lanterns; there is a cigar room in the style of a cave; and the bar has an inconspicuous entrance ninjaakasaka.com). Relaxation  Going to an onsen, or hot spring, is obligatory while in Japan, but for an unusual experience try the Ooedo Onsen Monogatari (tinyurl.com/yl8ffhv), a period spa complex designed to look like a recreation of Edo-era Tokyo (1603-1868). Unusual treatments at this one include getting buried in hot sand. Quirky museums The earthquake simulation centre (The Ikebukuro Bosaikan, 2-37-8 Nishi Ikebukuro, Toshima Ward; +81 33590 6565, closed Tuesday) recreates the experience of being in an earthquake \u2013 walls shake, furniture collapses. It&apos;s run by the Tokyo fire brigade to educate people about what to do in such an emergency. &quot;Take time to learn about the wonderful world of the parasites&quot; goes the slogan at the world&apos;s only parasitological museum (Meguro Parasitological Museum, 4-1-1 Shimomeguro, Meguro-ku, kiseichu.org/english.aspx), which explains the biology of creatures that use living hosts as their food source.

Such is the premise for one of the most poetic and influential films ever made. Coppola, Scorsese and Spielberg all cite this adaptation of Alberto Moravia&apos;s novel as a profound influence on their films. Coppola even lured Bertolucci&apos;s director of photography, Vittorio Storaro, to the Philippines to bring his talents to bear on Apocalypse Now. What wowed them? The symbolic colour-coded photography, the virtuosic flashback structure, and, no doubt, the idea that you could explore something as seemingly unfilmable as the psychopathology of fascism in that paradoxical object, an art film filled with\u00a0car chases, sex and violence.

Indeed, The Conformist is a compendium of virtuosic flourishes: the chilly framing of iconic fascist buildings such as the Esposizione Universale Roma in Rome and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris; the expressionist angles when Clerici visits his dotty mother. And, best of all, the ingenious sequence in a Parisian cafe in which Clerici&apos;s reluctance to participate in a dance leaves him surrounded by a tightening spiral of dancers shot from above, making him appear to us exactly what he is: a conformist alone in any crowd.

Is there a romance more mysterious than Mizoguchi&apos;s Ugetsu Monogatari? Is there action to surpass Kurosawa&apos;s Seven Samurai? And, in terms of family drama, has any film been more moving than Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story?  Time and again, Ozu has made films about family, and the shifting structure we refer to as &quot;time and again&quot;. Family is less a fixed entity than a kind of weather system that keeps coming back. So children need parents, and need to outlive them. But while the weather will go on, and your children will become parents, so your life will close, and you will not be there to see the way your own children look back as if to say they understand you, too late.  Is this tragedy or comedy? Ozu is never quite sure. He seems to wonder whether any progression can amount to tragedy, or whether it is not simply as inevitable as passing time and changing\u00a0light. This may not sound &quot;entertaining&quot; or active or even interesting, which only means the viewer needs to undergo the gentle process of being helped to see through Ozu&apos;s withdrawn but compassionate style. So he watches from the corner of a room at a low level (for Japanese domestic life is often conducted from a sitting position) and he declines to rush in with forgiving, approving, loving close-ups \u2013 because he believes people are beyond forgiveness or individual glamour.  Family is a group in which everyone has his or her reason. In Tokyo Story, Shukishi and Tomi Hirayama (Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama) visit their grown children, full of hope and the wish to be recognised, but they find the children too busy, too preoccupied. This is not depicted as bad behaviour, or a sign of cultural breakdown; it is the way of the world. The acting is intimate, humane and reserved yet there are no stars, let alone heroes or heroines. There are no &quot;happy endings&quot; in the terms western culture requires. Instead, the riddle of happiness or its opposite runs through &quot;time and again&quot; like light on moving water.

This week, for instance, without paying a penny, you could see BBC Dragon James Caan talking about entrepreneurship at the London School of Economics, and next week there&apos;s a discussion on the future of transport at Blackwell&apos;s bookshop in Manchester, or a speech on the aesthetics of litter at Leeds University. Check lecturelist.org, the Guardian Guide, the listings in the back of Prospect\u00a0magazine or the Saturday Review. LB Sneak a peek at a theatre rehearsal If you enjoy new writing, then it does not come any newer than the &quot;rehearsed reading&quot;. This type of performance allows a play to be shown to audiences cheaply and quickly, helping all those involved to hone the production before it reaches the stage. For around \u00a35, you can watch a play as it takes shape, and often even contribute to discussions. To find one, contact your nearest new writing theatre, such as the Royal Court in London or the Tron in Glasgow. LB Mug up on your art Many galleries offer free tours and workshops. In the coming days, kids visiting Manchester Art Gallery can make themselves into human machines while adults can listen to a panel discussion on the subject Design = Art? at Birmingham&apos;s Ikon Gallery, or visit the British Museum for a lunchtime talk on the art of the kingdom of Gandhara.

Photograph: Getty    Swap your old books The problem with your personal library is that it contains precisely those books that you do not want to read, because you&apos;ve read them already \u2013 or given up. So why not exchange them for someone else&apos;s? Visit a site such as readitswapit.co.uk, bookmooch.com or bookins.com, list your books, send them off, and then search for others to exchange your credit for. All you pay is the postage. The principle works just as well without the internet, of course, at organised events such as the Firestation Book Swap (\u00a35 entry), which is based in Windsor and also tours the country. LB Join a choir As Gareth Malone unceasingly demonstrates on television, singing in a choir can be tremendous fun. Large amateur groups\u00a0are the perfect place for an inexperienced singer to start building confidence. For many, the most obvious option is their local church choir. If that&apos;s not to your taste, there may well also be a choral society or community choir nearby. Scan the links on choralsociety.org.uk, or check your local paper. LB Watch a radio or TV recording It shouldn&apos;t really be possible to see some of some of Britain&apos;s most popular performers live, in small venues, for no money. But by visiting bbc.co.uk/showsandtours/tickets or tvrecordings.com you can do it pretty much every week. Currently available are seats in the audience for Harry Hill&apos;s TV Burp, Celebrity Mastermind and The Hairy Bikers&apos; Cook-Off. Be advised: the best shows are often in London. LB Meet a celeb You don&apos;t have to pay anything to stand around and watch how awkward interactions play out, and if you are prepared to fork out for a book, you earn the right to share a moment with the celebrity in question. Be sure you get your money&apos;s worth by asking them the question no one else dares to.

HK Take a train through Ireland A four-day Golden Trekker pass for all trains in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is completely free \u2013 as long as you&apos;re over 66. And if you want to take in the country at a more leisurely place, simply apply for more than one pass. HK Sleep in someone else&apos;s bed House-sitting may not pay well but it does offer the chance of a break in someone else&apos;s life (and sometimes swimming pool). Adele Barclay from Homesitters says: &quot;There are a variety of homes, from flats in central London to remote country properties.&quot; In return for free accommodation, and a tax-free food allowance, you have to feed any pets, look after the pot plants and not leave the property for more than three consecutive hours in the day or an hour at night. If you fancy more freedom and far-flung locations you could try a home swap \u2013 where you exchange your\u00a0home with holidaymakers in your\u00a0destination of choice. Or if you don&apos;t mind staying on a sofa, there is always couchsurfing, which not only offers a free place to sleep, but a way to meet locals around the world (couchsurfing.org). HK Go back to university Cheap rooms in college halls are a great way to keep holiday costs down. The accommodation may be basic but the chance to wander through the corridors of historic halls and explore ancient colleges should make up for the wiry carpets and single beds. Bath, Oxford, Cambridge and London all\u00a0offer beds in beautiful buildings. Book a room at universityrooms.co.uk. HK     Enjoy splendid isolation at a remote bothy. Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Alamy    Get away from it all \u2013 and we mean all \u2013 at a bothy These are simple shelters in remote parts of the UK that are free to stay in, but definitely without home comforts \u2013 by which we mean a water supply or a toilet. Think of it like indoor camping, but what is lost in luxury can be gained in breathtaking scenery and splendid isolation (mountainbothies.org.uk). HK Learn to ski OK, not completely free \u2013 you need to book your flights and accommodation through one of six approved operators \u2013 but for a lot less than usual. The Association of Snow Sports Countries is offering novices free skiing tuition, lift passes and equipment hire as part of its Freshers Ski Weeks for seven days from 22 January or 19 March. Choose\u00a0from 25 resorts. HK Free castles, cathedrals and palaces On St Andrew&apos;s Day weekend (27\u00a0and 28 November) a huge number of historic sites \u2013 including Edinburgh Castle, Iona Abbey and Stirling Castle \u2013 will open their doors for free. For more information, see www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. HK Food and drink Review a new restaurant Mystery shopping is a great way to eat for free if you don&apos;t mind where you end up. This is how restaurant and cafe owners (as well as supermarkets, theme parks and everywhere else) do their own quality check before the critics find them. If you sign up to mystery-shoppers.co.uk you will receive an assignment and could find yourself reviewing a fine dining restaurant with up to \u00a375 to spend \u2013 or a local cafe with a fiver. But\u00a0beware of scams where agencies try to charge you to sign up with them. HK Make a gourmet dish from weeds It&apos;s a bumper year for hedgerows, according to forager Robin Harford, and now is the perfect time to start picking your own meals. &quot;The drier fruits are really lush this year. Try picking rosehips and making a syrup or a cordial \u2013 rosehips have 20 times as much vitamin C as oranges and taste absolutely fantastic. Dandelions are also good at this time of year \u2013 after they have flowered and seeded. Pick ones that have grown in the shade, saute the leaves and serve them with bacon.&quot; For more recipes and wild food, go to eatweeds.co.uk. HK Go down the pub With 50 pubs shutting every week, it is practically your civic duty to go to your local and be cheered up.

She was loved in private and public alike for her modesty, down-to-earth nature and defiance of protocol, characteristics which were given expression in her bestselling autobiography Auf dem Roten Teppich und Fest auf der Erde (On the Red Carpet and Feet on the Ground, 2010). She and her husband, avid smokers since their childhood, were well known for lighting up in public places well after the smoking ban was introduced. She often said that her love of nature had removed for her the fear of dying. &quot;It&apos;s a consolation that nothing in the earth&apos;s cycle is ever really lost,&quot; she said. The long and happy 68 years of marriage the Schmidts enjoyed both inspired and moved the German public, who seemed to take an increasing interest in them the older they got. As many perceived it, they had attained a state which many only dream of: a lifelong, loyal partnership where respect for each other and their individual personalities was uppermost. They had known each other for more than eight decades, first meeting at school as 10-year-olds. At a birthday party at the Schmidts&apos; house in 1929, Loki left her hat behind. Helmut was told to take it to her and was struck by her modest surroundings: &quot;The pathetic nature of the small two-room flat in the back courtyard of the building \u2026 dark but full of children and adults, which shocked me deeply.&quot; A friendship developed and from that a deep love and in 1942 they married. Their first child, a son, Helmut, died when he was seven months old. They had a daughter, Susanne, two years later. Loki said she only ever remembered having one blazing row with her husband and, although she&apos;d forgotten the reason for it, recalled throwing a wet dishcloth at him. &quot;It was prior to monetary reform and I couldn&apos;t afford to throw anything that would break,&quot; she said. She described life as the wife of the Social Democrat chancellor as tough, at the same time as enjoying it to the full, especially the foreign travel. One of the most testing times, however, was when the activities of the far-left urban guerilla movement the Red Army faction, were at their height. She recalled making the decision with her husband during a late-night stroll through the park at the back of their Bonn apartment that if either of them were kidnapped by the gang, they would not give in to any of their demands. &quot;The following day we put it in writing and after that, both of us felt rather better,&quot; she said. She was born Hannelore Glaser in Hamburg to an electrician father and a seamstress mother, and her life and public profile was very much shaped by her husband&apos;s time in office, between 1974 and 1982. But the former schoolteacher \u2013 who went into teaching only because her parents could not afford the fees needed for her to take up a degree in biology \u2013 was never short of her own passions and interests or intentions to follow them. She became involved in nature protection, particularly the fight to save endangered plants, admitting with glee that she had &quot;shamelessly taken advantage of my husband&apos;s name&quot; to push her cause. Her work, which included several books on botany and gardening, earned her international recognition and numerous prizes. During a research trip to Mexico in 1985, she discovered a previously unknown pineapple plant which was subsequently named after her: Pitcairnia Loki-Schmidtii. A Tunisian orchid and a new strain of dahlia also carry her name. On meeting Emperor Hirohito of Japan in the 1970s, she brought up the subject of rare fish breeds with him, despite having been instructed in advance that only he was allowed to determine the direction of conversation. &quot;The very old emperor then proceeded to tell her how proud he was that his son had just discovered a new breed of fish in Tokyo Bay,&quot; Helmut Schmidt recalled. Last Thursday she had been due to present the &quot;Flower of the Year&quot; award, at an event she had hosted for over 30 years, to the Narthecium. She is survived by her husband and daughter.  \u2022 Loki Schmidt, conservationist and teacher, born 3 March 1919; died 21 October 2010 in Hamburg-Langenhorn."}, {"sentences": ["   Sony's first Walkman, on display in Tokyo, Japan."], "tags": ["Sony", "Technology", "Film", "Culture", "Comedy", "Mel Gibson", "Sesame Street", "US television", "Children's TV", "Television"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-26T18:02:29Z", "title": "The Walkman has gone, and I must move on | Hadley Freeman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/26/walkman-hollywood-nostalgia-80s", "article": "   Sony's first Walkman, on display in Tokyo, Japan. Photograph: Shuji Kajiyama/AP    Not even a life spent chuffing down 17 packs of Lambert &amp; Butler a day while lying on a sunbed, face slathered in vegetable oil, fresh from a chemical peel, taking occasional breaks only to have one&apos;s skin scrubbed with sandpaper, rusty nails and acid will age a person as swiftly as waxing sentimental about objects from their childhood that were, unquestionably, crap. So stand by as I shrivel faster than the evil American Nazi at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade after drinking from the wrong cup. (Note to younger readers: this was like the whole of Benjamin Button, but in reverse and compressed into two minutes as opposed to two hours. Ah,\u00a0the good ol&apos; days.) Sony announced over the weekend that it has sent out its last shipment of Walkman portable cassette recorders. Now, if you are of a certain age, one that suggests you remember the happy days when the name &quot;Jordan&quot; referred to a Mr Knight as opposed to a Ms Price, your immediate, grief-struck reaction to this news will have been: &quot;Hang on, I can&apos;t hear you. Let me turn off my iPod.&quot; This will have been swiftly followed by surprise that Walkmen still exist, a brief interlude in which the issue of whether Walkmen is the correct plural of Walkman is hotly debated, a sense of overwhelming sadness that something you haven&apos;t thought about since roughly 1991 is no more, and then \u2013 having now moved into the sentimentally obsessive phase of grief \u2013 an urgent need to run home and order at least three Walkmen off\u00a0eBay while listening to the 80s Greatest Hits album you just ordered off iTunes. It was a design classic, you\u00a0know. Now, in defence of this particular 80s sentimentalist, I would like it to be on record \u2013 or on cassette, perhaps \u2013 that I have often thought how much better life was when one could rewind particular lyrics instead of having to skip to the beginning of the song, as one usually has to do with CDs and downloaded music. This was very useful for those of us who spent about 82% of our teenage lives attempting to fathom precisely what Robert Smith was saying in every single song by the Cure (further note to younger readers: this was in the days before lyrics.com or, indeed, anything.com. If all this evokes for you images as quaint as paintings of hardy pioneers, hands shielding their eyes as they gaze upon their grazing cattle, then I would like to make a initial gesture of protest, before shrugging and conceding that the analogy is fair enough.) It is hard to believe that any generation has been as preoccupied with immediacy and the latest technology while simultaneously being so sentimental about their childhoods as mine, but perhaps that&apos;s just me being sentimental. But with all the looking forward and looking backward it&apos;s amazing there isn&apos;t a whiplash epidemic among thirtysomethings, although it does explain the dizzy stupidity of some of the sentiment. John Cusack&apos;s 80s-themed movie Hot Tub Time Machine consisted of plenty of 80s artefacts and absolutely nothing in the way of plot or interest \u2013 it was, in fact, the perfect metaphor for 80s sentimentalism. Yet there is a certain irony in the fact that while 80s children and Hollywood might not be able to let the 80s go, as the recent and upcoming remakes of The Karate Kid and Top Gun prove, 80s products, such as floppy disks (discontinued earlier this year \u2013 quick, hie thee to eBay!) and, yes, the Walkman (which was invented in 1978 but, like me, came of age in the 80s), know when to bow\u00a0out. Heck, even the backing soundtrack to my 80s childhood, Sesame Street, moves with the times, with Bert appearing to have finally come out, tweeting that his hair is &quot;more &apos;mo&apos; than &apos;hawk&apos;&quot;. That Ernie is such a hottie (even in horizontal stripes! Work it, Ernie!), and Bert is such a deserving, upright fellow serves as some consolation for the fact that a Muppet is officially more with it than me, with a Twitter feed and everything. He probably even has an iPhone. Anyway, I can&apos;t talk any more. Huey Lewis is on American breakfast TV right now, speaking about the 25th anniversary of Back to the Future, to loud studio applause. Yes, Huey Lewis. Applause. Loud. He was a design classic, you know. Hypocrisy isn&apos;t funny   You may have noted a strange, tangy smell in the air \u2013 strange but not wholly unfamiliar. Base notes of nausea and idiocy, methinks. Ah yes, it is Eau d&apos;Hypocrisie d&apos;Hollywood, a parfum that is not nearly as limited an edition as some might prefer. This time, it wafts from the cast and crew of the upcoming sequel to The Hangover, who have heaved their persons up to the moral high ground and refused to let Mel Gibson guest-star in their movie. Gibson is a flawed fellow, no doubt, and it is pleasing that, for once, a celebrity&apos;s offscreen antics do seem to be having an effect on his career. But the Hangover posse&apos;s pose might have more heft if they themselves hadn&apos;t made a film nearly as racist (Chinese people talk funny! Hilarious!) and misogynistic (all women are shrews, except for strippers, who are awesome) as any of Gibson&apos;s deluded rants. Then there&apos;s the small point that the guest star in the first film was Mike Tyson, a\u00a0convicted rapist and ear-muncher. But let&apos;s not get all, like, boringly logical here and focus instead on Mel&apos;s possible replacement. Maybe they could give Roman Polanski a call.

How reckless the Brown government was! How could it possibly have saddled the coalition with an economy growing at 3.25% per annum (in real terms, after allowing for inflation)? Just\u00a0like Labour&apos;s friends, the Greeks... In case anybody out there had too much to drink last night and thinks I am being serious, it is time to reach for another black coffee and relax. I am being ironic. A growth rate described by government statisticians \u2013 an honest breed, not given to &quot;spin&quot; \u2013 as &quot;robust&quot; is a fortunate inheritance for the coalition. It demonstrates that the Labour government was not nearly as deficient in the matter of economic policy as George Osborne, in particular, maintains. There is a vulgar, indeed colloquial, usage of &quot;ironic&quot;, but one becoming so common that I suspect it is on the verge of gaining widespread lexicological acceptance. A typical example would be for me to say: how ironic that the &quot;robust&quot; statistics for Britain&apos;s recent rate of economic growth should be published the day after David Cameron promised us &quot;a strategy for growth&quot;. What a magic touch our new prime minister has! He has only to promise a strategy and, hey presto, its fruits are made manifest within 24 hours. [That&apos;s enough half\u2011term irony. Ed.] Cameron&apos;s promise was made to the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry. He promised growth based on overseas trade \u2013 rebalancing our economy towards a more sustainable ratio of exports to imports; encouraging new industries, not least &quot;green technology&quot;, to flourish; and investment in infrastructure. This was all worthy but vague, and even members of his friendly audience, such as David Frost, the director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, felt that the prime minister needed to commission a lot more detailed work on his new strategy. One thing we do know. The Cameron growth strategy will not resemble a Soviet, French or Labour government with a 1960s-style plan smacking of dirigisme. We have already had the coalition&apos;s five-year plan: it is a plan for what some regard as a shake\u2011up of the public sector and what others see as the wanton destruction of the welfare state as we should like to know it. But let us return to the growth we already have. After the freakish growth of 1.2% in gross domestic product in the first quarter, implying an unsustainable annual rate of some 5%, the City of London was brimming with analysts predicting a sharp slowdown. The preliminary estimate for growth in the third quarter, announced last week, of 0.8% \u2013 implying an annual rate of 3.25% \u2013 was greater than many had predicted, given the sluggishness of retail sales. That second-quarter figure was inflated by extra construction activity delayed by the heavy winter; government statisticians calculate that the &quot;underlying&quot; growth in each of the second and third quarters was indeed 0.8% per quarter, or an annual rate of some 3.25% over six months. Why so good? Well, there can be little doubt that a major factor was the fiscal and monetary stimulus which the Cameron-Osborne duumvirate did so much to attack at the time. And, in addition to the impact of the stock-building cycle (industry&apos;s stock levels were run down heavily during the recession), manufacturing output has been boosted by the devaluation of the pound. It has not been a formal devaluation of the sort that caused so much embarrassment to previous Labour governments, but a fall (on average, against the other major currencies) of about 20% since the average of 2005, the decline having been concentrated in 2008 and 2009 \u2013 ie, during the worst of the recession. There has also to be serious concern, at a time of 1930s-style competitive devaluation, about reliance on further depreciation of the pound, a subject of much speculation in the City. Now, in addition to my worries (expressed here last week) about the form of the coalition&apos;s attack on the deficit \u2013 the impact on the welfare state and the housing crisis \u2013 I am very concerned about the potential effect of the removal of the fiscal stimulus on the growth of the economy, and therefore on employment. The Tokyo-based economist Richard\u00a0Koo, of Nomura, has pointed out that private sector saving has been increasing faster than public sector deficits almost everywhere except in Greece. The deficit that the coalition goes on so much about is the counterpart of that private sector saving. It has for several years been the solution to dealing with the economic devastation caused by the financial crisis, not the problem.

It will also charge the highest commercial rents outside New York and Tokyo. The Renzo Piano-designed Shard could become a symbol of London&apos;s renewed vigour following the worst banking crash since 1929. It could also become the opposite, according to analysts who fear that Britain will fall back on its old allies of construction and financial services to boost recovery. This week the construction sector was found to be one of the main props holding up the UK&apos;s growth in national income. Commercial property and spending on infrastructure projects spurred a jump of 4% in overall bricks-and-mortar spending in the third quarter, the Office for National Statistics revealed, after a 9% rise in the previous quarter. Once the figures were fed into the ONS mincer, construction made up almost a third of growth in gross domestic product (GDP). The chancellor, George Osborne, was elated. Appearing before TV cameras, he focused on the headline figure that showed the UK grew by 0.8% in the three months to September, which was twice the City&apos;s more gloomy estimate. Osborne said the economy was growing strongly and was on track to meet forecasts for growth set by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Several investment banks provided helpful charts showing the UK recovering more strongly than in previous recessions. To most people, it seemed the prospect of massive public spending cuts was having little impact on the economy. But many analysts say we should ignore the headline figure and examine which sectors that are propelling the economy and how they are likely to fare. In the construction sector, a rally that began last year is expected to peter out. &quot;Everyone is wondering where growth is coming from,&quot; says Mel Budd, a construction forecaster at the analyst Leading Edge. Kelly Forrest, a construction economist at the Construction Products Association, says the commercial market&apos;s strength was probably the biggest surprise. &quot;The private sector has bounced back quite strongly but from a low base. There has been some recovery, but there are question marks as to whether it can be sustained.&quot; Developers in London especially have started projects recently as City rents rise and forecasters predict a shortage of office space.

The last two are unlikely to have fed into the third-quarter figures but the Shard, which is in its most costly phase as its glass cladding is fitted, will have. Two other factors have boosted construction this year. Housebuilders saw a brief recovery early this year, with the industry&apos;s top names talking of hiring 10,000 people. That will have affected recent output levels. The previous government&apos;s stimulus efforts on public housing and schools construction will also have boosted numbers, according to Forrest. &quot;Public-sector construction output continued to rise in the third quarter. We expect that to fall away from early next year,&quot; Forrest says. The best guide to what will happen in construction is the government&apos;s new orders data, and it tells a grim story. Housing orders are down sharply, especially as the government&apos;s decision to give more power back to local councils starts to bite and they reject planning applications after the relaxation of regional housebuilding targets. Few have confidence in the government&apos;s claims that it will build more homes than its predecessor, at least not in the short term. But perhaps the biggest question remains the health of the commercial sector (offices, retail and industrial), which makes up almost a quarter of construction activity in the good times. New orders of commercial buildings rose towards the end of 2009, but then fell back 7% in the second quarter of this year. The sector will also need to rise strongly to offset falls in public-sector building. Forrest says: &quot;The outlook is a lot less optimistic than the figures for the second and third quarters suggest.&quot; Without construction to lift growth, the economy will fall back on its old favourite: financial services. Banking, insurance, legal and accountancy services dropped like a stone after the Lehman Brothers crash of 2008. Since then they have recovered strongly and not only made up a significant slice of UK growth, but also propped up exports. Manufacturing has regained some of the losses from the crisis, but has yet to show signs of a renaissance. It was with this in mind that the eminent economic historian Robert Skidelsky argued on BBC radio that Osborne was &quot;economically illiterate&quot;. Why, he asked, was the chancellor relying on figures showing the economy was growing when these were obviously retrospective? Spending cuts would lay waste to vital parts of industry, force up unemployment and shatter regional economies reliant on public investment. Skidelsky warns of a double-dip recession. A devout Keynesian, he derides the government&apos;s reliance on monetarist remedies, including the prospect of quantitative easing by the Bank of England. He is not certain the economy is on a crash course but like many commentators he fears Osborne&apos;s refusal to consider alternatives if austerity erodes confidence and kills growth. He stresses that the comprehensive spending review, which cut all important investment as well as current expenditure, raises the risk of this. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which monitors sentiment in the economy, agrees. He fears that the coalition&apos;s determination to withdraw support for the economy at such a delicate stage will bring about a double dip. &quot;With construction still the main driver of the stronger-than-expected GDP figure, and a deteriorating outlook for that sector and lower public spending, there is still a chance that the economy may need a further shot of stimulus in the near future,&quot; he says. &quot;At the moment the only medicine available seems to be additional quantitative easing by the Bank of England.&quot; Simon Kirby, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, warns that the effects of quantitative easing are unknown. &quot;They could be beneficial or they could be costly and long-lasting. It&apos;s for this reason we think the government should adopt a less stringent fiscal policy in the short term. It would allow the economy to establish a growth pattern before fiscal tightening takes effect,&quot; he says. John Philpott, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, is even more strident. He says: &quot;QE2 [a second round of quantitative easing] is the ultimate escape route for fiscal masochists who reckon the chancellor doesn&apos;t need a plan B if public spending cuts and tax measures drive the economy back into recession. But what they overlook is that macho monetarism only works to stimulate demand, investment and jobs under certain conditions \u2013 and early post-recession Britain doesn&apos;t fit the bill.&quot; No amount of skyscrapers will propel the UK out of recession, he adds. &quot;Not only is the usual mechanism for transmitting extra money to businesses and households screwed up as the banks put their financial safety above the national interest but business and consumer confidence is anyway weak against a backdrop of economic uncertainty both at home and abroad. &quot;This is precisely the situation Keynes warned about in the 1930s when describing the impotence of monetary policy in a depressed economy. Simplistic reliance on QE2 could prove to be our own version of what Keynes called the futility of &apos;pushing on a string&apos;. &quot;If George Osborne really wants to avoid a double-dip recession he should abandon the &apos;carry on regardless&apos; school of fiscal policy and take a much more cautious approach to cutting the deficit. He can&apos;t assume QE2 will help him out.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Last year, in Tokyo, we were right there until half-time but I&apos;d come off with a dead leg."], "tags": ["Autumn internationals", "England rugby union team", "Martin Johnson", "New Zealand rugby union team", "Sport", "Australia rugby union team", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-02T00:04:00Z", "title": "England's Ben Youngs aiming to match his New Zealand-defeating father", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/02/ben-youngs-england-new-zealand", "article": "&quot;I&apos;m useless, absolutely useless,&quot; Ben Youngs says, shaking his head in apparent shame. &quot;I&apos;m just hopeless and there&apos;s no point denying it. They&apos;ve got all the proof they need.&quot; It is fortunate for England that the 21-year-old scrum-half, who will make his home international debut at Twickenham this Saturday against the All Blacks, is talking less about rugby than his hapless excursions on his father&apos;s farm in Norfolk. Youngs might be the most sensational player to break into the England side for years but, as he admits with some relish, he is terrible on a tractor. &quot;The combination of me and a tractor is horrible,&quot; he chortles. &quot;I&apos;ve crashed a tractor into a ditch. I&apos;ve driven a tractor into a boat \u2013 and it was my uncle&apos;s boat as well. I&apos;ve done loads more. I hit a sugar beet harvester while loading up a trailer. I&apos;ve cost my dad a fortune and so he keeps me well away from the tractor now. It&apos;s a bit of a relief all round that we&apos;ve agreed on my lack of a farming future.&quot; Youngs is amusing company but this Saturday he will attempt the serious trick of following his father \u2013 not on a tractor but in the white No9 shirt of an England team capable of beating New Zealand at Twickenham. In 1983 Nick Youngs won one of his six caps for England by playing scrum-half when a dour but determined home team beat the All Blacks 15-9. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen a tape of that match,&quot; his son says on a sunlit afternoon in Leicester, &quot;and I&apos;ve not thought much about him even playing for England. He&apos;s always just been &apos;Dad&apos;. I spoke to him once about it because it&apos;s quite a thing to beat New Zealand and he said England just kicked the ball \u2013 literally all day.&quot; Nick Youngs was, apparently, the man of the match. &quot;Really?&quot; his son replies in surprise. &quot;He might well have been but he&apos;s never mentioned it. Typical Dad. He&apos;s so laid-back he&apos;s pretty much horizontal. And that&apos;s helped me and my brother [Tom, who is also at Leicester \u2013 and currently on loan to Nottingham]. Dad lets us get on with it \u2013 which is what you want.&quot; England have also just found what they&apos;ve wanted, for a very long time. A quick-thinking dynamo, with a coruscating break and a solid mastery of the basics at scrum-half, Youngs helped transform England when he made his first Test start against Australia in June. Having performed abjectly until he appeared in the second half in Perth the previous week, England were galvanised from the outset in Sydney. Youngs looked ridiculously confident and devastatingly sharp. He scored a dazzling try and suddenly England, after so long in the wilderness, played with conviction as they recorded a rare win in Australia. &quot;The night before the game I wasn&apos;t nervous,&quot; Youngs says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t wait. I was extremely excited.&quot; He laughs, but then ducks his head shyly at the compliment that, rather than playing excitably, he looked as if he had been involved in Test rugby for years. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he says, almost blushing. &quot;That&apos;s very kind. I&apos;m pleased you got that impression because I felt calm. It helps that you&apos;re surrounded by some fantastically experienced players like Moodos [Lewis Moody], Nick Easter, Simon Shaw and guys who&apos;ve been there for years. It makes you feel at ease. &quot;I got one thing massively right. I just played my normal game. I&apos;d come off the bench once before, against Scotland at Murrayfield in the Six Nations, but I was out on the wing. The expectation of me doing well on the wing was around the sub-zero mark. So that took the pressure off me. But, against Australia at scrum-half, I decided I wasn&apos;t going to do anything different just because it was England. I thought they&apos;ve selected me because they like what I do for Leicester and so I&apos;ll play my usual style. It went amazingly well.&quot; Youngs is shown a photograph of himself scoring his try in Sydney and he laughs at his exaggerated swallow-dive over the line. &quot;That&apos;s me showboating and being very un-sportsmanslike with that big dive. I do like the show-stopping dive. Once I&apos;d scooted round their winger I knew there was no stopping me. But the whole game felt like a turning point for England. I&apos;ve obviously not been with the squad long, but the mood is definitely more upbeat now. A lot of the guys said our result against Australia had been a long time coming and I think it&apos;ll give England a real boost going into the autumn internationals.&quot; Youngs has a mere three caps to his name; and it would usually be absurd to make grand claims about a player on the basis of one fine game in his only start. Yet the way in which Youngs has rocketed to prominence underpins a belief that he is a singular talent who could be central to the revitalisation of English rugby. He is also, crucially, not the only young player reshaping the England team manager Martin Johnson&apos;s deep-seated conservatism. Three of his team-mates at Leicester will have significant roles to play at Twickenham. Youngs will partner his club No10, Toby Flood, at half-back while the 23-year-old Dan Cole is the front row&apos;s version of an explosive and impressive new talent. &quot;Then there&apos;s Crofty [Tom Croft],&quot; Youngs says of the Leicester flanker who is an emerging leader of England&apos;s pack. &quot;We&apos;re housemates, me and Crofty. It&apos;s his place so we try and look after it \u2013 but we&apos;re just two boys living together and having some good times. He&apos;s getting on a bit though, Crofty. He&apos;ll be 25 on 7 November so I might be getting his slippers out soon.&quot; Courtney Lawes, the huge but athletic young lock from Northampton, is still only 21, and he also made his first Test start in Sydney. Instilling power and vitality into the forwards, he looks ready to rumble against New Zealand. Youngs grins when asked what Lawes is like in person: &quot;Courtney&apos;s a nice guy. Big and mute.&quot; Mute? &quot;Yeah,&quot; Youngs says, laughing. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll mind me saying that. He can talk a little \u2013 but he&apos;s just a forward, isn&apos;t he? They&apos;re different to us backs. But he&apos;s so physical and you have to be impressed by how much his career has accelerated.&quot; Even Lawes cannot match Youngs&apos; dizzying rise. This Saturday, 6 November, it will be exactly a year to the day since the then third-choice scrum-half for Leicester finally got his big break. &quot;That game a year ago, when Leicester played South Africa, was the definite start for me. When I began the season my goal was to get a regular place in the club squad \u2013 even if it was on the bench. I came to Leicester&apos;s academy when I was 16 and so I was going into my fourth season and knuckling down. And then I got the chance to start against the Springboks. &quot;It was a real opportunity and with the grand opening of the new stand, it was a massive occasion for the whole club. I did pretty well and kicked five penalties and a conversion and, best of all, we beat the Springboks [22\u201317]. Cockers [Richard Cockerill, Leicester&apos;s coach] must&apos;ve been happy because he kept me in the side and it just went from there. We won the Premiership \u2013 and I ended up being players&apos; player of the season at the club. I&apos;ll always treasure that.&quot; Youngs, however, will be tested like never before in an intense atmosphere on Saturday. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he smiles, &quot;they&apos;re good aren&apos;t they, the All Blacks?&quot; He soon becomes more reflective as he recounts his two previous experiences against New Zealand. &quot;I&apos;ve played them twice, in the same Under-20 team as Courtney, and we got beaten both times. In 2008 I was on the bench and we were hammered 36-3. Last year, in Tokyo, we were right there until half-time but I&apos;d come off with a dead leg. They pulled away in the second half and we lost [44\u201328]. There was this constant feeling that they could run riot if you let them. It&apos;s like they can score from anywhere.&quot; How will he feel facing great players such as Richie McCaw and Dan Carter? &quot;I&apos;ll be very excited. It&apos;s not every day you get an opportunity to play against such great players. I&apos;ll do everything in my power to put on a good performance. The key thing, again, is to play like I do every week for Leicester. I work really hard on the basics \u2013 but my natural instinct is to make some fast breaks. &quot;It&apos;s something I&apos;ve always been able to do and some players don&apos;t have that. You can&apos;t really learn it. So, while I can always improve the basics, my natural game is much more instinctive. It&apos;s probably why my favourite player when I was a kid was an All Black: Christian Cullen. I loved watching him because he made breaks out of nothing and beat defenders as if they weren&apos;t even there. He was sensational.&quot; Youngs will not be able to scythe through the black shirts so easily \u2013 but another bold and attacking display is fundamental to England&apos;s chances of stretching New Zealand. &quot;I think we can, because we&apos;ve got something to build on after Australia. But, whatever happens, I&apos;ll enjoy the whole experience.&quot; Youngs pauses when asked if he can identify the source of his innate confidence. &quot;It&apos;s just the way I am,&quot; he eventually says. &quot;I&apos;m a pretty relaxed guy and it&apos;s probably because we were always relaxed out on the farm, living in the countryside. That&apos;s helped me. I&apos;m such a chilled-out guy I think my parents are relieved I&apos;m highly motivated about rugby. They know I&apos;ve got a real focus in life and, best of all, it&apos;s keeping me off the tractor. I think they&apos;re pretty ecstatic about that.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Kengo Kuma has designed museums in Japan, including the Suntory museum of art and Masanari Murai art museum in Tokyo, and large corporate buildings such as the Asahi Broadcasting Corporation headquarters in Osaka."], "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "V&A", "Museums", "Culture", "Scotland", "UK news", "Travel", "Scotland holidays", "Dundee"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-03T13:40:49Z", "title": "Japanese architects to build V&A design museum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/03/japanese-architects-to-build-design-museum", "article": "Japanese architects have won a competition to design the first dedicated museum for the V&amp;A outside London, a low-slung angular building on the banks of the river Tay. The &quot;bold and ambitious&quot; design by Kengo Kuma &amp; Associates, a two-part structure of close-fitting slabs made from a stone compound and glass, is proposed for a site in former docks in Dundee, partly sunk into the river Tay. It would be the V&amp;A&apos;s first permanent outpost outside Kensington but the project&apos;s backers, a consortium including the city council and Dundee&apos;s two universities, said they face a tough fight to secure the \u00a345m needed to finance the building. Lesley Knox, chair of the project board, said Kengo Kuma&apos;s proposal was the most suitable of six &quot;exciting and dynamic&quot; designs from around the world and had won the unanimous votes of the selection committee. &quot;What really swung it is that not only is it an incredibly exciting design, but it also works for us in Dundee. You can design buildings that can go anywhere in the world and you can design exciting buildings which are exactly right for this site,&quot; she said. Rather than pure stone, the winning design uses a strong compound stone which can be manufactured to exact specifications and is more durable and stain-resistant than concrete, ideal for its exposed position on the Tay, Knox said. It features viewing terraces protected from the weather and an &quot;extraordinary&quot; central hall. The two sections would frame the research ship Discovery, used by Captain Scott to explore the Antarctic. Competing proposals included a rock-shaped building by Vienna&apos;s Delugan Meissl Associated Architects and a large glass building by New York-based firm REX which echoed a jutting rock crystal. Kengo Kuma has designed museums in Japan, including the Suntory museum of art and Masanari Murai art museum in Tokyo, and large corporate buildings such as the Asahi Broadcasting Corporation headquarters in Osaka. The future of the Dundee plan hinges on whether the Scottish government will support it when the budget is fixed. The project needs \u00a315m from the devolved government and similar amounts from European and lottery funds, and from private sector donors. Unlike the Tate&apos;s offshoots in St Ives and Liverpool, the V&amp;A in Dundee will not house a permanent V&amp;A collection and the parent museum will not meet any of Dundee&apos;s costs. But it has signed a 20-year deal to send two or three travelling exhibitions there each year. The V&amp;A has been staging temporary exhibitions in Sheffield for 10 years and is in protracted talks to have a similar 10-year deal with Blackpool. Dundee&apos;s supporters, including the city&apos;s Labour and Scottish National party MPs, believe it would help drive the city&apos;s economic regeneration. Knox confirmed it was still far from clear whether the money would be available given the heavy public spending cuts. &quot;Everybody has we&apos;ve made compelling case, but it&apos;s tough times and therefore until the decision is made, we can&apos;t prejudge that,&quot; she said. &quot;All I can say is we&apos;ve worked our tails off to make sure we&apos;ve made our case, and the feedback has been positive.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["This year he made a documentary on the story of Feng Zhengzu, the Chinese human rights activist who spent more than three months living in Narita airport, in Tokyo, after being denied re-entry to China eight times following a trip to see his sister in Japan."], "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "Art and design", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-03T20:49:46Z", "title": "Ai Weiwei's Shanghai art studio to be demolished", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/03/ai-weiwei-shanghai-art-studio", "article": "The artist who has filled the Turbine Hall in the Tate Modern with millions of hand-crafted porcelain seeds blamed a &quot;political issue&quot; after it emerged that Chinese officials have ordered the demolition of his Shanghai studio, which he designed himself. Ai Weiwei, who also designed the 2008 Beijing Olympic stadium, said officials had told him the Shanghai government was frustrated at his human rights campaigning. The building was to have formed part of a new cultural area, with Ai using it as a studio and to teach architecture courses. But now Ai has been accused of erecting the structure without the necessary planning permission and a demolition notice has been ordered. Ai said the government informed him two months ago that the newly completed studio would be knocked down because it was illegal. &quot;I was very surprised because the whole process was under government supervision and they were very enthusiastic in pushing it,&quot; he said. &quot;Two years ago quite a high official [from Shanghai] came to my studio to ask me to build a studio in this newly developed cultural district in an agricultural area. I told him I wouldn&apos;t do it because I had no faith in government, but he somehow convinced me, saying he had come to Beijing from Shanghai, and so I said OK. &quot;Half a dozen artists were invited to build studios there because they wanted a cultural area. I&apos;m the only one singled out to have my studio destroyed.&quot; The official demolition notice said Ai, who also has a studio in Beijing, where he is based, had not applied in advance for a project planning licence, but the artist says authorities told him they had arranged the necessary papers. Asked why the Shanghai authorities&apos; stance had changed, Ai said: &quot;We asked the same question. I can&apos;t tell. All the people we asked in government said &apos;You should know.&apos; &quot;They said they are sorry and can pay back what has been put into the project, but the building has to be destroyed. &quot;It&apos;s not only money; architecture, after it has been built, is not just bricks and concrete. It has become a work with its own meaning.&quot; Ai has had something of a turbulent relationship with authorities in China ever since the age of 10, when his family was exiled to a labour camp, after his father, Ai Qing \u2013 China&apos;s leading poet \u2013 was accused of being a dissident. He lived in the US for more than a decade before returning to China in 1993 when his father fell ill. While he was exhibiting in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, in August last year, he was beaten about the head by police who raided his hotel, and suffered a haemorrhage a month later as a result of the blow. Ai&apos;s &quot;installation&quot; in the province was a public list of more than 5,000 children killed by a 2008 earthquake. This year he made a documentary on the story of Feng Zhengzu, the Chinese human rights activist who spent more than three months living in Narita airport, in Tokyo, after being denied re-entry to China eight times following a trip to see his sister in Japan. Ai said officials had told him the Shanghai government was &quot;frustrated&quot; about documentaries he had made. on sensitive incidents in the city. &quot;It&apos;s definitely some kind of political issue.

Just three days after getting the worst drubbing of his career, Barack Obama flew off for a 10-day spin around Asia that encompasses India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. There is a G20 summit thrown in, and Obama is bringing 200 business leaders, so he can argue that the trip is all about drumming up orders for US jobs. Indian investment alone accounts for 75,000 of those. Even so, he is either one cool dude or he has still not got the message. No one is quite sure which. Under the constitution, the president both has the initiative and plays the predominant role in foreign policy. The international stage is the only one in which he can be relatively free of a Republican veto. But this freedom is relative. A pro-Israeli Cuban-American is taking over the chairmanship of the house foreign affairs committee, which will surely cheer Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. There could be problems ahead in the Senate over an important treaty which the president has already signed with Russia, the strategic arms reduction treaty. Some of the more cold-war minded Republicans could put an oar in here too, claiming the treaty limits anti-missile deployments. Perhaps paradoxically, Mr Obama needs to be at home just to safeguard his foreign agenda. But the fact that Mr Obama and David Cameron will be in India and China respectively next week with posses of businessmen in tow speaks volumes about who needs whom in today&apos;s world. US trade with India is more balanced than it is with China, even though it is only a fraction of it. But Delhi is just as troubled by America&apos;s superpower role. For his part, Mr Obama is not about to reverse Washington&apos;s support for Pakistan&apos;s military, nor change his plans to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan next year, neither of which India likes. The US president will stay at the Taj hotel in Mumbai, where 31 people died in the terror attacks in November 2008, which is an important gesture. But in the end presidential trips are about pushing hard strategic interests, not Harley-Davidsons. The arrival of the American president in Japan and South Korea comes when the waters of the East China Sea are choppy. China, Taiwan, Russia and South Korea all have leadership changes next year, and North Korea is in the process of one transition already. It is a zone where there are at least two active territorial disputes, and plenty of ocean in which boats can collide and nationalist mischief be engineered for domestic electoral gain. The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, have only just met to repair the damage done by the arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain by a Japanese coastguard. The incident caused weeks of anti-Japanese demonstrations and a shutdown in the export of rare earth minerals to Japan. It took the threat of a reference to the WTO before the exports resumed. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, denied recently that the US was seeking to contain the projection of Chinese power in the region, but that is exactly what at least 10 members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations want the US to do. Barely had the Chinese fishing boat captain been released when the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, popped up in the Kurils (the site of a dispute between Moscow and Tokyo). Senior Japanese analysts interpreted this as a Russian diplomatic gift to China. Try as modern leaders do to talk about capital inflows, trade balances and exchange rates, they are just as anxious about keeping national influence, and for this the diplomatic presence of the US in the region is needed as never before. It may do him no good in Ohio, but it is important that Mr Obama sees for himself how the world&apos;s engine of growth \u2013 for that is what India and Asia now are \u2013 is running."}, {"sentences": ["Japanese carmakers, including Honda, Toyota and Nissan, were only given a handful of permits but insist that they need to be able to bring technical experts from Tokyo to work at British factories."], "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "Business", "Theresa May", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-07T00:06:50Z", "title": "Big businesses welcome government roll-back of immigration caps", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/07/businesses-immigration-cap-rollback-government", "article": "Just 50 people. That&apos;s how many foreign workers PricewaterhouseCoopers, which employs 18,000 UK staff, will be allowed to bring into Britain this year. And the accountancy firm is not happy. PwC is not alone. Across the UK, banks, law firms, carmakers and industrial companies have been agitating vigorously about the coalition&apos;s draconian crackdown on the immigration of highly skilled staff. This week, they thought they glimpsed a chink of light. The home secretary, Theresa May, announced on Friday that certain international transfers of existing employees within companies will be excluded from quotas placed on the number of overseas hires for big businesses. But the Observer has learned that this exemption on &quot;intra-company&quot; visas is likely to be tightly limited. Tentative proposals floated by ministers would allow firms to transfer overseas staff earning over \u00a340,000 into the UK. But entry for lower paid workers, particularly those on less than \u00a324,000, is set to be severely restricted. May&apos;s concession came hot on the heels of another quiet shift \u2013 a refinement of visa renewals that allows companies to extend the stay of foreign workers already in Britain. That alleviated fears that big firms would have to start sending London-based international staff back home within months. Company-by-company limits placed on foreign recruitment in July have been a source of intense anxiety. Many of the City&apos;s top banks, which have huge multinational workforces, were capped at around 40 foreign hires. One major drugs company was given an allowance of fewer than 10 visas. The caps are part of an effort to achieve a Conservative manifesto pledge to reduce immigration from hundreds of thousands to &quot;tens of thousands&quot; annually. Businesses complain that they are being targeted because it is easier to address legitimate migration than illicit entry. Japanese carmakers, including Honda, Toyota and Nissan, were only given a handful of permits but insist that they need to be able to bring technical experts from Tokyo to work at British factories. &quot;Intra-company transfers are essential for our business to operate,&quot; says a Nissan spokesman. &quot;They&apos;re clearly not the type of migration that the government was hoping to target. They&apos;re very small in number but essential for us.&quot; In the Square Mile, senior sources say that disquiet over caps was sufficient for some banks to threaten a rethink over investment in London. An executive at one bank says that a block on transfers within companies could put &quot;a serious check&quot; on growth: &quot;That new investment wouldn&apos;t be coming to London if you don&apos;t have the visas to slot people in to expand the business and grow by bringing in that person who, say, runs Turkish operations.&quot; Many investment banking firms headquarter their entire European and Middle Eastern operations from London and argue that they need people with a knowledge of markets in many different nations. They complain that the Home Office devised the bespoke company-by-company limits by taking firms&apos; visa applications in 2009 \u2013 a low point for recruitment because of the recession \u2013 and then imposing arbitrary cuts of 5% to 15%. Julia Onslow-Cole, head of global immigration at PwC, says her firm needs &quot;significantly more&quot; visas than its cap of 50 simply to renew expiring permits of workers already in London. She welcomes the refined criteria exempting renewals from the immigration cap: &quot;The government announcements on the interim quota regime, guaranteeing extension applications, and the exemption for intra-company transfers in the final cap will be very welcome not just for PwC but also for our clients.&quot; But in spite of last week&apos;s concessions, businesses still have major concerns. The Commons home affairs select committee recently recommended that international transfers within companies should be limited to two-year assignments, and immigration minister Damian Green has suggested visas will only be made available to people above a certain level in seniority, pay and skill. The government is to set out its full policy by the end of the year, with revised caps for companies to be introduced in April. But the Corporation of London, the local authority for the Square Mile, was heartened by the pledges made on Friday. &quot;The City welcomes the general direction of travel\u2026 We are also grateful that the home secretary acknowledged legitimate business concerns about the proposals,&quot; says a spokesman."}, {"sentences": ["Self-consciously pitched as an underground scene&apos;s concerted bid for mainstream popularity, the record was a little too compromised and earnest, opening with a solemn, string-led instrumental called Flying into Tokyo.", "Live, fortunately, Magnetic Man&apos;s relationship to Tokyo has more in common with Godzilla&apos;s.

It is a classic cult Japanese anime and manga comic which maintains a heady reputation among fans of the genres more than 20 years after its initial release. Now, according to reports in the blogosphere, the terms Zac Efron and Akira may become forever connected after the actor was touted to star in a planned Hollywood remake. In what would be one of the strangest casting decisions of all time, Efron is reportedly in line for the leading role of Shotaro Kaneda in Warner Bros&apos;s live-action English language version, according to both the Bloody Disgusting and Slash Film blogs. The project is being lined up as a two-part adaptation, with From Hell&apos;s Hughes brothers set to direct. Bloody Disgusting also reports that Morgan Freeman has been offered the role of The Colonel, the head of a sinister government project in the original film and comic book series. Akira was originally a 2,182-page manga epic which was adapted by director Katsuhiro Otomo into a two-hour film. Despite its complex, densely packed storyline, it has gained huge popularity over time since its release and helped to fuel the growth of anime&apos;s popularity outside of Japan. The Hollywood version would presumably transport the action from the original&apos;s Japanese setting to a US location. In Otomo&apos;s film, the action takes place in Neo-Tokyo, a city built on an artificial island in Tokyo bay following the destruction of the original Tokyo in an explosion 30 years previously. Akira is the name of a young boy whose powers led to the disaster. Kaneda, the role apparently snapped up by Efron, is a biker and gang leader who discovers that his childhood friend Tetsuo is developing similar destructive powers. Efron has somewhat hedged his bets since the most recent High School Musical film, High School Musical 3: Senior Year, which appeared in 2008. He has appeared in teen-friendly fare such as 17 Again and the recent The Life and Death of Charlie St Cloud, and also more adult-oriented movies such as Me and Orson Welles."}, {"sentences": ["The closest I came to eating anything alive before my Noma experience was freshly skinned and sliced eel served as sashimi in a Tokyo restaurant."], "tags": ["Restaurants", "Ren\u00e9 Redzepi", "Food & drink"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T10:30:00Z", "title": "Live and let dine: is eating a live shrimp ethically acceptable?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/nov/10/live-and-let-dine", "article": "The first time I try to grab the live shrimp it twists and turns so much that it jumps out through my fingers. The second time I pinch a bit harder and quickly dip the translucent creature in the accompanying emulsion of brown butter. When it lands on my tongue it does a little hop, skip and a jump before I decapitate it with my teeth and swallow the wonderful blend of crunchy shells, soft tail meat and creamy sweet butter. The two-inch live shrimp, simply served in a pickle jar filled with ice, was one of the many pre-lunch snacks I was served recently at Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant of chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and hailed as the world&apos;s best for its inventive take on Nordic cuisine and allegiance to local produce. In the past I&apos;ve happily eaten pig&apos;s spleen, lamb&apos;s brains and similar unusual delicacies, but the shrimp was the first time I have crossed the dividing line and eaten an animal that&apos;s still alive (except oysters, but more on that later). Part of the problem for me is that eating live creatures is often more a circus of squeamishness than a culinary adventure. From Indiana Jones&apos;s &quot;snake surprise&quot; and monkey brains to reality TV shows where the consumption of creepy crawlies guarantees tabloid ubiquity, eating live animals is judged on a scale of grossness rather than taste. Food tourism has become a macho sport, whether it be cockroaches or snakes.  The outr\u00e9 perhaps becomes a bit more palatable when it comes to fresh fish. The closest I came to eating anything alive before my Noma experience was freshly skinned and sliced eel served as sashimi in a Tokyo restaurant. However, the Japanese tradition of ikizukuri takes the level of freshness one step further by filleting a live fish and reassembling it with the still-moving head as decoration.  The practice is banned in some countries and far from uncontroversial in Japan itself, but connoisseurs swear by it for the remarkable freshness and quality of the fish. In Korea the preference is for live baby octopus, or sannakji, where the tentacles of the animal are sliced and served with sesame oil. When the American chef and author Anthony Bourdain tried this dish in a Korean restaurant in New York he said that &quot;there is no cruelty issue here. [The octopus] is dead, it&apos;s just too dumb to know it&apos;s dead.&quot; Stupid or not, you have to be careful with sannakji because the squirming suction cups can attach themselves to the inside of your mouth and throat on the way down. The risk of a slippery love bite from a baby octopus - although potentially lethal - seems a small price to pay for a food adventure compared with finding the FBI on your case. In 2006, the Faroe Islands authorities charged a Danish food journalist and a photographer with breaching animal rights legislation after they sampled a local delicacy: live langoustine (aka Norway lobster). A year earlier the pair had been on a tour of the islands and were invited by a local fisherman to try the shellfish. In the original article (here in Danish), the journalist Henrik Kern-Jespersen described the experience:   &quot;A live and kicking langoustine is cleaned to get rid of the worst gravel and dirt. Then you pry the back of the shell off with a knife while the langoustine is still alive. A bit of salt and lemon on the tail meat and then a bite that makes most people gasp. The trick is to bite the tail off while the langoustine is alive. We close our eyes, but sense the clasping claws through the corner of our eyes when the tail breaks off. But what a taste - sushi go home!&quot;  This paragraph kicked off a four-year legal battle, inevitably dubbed Lobstergate, which involved the FBI trying to track down the photographer, then living in New York. Earlier this year the pair were acquitted. The court ruled that langoustines were not protected by the animal rights legislation as they are invertebrates without a central nervous system and therefore are not likely to feel any pain. The question of whether a particular animal has the capacity to feel pain was at the centre of this legal tussle, and for many people is also the essence of the ethical debate. Professor Andrew Linzey, who is director of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics and author of the book Why Animal Suffering Matters, says &quot;there are strong grounds for supposing that all mammals and birds are sentient, ie they can experience pain and mental suffering, and there is now increasing scientific evidence that sea creatures, notably cephalopods [eg squid and octopus] and decapod crustaceans [eg shrimp and lobster] can as well - at least to some degree. This evidence needs to inform our ethical decisions.&quot; So are there any animals where you could make an exception? &quot;Oysters are probably where we should draw the line, since there is - to my knowledge - no evidence of sentiency,&quot; says Linzey. While the argument against eating live animals goes all the way back to the book of Genesis and probably earlier (&quot;But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it&quot;), food adventurers may choose to argue for a more pragmatic approach. Why the big uproar over a scientific definition of sentience when, as consumers, we regularly ignore the abhorrent conditions under which some food animals are reared? And even if a number of studies point to evidence that fish and crustaceans feel a form of pain, isn&apos;t there a danger that we tend to attribute too many human characteristics to these animals (as the most recent comment on this article argues)? The question of sentience is the last thing on my mind as I bite through the wriggling creatures. I&apos;m too busy admiring this dish for its extraordinary fresh taste and the multitude of textures in my mouth. Perhaps it&apos;s as simple as Redzepi argues: it just tastes a lot better this way."}, {"sentences": ["Announced at the Tokyo Game Show in September it promises, &quot;a spine-tingling horror experience that uses the innovative new controls of Kinect to give players the ultimate fright.&quot; Oo-er.", "Project DracoThe last of the four big Kinect titles revealed at the Tokyo Game Show."], "tags": ["Kinect", "Xbox", "Microsoft", "Games"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T14:51:59Z", "title": "Kinect: a beginner's guide, and the recommended games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/10/kinect-games-review-beginners", "article": "Microsoft&apos;s much-hyped attempt to remove the joypad from the gaming equation launched this week. Kinect allows users to interact with compatible Xbox 360 games through movement and gesture alone, ostensibly taking physical gaming beyond the foundations set by the Nintendo Wii.  Here&apos;s everything you need to know - and the games to buy - if you&apos;re thinking of taking the plunge into a controller-free life\u2026 The basics: technology The Kinect device looks a little like a very wide web cam and sits beneath your TV. If you have the newest iteration of the Xbox 360 console, it connects to your machine via the special port at the back; if you have an older machine you&apos;ll need to use the Kinect adaptor, which comes with the standalone Kinect package. The three lenses on the front are an RGB colour camera for capturing photos and video as well as aiding in facial recognition; a CMOS sensor; and an infrared emitter. The latter two work in combination to act as a 3D sensor, tracking the movement of the player. This sensor is capable of distinguishing between up to six people, although its motion tracking capabilities are restricted to two players simultaneously.  The device can track up to 20 joints and 48 different body points on each participant. It can also use facial recognition to differentiate between users, allowing you to sign in to your Xbox Live account simply by looking into the camera. Microsoft recommends that you have an eight foot space free in front of your TV to play the games comfortably. You may want to consider getting rid of all your furniture. Or putting the TV in front of your window and playing from the back garden.  Kinect also includes a microphone, allowing players to communicate with the Xbox 360 via voice, and to engage in video chats without having to wear a headset. Several of the launch titles use this feature, and it can also be employed to control the video player (so if you want to pause a movie, you can shout &apos;pause&apos;). Indeed, Kinect also allows users to interact with the Xbox 360 menu system via gestures and hand movements \u2013 yes, like Tom Cruise in Minority Report, but without the funky data glove. Much has been made of the latency that may exist when player movements are translated into on-screen action. However, developers reckon this lag is down to about a thirtieth of a second. The Kinect can tilt and pan to adapt to different player heights and more extravagant movements. It also senses when a game isn&apos;t Kinect compatible, tilting downwards in response like a sulky robot. The price The Kinect system retails at around \u00a3130 bundled with the Kinect Adventures game. Many retailers are also offering Xbox 360 + Kinect packages. These vary between \u00a3250 for an Xbox 360 with a 4GB hard drive to \u00a3299 for the 250GB model. (Here it is on Amazon.) The five best launch games There are 19 Kinect titles available at launch in the UK, but many of them are rather poor \u2013 as is often the case with new technology debuts. Considering that Kinect Adventures comes with the system, the five titles we&apos;d recommend are: Dance Central (MTV Games)Developed by Harmonix, the company behind Guitar Hero and Rock Band, this is easily the strongest title in the launch line up. Players must learn the choreography to a range of pop hits then perform them all with style. There are over 650 steps to master and 90 routines based around tracks from the likes of Lady Gaga, Kool &amp; The Gang and Kylie Minogue. It&apos;s an enormously entertaining addition to the rhythm action genre. Buy it on Amazon &gt;&gt; Kinectimals (Microsoft)Created by Frontier Developments this is a more touchy-feely spin on the &apos;virtual pet&apos; concept. Your &apos;aim&apos; is to explore a rich island setting, making friends with lion and tiger cubs and opening up mini-games. You can stroke and tussle with your furry pals, and the tasks, ranging from car races to assault courses, are a lot of fun. I played this with my two- and four-year-old sons at a preview event and they were immediately spellbound. It was a genuinely moving experience.Buy it on Amazon &gt;&gt; Kinect Sports (Microsoft)Yes, it&apos;s the mandatory multi-event sports game. Football, bowling, boxing, table tennis and several track and field events get the Kinect treatment with varying degrees of success. Despite some rough edges, all the activities are intuitive and accessible, and if you&apos;re playing with friends and family you will laugh constantly \u2013 especially when viewing the automatic video replays, which show (in merciless detail) your idiotic movements.Buy it on Amazon &gt;&gt; Your Shape: Fitness Evolved (Ubisoft)This is a rather serious-minded fitness title, but it&apos;s got a huge list of activities and provides a really well structured programme. Users can accurately track their progress and there&apos;s an online community element allowing you to compare results with friends. Buy it on Amazon &gt;&gt; Sonic Free Riders (Sega)IF you&apos;re desperate for a more &apos;arcade-style&apos; Kinect experience, this is pretty much your only option right now. It&apos;s essentially a hover board racing game featuring sonic and his friends. You lean left and right to steer and scuff your foot along the ground to speed up. The controls aren&apos;t responsive enough for the demanding courses, but this is quite good fun for a quick blast, especially with a friend.Buy it on Amazon &gt;&gt; The eight most promising Kinect titles A quick run through some intriguing possibilities\u2026 EA Sports Active 2A more gamer-friendly fitness title from EA, featuring a heart rate monitor that attaches to your arm and conveniently lets you know when you&apos;re about to collapse. Features over 70 exercises, including specific regimes for football and mountain bike training. Gruelling but competitive and fun.

Haunt Due out next year, this is &apos;horror&apos; game from Pa Rappa the Rapper creator Masaya Matsuura. It&apos;s set in a haunted house and looks to be a light-hearted puzzler rather than straight-up spine chiller.  Rise of NightmaresAnother spooky title, this time from Sega. Announced at the Tokyo Game Show in September it promises, &quot;a spine-tingling horror experience that uses the innovative new controls of Kinect to give players the ultimate fright.&quot; Oo-er. Codename DLittle is known about Codename D (working title, apparently) other than it&apos;s being developed by Grasshopper Manufacture, the guys behind deranged cult masterpieces Killer 7 and No More Heroes. I think we can safely predict that it won&apos;t be like anything in the Kinect launch line up. Project DracoThe last of the four big Kinect titles revealed at the Tokyo Game Show. This is some kind of dragon-riding game from Yukio Futatsugi, who previously worked on cult Saturn shooter, Panzer Dragoon. It&apos;s touching down next year. Child of EdenA typically trippy music shooter from Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the genius behind Lumines and Rez. His performance of the game at Ubisoft&apos;s E3 press event was a joy to behold. Kinect Star WarsBeing developed as a joint project between LucasArts and Texan studio Terminal Reality, this looks to be a third-person Jedi fighting adventure, in which players are able to wield dual lightsabers.

As he puts it: &quot;Can you imagine being Neil Diamond and having to sing &apos;Cracklin&apos; Rosie&apos; every time you get on stage for the rest of your life?&quot; The whole thing was an accident. In 2004, Chang signed a lease on his first Manhattan restaurant, a noodle bar he called Momofuku, which means &quot;lucky peach&quot; in Japanese, but is also a nod to the inventor of instant noodles, Momofuku Ando. The menu was simple: ramen noodles with shredded pork, $7; Momofuku ramen with pork and a poached egg, $12; spicy noodles, $9; rice with chicken and egg, $10. The business was cash only. But he had no business to speak of. No one came. Chang would gaze on the &quot;terrible&quot; Japanese place across the street, which was always packed, and wonder what in hell he was doing wrong. His luck only changed when he decided that if he was going to go bust, he should do it in style, and cook whatever he felt like. He added bowls of tripe and sweetbreads to the menu, and a Korean-inspired burrito. In time, it was normal for Chang to rock up for work and see a little crowd outside, waiting for him to open. But it was his pork buns that people were really mad for. &quot;Every ticket started to have a pork bun on it,&quot; he says. &quot;Four people would get four orders of pork buns. They&apos;re only pork belly sandwiches, and usually people are so afraid of fat. I didn&apos;t understand it. It&apos;s not like we reinvented the wheel.&quot; He shrugs. Six years on, 33-year-old Chang is the owner of six New York restaurants, one of which \u2013 Momofuku Ko \u2013 has two Michelin stars. Is it fair to say that he owes all this to pork buns? &quot;Oh, yes. I wouldn&apos;t be here today if it wasn&apos;t for pork belly.&quot; What makes his pork buns so special? Chang wriggles on his banquette (we are in a London hotel; he is here to publicise his Momofuku cookbook). &quot;I&apos;ve no idea! We needed stuff to fill out the menu, we had pork belly because ramen is pork-based, and there are only so many ways you can turn it into a dish. That&apos;s all. People say I&apos;m playing dumb when I tell them this, but I&apos;m not.&quot; Chang&apos;s pork is, however, served with hoisin sauce, pickles, cucumber and spring onions, exactly like the Peking duck served in most Chinese restaurants; the difference is that he has swapped pancakes for the pillowy steamed bread that is more commonly eaten in northern China. Where did he get this idea? Apparently, he nicked it. &quot;I&apos;ve had more meals at Oriental Garden in Chinatown [in New York] than anywhere else, and they served their Peking duck with buns rather than pancakes.&quot; He asked the restaurant&apos;s owner, Mr Choi, how to make steamed buns \u2013 and was promptly directed to a Chinese restaurant supply company. He started using this company himself and, in his cookbook, he suggests that the home cook guiltlessly visits the freezer section of the nearest Chinese supermarket. Sure, they&apos;re perfectly easy to bake. But why kill yourself? After all, he built a small empire on bought-in buns. Chang is the son of Korean immigrants and the food that he cooks is an inspired and occasionally counterintuitive fusion of Korean and the American. But then there are other twists. Chang grew up in Washington, and has relatives in Richmond, Virginia, which technically counts as the South. He also, as a young man, spent time working in kitchens in Japan. So, he knows his grits, his barbecue, and his ham; and he also knows that, among other things, it takes 17 hours to make proper ramen. Combine all this with his technical expertise and you will understand that, on Chang&apos;s table, quite a lot is going on. He is perhaps the only chef in the world who can put kimchi \u2013 the spicy, fizzy, sweet-sour fermented cabbage he adores \u2013 on the same menu as his own riff on red-eye gravy. He makes these juxtapositions seem not just daring, but elegant, too. He turns out dishes of astonishing creativity and tastiness, but they are also, very often, humble, at least in origin. Chang&apos;s chicken wings, for instance, look like anyone else&apos;s chicken wings. Only when you stick one in your mouth, at which point you think: Jeez! How in God&apos;s name did he make these bits of gristle taste so good? Answer: they have been brined in a salt-and-sugar solution for a whole day, cold smoked over mesquite for 45 minutes, poached in a vat of pork fat for an hour and a half, browned on the grill, and then, finally, glazed in a chicken-infused soy sauce combined with mirin, garlic and pickled chilli peppers. There is a reverence for process in Chang&apos;s kitchens that you taste in every bite; it makes perfect sense to discover that, at college in Connecticut, where he was a religious studies student, he wrote a thesis on Thoreau, a writer who believed that quotidian repetition and simple living can, in the end, lead a man to happiness and self-fulfillment. But is Chang happy? Not exactly. Although he used to be known for his temper, and his excessive swearing, these days, he is much calmer. &quot;Before I had my own restaurant, I was never top dog in the kitchen. I&apos;ve always had a low opinion of myself as a cook. I was always yelled at by the chefs I worked for. It was like high school. You&apos;re the freshman, and the seniors are so cool, like gods; I never thought I&apos;d be one of them.&quot; He thinks this attitude may have something to do with his once having been a junior golf champion. &quot;I was quite cocky, but having been hailed as this great young golfer, I couldn&apos;t even make the high school golf team once I got there. I had a big dose of humble pie then, and ever since, I&apos;ve always known that there is always someone out there better than you, more talented. Always.&quot; Chang&apos;s father, Joe, had just $50 to his name when he arrived in America. He started out as a dish washer, then opened a couple of restaurants before starting a golf supply business (it was successful enough that he was able to lend his son $200,000 when he decided to open his first noodle bar). After college, and stints at the Mercer Kitchen and Craft, Chang knew he wanted to work as an apprentice in a Japanese noodle shop. His father knew a Korean businessman who had turned part of a Tokyo building into a ramen shop; upstairs was a church and shelter for the homeless. The friend said he could work in the shop, and sleep in the shelter. Unfortunately, the ramenya turned out to be a dive. The chef wore only his underpants, no trousers or shirt, and tucked into his apron strings were greasy newspapers which, for some reason, he favoured over tea towels. He was also a chain smoker with a strong aversion to refrigerators. Chang was only able to stick it out for a few days. His next berth \u2013 a soba shop \u2013 was better, and the one after that \u2013 a kaiseki restaurant \u2013 a life-changing experience. But he missed America and so, in the end, he went home. In New York, he chose to work for Daniel Boulud, on the grounds that Boulud was a superstar who had worked for &quot;titans&quot; such as Michel Guerard. He had jet lag the day he started there, and he felt like he still had jet lag the day he left. &quot;I couldn&apos;t get to work early enough. No matter how early I got there, I was already behind when I walked through the door.&quot; He lasted five months, though he only left because his mother was ill, and he wanted to look after her. His mother on the mend, he touched his father for a loan, and set up Momofuku on the site of an old chicken wing place in the East Village. He worked like a dog \u2013 and still does. He has no time for anything else. A few years ago, wanting to furnish his apartment, he went into Crate &amp; Barrel, pointed at the nearest mocked-up room, and said: &quot;Just give me all of that.&quot; Nothing has changed indoors since. As for a private life, am I kidding? His parents are desperate for him to find a nice Korean girl. &quot;I wish! But it&apos;s so hard.&quot; Nor is he willing to respond to the siren call of television. &quot;I do bits, but it&apos;s not something I&apos;m comfortable with. I doubt I&apos;d ever do television to the extent that, say, Gordon Ramsay has. It&apos;s always, to some degree, a reality show \u2013 or they want me to be yelling at people. &apos;Just get mad!&apos; they say. I think you can be successful without it.&quot; He is obsessed with standards, and worries aloud to me about the future of cooking. &quot;People are getting famous now for serving food out of a truck, or for, well, pork buns. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m really pleased to be a part of that. I&apos;m somewhat terrified of what the future holds, especially in America. I don&apos;t think we&apos;re producing the cooks we used to produce. I think a cook has to have a classical French foundation, and if not that then a classical Japanese foundation. Someone has to discipline the young chefs. Now if you ask a young chef who the Roux brothers were, they&apos;re not going to know, and they don&apos;t care that they don&apos;t know!&quot; His face is as plump and as round as a baby&apos;s, but he sounds suddenly very old. I want to cheer him up. What&apos;s the dish he&apos;s most proud of? &quot;My mum says everything I make is too salty,&quot; he says, with a forlorn laugh. Poor thing. If he wasn&apos;t due at Claude Bosi&apos;s kitchen at Hibiscus \u2013 the two of them are cooking a special tasting menu together \u2013 I would take him home and feed him a toasted cheese sandwich. A postscript. All the talk of pork buns has left me plainly desperate to eat one. So Chang and I strike a deal: I will toddle over to Hibiscus while he is prepping for the big dinner, and he will feed me. This I duly do. There follows the strangest encounter. At 4pm Chang emerges from the kitchen, and makes his way, zen-like, through the dining room to the front desk, where I am waiting. He is very sweaty. In his hand is an oval-shaped stainless platter which he carries before him, butler-style, and on it is a single and somewhat exiguous pork bun. I pick it up, and put it in my mouth. It&apos;s great: warm and pillowy without, salty and sweet within. But I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m only allowed one! &quot;Don&apos;t I get another?&quot; I say. He shakes his head. &quot;No.&quot; He smiles, offers his hand, and then turns on his heel, back to the kitchen. Was he being priestly \u2013 it felt to me as if I&apos;d just taken communion \u2013 or was he merely embarrassed at my having travelled for the best part of an hour merely to taste his oh-so-humble dish? I really don&apos;t know \u2013 though his delectable offering has stayed with me. I wonder when, exactly, I will get my seconds."}, {"sentences": ["If You Follow Me by Malena Watrous (HarperPerennial) is about a college graduate who goes to teach English in Japan, thinking she&apos;ll end up in Tokyo and instead landing in a rural nuclear power plant town."], "tags": ["Best books of the year", "Books", "Culture", "Jonathan Franzen"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-14T00:02:03Z", "title": "Best books of the year: 2010 | feature", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/14/best-books-of-year-2010-franzen", "article": "Sam MendesDirector     Buy it    Jonathan Franzen&apos;s Freedom (Fourth Estate) was head and shoulders above any other book this year: moving, funny, and unexpectedly beautiful. I missed it when it was over. Stephen Sondheim&apos;s Finishing the Hat (Virgin) was like its author: fascinating, precise, opinionated, brilliant. I loved Stewart Lee&apos;s How I Escaped My Certain Fate (Faber). Never has anyone made me feel so close to the terrifying and occasionally exhilarating insanity that is stand-up comedy. Sebastian FaulksNovelist I enjoyed \u2013 if that can be the word \u2013 The Big Short by Michael Lewis (Allen Lane), an account of how a group of people contrived to bring the banking system to its knees, to take much of your money and many of your jobs, to condemn your children to a life of debt \u2013 and got away unpunished, with millions in their own back pockets. It&apos;s in the interest of bankers to pretend that their work is too technical for lay people to follow, but in an account such as Michael Lewis&apos;s, it&apos;s really not that difficult. It&apos;s quite clear what they did. Harder to understand is how they got away with it. Rachel JohnsonEditor, the Lady     Buy it    Hitch-22 (Atlantic) by Christopher Hitchens is like a tin of Pedigree Chum: solid, meaty nourishment. Hitchens is incapable of writing a boring sentence. When he asks himself what he&apos;d like to be different if he had to be the Hitch all over again, he answers: &quot;more money, an even sturdier penis, slightly different parents, a briefer latency period&quot;. I cried several times during Deborah Devonshire&apos;s memoir Wait for Me! (John Murray), mainly at deaths: sister Nancy, brother Tom, and her three stillborn children. The calibre of events, cast and author could hardly be higher and Debo has gracefully potted an extraordinary life (though ordinary to her) with kindness and humour. Tristram HuntHistorian and politician Putting his little local difficulty behind him, Orlando Figes showed in Crimea: The Last Crusade (Allen Lane) why he is such a stellar historian. As ever, it mixes strong narrative pace, a grand canvas and compelling ideas about current geopolitical tensions. In The Lost City of Stoke-on-Trent (Frances Lincoln), Matthew Rice, partner to top potter Emma Bridgewater, provides a clarion call to the &quot;Five Towns&quot; to stop knocking down the bottle kilns and pot banks and start preserving one of the civic gems of England. New Labour never had much time for history, but since the end of office, you can&apos;t stop them writing the stuff. Peter Mandelson&apos;s The Third Man (HarperPress) has the most authentic feel in a genuine account of his role in, out, in, out and in government. Jeremy HuntCulture secretary     Buy it    When I fought the last election I never imagined I would be in cabinet with Nick Clegg \u2013 and certainly never thought I would be recommending Tony Blair&apos;s A Journey (Hutchinson). But he has done politicians a favour by reinventing the art of the memoir in a way not achieved since Alan Clark&apos;s Diaries. Funny and self-deprecating, they are also deeply manipulative beneath the surface. His best advice to ministers? Don&apos;t make enemies deliberately as you&apos;ll make plenty accidentally. Wendy CopePoet I once tried to write a prose memoir but couldn&apos;t find the right tone of voice. Three authors who did published books this year. Hitch-22 by Christopher\u00a0Hitchens (Atlantic), Red\u00a0Dust Road by Jackie Kay (Picador), and My Father&apos;s Fortune: A Life by Michael Frayn (Faber) are all beautifully written. On my summer holiday I was surprised to find myself enjoying a fat book about the Soviet economy. Francis Spufford&apos;s Red Plenty (Faber) mixes fact and fiction, with the benefit of scrupulous notes to tell the reader which is which. Without the notes I would have found it frustrating. With them it&apos;s terrific. Shami ChakrabartiCivil rights campaigner      Buy it    Gareth Peirce is such a private person that despite a momentous career (representing the Birmingham Six, Lockerbie families and Guant\u00e1namo detainees among others), Dispatches from the Dark Side (Verso) is her first book. It is a timely reminder of the darker side of lawlessness in freedom&apos;s name. The End of the Party by Andrew Rawnsley (Penguin) is an impartial journalistic examination of New Labour by one of Britain&apos;s finest political commentators. Craig RainePoet and critic Hampton on Hampton (Faber) is a series of interviews with the playwright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton that amounts to an artistic autobiography. Intellectually intimate, unpretentious, informative, entertaining, anecdotal, fearless, funny, serious. Simon Armitage, the best poet of his generation, has produced a book of prose-poems, Seeing Stars (Faber), full of compelling, quirky, inventive, surreal tales. In January, I read his incomparable translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. This autumn, I was charmed by the comedy of these spellbinding dispatches. Michael PalinBroadcaster       Buy it    I enjoyed Chef by Jaspreet Singh (Bloomsbury). Its themes of food and war and love and poetry form a series of intricate tightropes that the author treads skilfully, bringing us, in a short book, a lot of pleasures. I read Alain de Botton&apos;s A Week at the Airport (Profile) with smiles of recognition, nods of approval and sighs of admiration. Most people can&apos;t wait to get away from airports. I&apos;m very glad he stayed. Nick HornbyNovelist Sarah Bakewell&apos;s How to Live: A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer (Chatto &amp; Windus) pretty much delivers on the promise of the title, and certainly delivers everything you&apos;d ask from a literary biography. Bakewell recognises that the life of a major writer extends way beyond his death: Montaigne is nearly 500 years old now and, given that he invented the personal essay, as influential as he&apos;s ever been. There must have been some doubt in the minds of the Booker judges as to whether Francis Spufford&apos;s Red\u00a0Plenty (Faber) is a novel. I can think of no other explanation of why it wasn&apos;t even longlisted. It&apos;s a breathtakingly researched and brilliantly imagined picture of life in Khrushchev&apos;s USSR. Fictional farmers and economists rub shoulders with real politicians; Spufford cuts between them like Robert Altman might have done, if he&apos;d ever been drawn to five\u2011year\u00a0plans. David VannNovelist     Buy it    I was hesitant to read Lisa Moore&apos;s February (Chatto &amp; Windus) because it didn&apos;t sound fun to read about decades of grief, the aftermath of a husband lost in the sinking of an oil rig off Newfoundland. But the world is so carefully observed it becomes something other than what it is. Rose Tremain&apos;s Trespass (Chatto &amp; Windus) offers a similarly gorgeous evocation of the external world and interior life but coupled to grand themes: the fall of the old house, the broken inheritance, rivalry and betrayal. In non-fiction, Melanie Thernstrom&apos;s The Pain Chronicles (North Point Press) explores the history and meaning of pain. Nicholas HytnerProducer and director In Finishing the Hat (Virgin) Stephen Sondheim collects the lyrics from the first half of his career, with a fierce running commentary on them that is as eloquent an insight into the creative process as I&apos;ve ever read. He writes utterly fair and sometimes unsparing appreciations of the work of his peers and predecessors; and his reports from the Broadway front are irresistible. The theatre book of the decade. Joan BakewellBroadcaster and novelist     Buy it    In 2005, after 50 years of married life, poet Dannie Abse&apos;s wife, Joan, was killed in a car crash. His grief was torrential. He turned to what he knew \u2013 words, and how to shape them into poetry. His 2008 book, The Presence, was a prose account of his loss. This year&apos;s Two for Joy: Scenes from Married Life (Hutchinson) charts in some 50 poems the progress and evolution of their love and their married life together. I love their delicacy, their exquisite taste, and the sense of their sustained happiness together. This year I discovered Geoff Dyer with his essay collection Working the Room (Canongate). Once I caught his style, casually borne erudition, gentle self-disparagement, and ideas about most things on earth, I was hooked. Keynes on the Wireless (Palgrave Macmillan) shows that the economist&apos;s views on finance, state planning, the bank rate, debt, tariffs are by no means out of date. But what gives me most pleasure is his prose \u2013 lucid, exact and well-mannered. Andrew RawnsleyObserver political commentator   New Labour&apos;s personalities have been accused of producing memoirs that are self-serving. That&apos;s slightly unfair if only because, whether they meant to or not, they come out of them so badly. This year&apos;s crop have been execrably written (Tony Blair being the worst offender) and utterly unreliable as history (the preening and dissimulating Peter Mandelson being the worst culprit). For a memoir that is unflinchingly candid about both the personal and the political, intensely moving about his tribulations and triumphs, awesomely lacking in vanity and suffused with insight, I recommend Nelson Mandela&apos;s Conversations with Myself (Macmillan). This is not so much a book as a scrapbook: a collection of extracts from diaries, letters to family and friends, notes and transcripts. That adds authenticity to a book that breaks the heart and then makes it sing. Nigel SlaterFood writer     Buy it    The books I value most are those I return to again and again. Such has been the case with The Flavour Thesaurus by Niki Segnit (Bloomsbury). It has intrigued, inspired, amused and occasionally infuriated me all year, and will for years to come. Julie MyersonNovelist Two novels filled me with writer&apos;s envy, and neither got the accolades it deserved. Joshua Ferris&apos;s The Unnamed (Viking) explores a mysterious, undiagnosable illness with the pace and daring of a thriller. But ultimately it&apos;s a compassionate meditation on the frailty of human minds and bodies. Subtly similar in theme is David Flusfeder&apos;s A Film by Spencer Ludwig (Fourth Estate). A clapped-out film-maker and his garrulous, elderly father leave a hospital appointment in New York City and decide on a whim to keep on driving. It&apos;s a road movie, it&apos;s a tender dialogue between parents and children, it&apos;s wonderfully embarrassing about how artists think about their art, but it also has the mark of great fiction: it feels like it has existed forever. William DalrympleTravel writer     Buy it    This year has seen three remarkable debuts by Indian non-fiction writers. Curfewed Night (HarperPress) is Basharat Peer&apos;s memoir of growing up in Kashmir under the shadow of the uprising. His revelations, especially about the indiscriminate use of electric shock torture on the genitals of a whole generation of Kashmiri youths, needs to be read by anyone who wishes to understand why the valley remains so restless. Sonia Faleiro&apos;s Beautiful Thing (Penguin India) is a sassy, sensitive and moving account of one bar girl&apos;s journey spiralling down through the circles of hell that are Bombay&apos;s sex industry. Mimlu Sen&apos;s The Honey Gatherers (Rider), about her travels with the Bauls, the wandering troubadours of Bengal, is a mixture of love story, travelogue, book of devotion and work of ethnography and theology. Rachel CookeObserver journalist   I loved Letters to Monica, a collection of letters from Philip Larkin to his girlfriend, Monica Jones (Faber). Not only are they funny, sad and true; they are also charmingly replete with 1950s detail, evoking a world of curry-powder concoctions, rasping gas fires, and long but civilised train journeys. Nothing to Envy (Granta Books), Barbara Demick&apos;s book about real lives in famine-stricken North Korea, shows what good journalism can still do when it tries. Two novels were unfairly overlooked: Union Atlantic by Adam Haslett (Tuskar Rock), a gripping and beautifully written tale of what happens when greedy corporate America collides with a stubborn old woman; and The Last Weekend by Blake Morrison (Chatto &amp; Windus), which is about curdled male friendship. It&apos;s a page-turner: creepy, and uncomfortably close to home. Peter SerafinowiczComedian       Buy it    The iPad has revolutionised my habits. I must have read 30 novels on it this year; usually I read two or three. I&apos;ve loved Lee Child&apos;s Jack Reacher series for thrills, including his most recent, Worth Dying For (Bantam), but my book of the year is A Book Of Jean&apos;s Own! by Jean Teasdale (Griffin). Jean is the Onion&apos;s resident humour columnist: a childless, overweight, but psychotically optimistic fortysomething who lives with her boozy husband and spends what little money she has on collectable dolls and costumes for her cats, who both hate her. It&apos;s a comic masterpiece. Chris PattenChancellor of Oxford University The Rule of Law by the late Tom Bingham (Allen Lane) is the book of the year that I am likely to read again and again. In his beautifully written book the former senior law lord gives a succinct definition, demolishing, for example, the alleged legal case for the Iraq war in a few devastating pages. Every MP who can read should be given it for Christmas. The most gob-smacking book was Obama&apos;s Wars by Bob Woodward (Simon &amp; Schuster). Why on earth does administration after administration allow Woodward to tell the inside story of the often gruesome process of decision-making in the White House? Philip FrenchObserver film critic     Buy it    My favourite movie book of the year is Susan Compo&apos;s exuberant Warren Oates (University Press of Kentucky), a biography of that fine character who appeared in some of the greatest films of our time. Appropriately subtitled &quot;A Wild Life&quot;, its setting is the less glamorous side of Hollywood where Oates, a man of modesty, ambition and probity, lived recklessly. Paul Bowles&apos;s Travels: Collected Writings, 1950-93 (Sort of Books) is a handsomely produced, endlessly delightful original paperback by one of the most singular authors of the 20th century. A scholarly work as riveting as a detective story, James Shapiro&apos;s Contested Will (Faber) judiciously looks at the evidence, motives and psychology that lead many otherwise sane people to believe Bacon, the Earl of Oxford or Christopher Marlowe wrote the plays of Shakespeare. AN WilsonAuthor and journalist This is a good moment for Europeans to remind themselves of their &quot;roots&quot;. Hywel Williams&apos;s Emperor of the West: Charlemagne and the Carolingian Empire (Quercus), is a magisterial survey of the great European emperor, of the Latin culture of his court and the political extent of his domains. Andrew Graham-Dixon&apos;s Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane (Allen Lane) is an acute piece of art history. Painting after painting which you thought you &quot;knew&quot; will be enlivened for you by this fascinating evocation. Salley VickersNovelist     Buy it    To call Iain McGilchrist&apos;s The Master and His Emissary (Yale University Press) an account of brain hemispheres is to woefully misrepresent its range. McGilchrist, a former Oxford English don and now a consultant psychiatrist, persuasively argues that our society is suffering from the consequences of an over-dominant left hemisphere losing touch with its natural regulative &quot;master&quot;, the right. I like everything that Richard Mabey writes and Weeds (Profile) is no exception. The unpretentious prose is a tonic, the subject matter arcane and fascinating. And unlike many gardeners Mabey is not a zealot. He is indulgent to his weeds whose expansionist habits, he suggests, most closely resemble ours. Stryker McGuireNewsweek journalist Having blessed us with Liar&apos;s Poker, the classic portrait of 1980s Wall Street, Michael Lewis returned this year with The Big Short (Allen Lane). This is a depressingly revealing tale of a small herd of mavericks who cleaned up big-time after the Gordon Gekkos de nos jours Cuisinarted America&apos;s subprime mortgage loan-a-thon into a toxic timebomb. Read it and weep.  Polly StenhamPlaywright     Buy it    I loved Bill Clegg&apos;s  Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man (Jonathan Cape) because of its unflinching honesty. The author and main character is a middle-class literary agent by day and crackhead at night. Then his two worlds collide to devastating consequences. There is a passage in it that is among the most tender and desperate I have ever read. It is also extremely funny. Daljit NagraPoet Roddy Lumsden&apos;s Identity Parade  (Bloodaxe) is a valuable record of the best new British and Irish poets of the past 15 years. Of Mutability (Faber) by Jo Shapcott is powerfully moving for the way she transmutes illness into urgent poetry about recovery and joy. In White Egrets (Faber), Derek Walcott is a wandering soul around the old world. This is his most immediate collection for decades and my favourite poetry book for ages. Richard EyreDirector     Buy it    The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet (Sceptre) by David Mitchell is as enjoyable as a Patrick O&apos;Brian novel and much better written. It&apos;s a brilliantly imagined journey through 17th-century Japan and Holland which is moving, thoughtful and unexpectedly funny. Ill Fares the Land (Allen Lane) by Tony Judt is his political testament and ought to be essential reading for any politician and every voter trying to imagine how society could be improved. Judt&apos;s recent death robbed the world of a great political moralist as well as a brilliant contemporary historian. Geoffrey WheatcroftJournalist and author &quot;What strange creatures dons are,&quot; Hugh Trevor-Roper once wrote to me in a letter about some storm in a college teacup. He might have been talking about himself as well as the weirder colleagues, especially at Peterhouse, Cambridge, described in Adam Sisman&apos;s highly readable Hugh Trevor-Roper (Weidenfeld). Although loath to call any of them a &quot;book of the year&quot;, there is no doubting the importance of A Journey (Hutchinson) by Tony Blair, The Third Man (CollinsPress) by Peter Mandelson and The New Machiavelli (Bodley Head) by Jonathan Powell. Whatever one thinks of the coalition, no honest person who reads these books, as well as Andrew Rawnsley&apos;s hair-raising The End of the Party (Penguin), can doubt that the 13 years before last May saw the nastiest, dirtiest and altogether worst British government of our lifetime. Mariella FrostrupBroadcaster     Buy it    I really enjoyed two novels \u2013 Paul Auster&apos;s Sunset Park (Faber) and Bella Pollen&apos;s The Summer of the Bear (Mantle) \u2013 and I&apos;m currently immersed in Life Times (Bloomsbury), the definitive collection of Nadine Gordimer&apos;s short stories, most of them written during the apartheid period yet still relevant for their acute observations on what it is to be human. Half the Sky (Virago), by journalists Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, makes a convincing case for why the education and emancipation of women is as urgent a cause today as the fight against slavery was in the 19th century. Curtis SittenfeldNovelist   I fell in love with two American first novels. Stiltsville by Susanna Daniel (Harper) is the gorgeously written story of a marriage over several decades, and it takes place in Miami, Florida, a place so vividly depicted you feel like you&apos;ve travelled there while reading. If You Follow Me by Malena Watrous (HarperPerennial) is about a college graduate who goes to teach English in Japan, thinking she&apos;ll end up in Tokyo and instead landing in a rural nuclear power plant town. It&apos;s funny in a sharp, dark, painfully true way. Philip HensherNovelist     Buy it    It&apos;s been too long since Candia McWilliam&apos;s last book, and What to Look for in Winter: A Memoir in Blindness (Jonathan Cape) explains why. She has lost none of her grace of expression and freshness of thought. A remarkable and brave book. The Collected Stories of Lydia Davis (Hamish Hamilton) was a real revelation of the remaining possibilities of fiction. They were often very funny, and not just in the usual experimental-fiction way. At the other end of the scale of expansiveness, Jonathan Franzen&apos;s Freedom (Fourth Estate) effortlessly outshone every other novel on the autumn lists. The best English novel of the year was Martin Amis&apos;s warm, rueful, resonant The Pregnant Widow (Jonathan Cape). Geoff DyerNovelist and essayist The Good Soldiers (Atlantic), David Finkel&apos;s account of a battalion of US soldiers in Iraq, in the midst of &quot;the surge&quot;, begins as reportage and ends up embodying Ezra Pound&apos;s definition of literature: news that stays news. The German poet Durs Gr\u00fcnbein&apos;s book of essays, The Bars of Atlantis (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), is a wide-ranging and deep exploration of his passions, intellectual formation and sense of creative vocation \u2013 all conveyed with a kind slouched grandeur that I found simultaneously irritating and quite irresistible. 2010 will also be remembered as the year when, thanks to a single book, the literary merit of that somewhat neglected beast, the comic novel, could no longer be denied: Sam Lipsyte&apos;s relentlessly and hilariously brilliant The Ask (Old Street Books). Hari KunzruNovelist     Buy it    Britain tends to get the architecture it deserves. As the regeneration boom bites the dust, Owen Hatherley&apos;s sardonically titled A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain (Verso) is a useful and entertaining guide to the state of our built environment. Hatherley is an unrepentant modernist, which makes his polemic all the more challenging. Bret Easton Ellis is often dismissed as a fashionable provocateur, but Imperial Bedrooms (Picador) is a dissection of the moral wasteland of LA that deserves comparison with Nathanael West. Herta M\u00fcller was unknown to me before she was awarded the Nobel prize. The Appointment (Portobello) is a strange, lyrical and disturbing allegory of life in Ceausescu&apos;s Romania. Peter ConradAuthor and critic Alexandra Harris&apos;s Romantic Moderns (Thames &amp; Hudson) is a spectacular debut by a gifted and versatile cultural historian \u2013 a study of Englishness that roves from literature to art, music and film as it travels around a rural England of gargoyled churches, eccentric houses and pebbly beaches. A beautiful book; also, with its bucolic end-papers and its cornucopian illustrations, a beautiful piece of book-making. Eric HobsbawmHistorian       Buy it    The most interesting biography was that of the witty, cosmopolitan and controversial Ernest Gellner (1925-1995), philosopher, anthropologist and all-purpose social thinker \u2013 Ernest Gellner: An Intellectual Biography by John A Hall (Verso). Few books have more successfully combined the study of personal life and intellectual development in the turbulent setting of the 20th century. Alessandro Barbero&apos;s The Anonymous Novel: Sensing the Future Torments, from a new publisher, Vagabond Voices, situated on the Isle of Lewis, is a vivid novel about Russians coping with the transition from communism to capitalism and combines echoes of Bulgakov with elements of a thriller. Strangely, it was written by a successful medieval\u00a0historian. Rosie BoycottJournalist and broadcaster David Mitchell is an astonishing and inventive writer who just keeps getting better. I found The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet (Sceptre) absorbing and compelling. The Finkler Question (Bloomsbury), Howard Jacobson&apos;s deserved Booker winner, is a novel of enormous scope, humour and intelligence. I also loved Matthew Crawford&apos;s The Case for Working with Your Hands (Viking), which explains why humanity&apos;s need to use its hands goes beyond just gardening or knitting, but is wired into our DNA. Alastair CampbellNovelist and former political adviser     Buy it    My favourite novel of the year was On Black Sisters&apos; Street (Vintage) by Chika Unigwe. I was drawn to it first by the beautiful picture on the cover, of the back of a stunning black woman&apos;s body. Inside is the haunting story of four African women trafficked to Belgium and working there as prostitutes. Sometimes a novel can tell you more than any amount of documentary journalism. On the non-fiction front, I am enjoying, Revolutionaries (William Heinemann) by Jack Rakove. He takes a fresh look at some of the key figures in the American revolution. Russell T DaviesScreenwriter The last 100 pages of Stephen King&apos;s Under the Dome (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) are the most vivid and ferocious thing he&apos;s ever written. I&apos;ve also just finished Freedom by Jonathan Franzen (Fourth Estate), which I thought was beautiful. Kirsty WarkBroadcaster     Buy it    Jonathan Franzen&apos;s Freedom (Fourth Estate) is something of a slow burn where The Corrections was like a punch to the stomach, but each is a cat&apos;s cradle of family life, and if the measure of a good book is its afterburn, Freedom is a great book. You can&apos;t keep Nigel Slater down. Tender, Volume II: A Cook&apos;s Guide to the Fruit Garden (Fourth Estate) is a companion piece to Tender: Volume I, and is equally inviting. Only he could have a recipe entitled A deeply appley apple crumble. The Lost Books of the Odyssey (Jonathan Cape) is Zachary Mason&apos;s first book, and it is a beautifully imagined, and written, retelling of passages from Homer. Fintan O&apos;TooleJournalist and author Faced with the prospect of death, two writers produced great testaments of faith in humanity. Seamus Heaney&apos;s Human Chain (Faber), written after a stroke, wonderfully evokes the power of memory and of social connection. He has a beautiful line about &quot;love that&apos;s proved by steady gazing/ Not at each other but in the same direction&quot;. Tony Judt&apos;s dying words in Ill Fares the Land and The Memory Chalet (both Heinemann) make the same connection between memory and society. Judt calls us to gaze in the same directions \u2013 back to a notion of austerity as a form of public seriousness and forward to a renewal of equality and mutual care. Emma Donoghue&apos;s moving novel Room (Picador) also deals with a notion of austerity and shows how, with love and imagination, a nutshell can become an infinite space. Jeremy DellerArtist       Buy it    The most stressful read this year has been Andrew Rawnsley&apos;s The End of the Party (Viking), in particular where former tabloid journalists bully secret service professionals to make the case for war in a dossier to other tabloid journalists. Totally grubby. Rob Young&apos;s Electric Eden (Faber) was an eye-opening account of modern British music&apos;s conversation with the rural. It has been too easy to knock this kind of music out of embarrassment more than anything else, but this epic book will hopefully redress this tendency. Jackie KayNovelist  A good year for true originals: Jo Shapcott&apos;s Of Mutability (Faber) is that surprising thing, an uplifting book about mortality. In not being afraid to look death in the eye, Shapcott&apos;s poems are life-affirming. Alasdair Gray has broken the mould again. His memoir, A Life in Pictures (Canongate), travels right to the heart of his dark, turbulent and chaotic imagination, and lights up a path through his life; it also makes the reader imagine her own life in pictures. Pascale Petit&apos;s What the Water Gave Me (Seren) gives us 50-odd poems in the voice of the Mexican original Frida Kahlo. Pascale&apos;s poems are as fresh as paint, and make you look all over again at Frida and her brilliant and tragic life. John LanchesterNovelist     Buy it    The novel that made me laugh most this year \u2013 a year in which laughs have been on the infrequent side \u2013 was Andrew O&apos;Hagan&apos;s The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe (Faber). As with all high comedy the book has an underlying sadness, but it is the good humour that stays with the reader. In non-fiction I liked Simon Winder&apos;s Germania (Picador), a book that does a lot to fill the gap in our consciousness about one of the world&apos;s most interesting countries. I also liked Tom Bissell&apos;s Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter (Pantheon), a thoughtful and unscandal-seeking book about this fascinating new art form. Mark WatsonComedian Around September, everyone started saying that Freedom by Jonathan Franzen (Fourth Estate) was the book of the year, which was a relief as I&apos;d been fairly slack in keeping up; now I could just cut to the chase and read that.

There was no evidence of complicity between the combatants to unnecessarily prolong the agony beyond what were two of the most peace-riddled rounds in the history of the sport, outside mutual recognition of an obvious gulf in their commitment to battle. For third parties \u2013 some of them not entirely disinterested \u2013 to suggest that Haye somehow broke the shining spirit of the fight game by holding up Harrison to complete the execution at a moment of his choosing and thus profit from the exercise improperly might score a technical point but such mischief-making reads unnecessary mystery into a straightforward narrative. It also ignores the long history of betting in boxing. Frank Warren was loud in his criticism. Yet Haye&apos;s promotional rival admitted losing a substantial amount on his fighter, Enzo Maccarinelli, when Haye stopped him in the second round of their world cruiserweight title on his promotion at the O2 Arena in Greenwich in March 2008. The difference, Warren would argue, is that he plainly did not win his bet and that he was not in the ring to determine the course of the action. It is a fair point but it is not as if Haye bet on himself to lose. He did not fix the result in the way the Mob notoriously did in their pomp. Haye brought no shame on the sport bar sharing a ring with the most frightened pacifist ever to challenge for the world heavyweight title. It was a side bet, if you like, the very essence of prizefighting when it entered the sporting consciousness of this country, bare-knuckled and brazen, in Georgian times. Indeed, the sport probably would not exist without gambling \u2013 a point that could be made about nearly all organised sports, most of which started in Britain over the past couple of centuries, from cricket to conkers. Appearances count for much, though, especially in a sport perceived by some to be inhabited by shady characters. The position of the British Boxing Board of Control is unequivocal. &quot;It is not permitted [for boxers to bet on a fight they are in],&quot; the board&apos;s general secretary, Robert Smith said yesterday. &quot;I&apos;ve been told about David&apos;s comments but I did not hear them myself. We will take a look at them and will have to talk to Mr Haye and his people about them. &quot;There are regulations about betting at boxing venues. A promoter has to apply for a licence to do so. There was no such application in this case but you can place a bet on your mobile phone these days, so it is not particularly relevant.&quot; In all probability, Haye will get away with a caution. The last time the board were alerted to the dangers of gambling was in 1992, when Lennox Lewis stopped Derek Williams in a British, Commonwealth and European title fight in the third round. It was suspected there was heavy betting on Williams losing in that very round, at 33-1, but no suggestions the fighter was in any way involved. James DeGale admitted in the heady moments after he won his Olympic gold medal in Beijing two years ago that his father had won \u00a311,000 on the fight. No fuss was made, no sanction brought to bear. The promoter Mickey Duff happily admitted to making regular wagers on fights he promoted and, good judge though he was, even suffering regularly from his belief that Marvin Hagler, one day, would lose. What is more relevant in terms of Saturday night&apos;s fight as a legitimate contest is Harrison&apos;s complicity in its farcical course. Some fighters enter the ring subconsciously making arrangements for the least complicated way to get out of it: a do-or-die knockout swing, the kindly nod of a compassionate referee or a chilling blow by an opponent turned merciful executioner. The suspicion that Harrison had such thoughts swimming in his confused head the instant he was caught in a maelstrom of his own making are hard to resist. Rarely has fear and apprehension been so vividly painted on a fighter&apos;s face. Harrison made some bizarre excuses later, all delivered with the same evangelical zeal and overpowering self-delusion that he brought to his many pronouncements about shocking the world in the weeks before the event. In the seven minutes and 53 seconds it lasted, he threw 32 punches and landed one, a jab. Yet he felt justified in sharing blame for his demonstrable flight from the fight with the referee and his opponent. &quot;Credit to David, he caught me with a good shot. I beat the count, but the referee stopped the fight. I have to take it on the chin.&quot; That he did. His inaction spoke louder than his words. In his moment of worst resort, Harrison lifted a shaking glove towards his battered mouth and tried to remove his gum shield, as poignant a symbol of surrender as exists in boxing. How far it was from the famous image of Mike Tyson, battered to the floor by Buster Douglas in the 10th round in Tokyo 20 years ago, yet pawing about on the canvas for his teeth-protecting implement as the referee counted to ten over his kneeling body.

These fellow aficionados of Tokyo low-life would often peer at\u00a0one another across a variety of revolving stages upon which God knows what was taking place. When finally they were properly introduced, on the premises of the utterly respectable Tokyo foreign correspondents&apos; club, Seidensticker murmured: &quot;I believe we have certain interests in common.&quot; For Nick, sexual life in Japan was more than an interest. It was a passion he pursued with the tenacity of a sleuth and the seriousness of a scholar. Far from being a mere expatriate bon vivant, he made the subject into his life&apos;s work, and produced a detailed study, Pink Samurai: Love, Marriage and Sex in\u00a0Contemporary Japan (1991). Nick also wrote on a variety of other subjects, mostly related to Japan. In the late 1970s and early 80s, he was the film reviewer for the English-language Japan Times. In 2000 he wrote an excellent guide to Japan&apos;s towns and villages for National Geographic&apos;s Traveler series. And in 2002 he produced Things Japanese, a fine text to accompany photographs by Michael Freeman. Japan has often served as a refuge for westerners with a restless disposition. Born in London, Nick never quite felt at home in Britain, or indeed anywhere else. His father, Jack, a musical administrator, came from an Anglo-French-Polish family. The name Bornoff was adopted by Nick&apos;s grandfather, who\u00a0was an opera singer in Monte Carlo and preferred Bornoff&apos;s whiff of Russian aristocracy to his actual name, which was Bornzstein. Nick&apos;s mother, Monique Hazleden, was also partly French. Paris, where his father spent much of his life after he and Nick&apos;s mother divorced, was perhaps where Nick felt most at home. Being sent to Dover college was clearly not to his liking. Having been expelled, he finished his schooling at the progressive Frensham Heights in Farnham, Surrey. Nick moved to Paris as soon as he could to become a student at the Institut de Formation Cin\u00e9matographique, a\u00a0small film academy run by the eccentric American movie theorist No\u00ebl Burch, whose somewhat impenetrable writings may nevertheless have ignited Nick&apos;s interest in things Japanese (Burch fancied himself as an authority on the subject). Nick then participated in the production of documentary films, notably in connection with Indonesian music, an experience that inspired his lifelong taste for tropical exoticism. His\u00a0greatest gift may well have been in the visual arts. He was a superb caricaturist and cartoonist. Never one to turn down any enhancement of the good life, Nick drifted into an excessive epicureanism that began to take a heavy toll on his health. On\u00a0the advice of friends in Japan, in 1978 he moved to Tokyo, where there were plenty of job opportunities for young Europeans who had lost their way for one reason or another. Nick soon found employment as an advertising copywriter, film critic, author and translator. It was in Tokyo that he met his wife, Masami. They had one son, Corin. Despite having found happiness in his new life, Nick did not want to spend the rest of his years in Japan. In 1991 he and his wife decided to\u00a0try their luck in London. Always ambivalent about his native country, Nick never quite found his place there, and the last decades of\u00a0his\u00a0life were plagued by ill health and\u00a0bad luck. The victim of a hit-and-run road accident, he was left with a bad limp. His excellent cartoons remained unpublished. But he always managed to\u00a0bring good cheer to others, being a\u00a0kind and generous friend, a devoted husband and good father. He is survived by his mother, Masami and Corin. \u2022 Nicholas Bornoff, writer, born 28 September 1949; died 30 October 2010"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,&quot; said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.", "Takayama was influential in the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s expansion into Tokyo, an audacious move that led to several shootings in the capital in 2007."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-18T15:39:10Z", "title": "Yakuza chief arrested in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/18/yakuza-kiyoshi-takayama-arrested-japan", "article": "The arrest today of the de facto leader of Japan&apos;s most powerful underworld organisation has sparked fears of a violent internal power struggle, as police step up their crackdown on organised crime. Kiyoshi Takayama, the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, is being held on suspicion of extorting about \u00a540m (\u00a3300,000) from a man involved in the construction industry. The national police agency declared war on the Yamaguchi-gumi in September in an attempt to rein it in before the release of its leader, Kenichi Shinoda, from prison next spring. Shinoda began a six-year prison sentence in December 2005 for violating gun control laws and entrusted the running of the Yamaguchi-gumi to Takayama, who is also head of the organisation&apos;s biggest and most violent faction, the Kodo-kai. &quot;If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,&quot; said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan. &quot;He has been running the organisation with an iron fist, and other factions will see his arrest as an opportunity. His antagonism towards the police has angered some in the organisation. He is not a popular man.&quot; Takayama, 63, did not resist arrest during a dawn police raid involving 140 officers at a Kodo-kai base in the western city of Kobe. He has, however, denied involvement in the extortion case, according to Japanese media. Although he was not present at meetings with the alleged extortion victim, police believe they can build a case against him using a law that holds gang leaders responsible for crimes committed by their juniors. When Shinoda was sworn in as the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s sixth don in July 2005, he vowed to expand the 95-year-old organisation&apos;s influence beyond its traditional Kobe base. Until recently Japan&apos;s crime syndicates, which are not illegal, operated with relative impunity. Gangsters made no attempt to hide their underworld affiliations and listed their offices in the phone book. But Takayama&apos;s arrest has heightened fears of a dramatic deterioration in relations with the police. Takaharu Ando, the combative head of the national police agency, has vowed to destroy the Yamaguchi-gumi as part of an unprecedented crackdown on organised crime. &quot;We want them to disappear from public life,&quot; he told reporters after his appointment last year. Aside from gambling, loan sharking, protection rackets and prostitution, the yakuza have added stock market manipulation and front companies to their myriad illegal activities. Takayama was influential in the Yamaguchi-gumi&apos;s expansion into Tokyo, an audacious move that led to several shootings in the capital in 2007. The Kodo-kai faction, thought to have about 4,000 members, has dispensed with the yakuza&apos;s traditional policy of co-operating with the police. Its members have followed officers to their homes, photographed them with members of their families, and attempted to unearth information that could be used to blackmail them. In other major departures from yakuza tradition, they never confess to their crimes and have been accused of targeting civilians. There were about 87,000 gangsters active in Japan at the end of 2005, according to the national police agency. An estimated 50,000 belong to the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has recently attracted mobsters from smaller gangs targeted by rigorous police investigations."}, {"sentences": ["In one of two excellent essays on the Blu-ray disc, Peter Bogdanovich reports Orson Welles saying: &quot;Oh my God, that&apos;s the saddest movie ever made.&quot; Make Way for Tomorrow foreshadowed Tokyo Story and can hold its own with Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s masterpiece."], "tags": ["Drama", "World cinema", "Film"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-21T00:06:25Z", "title": "Make Way for Tomorrow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/21/make-way-for-tomorrow-dvd-review", "article": "This important addition to Eureka&apos;s &quot;Masters of Cinema&quot; series stars Beulah Bondi and Victor Moore as an elderly, lower-middle-class couple who lose their home in the Great Depression, are shuffled around between their sons and daughters and are finally separated forever after a last unforgettable evening in New York.

Washington&apos;s top envoy on North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, was dispatched to the region after a US scientist said the government in Pyongyang had shown him a &quot;stunning&quot; new uranium enrichment plant at the country&apos;s nuclear complex at Yongbyon.  The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, said it provided further evidence of North Korea&apos;s increasingly belligerent behaviour. &quot;From my perspective, it&apos;s North Korea continuing on a path which is destabilising for the region. It confirms or validates the concern we&apos;ve had for years about their enriching uranium, which they&apos;ve denied routinely,&quot; said Mullen. &quot;They are a country that routinely we are unable to believe that they would do what they say.&quot; Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor who was shown round the enrichment plant, said it contained an &quot;astonishingly modern control room&quot; overlooking 2,000 centrifuges. &quot;These facilities appear to be designed primarily for civilian nuclear power, not to boost North Korea&apos;s military capability,&quot; Hecker wrote in a report on his visit. But he added: &quot;Nevertheless, the uranium enrichment facilities could be readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) bomb fuel (or parallel facilities could exist elsewhere).&quot; Despite North Korea&apos;s claims that the facility is designed to produce electricity, the news will trigger suspicions that it is seeking to bolster its weapons capability and gain the upper hand in nuclear talks, as it reels from US and UN sanctions. The North Koreans have already made and tested nuclear bombs made from plutonium. The enrichment of uranium represents another potential route to make a bomb. Plutonium and uranium can also be used to make much more powerful thermo-nuclear warheads. Bosworth will visit Seoul on Monday, and go on to Beijing and Tokyo to discuss a collective response to the revelations. Six-nation talks over North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme \u2013 between the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and hosted by China \u2013 have stalled, and some observers speculated that the Pyongyang regime gave Hecker and other scientists access in the hope of strengthening its position at any future multi-party nuclear talks. Washington has refused to consider North Korea&apos;s request to restart six-party talks in Beijing until the regime honours previous commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make six to 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proven it has a working nuclear weapon. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said the new facility appeared to have been built within a year, in the gutted shell of an old fuel fabrication plant at Yongbyon. The nuclear scientist said: &quot;The first look through the windows of the observation deck into the two long high-bay areas was stunning. Instead of seeing a few small cascades of centrifuges, which I believed to exist in North Korea, we saw a modern, clean centrifuge plant of more than 1,000 centrifuges, all neatly aligned and plumbed below us.&quot; He said the facility &quot;would fit into any modern American processing facility&quot;. Although he could not verify claims by his hosts that they had already put 2,000 centrifuges into operation, he confirmed he personally saw at least 1,000. Hecker, who was not permitted to photograph the facility, passed on his findings to the White House several days ago, according to media reports. He predicted they would cause &quot;a political firestorm&quot;. The news is the latest in a series of recent blows to Barack Obama&apos;s attempts to keep alive his vision for global nuclear disarmament. The speed with which the plant appears to have been built and its sophistication suggest outside help, at least in acquiring parts. Washington is expected to exploit Hecker&apos;s report to prove that the regime has continued to develop nuclear weapons, despite UN sanctions. Pyongyang has endured near-universal condemnation and punitive measures since conducting nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Hecker said: &quot;It is clear that waiting patiently for Pyongyang to return to the six-party talks on terms acceptable to the United States and its allies will exacerbate the problem ... The only hope appears to be engagement.&quot; Pyongyang has already carried out two nuclear bomb tests. There have been reports that it may be preparing for a third in north Hamgyong province, where it held its second test in May last year, and where new tunnelling work has been spotted recently."}, {"sentences": ["They were happy for Barry Sheene to splash it on all over, while simultaneously enjoying intimacy in the Tokyo Hilton with a generous selection of female cabin staff from some of the world&apos;s favourite airlines."], "tags": ["Sport", "Television", "Television & radio", "Sport TV"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-22T00:06:01Z", "title": "On the scent of the Seventies with James Hunt and Barry Sheene | Martin Kelner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/22/screen-break-james-hunt-barry-sheene", "article": "Guess what they are doing at Nike?

The programme sought to contrast the hedonism of the 1970s when Sheene and his mate, the Formula One driver James Hunt, set new standards in bad behaviour, with today&apos;s prissy, sanitised world of sport, where besuited Nike chaps, going round reeking of Perrier water, rule the roost. As Sir Stirling Moss told the programme: &quot;After a race, instead of chasing girls, now they go and say thanks to Vodafone.&quot; To be honest, I fast forwarded over a lot of the comparison stuff, like the Nike man, and interviews with Kelvin MacKenzie and Max Clifford (if I never see Max talking about celebrity on television, or hear him on radio, ever again in my life, it will be just a smidgin too soon) to get to some brilliant footage of Sheene and Hunt; the crashes, the birds (to use contemporary argot) and especially Dickie Davies. Could it be life was so different then or, to quote the great philosopher and dropper of the letter &quot;a&quot; Barbra Streisand: &quot;Has time rewritten every line?&quot; It was a timely question in a week when a presenter felt constrained to give up his job bringing us the latest news of skateboarding ducks and interviews with Gyles Brandreth on teatime television, because he had been caught exchanging something called &quot;saucy texts&quot; with a female admirer. Sheene and Hunt were exchanging a lot more than that with their admirers. In fact, it seemed the only fluid Sheene actively shunned was Brut 33. According to his widow, Stephanie: &quot;I&apos;d have gone mad if he&apos;d have splashed that all over him. We had buckets of it. We used to give it to his uncle, who used to stink of it.&quot; Stephanie, who may have had a vested interest as she was first dated by Barry after he spotted her advertising Old Spice on TV (TV commercials in those days seemed to serve as a kind of dating agency for celebrities, as Sir Michael Caine found his wife on a Maxwell House coffee ad), was a great witness, as was Barry&apos;s sister Maggie Smart and Hunt&apos;s brother David. &quot;If ever I got irritated by James, I used to remind myself there was a nice bloke hiding inside,&quot; said David. But the real joy of the programme was in its impressive archaeology, reviving an era when camera lenses and open microphones held no terrors for sports stars, and Clifford was usefully employed sending out press releases about pop singers. I particularly enjoyed Hunt telling Moss on a TV show how he achieved so many pole positions. &quot;I just give it arseholes,&quot; he explained. I also liked Murray Walker&apos;s reaction to Lord Alexander Hesketh, Hunt&apos;s portly sponsor, turning up dressed all in white, cracking open bottles of champagne in the pits on the morning of a race. &quot;I thought, well, this is a bit of a rum do,&quot; tutted Walker, whose attitude has not changed significantly if his appearance on Sky&apos;s Time Of Their Lives is anything to go by. Walker told the host Gary Newbon, that when the head of BBC Sport told him in 1980 that Hunt was to be his co-commentator on Formula One, he was horrified, regarding his new partner as &quot;a drunken Hooray Henry, which was not unreasonable because he was&quot;. Walker was clearly less impressed with Hunt&apos;s sexual exploits than the driver&apos;s biographer Tom Rubython, goggle-eyed over on ITV at Hunt&apos;s heavily notched bedpost: &quot;I worked it out at about 5,000, and that&apos;s different ones,&quot; he marvelled. To put that in context, it is the equivalent of 166 Nick Cleggs, but only half a Georges Simenon (who also found time to write a reported 500 novels, and smoke a pipe). Nonetheless, in 1976 Hunt and Sheene also found time to dominate their sport, the only time Britain could boast both the Formula One drivers&apos; champion and 500cc motorcycle champ, and therefore, if Rubython&apos;s mathematics is at all accurate, and saving Belgian writers of formulaic detective novels, truly top of the world."}, {"sentences": ["Bosworth will go on to Beijing and Tokyo to continue discussions on a collective response to the revelations."], "tags": ["North Korea", "US foreign policy", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-22T11:24:00Z", "title": "North Korean nuclear plant 'not a crisis'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/22/north-korea-nuclear-plant-crisis", "article": "Washington&apos;s top envoy on North Korea said today revelations that the regime had made dramatic progress in enriching uranium posed a &quot;difficult problem&quot; but played down fears that the region is on the brink of a nuclear crisis. Speaking to reporters in Seoul, Stephen Bosworth said evidence the North had built an ultramodern enrichment plant was &quot;the latest in a series of provocative moves ... it is a very difficult problem we have been struggling to deal with for 20 years&quot;. &quot;This is not a crisis, we are not surprised. We have been watching and analysing [North Korea&apos;s] aspirations to produce uranium, [but] it is not helpful to jointly agreed goals we have subscribed to in terms of peace, prosperity and stability in the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia.&quot; Bosworth arrived in the region after a US scientist, Siegfried Hecker, said the government in Pyongyang had shown him a &quot;stunning&quot; new uranium enrichment plant at the country&apos;s main nuclear complex at Yongbyon this month. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, said it provided further evidence of North Korea&apos;s increasingly belligerent behaviour. &quot;From my perspective, it&apos;s North Korea continuing on a path which is destabilising for the region. It confirms or validates the concern we&apos;ve had for years about their enriching uranium, which they&apos;ve denied routinely,&quot; said Mullen. &quot;They are a country that routinely we are unable to believe that they would do what they say.&quot; Hecker&apos;s revelations are expected to prompt a rethink over Washington&apos;s policy towards Pyongyang given the failure of sanctions to curb its nuclear ambitions. Mullen said China \u2013 the North&apos;s main ally and biggest aid provider \u2013 had a pivotal role to play. &quot;We&apos;ve been engaged with China for an extended period of time with respect to North Korea ... a great part of this, I think, will have to be done through Beijing,&quot; he said on ABC&apos;s This Week. &quot;I&apos;ve been worried about North Korea and its potential nuclear capability for a long time. This certainly gives that potential real life, very visible life that we all ought to be very, very focused on.&quot; The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said he doubted North Korean claims that the facility is part of a peaceful nuclear energy programme. &quot;I don&apos;t credit that at all,&quot; Gates told reporters in Bolivia, where he is attending a regional defence conference. He said the facility could enable North Korea to build &quot;a number&quot; of nuclear devices. Hecker, a Stanford University professor who was shown around the enrichment plant, said it contained an &quot;astonishingly modern control room&quot; overlooking 2,000 centrifuges. &quot;These facilities appear to be designed primarily for civilian nuclear power, not to boost North Korea&apos;s military capability,&quot; Hecker wrote in a report on his visit. But he added: &quot;Nevertheless, the uranium enrichment facilities could be readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) bomb fuel (or parallel facilities could exist elsewhere).&quot; Despite North Korea&apos;s claims that the facility is designed to produce electricity, the news will trigger suspicions that it is seeking to bolster its weapons capability and gain the upper hand in nuclear talks, as it reels from US and UN sanctions. The North Koreans have created and tested nuclear bombs made from plutonium. The enrichment of uranium represents another potential route to make a bomb. Plutonium and uranium can also be used to make much more powerful thermo-nuclear warheads. Bosworth will go on to Beijing and Tokyo to continue discussions on a collective response to the revelations. Six-nation talks over North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme \u2013 between the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and hosted by China \u2013 have stalled, and some observers speculated that the Pyongyang regime gave Hecker and other scientists access in the hope of strengthening its position at any future multiparty nuclear talks. Washington has refused to consider North Korea&apos;s request to restart six-party negotiations in Beijing until the regime honours previous commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make six to 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proved it has a working nuclear weapon. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos national laboratory, said the new facility appeared to have been built within a year, in the gutted shell of an old fuel fabrication plant at Yongbyon. The nuclear scientist said: &quot;The first look through the windows of the observation deck into the two long high-bay areas was stunning. Instead of seeing a few small cascades of centrifuges, which I believed to exist in North Korea, we saw a modern, clean centrifuge plant of more than 1,000 centrifuges, all neatly aligned and plumbed below us.&quot; He said the facility &quot;would fit into any modern American processing facility&quot;. Although he could not verify claims by his hosts that they had put 2,000 centrifuges into operation, he confirmed he saw at least 1,000. Hecker, who was not permitted to photograph the facility, passed on his findings to the White House several days ago, according to media reports. He predicted they would cause &quot;a political firestorm&quot;. The news is the latest in a series of recent blows to Barack Obama&apos;s attempts to keep alive his vision for global nuclear disarmament. The speed with which the plant appears to have been built and its sophistication suggest outside help, at least in acquiring parts. Washington is expected to exploit Hecker&apos;s report to prove that the regime has continued to develop nuclear weapons, despite UN sanctions. Pyongyang has endured widespread condemnation and punitive measures since conducting nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Hecker said: &quot;It is clear that waiting patiently for Pyongyang to return to the six-party talks on terms acceptable to the United States and its allies will exacerbate the problem ... The only hope appears to be engagement.&quot; Pyongyang has carried out two nuclear bomb tests. There have been reports that it may be preparing for a third in north Hamgyong province, where it held its second test in May last year, and where tunnelling work has been spotted recently."}, {"sentences": ["An escalation in hostilities on the Korean peninsula would, however, force Tokyo to make contingencies for a potential flood of refugees across the Sea of Japan.", "A foreign ministry official in Tokyo quoted by the Kyodo news agency described the shellings as &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;provocative&quot;."], "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-23T07:36:20Z", "title": "North Korea fires on South Korea \u2013 live coverage", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2010/nov/23/north-korea-fires-south-korea", "article": "     Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    4.30pm: That&apos;s it for today, thanks for reading and for the comments. Tania has just filed a story on today&apos;s events:  South Korea warned today that it will unleash &quot;enormous retaliation&quot; if North Korea launches fresh attacks against its territory. North Korean troops bombarded Yeonpyeong, an island in disputed waters, with dozens of rounds of artillery earlier today, reportedly killing two South Korean soldiers and injuring around 20 people. Seoul placed its military on its highest non-wartime alert level, scrambling F-16 fighter jets to the western sea and returning fire, officials said. It warned that the attack was a violation of the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, who convened an emergency security meeting shortly after the initial bombardment, said an &quot;indiscriminate attack on civilians&quot; could never be tolerated. &quot;Enormous retaliation should be made, to the extent that [North Korea] cannot make provocations again,&quot; he said. The assault is one of the most serious in the decades since the war, given the involvement of civilians, although previous firefights around the disputed maritime border have resulted in a higher number of casualties. In a short statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North said the South had fired first \u2013 presumably in reference to a live-fire drill being carried out as part of annual military exercises. It said it had repeatedly warned the South not to go ahead with the drill. ... Read more here.   2.40pm: The President of South Korea has said he believes &quot;enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again&quot;. Quoted by Yonhap news agency, Lee Myung-bak said: &quot;Reckless attacks on South Korean civilians are not tolerable, especially when South Korea is providing North Korea with humanitarian aid.&quot; &quot;As for such attacks on civilians, a response beyond the rule of engagement is necessary.  &quot;Our military should show this through action rather than an administrative response,&quot; he added. Lee did not rule out the possibility of follow-up attacks. &quot;Given that North Korea maintains an offensive posture, I think the Army, the Navy and the Air Force should unite and retaliate against [the North&apos;s] provocation with multiple-fold firepower,&quot; Lee said.  &quot;I think enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again.&quot;  2.00pm: My colleague Simon Rogers has used a 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, to map out the 150 incidents which have occurred between North and South Korea since the Korea War in 1950. You can read more on the Guardian&apos;s Datablog and see the incidents across North and South Korea here:      1.38pm: Justin McCurry reports from Osaka on Japan&apos;s reaction to this morning&apos;s developments \u2013 Japan being one of the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks.       The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has instructed government colleagues to be prepared &quot;for any contingency&quot; in the wake of North Korea&apos;s attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong earlier today. Kan said he had told his cabinet to &quot;put all efforts into gathering information and ... to prepare to be able to respond firmly to any eventuality.&quot; Japan&apos;s efforts will, for the time being, be limited to information gathering \u2013 in any case its &quot;pacifist&quot; constitution forbids it from mobilizing forces in response to an attack on an ally. An escalation in hostilities on the Korean peninsula would, however, force Tokyo to make contingencies for a potential flood of refugees across the Sea of Japan. Nevertheless Japan, which is still trying to establish the whereabouts of several of its nationals abducted by Pyongyang agents at the height of the cold war, considers itself near the top of North Korea&apos;s list of potential targets. A foreign ministry official in Tokyo quoted by the Kyodo news agency described the shellings as &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;provocative&quot;.  1.16pm: News of the exchange of fire has sent the South Korean currency tumbling, with the won currently down 3.5% on the US dollar. The South Korean central bank, after an emergency meeting, says it planned to co-operate with the government to take measures to stabilise markets if necessary.  Many traders expect South Korea&apos;s financial markets to fall further when trading opens tomorrow. However the drop against the dollar should be seen in the context of the dollar spiking in reaction to the news of the shelling \u2013 as my colleague Graeme Wearden, who knows much more about such matters, reported in our 11.02am post.  12.22pm: Mark Tran, Guardian colleague specialising in international news, has been mulling over the events of this morning. He says the key to rehabilitating North Korea into the international community lies with the US:       Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian    North Korea is a case of what Richard Nixon used to describe as the madman theory of politics, designed to keep opponents off balance. This is how Nixon described his approach \u2013 when he was trying to extricate the US from Vietnam \u2013 to his chief of staff Bob Hadelman. Nixon said: &quot;I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I&apos;ve reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We&apos;ll just slip the word to them that, &apos;for God&apos;s sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can&apos;t restrain him when he&apos;s angry -- and he has his hand on the nuclear button&apos; -- and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.&quot; This time it&apos;s not Nixon acting crazy, it&apos;s the North Korean leadership. Yet there is some method behind the madness for North Korea. As Simon Tisdall wrote below, North Korea has consistently pursued a fundamental objective \u2013 a non-aggression pact with the US. But as far as the US is concerned, it has no intention with rewarding North Korea&apos;s &quot;bad behaviour&quot; with a peace treaty. Bill Clinton tried the carrot approach in the 1990s when he agreed to provide aid to Pyongyang in exchange for North Korea&apos;s commitment to stop its nuclear programme under the 1994 &quot;agreed framework&quot;. That deal eventually broke down with both sides blaming each other.  When George Bush became president, his administration dismissed the Clinton approach as appeasement. But eventually he adopted a less confrontational approach not so different from Clinton&apos;s, only to see the North Koreans testing its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Since then it&apos;s been a roller-coaster, with signs of progress interspersed setbacks.  Meanwhile, South Korea under Lee Myung-bak, who became president in 2008, ditched his predecessor&apos;s conciliatory &quot;sunshine policy&quot; for a more hard-headed approach, reinforcing North Korea&apos;s sense of isolation. The key lies with the US, which can offer only what North Korea wants. But it&apos;s difficult for Barack Obama to show flexibility when the North Koreans behave so provocatively.  11.50am: Time for a bit of a recap after a tumultuous morning.      \u2022 Two South Korean marines have died after North Korea fired shells at on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. South Korea&apos;s Joint Chief of Staff said 16 others were injured during the bombardment of the island, which is located near the countries&apos; disputed western border. \u2022 South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets in response to the attack. North Korea has not confirmed whether it suffered any losses. South Korea has accused its neighbour of an &quot;intentional and planned attack&quot;, and said North Korea&apos;s action violated the 1953 armistice between the two countries. \u2022 North Korea has issued a robust response, accusing South Korea of firing first and saying it was provoked into taking action. South Korea was undertaking an annual military drill before North Korea fired. &quot;Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we&apos;ve taken strong military action immediately,&quot; the North&apos;s official KCNA news agency said. \u2022 The international community has criticised North Korea, with the White House describing the attack as &quot;belligerent&quot;. In the UK, foreign secretary William Hague said the attack was &quot;unprovoked&quot; and said the country &quot;strongly condemns&quot; it. A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said North Korea&apos;s action was &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;. \u2022 China, North Korea&apos;s only major ally, expressed &quot;concern&quot; over the initial reports, but called on both Koreas to &quot;do more to contribute to peace&quot;. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was now &quot;imperative to resume six-party talks&quot;. North Korea quit talks with South Korea, the US, China, Russia and Japan in April last year.  11.23am: William Hague, the foreign secretary, has put out a statement condemning the attack on South Korea.  The UK strongly condemns North Korea&apos;s unprovoked attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong Island. Such unprovoked attacks will only lead to further tensions on the Korean Peninsula. We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from such attacks and adhere to the Korean Armistice agreement. I welcome President Lee Myung-bak&apos;s call for restraint.   11.02am: My colleague Graeme Wearden reports that the military action alarmed the stockmarkets this morning:      With markets already nervous following the political crisis in Ireland, news of the shelling helped to send shares falling sharply when trading began. The FTSE fell by 66 points at one stage to 5614, down 1.1%, and there were similar falls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The dollar also spiked (traders typically run to the [perceived] safety of the greenback when bombs start to fall). The South Korean Won was hit hard, falling 3.75% against the dollar, and other Asian currencies also fell. There was also a significant leap in the cost of insuring South Korean government debt -- with its five-year credit default swap jumping by 18 basis points to 102bp. That still makes South Korean debt a very safe bet, though (the Irish CDS is more than five times higher). A rumour travelled around the City this morning that North Korea&apos;s attack had been prompted by the death of Kim Jong-il \u2013 perhaps to prove to the world that the country was still in firm hands. Neil Hume, the editor of FT Alphaville, tweeted the speculation: &quot;@humenm: Warning broker RAW: Unconfirmed chat that kim jung-il has died. Prompts the shelling from north korea as being reported by newswires.&quot; Most raw gossip from stockbrokers should treated extremely cautiously, of course.  10.43am: Tania Branigan has more on the events that preceded shells being fired \u2013\u00a0when South Korea was undertaking military drills close to Yeonpyeong.     Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    The North Korean artillery attack followed a live-fire exercise by the South as part of its annual Hoguk military drills. The Korea Herald reported that the North faxed a message to the South this morning saying it would not &quot;just sit back&quot; while the South carried out the exercise, citing military officials. The Korea Times reported last week that the US had pulled out of the joint drill citing scheduling conflicts, but had said it would seek to rearrange the exercise.  10.36am: North Korea has accused South Korea of firing first, saying it was provoked into the military action, which has killed two soldiers in the South and set dozens of houses ablaze.  &quot;Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we&apos;ve taken strong military action immediately,&quot; the North&apos;s official KCNA news agency said in a brief statement.  It did not elaborate whether North Korea had suffered any losses from the exchange of fire.  10.25am: South Korea&apos;s defence ministry has said North Korea&apos;s firing of artillery shells voilated the armistice between the two countries. &quot;This is an intentional and planned attack... and it is clearly in violation of the armistice,&quot; Lee Hong-ki, South Korea&apos;s defence ministry official, told reporters.  10.03am:  This map shows just how close the island of Yeonpyeon is to North and South Korea&apos;s disputed border.       9.58am: Reuters news agency is now also reporting that two South Korean marines have been killed. Quoting South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff, it says four more soldiers have been seriously injured on Yeonpyeong island.  9.50am: The White House has issued a statement describing North Korea&apos;s action as &quot;belligerent&quot; and reinforcing US support for South Korea:  The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action and to fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement. The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability.   9.38am: Tweet from Yonhap News, the publicly funded South Korean news agency, on South Korea&apos;s initial diplomatic response:       (URGENT) South Korea indefinitely postpones Red Cross talks with North Korea slated for Thursday: official  9.34am: Another marine has died following North Korea&apos;s shelling of Yeonpyeong island, taking the number of soldiers killed to two, Yonhap news agency is reporting. More shortly.  9.31am: Potentially awkward moment in Guangzhou, China, this morning, where two South and North Korean archers stood side-by-side on the Asian Games podium as their countries fired shells at one another. South Korea&apos;s Yun Ok-hee won gold in the women&apos;s individual archery competition, while Kwon Un Sil from North Korea took bronze, and stood beside Yun when they received their medals. &quot;Kwon, wearing a red team jacket, and Yun, with a multicolored team top, both stood with their hands behind their backs before the medals were presented,&quot; AP reports. &quot;Yun waved her national flag to a crowd of South Korean fans and held it up as all three medalists stood for photos.&quot;  9.23am: China, North Korea&apos;s only major ally, has expressed &quot;concern&quot; over the reports that North Korea has shelled a South Korean island, and called for six party talks on its nuclear aspirations to resume. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, told a news conference both sides of the divided Korean peninsula should &quot;do more to contribute to peace&quot;, and said it was imperative to return to six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. &quot;We have heard reports and express our concern. The situation still needs to be confirmed,&quot; said Hong, responding to a question about the North Korean artillery attack.&quot;China hopes that the relevant parties will do more to contribute to peace and stability in the region,&quot; he added. &quot;It is imperative now to resume the six-party talks.&quot; China is North Korea&apos;s only major ally, and its economic and diplomatic support have been important to shoring up its otherwise isolated neighbour, whose leader Kim Jong-il visited China twice this year to strengthen ties.  North Korea quit six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US in April last year. The country has indicated it would return to talks on the condition it first gets face to face talks with the US. The Obama administration has so largely resisted.  9.09am: This footage from CNN appears to show smoke rising from the Yeonpyeong, and buildings ablaze on the island:             .  9.02am: Tania Branigan emails from Beijing:     Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    The artillery attacks are a &quot;totally justifiable act of self-defence&quot; in response to the South&apos;s sea drills, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea has said, warning that nuclear war could follow &quot;at any point&quot; unless the exercises stop. Pyongyang has repeatedly issued such threats in the past. &quot;We repeatedly warned South Korea to stop its dangerous war games. If the South continues its dangerous behaviour, Seoul will be the next target. It will be a sea of fire. Nuclear war could start at any point,&quot; said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace. He said it was fair to describe him as speaking on behalf of the North&apos;s government. He added: &quot;We have repeatedly warned the South to avoid endangering our territory on sea or air.&quot;  8.56am: In the comments below, seoulman writes expressively of the mood in South Korea:      I&apos;m posting this from Seoul. Everyone is watching the news closely but there isn&apos;t any signs of panic. A few people, my girlfriend included have a sense of seeing this all before. I&apos;m not trying to play it down, my arse went a bit when I heard the news but people are still going about there normal business.  8.47am: Reports are suggesting the shelling has now ceased, but fires are still burning on Yeonpyeong. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to &quot;sternly respond&quot; to North Korea&apos;s action, but also called on officials to make sure that the &quot;situation would not escalate,&quot; a presidential official told Associated Press.  Lee is holding a security meeting in a presidential situation room, the official said. North Korea&apos;s actions &quot;are illegal and a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement&quot; that ended the Korean War, a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said. He said South Korea responded to the shelling by firing a K-9 155mm self-propelled howitzer. However the JCS official declined to say whether North Korean territory was hit by the South Korean artillery. The official said island residents are escaping to about 20 shelters in the island.  8.34am: Simon Tisdall, assistant editor of the Guardian and foreign affairs columnist, writes that North Korea is seeking &quot;acceptance by the great powers&quot;:      The sudden flareup in hostilities will be attributed to several factors. But as far as North Korea is concerned, one motive above all guides its behaviour: it desire for international attention. This has been largely lacking over the past year following the stalling of the six party talks, involving the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and China, on the regime&apos;s rogue nuclear and missile programmes. Pyongyang wants to hold face to face negotiations with the US alone but so far the Obama administration has largely resisted. The main difference is the agenda for any resumed talks, with Washington insistent that the aim must be the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. Today&apos;s violence follows the sinking earlier this year of a South Korean naval vessel, which was blamed on the North - though it denies involvement. This too was seen by analysts as a bid by the regime to get the world&apos;s attention. The North badly needs more international economic, development and food aid to bolster its chronically mismanaged economy. Its maverick leadership also seems to crave acceptance by the great powers. At present, paranoia reigns, amid constant claims tha the US is seeking regime change. This instability has been exacerbated by an apparent succession process in which the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il, is seeking to gradually transfer power to his youngest son. But regional analysts suggest that notwithstanding any steps he takes now, a fight for power could erupt when the ailing Kim dies. That struggle may already be underway and could involve members of the powerful military involved in triggering today&apos;s fighting. China, the North&apos;s only influential ally, has been urging the US to engage with the regime in order to defuse tensions. It has also held two summits with Kim this year. Chinese diplomats maintain Beijing has limited influence and are privately critical and alarmed, in equal measure, at the North&apos;s aggressive behaviour.  8.24am: This footage from YTN television, based in South Korea, appears to show images of of the impact of the shells on Yeonpyeong island:            .  8.19am: More from Tania:     Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Yonhap has also reported that the government is considering pulling South Korean nationals out of the North following the exchange of fire. We will decide whether we should evacuate them or not after looking into the safety of those at the Mount Kumgang resort and the Kaesong industrial park,&quot; the Unification Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mount Kumgang is a tourist resort, while Kaesong is a joint enterprise zone. But both have experienced their share of trouble in the past \u2013 in 2008, a Northern soldier shot dead a Southern tourist after she wandered into a restricted zone at the beauty spot, while the Kaesong complex has struggled amid increasing friction on the peninsula.  The official said officials would also reconsider plans to hold Red Cross talks with North Korea on Thursday in the South Korean border town of Munsan. Until last week, many had hoped that relations were thawing again after a long period of deterioration. The North was angered when President Lee took office in Seoul and adopted a tougher stance towards it than his predecessor, cutting off free-flowing aid.  8.10am: Dr Park Young-Ho, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, has said he believes the shelling is an attempt by North Korea to &quot;turn this region into a conflict zone&quot;.  Although I can&apos;t be certain of the rationale behind North Korea&apos;s attacks yet, I see it as North Korea&apos;s intention to turn this region into a conflict zone so that it can bring the concerned parties to the discussion table.By showing that it has nuclear capacity and by firing artillery shells today, I think it is trying to make a point that it is militarily capable and thus should not be lightly regarded. Ultimately, I think it is strategically seeking to tilt talks concerning the contested Northern Limit Line and the peace treaty towards its advantage.   7.54am: The Guardian&apos;s Tania Branigan reports:     Tania Branigan Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Seoul is examining whether the artillery attack is related to its drills near the western sea border, a spokeswoman for the presidential Blue House said today, according to Yonhap. Kim Hee-jung told reporters that officials were looking into the North&apos;s motive, adding: &quot;Our Navy was conducting a maritime exercise near the western sea border today. North Korea has sent a letter of protest over the drill. We&apos;re examining a possible link between the protest and the artillery attack.&quot; South Korea&apos;s president Lee Myung-bak has told senior officials that the government must &quot;carefully manage the situation to prevent the escalation of the clash,&quot; another spokesperson said. He is due to hold an emergency meeting of ministers at an underground bunker in Seoul shortly, his aide Park Jung-ha added.  7.44am: North Korea started firing on South Korean waters off the island of Yeonpyeong at around 2.34pm local time, some of them landing directly on the island, Yonhap news agency is reporting. Col Lee Bung-woo, spokesman for South Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap the South had fired back some 80 rounds. The military is on its highest peacetime alert, he said, adding that the South Korean air force has deployed fighter jets to the island.  7.36am: Yonhap News, the South Korean publicly funded news agency, is reporting that one South Korean soldier has been killed in the shelling. Yonhap quotes an unnamed official. We&apos;ll hopefully have more information soon.  7.30am: North Korea has fired dozens of rounds of artillery onto a populated South Korean island near their disputed western border, military officials have said. The shells have set several buildings on fire, reportedly injuring two people, and have prompted South Korea to return fire and scramble fighter jets. The skirmish came amid tension over North Korea&apos;s claim that it has a new uranium enrichment facility and just over a month after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il unveiled his youngest son Kim Jong Un as his heir apparent. South Korea&apos;s YTN television has said two people were injured, several houses were on fire and shells are still falling on Yeonpyeong island. The station is broadcasting pictures of thick columns of black smoke rising from the island. Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, says four soldiers have been wounded. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to make sure that the firing wouldn&apos;t escalate, according to Yonhap, quoting a presidential official. YTN said between 1,200 and 1,300 people live on the island. A South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official said dozens of rounds of artillery landed on the island and in the sea. The official says South Korea fired back. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of JCS rules, said South Korea&apos;s military is on alert. He had no other details, and could not confirm the reports of casualties. Tensions between the two Koreas also remain tense after the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. Seoul has blamed a North Korean torpedo, while Pyongyang has denied any responsibility.  The countries&apos; western maritime boundary has long been a flash point between the two Koreas. The North does not recognize the border that was unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the close of the 1950-53 Korean War. North and South Korea have fought three bloody skirmishes near the maritime border in recent years, most recently in November 2009."}, {"sentences": ["Whisky expert Dominic Roskrow will be signing copies of his new book, The World&apos;s Best Whiskies: 750 Unmissable Drams from Tokyo to Tennessee."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2010-11-23T09:00:03Z", "title": "Edinburgh today: trams dispute take-two, traffic study for The Shore and a call for social media surgeons", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2010/nov/23/edinburgh-trams-tro-shore-social-media-surgeries", "article": "Good morning Edinburgh.  This morning from 10am the council&apos;s transport committee will have a second go at debating the knock-on effects of planned tram-works-related road closures.  I blogged previously about how members of the Moray Feu residents association and the Keep Blenheim Place Open Group left the last council transport meeting disappointed. They were planning to highlight concerns about closures but councillors asked for more legal advice. The two groups are set to return to make their cases to the council today.  An update report into hopes to cut traffic at The Shore in Leith will also be presented at the meeting. A \u00a310,000 fund was recently approved for a traffic modelling study, following a successful request through the Leith Neighbourhood Partnership. It is expected the results of that study will also be presented at today&apos;s meeting. Among its findings is that it would cost an estimated \u00a3300,000 to widen pavements in the area. I&apos;m off the radar today so can&apos;t be at the meeting, but hope to report on its outcomes tomorrow.  Tonight from 6pm the west end Waterstones is holding a book reading with a difference.

The Isango Portobello group, which grew from a township to perform award-winning interpretations of Mozart&apos;s The Magic Flute (Impempe Yomlingo) and The Mysteries (Yiimimangaliso) in London, and its director Mark Dornford-May arrived at the Fugard Theatre in Cape Town yesterday to find the doors locked against them. A statement from Isango, which has around 40 actors, compared the eviction with the apartheid government&apos;s forced removals of black people from Cape Town&apos;s District Six, which is home to the new theatre, named after leading South African playwright Athol Fugard . But Eric Abraham, the theatre owner and Isango&apos;s patron, said he was left with no choice because the company&apos;s shows played to near-empty houses and made losses that were unsustainable. The Fugard Theatre, redeveloped from two warehouses and a church, opened with great fanfare last February at a gala attended by government ministers, director Sean Mathias, actors Alan Rickman and Janet Suzman and Fugard himself. Abraham, a film and West End theatre producer in Britain, spoke to the audience about Isango&apos;s rise and secure future: &quot;From Khayelitsha to London&apos;s West End twice \u2013 an Olivier Award \u2013 to standing ovations in Dublin, Tokyo, Paris and elsewhere. All out of a church hall in Athlone and steel containers. Well now your homeless days are over.&quot; But the relationship between South African-born Abraham and artistic director Dornford-May, from Goole in the East Riding, has soured in the past nine months. Having been locked out of the premises yesterday, Isango then issued a statement entitled: &quot;Isango acting company forcibly removed from District Six home.&quot; It said: &quot;Shamila Rahim, the theatre manager who was in the office, was escorted out of the building by a security guard and her keys taken. &quot;Shamila has been working on the creation of a theatre for District Six since 2003. Her grandmother was one of the many who were evicted from District Six during the clearances. She is sad and shocked at the way history has repeated itself once again.&quot; The statement added: &quot;Recently Eric Abraham has severed links with the company&apos;s co-founders Mark Dornford-May and Pauline Malefane. He says he is concerned about the company&apos;s financial dependency on him.&quot; Abraham said today the decision was made &quot;following the discovery of certain financial irregularities that have taken place and which are currently being investigated,&quot; though he declined to elaborate. He told the Guardian: &quot;It&apos;s enormously regrettable. It was a decision I took as a last resort after months of attempts to negotiate which have ended in stalemate. It&apos;s tragic really. I feel for the cast because they have been misled and given one version of the story.&quot; Abraham \u2013 who with his wife Sigrid Rausing co-founded Portobello Books \u2013 said he has been Isango&apos;s sole benefactor over the past four years, putting in more than 30m rand (\u00a32.6m), and underwrote the Fugard Theatre at a cost of around 20m rand (\u00a31.8m). &quot;I embarked on this as an affirmation. It was an act of cultural philanthropy. But it was predicated on them building a sustainable model. I now feel I am to blame for creating a culture of entitlement.&quot; He insisted that the theatre had never been intended for Isango&apos;s use alone, and had enjoyed hits with Waiting for Godot, starring Sir Ian McKellen, and Fugard&apos;s The Train Driver, which transferred to the Hampstead Theatre in London. But Abraham said box office sales for Isango&apos;s past two productions, Aesop&apos;s Fables and The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, were just 20% of capacity. The latter show, which closed on Saturday night, cost upwards of 600,000 rand (\u00a353,405) to stage and brought in a return of just 143,000 rand (\u00a312,728). Abraham, a former foreign correspondent for the BBC and Guardian, said Isango had failed to grow the black audience needed to make the financial model viable. &quot;The box office reality of their productions has not been encouraging. There is no way one can sustain it with figures of 20%. The group may well be successful abroad but there is a fair way to go at home. &quot;Theatre is still a peripheral white activity in South Africa. The reality of the Fugard Theatre is that 97% of audience members have been white in spite of the enormous efforts we have made.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Named after the B-side of the Velvet Underground&apos;s All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties single, I&apos;ll be Your Mirror will debut in Tokyo on 27 February."], "tags": ["All Tomorrow's Parties", "Festivals", "Music", "Portishead", "Indie", "Electronic music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-25T16:43:24Z", "title": "Portishead to curate new ATP event", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/25/portishead-curate-new-atp-event", "article": "All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties is to launch its new festival series early next year.

After the festival makes its debut in Japan in February, the UK&apos;s inaugural I&apos;ll Be Your Mirror, curated by Portishead, will take place on 23-24 July 2011, in London. For more than 10 years, ATP has hosted holiday-camp festivals and one-off gigs everywhere from upstate New York to the Somerset coast. ATP has become synonymous with great shows, intimate parties, cosy pubs and real beds; it&apos;s as if organisers suddenly realised that cities have these things too. While there is no replacing Butlins, the opportunity to take the Tube home will be much welcome. Named after the B-side of the Velvet Underground&apos;s All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties single, I&apos;ll be Your Mirror will debut in Tokyo on 27 February. It is a one-day event curated by festival organisers, with appearances by Dirty Three, Boris and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Much more interesting is the July weekend, announced yesterday, which will be held at London&apos;s Alexandra Palace. &quot;[We have] been given the horrendous task of joining up with our favourite festival in the world and choosing a dream list of bands we would like to play with \u2013 at least the ones that aren&apos;t dead or in jail,&quot; explained Portishead&apos;s Geoff Barrow. The trip-hop group will headline both nights, featuring performances by Liars, Swans, the Books, DOOM and Beach House, as well as American hip-hop crew Company Flow, who are making their first UK appearance in a decade. The bill also includes The Passion of Joan of Arc, presumably a reference to the film-score collaboration by Portishead&apos;s Adrian Utley and Goldfrapp&apos;s Will Gregory.

Among her countless collaborators is Kanye West, a man so in awe that he&apos;s described her as &quot;the scariest artist right now.&quot; She lent a now-celebrated rap to his track &quot;Monster&quot; which included the brilliant boast that she commands &quot;50k for a verse no album out!&quot; Now though, finally, her debut is out: Pink Friday has been so hyped and so long awaited that its release last week reached that curious status of an &quot;event&quot;. As I wait to meet her at her label&apos;s New York office, there are at least six people engaged in frantic preparations. One is tasked with fetching drinks (&quot;Not soda \u2014 juice!&quot;). Another runs in bearing an icebox for the juice-not-soda. Someone else is on the phone urgently trying to sort out some honey. When the lady herself arrives, she&apos;s flanked by about 11 people and I&apos;m kicked out until 15 minutes later the door is reopened by a woman filled with all the bonhomie of a prison warden. She jerks her head inside: &quot;You ready?&quot; Inside, a petite and pinkified Minaj is perched in an armchair clutching a cup of tea. She&apos;s well wrapped up against a New York November but out from the swaddled layers peek two fluoro-fuchsia legs that end in silver stacked heels. Before moving to the borough of Queens at the age of five, she lived with her grandmother in Trinidad and Tobago, but now she speaks in a voice as honeyed as the tea she&apos;s sipping and keeps clearing her throat, a dainty little mannerism indicating a diva&apos;s concern for her pipes. When I ask what it is about her that she thinks has got people so excited she answers immediately: &quot;Daring to smile and have fun again in hip-hop.&quot; She goes on, warming: &quot;Fresh, new, different, exciting\u2026 pink! Euphoria! Saying, you know what, this may be the most hideous outfit that you&apos;ve ever seen but I don&apos;t care and I&apos;m gonna wear it. People enjoy theatrics, they want a show, they want to be entertained.&quot; And entertain she does. It&apos;s not often that a serious hip-hop artist makes you laugh, but Minaj&apos;s flourishes of operatic vibrato and her cartoonish, wide-eyed performance style are hilarious. But the excitement surrounding her album is also, no doubt, down to a paucity of young female MCs. That she should be both enormously talented as well as original and funny goes some way to explaining the Pink Friday mania. The first track on the album is called &quot;I&apos;m the Best&quot; and, as opening salvos go, it&apos;s a pretty irrefutable claim. On it, she raps: &quot;I&apos;m fighting for the girls that never thought they could win&quot; and: &quot;I am here to reverse the curse that they lived in.&quot; Minaj is fully aware that &quot;a lot is riding on this album&quot;. &quot;I realise that when this album does well there are doors that will be kicked open for female rappers immediately. I always wanted to be someone who spearheaded a movement, not just did something that worked for me. I want to get girls excited about being female rappers again and knowing that they can be kooky, goofy, playful, serious, hardcore \u2013 whatever it is, but you have the choice now.&quot; Does she think hip-hop is still a man&apos;s world? She takes a huge breath and then lets out a long sigh. &quot;I just want to be so careful in the way that I answer that question.&quot; She pauses. &quot;I mean, statistically, maybe yes. But realistically, no. I feel that I am doing everything the boys can and have done, plus more. And so if I go ahead and say, &apos;Yeah, it&apos;s man&apos;s world&apos;, I feel like I would make young girls feel like, &apos;Oh God, well Nicki even said it&apos;s a man&apos;s world.&apos; No, no: it&apos;s a leader&apos;s world. Doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re a man or woman.&quot; She does concede, though, that female MCs have been, &quot;a little lost for a few years. We just had to get back our footing, get back our confidence. Female rappers tend to have a lower self-esteem and they don&apos;t believe in themselves as much as they should.&quot; Such sisterliness isn&apos;t felt by all parties. Recently, a video surfaced of her peer Lil&apos; Kim performing in a club, declaring: &quot;I will erase this bitch&apos;s social security number\u2026 I&apos;d kill that bitch with my old shit.&quot; It&apos;s assumed that she was responding to Minaj&apos;s track &quot;Roman&apos;s Revenge&quot;, a formidable and foul-mouthed collaboration with Eminem, in which Minaj spits the inimitable lines: &quot;Word, that bitch mad &apos;cause I took the spot?/ Well, bitch, if you ain&apos;t shittin&apos;, then get off the pot.&quot; The Roman of the title is one of Minaj&apos;s alter egos, Roman Zolanski. She seamlessly switches into a posh, vaguely British accent to introduce him to me. &quot;Roman&apos;s a little gay boy who lives in me. And every time I talk he sort of just appears and I tell him, &apos;Roman, you know, stop it, you&apos;ve gone mad, I tell you, mad.&apos; He&apos;s an outlet to say what I need to say but sometimes don&apos;t want to.&quot; Sure enough, the track ends with Nicki-as-Roman&apos;s mother, crying: &quot;Stop it! Stop it!&quot; and: &quot;Wash your mouth out with soap, boys&quot;, a deft little feint towards self-censorship. Now Minaj is on an alter-ego roll: &quot;Then there&apos;s Barbie,&quot; she says, in a tiny, breathy voice. This, to honour her with her full name, is Harajuku Barbie; the epithet refers to the playful street fashions found around Harajuku station in Tokyo to which Minaj, with her pink-dipped, bright blond hair, seems indebted. &quot;She&apos;s innocent,&quot; explains Minaj-as-Barbie. &quot;She lives in a fantasy land and she plays dress up. And she&apos;s really cutesy. And, you know, you can&apos;t be mad at her because she&apos;s sweet.&quot; She has previously said that she adopted these fantasy identities to escape the sound of her parents fighting: according to Minaj, her father drank, took drugs and once tried to kill her mother by setting the house on fire. Snapping into a tougher twang now, she says: &quot; Then you have Nicki who&apos;s straight out of the streets of Southside Jamaica, Queens, New York City, who has been working on her craft for seven, eight, nine years and is now ready to rule the world.&quot; Minaj has already created a whole world, though. Her online Nictionary will tell you, for example, that &quot;Alfred Bitchcock&quot; is &quot;a term of endearment from one bitchy Harajuku Barbie to another&quot;, while a &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; is &quot;one who loses sight of her goals and her CAKE by focusing on BEEF and negativity&quot;. It&apos;s funny and engaging, but the point is that the idiolect and alter egos seem to keep her balanced as the pressure of her burgeoning fame builds. &quot;They keep each other from being suicidal at times,&quot; she says. &quot;And I hate to use that term loosely, but\u2026 you can tell people, &apos;Don&apos;t kill yourself, don&apos;t be weak&apos;, but until you walk a day in someone&apos;s shoes you don&apos;t know what that real pressure is. We&apos;re human. I create personalities to get through the day. It&apos;s like a defence mechanism for me so I don&apos;t have to deal with everything.&quot; One of the things Minaj has had to deal with is that wearisome question of image. When she first started putting out mixtapes (the first was 2007&apos;s &quot;Playtime Is Over&quot;), most photoshoots she did were overtly sexual. &quot;But recently,&quot; as she says, &quot;I&apos;ve switched it up and just tried to show people a whole different bunch of sides to me. I would be lying if I said I don&apos;t like to look sexy. But then there are some days when I don&apos;t want to look or feel sexy. So it just plays into how women are so multifaceted.

Not only are there her basics \u2013 hats, mittens and scarves, which all need finishing by hand \u2013 but also bestselling graphic cushions and lambswool blankets to produce. Then there are the &quot;creatures&quot; \u2013 Wilson&apos;s hand-knitted army of oddball characters and mutant animals. &quot;I took to knitting long-legged dolls while studying at the Royal College,&quot; says Wilson, now 33. &quot;My tutor, Freddie Robins, said I should take them into the design shop Couverture.&quot; They snapped them up on the spot. First she made Angry Ginger, a small knitted being with red hair and a hairy chest. Then two-headed Terry and Tina, a set of cuddly Siamese twins. &quot;I was inspired by children&apos;s drawings and how naive they are,&quot; Wilson says. &quot;I love the spontaneity \u2013 how five legs on a cat doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; It wasn&apos;t long before design entrepreneur Murray Moss, founder of Moss in Manhattan, got wind of Wilson&apos;s work. &quot;He came over to see me, and I didn&apos;t even know who he was.&quot; Moss bought up the entire collection. Then she was invited to do a show at Trico gallery in Tokyo. &quot;My mum, my auntie and I flew out there with our bags stuffed full of creatures,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;That&apos;s when the orders started coming in in their hundreds.&quot; Her work has spawned legions of copycats, and for a while misshaped creatures seemed to be everywhere. Recently, in conjunction with east London design store SCP, Wilson has branched out into furniture. In 2008 she produced a rainbow-coloured footstool called Motley which launched at the Milan Furniture Fair, and followed this with two sofas, Hugh and Mabel \u2013 one solid and square in block colours and the other curvier, &quot;like a boat&quot;. This year she has produced a rug and a pouffe based on a Fair Isle jumper design, a reference to her Scottish heritage. She has also been crowned Elle Decoration&apos;s designer of the year and next year plans to travel in Scandinavia, the spiritual home of her quirky aesthetic, to refine some of her ideas. Although Wilson is now stocked in 150 shops in 25 countries, she manages to stay true to the brand&apos;s homespun ethos. There&apos;s an army of remote workers taking care of the creatures \u2013 including 50-year-old Elaine from Orkney, who turns out 40 Cyril Squirrels a week. The blankets are produced in one of the last remaining factories in Galashiels, once the heart of the British knitting industry; the rugs are woven in Wales, and the rest is made in her studio by her staff of four. &quot;When I went to the factory five years ago I\u00a0was too scared to order more than a\u00a0few small blankets. They took a chance on me. Now they have six machines knitting for us,&quot; she says. &quot;We can&apos;t get much bigger. The other day, for the first time, I actually saw a man wearing one of my hats. It was bright green with a big pink pompom. It was amazing.&quot; For details, go to donnawilson.com PAUL DE ZWARTFURNITURE DESIGNER     Photograph: Hege Saebjornsen for the Observer    Like much good design, Another Country was born out of need. Creative director Paul de Zwart, 41, was searching for pieces to put in his Dorset home. &quot;I was looking for archetypal three-legged stools which I could use as side tables,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted something well made, that would last a long time and was a fair price. I didn&apos;t want to go to Habitat and it wasn&apos;t about going to Ikea. It sounds simple \u2013 but it didn&apos;t exist.&quot; It&apos;s not as if he didn&apos;t know where to look. De Zwart, along with Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, was one of the founders of design bible Wallpaper*. He had also worked with celebrated interior designer Ilse Crawford on two hotel projects and, prior to the creation of Established &amp; Sons, had long collaborated with Alasdhair Willis. If anyone knew the best places to source furniture, De Zwart did. While many people would just go out and buy the next best thing, De Zwart decided to create the pieces himself. &quot;I think it&apos;s because at my core I am a frustrated architect,&quot; he says. &quot;I wake up every day wanting to be one.&quot; De Zwart spent a year researching what was already on the market. &quot;I looked at the Japanese heritage of working with wood \u2013 the pared-down simplicity,&quot; he says. &quot;And I looked at the hugely influential Scandinavian market \u2013 the handsome Shaker stuff and mid-century designer pieces.&quot; Then he measured up. He took down the vital statistics of all manner of existing furniture, as well as the height and reach of his eight-year-old daughter, because he wanted it to work for children, too. Finally, he set about sketching a simple six-piece modular collection consisting of a\u00a0bench, a day bed, a chair, a stool and two types of table. He tracked down a local Dorset craftsman, Dominic Parish, who refined the designs for him, and production began. De Zwart realised that the only way to sell at the fair price he wanted was to sidestep the huge mark-ups of the high street and sell online. Another Country was launched at the London Design Festival in September and is now selling an astonishing \u00a325,000-worth of furniture a month. &quot;It wasn&apos;t purposeful, but we seemed to fit into a number of trends that have become important,&quot; he says. &quot;The return to craft, for example, and a greater care about how we do things.&quot; De Zwart, who is Dutch by birth, also sees the collection as being in keeping with classic Flemish interior styling: &quot;It&apos;s a look that speaks volumes to me. It&apos;s a very certain aesthetic with a great emphasis on true materials.&quot; Sustainability is core to Another Country&apos;s approach. Each piece is made of carefully sourced timber and cut in a way that limits waste; the leg systems are universal, so each one fits every piece, and the products are flat packed and thus easy to transport. &quot;We&apos;ve thought of the whole cycle of the pieces,&quot; he says. &quot;We intend for our products to last and not be thrown out because of a new design trend, but if you were to chuck them on the compost heap they would biodegrade completely.&quot; Already Another Country has added a bar stool to the collection, and in December De Zwart is opening a pop-up shop on the Brompton Road, west London, along with a few other internet-based design brands. There is also a line of accessories in development \u2013 clothes racks and candle holders, as well as a range of plates and bowls. &quot;There is no plan and there is no formula,&quot; says De Zwart. &quot;It&apos;s a new business and we are just going to see where it takes us.&quot; For details, go to anothercountry.com FAYE TOOGOODCREATIVE DESIGNER     Photograph: Hege Saebjornsen for the Observer    As a child, Faye Toogood was a\u00a0habitual collector. She grew up in rural Rutland and would go out gathering stones, shells and odd bits of wood and then shut herself away in her bedroom to arrange her finds. &quot;It was kind of obsessive,&quot; she says, &quot;and it would drive my mother mad because she was always having to dust it.&quot; It&apos;s a magpie&apos;s instinct that Toogood, 33, has turned into a career. Straight out of university, where she studied fine art and art history, she applied for a styling job at World of Interiors and turned up at the interview with nothing but a suitcase full of objects that had grabbed her attention and though she had never styled a shoot in her life, she was offered the job. &quot;I was very raw,&quot; she says, &quot;but I think they just saw something about my eye.&quot; After almost a decade on World of Interiors, Toogood left in 2008 to start up her own creative consultancy, Studio Toogood, based in her own home in north London. Recent projects include fantastical window displays for Liberty, with tattooed mannequins drowning in a sea of textile prints, and the shoe department at Dover Street Market; her company also consults for lighting and furniture designer Tom Dixon. Currently she is working on designs for the Selfridges Hotel, due to open in 2012. Although Toogood refuses to be pinned down to a signature style, her work demonstrates a love of heritage and craftsmanship and is packed with historical references. Colour is also an important motif. &quot;I had a long blue period,&quot; she says, &quot;when everything, including my eye make-up, was blue.&quot; She thinks nothing of mixing her eras and letting things clash. &quot;It&apos;s OK to put something from the 18th century together with something orange, plastic and ridiculous. I&apos;m interested in things that are well made, but also in things that make me smile. Perfect good taste bores me.&quot; Toogood can now add furniture-maker to her long list of talents, as in September she launched her own collection, Assemblage 1. &quot;A lot of stuff in the design world is either really strong and male or very gimmicky,&quot; she says. &quot;I wanted to do something that was beautifully made, democratic and that would work with antiques as well as a modern interior.&quot; She shows me two of the chairs. Each has a back based on the handle of a large wooden spade and a brass strip detail running up each leg, just like the seam on the back of a stocking. &quot;That&apos;s what turns it into something a little more elegant than just a\u00a0worthy wooden stool,&quot; she says. It&apos;s a reflection of her own rural/urban crossover. &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to think of how to describe it,&quot; she says. &quot;The best I can come up with is lipstick and wellies. I&apos;m happy in wellies and high heels, but not much in between.&quot; Toogood works full pelt from 6am to 7.30pm, when she stops to have dinner with her husband, before getting back on her laptop. &quot;I can&apos;t separate my passions from my work,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s just completely integrated.&quot; Studio Toogood is bursting at the seams. In the past four months the head count has risen from three to eight, with each new staff member \u2013 all specialists in sculpture, fine art or architecture \u2013 brought in using the same bring-along-a-suitcase-of-stuff-you-like process that got Toogood her first job. The staff squeezes into her house, which is crammed with her collections of Indian alabaster crockery, African azurite, ceramics, photos, rocks and glassware. &quot;Sometimes I wonder,&quot; she says, looking around, &quot;whether I am just one of those old ladies slowly but surely filling up their house with stuff.&quot; For details, go to studiotoogood.com"}, {"sentences": ["The governor of Okinawa in effect has the power to halt the plan by withholding approval to reclaim land for the offshore base envisaged by Tokyo and Washington.", "&quot;Both candidates have run on a platform of backtracking on the original agreement, so it&apos;s now extremely difficult to go ahead with the Futenma relocation,&quot; said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo.", "Earlier this week, a US state department spokesman, Philip Crowley, said Tokyo and Washington had &quot;engaged Okinawan leaders to help them understand the importance of the US presence in Okinawa."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "US news", "US military", "US foreign policy", "China", "Russia", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T14:29:00Z", "title": "Okinawa's voters set to test Japanese-US relations", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/okinawa-election-us-base-japan", "article": "Voters in Okinawa today placed further strain on Japan&apos;s security ties with the US with the near-certain election of a governor opposed to the relocation of a US marine base on the southern Japanese island. Both of the frontrunners in the election oppose a 2006 agreement to close Futenma airbase, located in the middle of the Okinawan city of Ginowan, and move it to a less populated coastal area. Early returns showed that the current governor, Hirokazu Nakaima, would be re-elected, narrowly defeating his only serious rival, Yoichi Iha. Nakaima had originally supported the relocation to Nago, but has since voiced opposition to the move amid mounting pressure from the public. According to an exit poll by the Kyodo news agency, almost 69% of voters said the current relocation agreement was unacceptable. Residents living near the base have long complained about noise from aircraft, the ever-present risk of an air accident and crimes committed by US service personnel. Under the agreement, the base will be moved to Nago on the island&apos;s north-west coast, and 8,000 marines and their families transferred to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014, at a cost of $10bn (\u00a36.4bn). Iha, a former mayor of Ginowan, has called for the base to be moved to Guam. Polls had shown the candidates were neck-and-neck on the eve of the election, with about a fifth of voters undecided. The result will present a major foreign policy headache to the Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, whose Democratic party of Japan [DPJ] decided not to give its official backing to any of the candidates. Kan became leader in June after his predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, reneged on an election promise to move Futenma to another part of Japan. Kan had come under pressure from Washington to honour the 2006 agreement, but failed to win the support of other potential host communities. The governor of Okinawa in effect has the power to halt the plan by withholding approval to reclaim land for the offshore base envisaged by Tokyo and Washington. Analysts said heightened security fears in the wake of North Korea&apos;s attack on a South Korean island in the Yellow Sea was unlikely to dent anti-base sentiment on Okinawa, which hosts more than half the US&apos;s 50,000 troops in Japan and 75% of its bases in the country. &quot;Both candidates have run on a platform of backtracking on the original agreement, so it&apos;s now extremely difficult to go ahead with the Futenma relocation,&quot; said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. &quot;The pressure to accept the US plan will have intensified after recent events on the Korean peninsula, but that won&apos;t apply to many Okinawans.&quot; Those who support a large US military presence on Okinawa say recent territorial disputes with China and Russia underline the importance of US-Japanese security ties. Kan himself reiterated his commitment to the alliance during the recent Apec summit in Yokohama. But Nakaima said the partnership would be unworkable as long as US bases were opposed by their host communities. &quot;We want the Futenma base off the island precisely because we recognise the Japan-US alliance is important,&quot; he told voters. Iha, meanwhile, vowed that as governor he would &quot;never succumb to US pressure&quot;. The DPJ swept into office in September last year vowing to end the country&apos;s &quot;subservience&quot; to US foreign policy and improve ties with China and other Asian countries \u2013 a policy that now appears to be in tatters. After initially giving the Japanese government time to consider its stance on Futenma, the US has made it clear that the 2006 agreement is non-negotiable. Earlier this week, a US state department spokesman, Philip Crowley, said Tokyo and Washington had &quot;engaged Okinawan leaders to help them understand the importance of the US presence in Okinawa. We&apos;ve produced a shared game plan on the way forward, and we will continue to work with Japan to carry it out.&quot; Kan&apos;s approval ratings have plummeted to below 30% over his handling of the territorial rows with China over the Senkaku islands and with Russia over the Northern Territories. Whether the victor in today&apos;s election is Nakaima or Iha, the prime minister will face a tricky balancing act: that of assuring Washington he is committed to the security alliance, while being seen to respond to the wishes of Okinawa&apos;s voters. The Japanese foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, said he would visit the island soon in an attempt to win public support for the original Futenma plan. &quot;Whatever the outcome of Sunday&apos;s election, we will take the result seriously.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Big Up the Spurs from Tokyo,&quot; awoogas Stuart Hamilton."], "tags": ["Premier League", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2010-11"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T15:06:38Z", "title": "Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool - as it happened! | Gregg Roughley", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/28/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-live", "article": " Preamble Afternoon. Where to start? If Spurs win they go into fifth place. If Liverpool win they join Spurs on the same number of points (and can even go above them with a 2-0 win or more), yet one would expect there to be a greater divide between the two teams in the league given the reaction in the press to their starts to the season.  Tottenham&apos;s exploits in the Champions League have helped to keep a positive glow around White Hart Lane whereas Liverpool&apos;s Europa League performances do not have that clout. That said, it is clear that Spurs have a stronger squad than Liverpool and it will take an almighty effort to beat them without Steven Gerrard today.  Roy Hodgson will likely set Liverpool up to take a point, as is his way on the road. However, without Javier Mascherano&apos;s energy in midfield, Liverpool have struggled to be as resistant as they once were. Generally, the 4-5-1 formation has isolated Fernando Torres and encouraged the opposition to attack.  Tottenham, under Harry Redknapp, need no encouragement to go forwards. With Luka Modric pulling the strings in midfield and both Gareth Bale and Aaron Lennon providing pace and width, this could be a difficult day for Liverpool. Lucas Leiva will have to stick to Modric like glue. Prediction: Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool  It looks like Liverpool&apos;s starting line-up is going to be 4-4-2 (probably a very narrow one): Reina, Johnson, Konchesky, Carragher, Skrtel, Lucas, Meireles, Maxi, Kuyt, Ngog, Torres. So my prediction that Liverpool would perhaps be negative looks a little off the mark. Ho-hum.  The teams  Tottenham: Gomes, Hutton, Kaboul, Gallas, Assou-Ekotto, Lennon,Palacios, Modric, Bale, Van der Vaart, Crouch. Subs: Cudicini, Pavlyuchenko, Defoe, Bassong, Kranjcar, Corluka, Sandro. Liverpool: Reina, Johnson, Carragher, Skrtel, Konchesky, Kuyt,Meireles, Lucas, Maxi, Torres, Ngog. Subs: Jones, Aurelio, Jovanovic, Kyrgiakos, Babel, Poulsen, Shelvey. Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)  The good news for Spurs is that Van der Vaart starts. He had been a major doubt after a recent knock to his ankle. So he&apos;s likely to play just off Crouch. Liverpool, surprisingly, look to have the more conventional 4-4-2 formation with both David Ngog and Fernando Torres starting in attack.  3.47pm: Thanks to Fraggle Wump for letting me know that the tape on Bale&apos;s legs is called Kinesio tape. Apparently, &quot;unlike regular athletic taping, using kinesio tape allows freedom of motion without restricting muscles or blood flow. By allowing the muscles a larger degree of movement, the body is able to heal itself more quickly and fully than before.&quot; So it&apos;s the new version of cycling shorts.  3.50pm: Wilson Beuys reckons Liverpool are better off without Steven Gerrard. &quot;I&apos;d have said that without his position-less wandering around the pitch, Liverpool tend to keep the shape Hodgson wants rather better \u2013 and that they might play better as a result. Although as a Spurs fan, I&apos;m hoping your prediction is nearer the mark.&quot; I know many Liverpool fans who echo your view Wilson. Personally, I&apos;ve always thought he was more influential on the right cutting in, but to say Liverpool are better without him on the pitch full-stop is ludicrous.  3.54pm: &quot;One out and out striker is not necessarily negative,&quot; writes Niall Mullen. &quot;The isolation of Torres is to do with a defensive philosophy and a lack of any sort of passing player. Hodgson is so far out of his depth I can&apos;t even see his bouffant sticking out of the water.&quot;  3.57pm: The teams make their way out of the tunnel. Carragher leads Liverpool out while Spurs are capatained by Gallas. If Hodgson takes Liverpool to sixth this season how will this be judged by Liverpool fans? I&apos;d have thought his remit was to do better than Rafa Ben\u00edtez under difficult circumstances. It really could go disasterously wrong if they suffer a few more defeats but a win today could kickstart a serious push for the top four too.  &quot;Big Up the Spurs from Tokyo,&quot; awoogas Stuart Hamilton. &quot;I have spent a lot of today reading the ashes OBO about how people employed coffee and booze to stay up and watch the cricket, now I find myself with a bottle of sake in front of the TV in my hotel room with Japanese commentary waiting for a 1am kick-off. The things we do for love eh?&quot; I take it the cockerel is your only friend in bed, Stuart?  Peep! It looks bitterly cold at White Hart Lane as Martin Atkinson gets the game underway. Liverpool are kicking from left to right if you would like to frame a picture of that in your minds.  1 min: It&apos;s all tame stuff to begin with. Spurs keep possession at the back with Kaboul and Gallas knocking a few passes to one another but going nowhere in any hurry.  2 min: In fact, so relaxed is Gallas that he gets too close to Gomes and plays a dodgy backpass which the Spurs No1 scuffs clear uncomfortably.  3 min: Lennon leaves Lucas and Meireles for dead with a turbo-charged run through the middle of the pitch, but treads on the ball as he enters the Liverpool area and gets a moody look from Van Der Vaart for his trouble. He was free to Lennon&apos;s left.  4 min: Another jet-heeled dash from Lennon leaves Konchesky yards behind him. It&apos;s a decent cross on this occasion to Modric, but the Spurs midfielder hits his attempted volley into the ground and Reina catches comfortably.  6 min: Spurs have started the match as the dominant force, as you&apos;d expect from the home team, but a Liverpool break gives Tottenham food for thought, with Rodriguez flicking the ball through to Torres, who is clear on goal but a yard offside. My hands are freezing! Guardian Towers is icy this afternoon.  8 min: Liverpool mount another attack. Kuyt holds off his marker and finds Rodriguez 12 yards from goal. He toe-pokes a shot towards the top corner but it sails a yard wide. Van Der Vaart looks to have injured himself stretching for the ball.  9 min: Van Der Vaart is substituted. He looks to have tweaked his hamstring. On in his place comes Jermain Defoe. That substitution depicts perfectly the strength of Spurs&apos; squad these days. Meanwhile, Kuyt finds space on the right but plays a dreadful pass into the box, yards behind Torres and Ngog.  11 min: Palacios goes one better than Kuyt and fails to find Lennon on the right with the simplest of passes. Tottenham fans then sarcastically cheer his next completed pass. Bit harsh? Liverpool win a corner on the right.  13 min: Meireles fails to beat the first man (which should be sackable) and Spurs clear with ease.  15 min: &quot;Why are the Liverpool fans so down on Roy Hodgson?&quot; asks Ian Markey. &quot;He has been left with a truck load of debt and a shed load of players not up to standard by Ben\u00edtez, who even at Inter continues to blame his lack of success on the paucity of the squad he has inherited. Despite them being treble champions last season under a manager who COULD manage!&quot; I couldn&apos;t begin to answer that question while trying to explain what&apos;s going on in this match, Ian. But perhaps some readers would like to help out. Although I could be inviting essays, not pithy emails, so perhaps scrap that.  17 min: Rodriguez is causing Spurs problems as he cuts in from the left. Again, Ngog and Torres combine well on the edge of the area and Rodriguez (who I&apos;m going to call Maxi from hereonin to save my fingers) goes unchecked as he drifts in from the left and strikes powerfully towards the bottom right-hand corner, forcing a fine save from Gomes.  19 min: Yup, it&apos;s hamstring twang that has done for Van Der Vaart. Meanwhile, Spurs have won a free-kick 30 yards from goal. Kaboul, Bale and Modric stand over it ...  20 min: Modric flicks the ball off to Kaboul, but Meireles races out to him and forces a wild swipe which goes five or six yards over to the right of goal.  21 min: &quot;When Rafa had a bad signing (and there are many to choose from) he didn&apos;t stick with them,&quot; offers Nial Mullen. &quot;Josemi, Kronkamp, Dossena, Degen were out on their ears quickly. Hodgson looks like he&apos;ll stick with Konchesky forever.&quot; To be fair, he hasn&apos;t got a reserve who is fit and he can&apos;t buy anyone till January, so he hasn&apos;t got a choice Niall. This is an intriguing match. Liverpool look dangerous when they go forwards. Their passing is sharper and less intricate than Spurs&apos;. Lucas has a bash from 30 yards on a rare forray forwards and forces Gomes into a decent save.  24 min: Palacios wastes possession again in midfield for Spurs. That&apos;ll get him another sarcastic cheer next time he pasess the ball successfully.  26 min: Alan Hutton should be booked for a pathetic dive in the Liverpool box. Martin Atkinson waves away the Spurs appeal for a penalty when he should have been waving a yellow card in Hutton&apos;s face. Prior to that Carragher ran into Crouch&apos;s hip as a corner was played in from the left, spinning the big man around in the air and giving him no chance to get his head on the ball. That incident was worth a penalty shout for sure. Very clumsy from Carragher? Or perhaps he practised it at Melwood when Crouch wore red?  28 min: Meireles looks much more mobile for Liverpool now than he did when he first arrived. He is a much more influential player in the centre than the right. Meanwhile, Konchesky is booked after sliding in on a rampaging Gareth Bale and missing by inches. He should have edged his bets and stayed out of it. Bale was flying. He&apos;s going to take the free-kick from 25 yards ...  30 min: Bale drives the free-kick straight into the Liverpool wall. &quot;Bale&apos;s inner thighs look like they have been franked by the post office,&quot; offers Ian Copestake. &quot;Perhaps it is in case he telegraphs any of his passes.&quot; Send your laughs to me and I&apos;ll post them on to Ian. I imagine I won&apos;t have much work to do ...  32 min: Jamie Carragher makes a fantastic block with the goal gaping for Jermain Defoe. Reina could only parry a low cross from Lennon, the ball lands at Defoe&apos;s feet and he drives low at goal but finds Carragher&apos;s right boot outstretched to clear the danger.  33 min: Liverpool are playing well on the counter-attack. Kuyt and Meireles combine well and the Dutchman plays a quick pass out to the right where Torres is free. He runs at Kaboul and tries to feint left and right before hitting a frustrated effort straight into Kaboul&apos;s right knee. Kaboul ges down injured, which is odd ...  35 min: Torres must have thumped that with some vigour. Kaboul is replaced by Bassong.  37 min: It&apos;s been a very close match so far. I couldn&apos;t call which way it might go. Liverpool look fresh and very well organised. Hutton finds space on the right after a neat one-two with Lennon, but his cross is aimed too close to Reina and the Spanaird catches it comfortably.  38 min: &quot;No sooner do I finish singing &apos;Arry&apos;s praises for his superior tactical acumen to Ars\u00e8ne&apos;s, than he goes and repeats Ars\u00e8ne&apos;s mistake precisely, risking a not fully fit Van Der Vaart and losing him to a hamstring, and thus making a hash of my subbing him for F\u00e1bregas as captain of my fantasy team. Drat!&quot; That moan comes courtesy of Richard T. W. Arthur, who sounds like an explorer to me.  39 min: Meireles almost catches Gomes off guard with a thumping right-footed effort from all of 25 yards. Gomes gets down ever so slowly and just manages to divert it wide by a foot. Gomes didn&apos;t look too sure on that occasion.  40 min: Predictably, The Liverpool corner comes to nought (do corners matter anymore? Throw-ins are more in vogues these days aren&apos;t they?). Spurs break and get a free-kick ...  Goal! Spurs 0-1 Liverpool (Sktel 42 min) Bale whacks his free-kick wide and Liverpool win a free-kick of their own 40 yards from goal. Meireles curls a delicious ball into the box, where Skrtel rises high and heads the ball off Ngog&apos;s back. The ball drops straight to Skrtel&apos;s feet and he pokes the ball into the right-hand corner. It was a scruffy goal ...  44 min: A second look at the goal makes me think that perhaps the Spurs defenders could have been quicker to react, but it&apos;s difficult to be too critical. Carragher was booked earlier for the tackle on Modric that led to Bale&apos;s free-kick attempt. Just thought I&apos;d tidy-up that detail ...  45 min: Torres finds Maxi with a wonderful scoop inside. The Argentinian should score, but chooses to drag the ball on to his left foot and then falls over his own feet like an egg on legs.  45+2 min: What a finish to the half. Bale skins Johnson \u2013 who is so slow to react \u2013 and drives a vicious cross in towards Crouch, but Skrtel and Carragher, crowd out the big striker and clear the ball to Meireles. He controls and sets Torres away on goal. He rushes in to the box on his right foot and shapes to shoot on his left only to be denied a strike by a wonderful slide and tackle by Bassong. Needless to say, the corner comes to nothing and the half ends.  Half-time emails This missive comes from Stuart Hamilton, who is in bed in Japan: &quot;Sadly, the nights I have spent with the cockerel have rarely gone to plan, often involving inflated expectations, early penetration but no staying power, some incredibly dextrous moments of skill but also some gutting heartbreak. I am hoping that the Japanese setting might make this a good one (VDV off. Wincing).&quot; We&apos;ve all been there, Stuart. Just relax, perhaps the cockerel will do you proud in the second half. Regan Fitzgerald writes: &quot;Gregg, there might not be a reserve to take Konchesky&apos;s place, but I believe Fabio Aurelio is sitting on the bench, ready and able (for today) to play left back. Given Konchesky&apos;s play today (and this season), there doesn&apos;t seem to be an excuse for Hodgson not making the change.&quot; I&apos;d argue that Aurelio needs a couple more weeks to get fully fit, Regan. He only came back two weeks ago. &quot;Are Tottenham becoming Arsenal?&quot; asks Ian Copestake, who presumably is going to answer his own question right after my next word. &quot;Not only are they prone to intricate passing without (Bale aside) much of an end product, but their players are as frail as a party of pensioners who find themselves on a day out but have forgotten to bring an extra layer.&quot; There&apos;s something in that Ian, particularly given that Palacios has scuffed the ball around the park like I&apos;d expect my 87-year-old grandad too today. If he isn&apos;t replaced by Huddlestone at half-time I&apos;ll spit my horrific cup of machine tea all over my keyboard. &quot;That Maxi miss was Liverpool in a moment,&quot; harrumphs Niall Mullen. &quot;Dazzling leading man, pedestrian support cast. Like George Clooney in Coronation Street.&quot; That&apos;s a wonderful image, Niall. I&apos;d give my right ear to see George Clooney in Corrie!  45 min: We&apos;re back. And Bassong starts the second half as he ended the first by chasing down Torres and making a wonderful tackle as the Spanish striker shaped to shoot inside the box just to the right of goal.  47 min: MBMer holds his hands up: &quot;You might want to get ready to mop that horrific cup of machine tea off your keyboard,&quot; chides Adrian Cooper. &quot;Palacious can&apos;t be replaced by Hudd, what with him being out for a couple of months injured. We&apos;re really going to miss him. After Van Der Vaart and Bale he&apos;s our most influential player.&quot; It takes a big man to admit that he had a brain freeze at half time.  49 min: Spurs win a corner on the right after a controlled attack. Bale swings it into the back post where Crouch hangs in the air and drops a header back into the six-yard box. Defoe tries to swivel and shoot on goal but he doesn&apos;t connect and Reina gathers the ball to his chest.  51 min: Header off the line! Defoe jinks his way up the right hand side and finds Lennon outside him. He swings a cross in deep towards Crouch. Reina comes off his line and only manages to paw the ball out to Bale, who hits a terrific shot that looks all the way a goal, but Meireles&apos;s bald skull rattles as it takes the hit and Liverpool escape.  54 min: Crouch gives away possession in Spurs&apos; half, Maxi nicking the ball away to Meireles, who releases Ngog on the right. He barges past Bassong, but the Spurs defender does very well again to get a tackle in and concede a corner ... which is played in too deep. Surprised? No, didn&apos;t think so.  56 min: This match is not at all as I expected it to be. Everything is being done at 100mph. There&apos;s a terrific end-to-end feel to it.  58 min: Free-kick to Spurs 25 yards out in Gareth Bale country ...  58 min: Penalty! David Ngog blocks the free-kick with two arms in front of his face. That was cowardly by Ngog. Meireles is booked in the resulting mel\u00e9e ...  58 min: Defoe to take it ...  59 min: Missed! Defoe thumps it half-a-yard wide to the left of the goal. He tightened up as he hit that.  60 min: How many penalties have Spurs missed this season? Is it four?  61 min: &quot;Are there any pubs actually like the Rovers Return in the UK?&quot; asks Ian Copestake. &quot;Are they not all kitted out with Sky surround sound and all day menus?&quot; I don&apos;t know of any, Ian. They&apos;re all pretentious gastros round by mine. Readers? Kuyt takes a tumble in the Spurs box after a robust tackle by Gallas. It&apos;s a good block. The ball spills to Lucas and both he and Maxi tackle each other. Somehow Liverpool win a corner. Maxi takes it deep to the edge of the area where Kaboul clears.  Goal! Spurs 1-1 Liverpool (Skrtel og 65 min): Modric finds a shocking burst of pace (I didn&apos;t think he had it in him) to cut in from the left and drive to the line. He looks up and plays the ball into the corridor-of-uncertainty where Crouch waits to tap the ball in, only for Skrtel to slide in to block the ball and divert it into the goal. He couldn&apos;t really help it, mind. Crouch was a cert to score as Reina didn&apos;t look like he&apos;d get to it.  67 min: This is a great match. Still can&apos;t predict which way it will go.  69 min: Bassong nudges Torres in the back on the left-hand side of the 18-yard box. Free-kick. Is there a pub like the Rovers return? I ask. &quot;In Salford near my house,&quot; writes DD.  70 min: This is manic. Can everyone take a deep breath? Kuyt is felled in the box as he touches the ball away from Assou-Ekotto. At first glance it looks like a penalty but a second glance it looks like both of the players fouled each other. Impossible for Atkinson to call. Spurs then break and Defoe thumps a shot at goal from the edge of the box, which two-goal Skrtel blocks.  72 min: Spurs are the new England, reckons Ian Markey. What, with all the penalty misses and the like. Ngog takes a knock and allows my fingers a break.  73 min: Aurelio has come on for Ngog. Kuyt goes up alongside Torres, and Maxi goes over to the right. So still a 4-4-2.  75 min: Liverpool knock a few passes around neatly in midfield and try to take the pace out of the game. Meireles wastes all the good build-up play with a rushed cross into the box which he overhits.  76 min: Andy Gray reckons &quot;15 minutes is a long time in this league?&quot; Is he Doctor Who?  77 min: Aurelio&apos;s first touch is a hoofed clearance under no pressure. By and large today the standard of football served up by both sides has been impressive. There&apos;ve been some very neat passing combinations (Palacios excluded).  79 min: If this was a game of chess both managers would be glaring at each other over the board and refusing to move.  80 min: Liverpool finally make a move forwards, which Meireles starts with a fantastically instinctive pass, and ends with a poorly executed flick towards Maxi in the box. It was nice interplay inbetween.  81 min: Reina flaps at a deep cross from Lennon. The ball drops to Crouch, who hits a first-time volley straight at Reina. He is in no-man&apos;s-land but does well to save.  82 min: &quot;Sorry to say this, but you&apos;re wrong Gregg,&quot; says Peter J\u00f8rgensen. &quot;Modric didn&apos;t find a shocking burst of pace. He was just up against Carragher, the slowest Liverpool legend bar Molby.&quot; Did you ever see Sean Dundee? He&apos;d give them a slow run for their money. Oh, you said legend ...  83 min: Meireles hits a fizzing left-foot shot from 25 yards which misses by inches to Gomes&apos;s left post. The Spurs goalkeeper wouldn&apos;t have got there. That was a fantastic strike. He&apos;s impressed in central midfield for Liverpool.  85 min: Carragher has somehow knacked his left arm in a challenge with Peter Crouch. He&apos;s mouthing a million F-Words at Kyrgiakos, who is slow to get changed and just manages to get on to the pitch before Carragher is booked.  87 min: &quot;The whole of Salford is looking forward to Rovers&apos; return, innit?&quot; giggles Steve Gurr. He&apos;s here all week etc and so on.  88 min: Glen Johnson flies into a tackle with Gareth Bale and sends him tumbling through the air. It&apos;s a dangerous tackle and Johnson is correctly booked.  89 min: The whole of White Hart Lane (and one of the layout guys in Guardian Towers) thinks Defoe has won it. But he is correctly flagged offside, by a yard, as he drives a Crouch flick-on into the roof of the net.  90 min: Maxi drives a yard wide after a robust challenge on Torres by Gomes results in a Liverpool penalty appeal. It wasn&apos;t a penalty in my opinion.  Goal! Spurs 2-1 Liverpool (Lennon 90+2min): This time White Hart Lane celebrates a legitimate goal. A crossfield pass by Bale lands at Lennon&apos;s feet. Konchesky is three yards off him and doesn&apos;t even attempt to react as he bursts inside and finishes smartly to Reina&apos;s left.  90+3 min: How Liverpool will regret those missed chances either side of half-time. Spurs weathered the storm, however, and have been rewarded for persevering.  90+4 min: Johnson slips and then tries to rugby tackle Lennon who races on to the free ball. He makes another jet-heeled run into the box, torments Konchesky to the left and right and then beats him again, before dragging his shot wide. Modric was inside him. He should have passed. Not that it matters. Spurs have won this.  Full-time: &quot;Why are we (Liverpool fans) so down on Hodgson. Two words,&quot; writes Niall Mullen. &quot;Paul bloody Konchesky.&quot; That&apos;s three words Niall. &quot;Why are you filtering the justifiably negative comments against Hodgson?&quot; asks Navin Seeterram. Are you sat behind me Navin? How could you possibly know whether I am or not? &quot;What irks Liverpool fans is the positive spin on Hodgson&apos;s mediocrity. An improved performance? Even Hodgson goes on about it being a results business. He looks defeated before the final whistle. Liverpool managers fight until the end. Koncheskey who barely reacts when Lennon goes through, later petulantly concedes a foul when we need to regain possession. Even Konchesky has given up. It seems only Hodgson and Konchesky are on the same page.&quot;  Full-time thoughts: Well, that was a fantastic match. End to end stuff throughout, sprinkled with some crisp passing moves and dramatic goalmouth action. Liverpool can feel aggrieved to come away with nothing. They played as well as they have all season (and I know they&apos;ve hardly hit the heights, but still ...) and will regret missing crucial chances around half-time. As for Tottenham, they proved that having players who suit key positions (ie. pacey wingers) and strikers with attributes that compliment each other (Crouch = height, Defoe = pace) really does make a difference at this level. One thing I can say for sure is that Paul Konchesky will be ignored all the way home on the Liverpool bus after allowing Lennon such an easy run through on goal. Thanks for your emails.

Delegates from 48 nations spent 11 days in Paris haggling over fishing quotas for the Atlantic and Mediterranean, poring over scientific data and pitting the demands of environmentalists against those of the fishing industry. Conservation groups said delegates took steps in the right direction with moves to protect oceanic whitetip sharks and many hammerheads in the Atlantic, though they had hoped for more. Sharks were once an accidental catch for fishermen but have been increasingly targeted because of the growing market in Asia for their fins, an expensive delicacy used in soup. WWF, Greenpeace, Oceana and the Pew Environment Group all strongly criticised the 2011 bluefin quotas set by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, or ICCAT, which manages tuna in the Atlantic and Mediterranean as well as species that have traditionally been accidental catches for tuna fishermen. Environmental groups had hoped to see bluefin fishing slashed or suspended, saying illegal fishing is rampant in the Mediterranean and that scientists don&apos;t have good enough data to evaluate the problem. The commission agreed to cut the bluefin fishing quota in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean from 13,500 to 12,900 metric tonnes annually about a 4% reduction. It also agreed on measures to try to improve enforcement of quotas on bluefin, prized for its tender red meat. Sergi Tudela, head of WWF Mediterranean&apos;s fisheries program, attacked the &quot;measly quota reduction.&quot; Oliver Knowles, Greenpeace oceans campaigner, complained that &quot;the word &apos;conservation&apos; should be removed from ICCAT&apos;s name.&quot; Russell F Smith, representing the US delegation, said: &quot;I think we made some progress. I wish we&apos;d made more.&quot; Meanwhile, the CNPMEM French fishing industry union praised the decision, saying &quot;reason prevailed.&quot; The international commission&apos;s committee of scientists had said keeping the status quo was acceptable, but environmentalists say there is so much unreported fishing that doing so is irresponsible. Japan buys nearly 80% of the annual Atlantic bluefin catch. Top-grade sushi with fatty bluefin can go for as much as 2,000 yen ($24) a piece in high-end Tokyo restaurants. While the focus of the Paris meeting was tuna, sharks have become a growing concern. Environmentalists say there are disastrously inadequate rules on shark capture. Although there are elaborate international fishing regulations and quotas for other types of fish, sharks have long been an afterthought, even though some species have declined by 99%, Oceana said. The international commission banned fishermen from catching and retaining oceanic whitetip sharks. It voted to limit the catch of several types of hammerhead sharks and to require countries to keep data on shortfin mako sharks. Delegates also decided that Atlantic fishermen will now be required to carry special gear to remove hooks from sea turtles. While the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and other regional commissions regulate fishing, trade bans are handled by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES. Environmentalists were sorely disappointed by a meeting of that body in March, where Atlantic bluefin and six species of sharks failed to get protection."}, {"sentences": ["Metal Gear Solid bag      Tokyo Toys, \u00a334.99This officially licensed heavy-duty messenger bag will ensure your favourite Metal Gear Solid fanatic has something nice to carry their stuff around in."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "Christmas"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-29T13:29:58Z", "title": "Top 10 Christmas gifts for gamers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/26/top-10-christmas-gifts-for-gamers", "article": "With two-thirds of the UK population now playing video games on a regular basis, the chances are you&apos;ll have a gamer to buy for this Christmas.

Wells for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 1. (C) Summary. Amidst escalating threats from Pyongyang in response to UN Security Council actions against its April 5 missile launch, Russian Ambassador-at-Large for Six-Party Talks Grigoriy Logvinov during an April 28 meeting urged the U.S. and the other Six-Party partners to remain patient. Reporting that Foreign Minister Lavrov had a difficult trip to North Korea that did not reveal any flexibility in DPRK&apos;s position, he assessed that Pyongyang was hunkering down for a succession crisis, while seeking to use Yongbyon&apos;s disablement reversal as a bargaining chip for further concessions in the Six-Party talks. Lamenting that no one had good ideas on how to pull North Korea back from its brinkmanship, Logvinov asked for additional consultations with the U.S., particularly on the time it would take for Pyongyang to reassemble its plutonium reprocessing capabilities. In Logvinov&apos;s view, the Six-Party partners should use the intervening time to engage in quiet diplomacy to persuade North Korea to return to the negotiating table, though it is possible that we may have to wait until the succession crisis has passed before seeing a softening of North Korea&apos;s position. End Summary. A Rough Trip ------------ 2. (C) In an April 28 meeting, Ambassador-at-Large Grigoriy Logvinov characterized Foreign Minister Lavrov&apos;s April 23-24 trip to Pyongyang as &quot;rough.&quot; Logvinov conveyed that the North Korean leadership was &quot;very angry&quot; and told Lavrov categorically that it was resolved to restart its nuclear program, would never participate in the Six-Party Talks again, and would not trust anything but nuclear deterrence as its security guarantee. In contrast to his 2004 trip, Lavrov did not get a meeting with Kim Jong-Il. Logvinov speculated that the reason could be due to either Kim&apos;s poor health or North Korean displeasure at the GOR&apos;s support for the UNSC Presidential Statement and sanctions. 3. (C) Indicating that FM Lavrov would be sending personal letters to his Six-Party counterparts regarding his trip, Logvinov urged the U.S. to show patience and not overreact to the latest developments. In his view, Pyongyang&apos;s hard line position was either a negotiating tactic or an indication that a power transition was near, but in any case did not represent the final word on the denuclearization issue. Referring directly to Japan, Logvinov warned that if countries were to press for additional UNSC action, it would only provoke the DPRK into further brinkmanship and prove counterproductive. Wait Out the Succession Crisis ------------------------------ 4. (C) Elaborating on his assessment that a power transition was near, Logvinov hypothesized that Pyongyang was being particularly intransigent because it wanted to demonstrate strength to the outside world and mask the power struggle occurring internally. Recalling the political instability around the time of Stalin and Mao&apos;s deaths, he indicated Moscow understood the possible fallout of a North Korean succession scenario because &quot;we have seen this before.&quot; While noting that Kim Jong-Il appeared to be functioning, if impaired, Logvinov speculated that as long as the &quot;Dear Leader&quot; was technically alive, he could remain the face of a charismatic leadership. Others, whether it&apos;s his son or brother-in-law, could wield the power behind the scenes. Should Kim die, however, these people would have to emerge from the shadows and establish their own authority to rule, in which case the situation could become quite unstable. According to Logvinov, the GOR did not have a clear picture of the role the North Korean military would play in a succession crisis, nor did it know what importance to attach to the increased prominence of the military in the official press. Logvinov mused that a collective leadership arrangement might be a more stable option during a North Korean succession scenario. 5. (C) In Logvinov&apos;s personal view, nothing was likely to induce North Korea to abandon its current course and return to the negotiating table until the succession crisis passed. The only thing the Six-Party partners could do in the meantime, he stressed, was to wait out the power transition MOSCOW 00001108 002 OF 003 while preventing Pyongyang from further wrongdoing. The previous goals of completing a verification protocol and finishing Phase II as soon as possible were unachievable for the time being. Or Wait Until DPRK Restarts Yongbyon ------------------------------------ 6. (C) Logvinov did not rule out the possibility that North Korea, in an attempt to &quot;sell&quot; its nuclear capabilities a third time, would seek negotiations once it reversed the disablement of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities. The GOR hoped that Pyongyang&apos;s stated intention to restart plutonium reprocessing was a negotiating ploy, rather than a real determination to reopen its nuclear program. In Logvinov&apos;s view, the DPRK&apos;s dire economic situation was affecting the military programs despite the disproportionate share of resources poured into them. Derisively calling the missile the North Koreans tested &quot;a piece of junk that miraculously flew,&quot; he wondered if Pyongyang truly had the capability to restart reprocessing plutonium given Yongbyon&apos;s dilapidated condition. Recalling the estimate by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it would take the North Koreans three to six months to reverse fully Yongbyon&apos;s disablement, Logvinov asked for consultations with U.S. experts on a more definitive assessment of time frame, stating that the Six-Party partners should use the intervening period to engage in quiet diplomacy to pull Pyongyang back from brinkmanship. 7. (C) Should the North Koreans decide to seek negotiations after reversing disablement, Logvinov saw several complications ahead. First, Pyongyang would likely demand a higher price for resuming the Six-Party Talks, which in his view could include a light water reactor and the exclusion of Japan from the talks as punishment for Tokyo&apos;s high profile role in pressing for UNSC action. Even the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the dissolution of the U.S. alliances in Northeast Asia could be among the DPRK conditions. Second, the Six Party partners should not agree to be blackmailed that way, especially with regard to paying again for Yongbyon&apos;s disablement, and would need to secure DPRK agreement to restart from where the process had left off. Third, Pyongyang&apos;s disablement reversal would be a clear violation of UNSCR 1718. Whether the Security Council should take action would be an awkward question, as doing so could provide North Korea into further belligerent action. And lastly, North Korea&apos;s blatant disregard of the principles of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) posed challenges to efforts to strengthen the global nonproliferation regime as the international community prepared for next year&apos;s NPT review conference. No One Knows What to Do ----------------------- 8. (C) In Logvinov&apos;s view, none of the Six-Party partners currently had good ideas on ways forward. He shared that during Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi&apos;s just concluded April 26-27 visit to Moscow, the Russian and Chinese sides discussed North Korea in general without putting forward specific proposals. Lavrov and Yang reaffirmed their common positions on the need for patience and restraint, and agreed that the Six-Party Talks must continue. Similarly, the MFA had prepared briefing material on North Korea for Prime Minister Putin&apos;s May 11 trip to Japan, but it too &quot;contained nothing special.&quot; One prerequisite for jump starting the negotiations again, in Logvinov&apos;s view, was the Six-Party readiness to fulfill immediately the Phase II economic assistance obligations. 9. (C) Logvinov stressed the importance the MFA placed on consultations with the U.S. on North Korea, and in this regard expressed appreciation for Ambassador Sung Kim&apos;s phone call last week that helped him to provide FM Lavrov a fuller brief for his Pyongyang trip. While welcoming a possible visit by Special Envoy Bosworth to Moscow in the next week, he asked that the U.S. come prepared with proposals or views on the next steps. &quot;We shared our views in Seoul. Now we are ready to hear from our American friends,&quot; he stated, referring to the March 7 initial meeting between Ambassador Bosworth and Deputy Foreign Minister Borodavkin in South Korea. He also expressed the view that should the Six-Party partners succeed in persuading North Korea to return to the talks, the U.S. should not continue to insist on completing a MOSCOW 00001108 003 OF 003 verification protocol as it would be untimely given the changed circumstances.

(C) Summary: As a presidential candidate, Lee Myoung-bak called for a &quot;creative reconstruction&quot; of Korea&apos;s foreign policy. In his February 2008 inaugural address, Lee criticized his two predecessors, saying, &quot;At times over the last ten years, we found ourselves faltering and confused.&quot; He vowed to trade ideology for pragmatism as Korea&apos;s surest means of improving ties with its neighbors, and he&apos;s had some successes, especially with China and Russia, where Lee was able to expand substantially economic and political ties. Lee&apos;s efforts on Japan and North Korea are more mixed. With Japan, the South Korean public was not quite ready to accept fully Lee&apos;s attempts to compartmentalize history issues. Still, much progress was made in Seoul-Tokyo consultations on a variety of issues ranging from North Korea to economic to even security issues. On North Korea, Lee&apos;s conservative agenda was predictably rebuffed by Pyongyang. However, all signs are that President Lee is quite comfortable in sticking to denuclearization and reciprocity as the basis of his North Korea policy, especially as it enjoys considerable support. End Summary. ---- DPRK ---- 2. (C) In a February 2007 speech that has widely come to be known as the &quot;MB Doctrine,&quot; presidential candidate Lee Myung-bank firmed up his vision of his administration&apos;s North Korea Policy. Lee said his first priority would be to abolish what he described as his predecessors&apos; &quot;unprincipled and unilateral policy of appeasement&quot; toward the DPRK and replace it with a policy that offered generous assistance in exchange for North Korea&apos;s complete nuclear dismantlement and Pyongyang&apos;s accommodation of South Korea&apos;s desire for family reunion, accounting of welfare and whereabouts of POWs from the Korean War and several hundred abductees after the war. Immediately upon taking office, the Lee Administration also made it clear that it would review all commitments from the two South-North summits -- June 2000 and October 2007. Senior Lee Administration officials complained publicly that the October 2007 summit between Kim Jong-il and President Roh Moo-hyun was arranged by Roh to favor the progressive candidate in the presidential election two months later and that therefore President Lee was not bound to fulfill promises amounting to billions of dollars of aid to the North. 3. (C) The response from Pyongyang was predictably swift and severe. Using threatening language not heard since the Kim Young-sam days, North Korea has moved step by step to cut off inter-Korean relations. Initially, all inter-Korean meetings were cancelled, with the North loudly proclaiming that food aid from the South was neither needed nor wanted. Thereafter, Pyongyang implemented a draconian restriction in December of North-South cross-border traffic, stopping Kaesong tourism and severely limiting traffic to the Kaesong Industrial Complex. As the Kumgang tourism had been stopped by the South over the July shooting death of a Southern tourist, the net result has been a crippling blow to the KIC and Kumgang tourism, the two proudest results of the Sunshine policy. 4. (C) With both sides dug in, the outlook for any quick improvement in inter-Korean relations is slim to none. Much more likely is the continued &quot;psychological war,&quot; as characterized by Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan in his recent meeting with the Ambassador. President Lee is determined not to give in to North Korean pressure. Our Blue House contacts have told us on several occasions that President Lee remained quite comfortable with his North Korea policy and that he is prepared leave the inter-Korean relations frozen until the end of his term in office, if necessary. It is also our assessment that Lee&apos;s more conservative advisors and supporters see the current standoff as a genuine opportunity to push and further weaken the North, even if this might involve considerable brinkmanship. Also favoring the Lee Administration&apos;s stance is the the Korean public, which is calm to the point of apathy about the inter-Korean situation. ----- Japan ----- 5. (C) President Lee has made concerted efforts to improve relations with Tokyo, which were significantly strained during the Roh Moo-hyun era over history and territory issues. Lee sought to compartmentalize what he called &quot;disputes over the past&quot;, stating in an early policy address that &quot;South Korea and Japan should...try to foster a future-oriented relationship with a pragmatic attitude. Historical truth must not be ignored, but we can no longer afford to give up our future relations due to disputes over the past.&quot; Lee&apos;s vision was to look beyond the history-bound bilateral issues and create a Korea-Japan partnership active in the regional and global arena on issues like the denuclearization of the DPRK, strengthening of multilateral relationships, trade and economics, and cooperation on projects like alternative energy, communicable diseases, and poverty alleviation. 6. (C) So far, Lee&apos;s efforts have yielded some success, although Blue House officials would argue that results would have been far better had Tokyo shown more courage, especially in dealing with the Takeshima/Dokdo issue. For example, Lee pressed ahead with his plan to engage Japan on a more strategic regional and global level. Lee made the decision that Korea would participate in the October U.S.-Japan-Korea Trilateral Policy Planning talks (Ref A) in Tokyo. He then agreed to the U.S.-Japan-Korea Defense Trilateral Talks (Ref B) in Washington in November, the first trilateral defense talks in six years. Lee also initiated the first ever stand-alone China-Japan-Korea Trilateral Summit (Ref C) in Fukuoka in December. Critics will of course point out that there were no substantive results from these meetings, but the fact that the meetings were held at all is a significant result. ----- China ----- 7. (C) President Lee has openly courted the Chinese, and he has chalked up some noteworthy successes. Less than one year into his term, Lee has already met with PRC President Hu Jintao three times, quite unprecedented in the history of ROK-PRC relations (Ref D); typically, in the past, the ROK could expect only one visit in a PRC president&apos;s ten-year term. Lee paid his first state visit to Beijing in May 2008 and met Hu again in August when Lee traveled to Beijing for the Olympics. Hu paid a state visit to Seoul August 25-26. President Lee made the relations seem a two-way desire. A Chinese Embassy contact told us that Beijing had been concerned that China-Korea relations would suffer because of the emphasis Lee wanted to put on improving U.S.-Korea relations. Therefore, China was pleasantly surprised that Lee was able to improve both bilateral relationships simultaneously. Kim Heung-kyu, Professor of Chinese Security and Foreign Policy at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, said Lee had effectively leveraged the U.S.-Korea relationship to improve relations with China, which is eager for closer ties with Korea to check U.S. and Japanese interests in the region. 8. (C) During Lee&apos;s first visit to Beijing, he and Hu issued a joint statement which upgraded the Korea-China relationship to a &quot;strategic cooperative partnership&quot;. Our Chinese Embassy contact gave the clearest explanation of what was now &quot;strategic&quot; about the ROK-PRC relationship: that China&apos;s nomenclature to describe its relations with Korea was upgraded according to a roughly five-year schedule. In 1992, relations were normalized; in 1998, the first year of Kim Dae-jung&apos;s term as President, the Chinese upgraded the relationship to &quot;cooperative partnership&quot;; in 2002, it was upgraded again to &quot;comprehensive cooperative partnership,&quot; and now it is &quot;strategic cooperative partnership.&quot; 9. (C) Despite the name, Koreans have found substantive strategic discussions with the Chinese frustratingly difficult. For example, Lee, unlike his immediate predecessors, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, added North Korean human rights to the Korea-China summit agenda in August, asking Hu not to repatriate North Korean refugees against their will. Hu did not respond to Lee&apos;s request (Ref E). Also, we understand, Lee asked Hu what China thought about the North Korean domestic political situation and whether Beijing had any contingency plans. This time, Hu apparently pretended not to hear Lee. Still, the ROK did not come away empty, because, despite initial Chinese objections, Lee was successful in including in the summit joint statement a commitment &quot;to promote dialogue and cooperation in the field of international human rights.&quot; ------ Russia ------ 10. (C) Lee has largely continued the trend of his predecessors in upgrading economic ties with Russia. ROK-Russia economic ties have grown more than 40% annually for the past three years, with two-way trade exceeding USD 15 billion in 2007. Much of the growth is due to Russia&apos;s natural resources. For example, Lee paid a state visit to Moscow in September and agreed to a contract for Russia to supply Korea with 7.5 million tons of natural gas annually for thirty years beginning from 2015, amounting to an estimated 20% of Korea&apos;s annual natural gas consumption. And despite doubts about North Korea&apos;s cooperation, Lee agreed in principle to Russia exploring plans for a pipeline through North Korea to deliver the gas. The two countries also agreed to investigate the possibilities for linking the inter-Korean railway to the trans-Siberian railway system (Ref F). 11. (C) On his state visit, Lee also signed an agreement to upgrade the ROK-Russia relationship to a &quot;Strategic Cooperative Partnership&quot;, the same term used by China to describe this year&apos;s upgrade to the ROK-PRC relationship. Ko Jae-nam, of MOFAT&apos;s Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security, said Korea proposed using the term &quot;Strategic Cooperative Partnership&quot; after China used the term to describe the ROK-PRC relationship. Ko said Korea&apos;s objective in using the same terminology to describe the ROK-Russia relationship was to balance the ROK-PRC relationship. ------- Comment ------- 12. (C) During a year in which President Lee faced considerable difficulty advancing his domestic agenda, his foreign policy efforts, if not wildly successful, at least did not get him into trouble. To a considerable degree, relations with South Korea&apos;s neighbors are driven by economic realities -- increased regional trade, investment, and tourism -- that mesh with Lee&apos;s pragmatic, non-ideological approach. Relations with North Korea were the outlier, as the DPRK took pains in 2008 to demonstrate that it could live without ROK assistance.

No wonder she turned to drink. Fresh Hell is also the title of an exhibition now at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, curated by New York-based British artist Adam McEwen. McEwen&apos;s show gives us old and\u00a0new hell: performance artist Ana\u00a0Mendieta naked and lying on top\u00a0of a skeleton, Martin Kippenberger&apos;s inflatable rubbish skip, and funny little films of Gino de Dominicis failing repeatedly to hurl himself to an early death. You think he&apos;s going to disappear over a precipice into a lake.\u00a0Instead, he&apos;s merely hopping off a\u00a0tussock. De Dominicis repeatedly announced his own demise throughout\u00a0his career, which was cut\u00a0short by his actual death in 1998. Mendieta, the wife of sculptor Carl Andre, fell from a balcony in mysterious circumstances in 1985, and\u00a0Kippenberger is also no longer with us. McEwen, it is worth recalling, was once an obituarist for the Daily Telegraph, and went on to write fake\u00a0obituaries of living celebrities (including Jeff Koons and Bill Clinton) as artworks. The smell of death hangs around Fresh Hell, and won&apos;t go away. Maybe\u00a0it comes from the separate Sophie Calle show in the Palais de Tokyo basement, which is all about her\u00a0dead mother, and is undoubtedly the most sentimental exhibition I have\u00a0ever seen, however cathartic it may intend to be. I much prefer McEwen&apos;s hell, which is full of interesting alignments and unexpected\u00a0artists. Medieval busts of the Kings of Judah, whose faces were mutilated during the French Revolution by protesters who mistakenly thought they represented the French nobility, open the show. These huge, defaced sculptures stare at\u00a0us, blankly, in front of a wall of silver-backed building boards, a 2003 work by Rudolf Stingel that visitors are also allowed to hack about, to graffiti and to gouge. And they have. Later, we come across a big outline drawing of the world, by Jessica Diamond, with the words Is That All There Is? emblazoned above the crudely-drawn continents. But how strange the world is, how rich, how peculiar, is more the point. A big, battered safe, appropriated by Maurizio Cattelan, stands in one gallery. A neat hole has been torched and cut through the safe by bank robbers, who stole over 74m Italian lire in a famous heist. You can&apos;t stop yourself peering into the dark void, looking for the money. There are lots of works here about the sort of emptiness that feels full and rich: Reinhard Mucha&apos;s shadowy cabinets; David Hammons&apos;s In the Hood, a hood ripped from a sport sweatshirt and hung head-high on the wall \u2013 there&apos;s no one in it. Michael Landy&apos;s Market, first seen in a London warehouse show at the beginning of the young British art boom in 1990, is empty, too \u2013 a sprawling arrangement of grocer&apos;s market stalls, with their stacked crates and stands covered in carpets of fake grass. Landy&apos;s vacant market could be a joke about minimalism, or seen as a forerunner of today&apos;s ultra-realistic installation art; it could be a metaphor for Thatcherism or for an art market where there&apos;s nothing to buy. Art, after all, can be nearly nothing. Fresh Hell is full of good things, forgotten things, old and new things. McEwen&apos;s enthusiasm and humour and curiosity is self-evident. Artists make good curators. Henri Michaux&apos;s intense 1960s mescalin drawings hang near a photograph of Sarah Lucas smoking, and Dan Graham&apos;s chart of drugs and their side effects. What are art&apos;s side effects? Georg Herold&apos;s Mountain of Cocaine is a monstrous alp of powdered milk and resin, while another &quot;mountain&quot; looks like a deflated windsock. Like a stoned rant, all this seemed to make sense at the time. Herold&apos;s best work here is a sort of diagramatic labyrinth of timber lengths, suspended at chest height by threads attached to the ceiling. It blocks the viewer&apos;s path. You either have to limbo-dance under it, or take the long way round through the idiotically simple maze. Another metaphor, then. Bruce Nauman&apos;s Pursuit (1975), made with Frank Owen, is a running gag, or rather a long film of people running against a black background. Feet pound, breathing accelerates, hair\u00a0swipes across the screen, breasts and asses bounce and arms flail. It is relentless. Who knows why they run. Nowhere, apparently. This is the goal\u00a0of most runners, and most artists, too. Then one comes across an anonymous 15th-century sculpture of Saint Florian, with carved water emptying from his carved wooden bucket. The arrested flow of the water is astonishingly lively, stilled, frozen in the sculpture&apos;s chiselled wood. Time is arrested, and us with it. Hell never seemed fresher. Fresh Hell is on until 16 January, at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.

On the plus side, gaining a few points for getting out a stop early - whether you&apos;d planned to or not - might make London&apos;s infuriating public transport system seem a little more fun. But, concedes creator Toby Barnes, the developers are aware that the strike is quite painful enough &quot;without someone saying &apos;come and play our game&apos;!&quot; he admits. Photo by wearemudlark. Some rights reserved. So what can Chromaroma do to transform your nightmare commute? The idea started with a preoccupation with what Barnes calls &quot;data shadows&quot;, part of the digital footprint we all leave behind. With the Oyster card, those of us in London leave a record of every journey, every date and every time, and mostly see those journeys as something to endured - as an obstacle to be cleared before the real day can begin. Mix that with a healthy curiosity for history, geography and storytelling, and a love of the\u00a0 that with the geeky &apos;chartiness&apos; of Last.fm and you get a web-based social game that enables and encourages you to explore the city. It doesn&apos;t need a phone or a screen, and you can use the Tube, buses and now Boris bikes. And once you start building up a picture of your Oyster use, the site begins to map it out for you on a deliciously slick map of London. Join a team, assign a home station and you&apos;re off. &quot;Commuting can be quite dull, uncomfortable and a chore,&quot; said Barnes. &quot;We wanted to make the commute something to take you beyond that. What games can you play in your head? Creating a framework that allows people to be a bit more dynamic, to go very slightly go outside the realms of going from A to B - it&apos;s amazing what you discover, the people you bump into and the things you see. When you can find a new route thorugh a city or find out some of the things that happened where you are, that&apos;s when a little bit of magic happens.&quot; Chromaroma also shows it pays to explore beyond the map design monopoly of Google. &quot;We&apos;re all Harry Beck fans,&quot; says Barnes. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to do the Open Street Map dot thing - we wanted to do something that at least we felt could stand somewhere near him.&quot; The result was what he describes as &quot;the world&apos;s first 3D space Flash live data mashup thing&quot;. The idea first came out of the phase when every developer seemed to be extracting the RFID chip from their Oyster card and investigating how much memory it had. &quot; We were all very excited by that but it was probably the wrong way of going about it - as well being illegal,&quot; says Barnes. &quot;So we started looking at the infrastructure that was already in place. With the Oyster card there is, literally, tons of data being generated and stored.&quot; Barnes is managing director of Mudlark, an ambitious and imaginative collective of designers and developers. The team has already produced the Romeo and Juliet-inspired Twitter play Such Tweet Sorrow, a mobile heart rate monitoring game called Heartlands and Civic Dashboard, which creates a hub of useful information for Birmingham residents. Chromaroma is less a moneyspinner than an experiment that combines their interests in visualisation, storytelling and psychogeography - the impact of location and environment on emotions. To play with the idea of &apos;fear&apos; in Chromaroma, for example, virtual props have been introduced including a leech that players can plant at stations to sap points from other teams, and then armour and mirrors to defend and deflect against those. It has taken Mudlark a year to build and release Chromaroma, with support from Screen West Midlands and the now-defunct Channel 4 4ip innovation fund. The game is also entirely dependent on Transport for London for the data that populates Chromaroma. So isn&apos;t that a risk? And what has been their experience of working with them? &quot;They&apos;ve come a very long way,&quot; says Barnes. &quot;It&apos;s an organisation based in Victorian times, with its feet fixed in steam travel. So this is a whole new era for them and they are really trying to get their heads around what it means to be a data company. But it&apos;s a challenge - they&apos;re not just letting us do what we want.&quot; The logistics of extracting data from TFL means it take 48 hours for Chromaroma to update; something of a lag for the online games space which has bene spoilt by the immediacy of most online tools. Real time would be fun, says Barnes, but he doesn&apos;t seem to want to pile the pressure onto TFL. &quot;A lot of people very aggressive at TFL about forcing them to do things, but the more I&apos;ve learnt about them the more I&apos;ve been amazed they do as much as they do. It&apos;s like trying to balance 15 metal balls on a glass plate... they have started delivering APIs and station data, and they are changing the way they are doing things.&quot; Photo by wearemudlark. Some rights reserved Chromaroma has big ambitions, but its biggest challenge seems to be deciding which ideas to develop first. Advertisers are talking to them about the storytelling and message side of the project, not least in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where billboards are banned. Battersea Power Staton - which is notoriously awkward to get to by public transport - is interested in the project, and with the Olympics are on the horizon, there will be millions more visitors to London exploring the city on public transport. The biggest vision is to turn Chromaroma global and have international cities competing against each other - Tokyo v Paris, London v Moscow. &quot;And we&apos;re looking at new game layers that would enable people to skin the game in different ways, so you could have a Victorian gas lamp London with Holmes and Moriaty, or a Warren Ellis 2050 underwater London that you explore with a jetpack.&quot; Is this just another example of the gameification of everything? Actually, you could blame Barnes for some of that. With his event organiser hat on, it was Barnes and friends that loaded the Playful conference stage for the past two years with speakers who extolled the virtues and value of gaming to the world. Add some mayors to this! Add some points to that! So was that what he meant? &quot;This year I stood up and said we were sorry - that we&apos;d messed it up,&quot; says Barnes. &quot;We had people talking about the value of games - and everyone took what we said and ran with it. It&apos;s like they&apos;d seen a disco in a film, then got a record and put a beat over it and said &apos;Look! It&apos;s dance music!&apos; It might look like dance music and sound like dance music, but it&apos;s not dance music.&quot; He does believe that gameification is important, but that it has to be done by games designers, and it&apos;s not just about points and badges. &quot;It needs to be playful, about exploring things, a sense of achievement and building things. There are strong emotions you can only have with an interactive game.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["I came back thinking about a dog.Walking last weekend in Karuizawa, a resort an hour outside Tokyo, I saw two middle-aged women park up a pram and play with their puppy.", "Weird credit derivatives didn&apos;t feature in 80s Tokyo \u2013 stupid lending to overvalued projects and property did, as summed up by the surveyors who calculated that the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were worth more than all the real estate in the state of California.", "Tokyo&apos;s answer to Bond Street now has nestled among the Dior and Prada branches of Zara and Uniqlo.", "Or: look at how easy it is to get a cab in central Tokyo.", "True, there are boarded-up shops in the towns outside Tokyo, and young graduates struggle to land the same quality jobs as previous generations.", "In Beijing and Delhi, they might talk about how tomorrow belongs to them; in Tokyo they suffer no such delusions."], "tags": ["Psychology", "Science", "Japan", "Economic policy", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-30T07:00:01Z", "title": "Japan's banking crisis led to 20 years of stagnation.

I came back thinking about a dog.Walking last weekend in Karuizawa, a resort an hour outside Tokyo, I saw two middle-aged women park up a pram and play with their puppy. There was a full armoury of toys, and a break every few minutes to take a photo of the star attraction. A lot of love was being lavished on a tiny canine. But it was only when I got up close to the pram that I saw what you have already guessed: it didn&apos;t have a baby inside at all. No, it was a super-deluxe petmobile, complete with rugs and more accessories. Ask the Japanese about puppy prams, and they will parry with tales of shops selling canine couture, of vending machines flogging dog wigs that turn your pet into Mermaids-era Cher. And then they will laugh, as if to say aren&apos;t-we-awful? This is the Japan you might remember from 80s television: all those documentaries about the far east&apos;s new economic powerhouse and consumerist paradise, and Clive James snarking his way through clips from perplexing gameshows. As the dog wigs show, that side of the country still exists. And yet, in the intervening 20 years something big happened to Japan, something that places it in the heart of the debate over what Britain&apos;s economy might look like over the years ahead. Decades before the British were bandying the term about, Japan suffered a major banking crisis \u2013 and it still hasn&apos;t recovered. Weird credit derivatives didn&apos;t feature in 80s Tokyo \u2013 stupid lending to overvalued projects and property did, as summed up by the surveyors who calculated that the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were worth more than all the real estate in the state of California. Still, after the property bubble went pop at the start of the 90s, the Japanese economy looked pretty similar to late-noughties Britain: banks with ruined balance sheets that couldn&apos;t or wouldn&apos;t lend money, and a historic economic slump. Japan&apos;s policy-makers tried pouring billions more yen into infrastructure projects, making big tax cuts, and \u2013 years before Britain and America were to do the same \u2013 implementing the policy of quantitative easing, or pumping cash into the financial system. The government even posted shopping vouchers to 35 million voters, in a bid to get the Japanese splashing out. Bold as they might sound, these policies were often too late or too little of the right thing \u2013 or they were swiftly offset by other austerity measures such as a sharp rise in VAT. If any of that sounds familiar to you, then worry \u2013 because in Japan the result was an economy that never really recovered the momentum it had in the 80s, and where shop prices fell more often than rose \u2013 a phenomenon known as deflation. For economists, the past 20 years in Japan is summed up in one phrase: the lost decades. Japan used to be a weird exception to the rest of the world economy: a country stuck in a rut while the rest of the developed world enjoyed a massive boom; now it is an lesson. At the Bank of England, the rate-setter Adam Posen has made speeches on how Britain has to avoid &quot;turning Japanese&quot;. Yet ask a Japanese economist what a lost decade looks like and you get some puzzling answers. Look at Ginza, I was told by one of the country&apos;s top financiers. Tokyo&apos;s answer to Bond Street now has nestled among the Dior and Prada branches of Zara and Uniqlo. Or: look at how easy it is to get a cab in central Tokyo. A bit more fast fashion, an easier journey home after a night out \u2013 and a family that thinks nothing of buying a pram for their pooch: none of these seem terrible hardships. True, there are boarded-up shops in the towns outside Tokyo, and young graduates struggle to land the same quality jobs as previous generations. But in a country as rich and as relatively equal as Japan, there are fewer of the obvious deprivations that one might remember from Britain in the early 80s, say. What happens instead is this: because prices for goods are falling (albeit slowly, moderately), businesses and consumers hold back from splashing out, and so prices keep falling and the economy continues to drift. In Japan, then, tomorrow is always just a little bit worse than today. In Beijing and Delhi, they might talk about how tomorrow belongs to them; in Tokyo they suffer no such delusions. Ask government ministers what they can do to get Japan moving again and you get a reference to how businesses and consumers must regain the confidence to spend freely again. And this plea for greater optimism is invariably delivered with Eeyore-ish pessimism. Should you find yourself near the Japanese equivalent of an Odeon this weekend, you could do worse than check out a new film called Abacus and Sword. It&apos;s the story of a samurai in early 19th-century Japan who is useless at martial arts but brilliant at book-keeping (I kid you not). He rescues his family from financial ruin by flogging everything they have. It is a necessary humiliation, and as wilful appeal to lost history it is more transparent than a window pane. It also sums up the sense of an economy at a dead-end. Yukitoshi Funo, executive vice-president at Toyota, put it like this: &quot;Japan grew so much in the postwar decades; now we have been in stagnation for 20 years. But we have no investment opportunities left.

It signalled the emergence of a new breed of people \u2013 described by Francis Bacon as &quot;merchants of light&quot;. They sought to understand the world by experiment and observation, rather than by reading ancient texts. They were motivated by curiosity, but also engaged with the practical problems of their time \u2013 improving navigation, cultivating forests, rebuilding London after the Great Fire, and so forth. Over the last 350 years our lives have been changed beyond recognition by the application of science. In 1660, vast areas were terra incognita; today, rapid communication and travel makes the world seem connected, even constricted. Some of the changes have been less benign: this is the first century when one species \u2013 ours \u2013 risks irreversibly degrading the entire planet&apos;s environment. We are now in a time of challenges and adversity but it is also a time for scientific opportunity. Issues relating to global health and sustainability must stay high on the agenda if we are to cope with an ageing and ever-increasing population, with growing pressure on resources, and with rising global temperatures. The risks and dangers need to be assessed and then confronted. The need to develop &quot;clean&quot; energy, new vaccines and better resources means science has a critical role to play over the coming years. Helping to meet the challenges of the 21st century demands technological advancement \u2013 and an optimal use of existing knowledge. From the growth of the internet through to the mapping of the human genome and our understanding of the human brain, the more we understand, the more there seems to be for us to explore. We have learned so much over the last 350 years, but with every answer comes more questions. From a personal perspective I am disappointed that we have yet to really achieve a full understanding of the origins of life on Earth. What was the spark that, billions of years ago, kickstarted the process of evolution that has brought us life as we know it today? I hope that we will get some answers to that in my lifetime. Looking further ahead is notoriously difficult, but whatever breakthroughs are in store in the coming decades and beyond, we can be sure of one thing: there will be an ever-widening gulf between what science allows us to do, and what it is prudent or ethical actually to do. In respect of (for instance) human reproductive cloning, genetically modified organisms, nanotechnology, robotics and geoengineering, regulation will be called for, on ethical as well as prudential grounds. In terms of what we should be looking to achieve, a huge priority must be to decarbonise our energy needs. Whether it is to reduce our carbon-dioxide emissions or to prepare for when the coal and oil run out, we have to continue to seek out new energy sources. Science has a huge part to play in the development, and the very survival, of humankind in both the near and distant future. Some of the challenges are obvious and some of the solutions are already being worked on by scientists. New challenges will emerge and in science we have seen again and again that some of the greatest breakthroughs are the unpredictable outcomes of pure curiosity. As we look to the next 350 years of the Royal Society we have no crystal ball that allows us to predict the detailed course of scientific discovery. However, we can be sure that today&apos;s young people will live their lives in a world where science \u2013 and the way it is applied \u2013 will play a greater role than ever before.

Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Kathy Sykes What is consciousness? Most of us have a feel for what we mean by it. But science hasn&apos;t managed to define or understand it. There are various theories; Roger Penrose suggests that quantum mechanics plays a key role, while Susan Greenfield postulates that it is similar to the &quot;wetness of water&quot;, a property that emerges from the actions of individual molecules. But, even with advances in brain-scanning techniques, such as fMRI, we are really only beginning to fathom how our brains work, let alone understand what consciousness is. In the future, as we get better at synthesising organisms, or making empathetic robots, we may be challenged harder about what actually counts as &quot;conscious&quot;. Even now, can we say with confidence which animals are &quot;conscious&quot;? Is your dog conscious? And what happens to our consciousness if we get progressive Alzheimer&apos;s, or if we become psychotic? And what about those &quot;coincidences&quot; or &quot;unscientific&quot; claims you hear about two conscious minds communicating at a distance? When someone &quot;knows&quot; that something awful is happening to someone they love? One day, could we have a tested understanding of consciousness that provides a viable mechanism? Maybe not, but it&apos;s a delightful thought that we might be connected to people we love \u2013 in a way we can&apos;t yet explain. Will we ever understand consciousness fully? Perhaps not. We are having to use the human brain to understand its own workings. But I hope in my lifetime that we will get closer to having some inkling about what and who we really are. Kathy Sykes is professor of sciences and society at the University of Bristol and co-director of the Cheltenham science festival. Joan BakewellWhat happened before the big bang? To simply declare \u2013 as some scientists do \u2013 there was no space or time before the big bang and that the question is therefore meaningless is hard to accept, as it suggests matter was created out of nothing. But then if there was some kind of pre-existing primordial chaos that was fashioned into the universe by the hand of God, then where did the chaos come from? At the other end of the timescale, I&apos;d like to know whether robots will ever supercede humans. We are told scientists have already created artificial intelligence that can respond to emotion, but will they be able to go beyond getting robots to affect responses and generate feelings spontaneously \u2013 such as falling in love? And will robots overcome their inability to physically reproduce by finding a way of replicating their components into newer models? Or will the same robots keep on regenerating themselves? Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster and writer. Mark MiodownikWill science and engineering give us back our individuality? If you do a quick inventory of what you own, you will find that most of it is mass produced. This is a result of the industrial revolution, during which we gave up the individually crafted object in return for factories, and in the process got extremely rich. The price was the acceptance of uniformity in every aspect of our lives: our pens, our clothes, our cars, even our homes are all mass produced. It is a dominant influence in our lives, and it shapes global capitalism. But now there is a technology coming out of university science labs that could change all this and set in motion a second industrial revolution that may reverse the whole process. The technology is called a 3D printer. What it does is this: it takes a design from your computer and makes it into a physical object. In other words, you press &quot;print&quot; and out comes a thing; this can be a functioning pen, a pair of glasses, or a hip replacement. This is not science fiction: I have a 3D printer in my lab and it works. At the moment the technology is in its early stages, but already hospitals are using it to make tailor-made implants for patients. Think what might happen if we perfect this technology. Why buy a phone, when you can design and print your own? Why buy a ring when you can express exactly how you feel by making one for your lover, or new cutlery for your mother? The possibilities are literally endless. But it has political and economic implications too. As soon as our desire for material wealth is no longer linked to mass production, factories may become redundant, and shops too. This technology is currently at the state that computers were in the 1980s. Will science and engineering deliver another industrial revolution by perfecting the 3D printer as it did the computer? Mark Miodownik is a physicist at King&apos;s College London and will give this year&apos;s Royal Institution Christmas lectures. Tracy ChevalierHow are we going to cope with the world&apos;s burgeoning population? We can talk all we like about renewable energies, recycling and sustainable agriculture, but population is the issue that really matters. Yet it is the one on which so many people are silent. We have made the human right to reproduce unchallengeable: to do so is either to be eugenicist or \u2013 as with China&apos;s one-child policy \u2013 repressively authoritarian. But sooner or later we have to do something. No matter how much recycling we do, how much renewable energy we create and how much better we become at producing food, there has to come a time when the world&apos;s population makes the planet unsustainable. What&apos;s more, the pressure on resources is being maintained at both ends of the population spectrum; not only are more babies being born, people are living longer and longer. There are even suggestions some people may soon live to 200-300. This may be a triumph for medicine but it may be a disaster for the world. So I&apos;d like to see scientists create a working model of population growth that can predict the planet&apos;s breaking point and for global policy to be framed around it. Tracy Chevalier is a novelist. Marcus du SautoyIs there a pattern to the prime numbers? For 2,000 years mathematicians have been struggling to unlock the secret of the primes, numbers such as seven and 17 that can&apos;t be divided. Is there a pattern to these numbers that can help us predict where to find the next one, as we count higher and higher through the universe of numbers? Each generation has contributed another chapter in our odyssey to understand these fundamental numbers. There is a feeling that the answer to the enigma of the primes might finally be close. But the fun thing about mathematics is that you can never be sure when and from where the great breakthrough will come. I think many people believe that we must have solved all the big problems of mathematics, that Fermat&apos;s Last Theorem was precisely that: the last theorem. But that is far from true. Mathematics is a living, breathing subject because of the many problems we still can&apos;t solve. Numbers still retain many of their mysteries, none more so than the primes. Given all the problems that face the world \u2013 cancer, climate change, sustainability, energy alternatives \u2013 the problem of the primes sounds something of an esoteric, arcane place to be channelling one&apos;s scientific efforts over the coming decades. History tells us otherwise. The great technological breakthroughs, the science that has changed society, all have their roots in fundamental science pursued for its own sake. The primes are the atoms of arithmetic; from numbers you get mathematics; and from mathematics flow all the other sciences. It&apos;s answering the fundamental questions of science that has the greatest potential to transform society.

Photograph: Alamy    Brian CoxCan we make a scientific way of thinking all pervasive? This would be the greatest achievement for science over the coming centuries. I say this because I do not believe that we currently run our world according to evidence-based principles. If we did, we would be investing in an energy Manhattan project to quickly develop and deploy clean energy technologies. We would be investing far larger amounts of our GDP in the eradication of diseases such as malaria, and we would be learning to live and work in space \u2013 not as an interesting and extravagant sideline, but as an essential part of our long-term survival strategy. One only has to look at the so-called controversies in areas such as climate science or the vaccination of our children to see that the rationalist project is far from triumphant at the turn of the 21st century \u2013 indeed, it is possible to argue that it is under threat. I believe that we will only be able to build a safer, fairer, more prosperous and more peaceful world when a majority of the population understand the methods of science and accept the guidance offered by an evidence-based investigation of the challenges ahead. Scientific education must therefore be the foundation upon which our future rests. Brian Cox is a physicist at the University of Manchester and Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. John SulstonHow do we ensure humanity survives and flourishes? This is the context in which all the exciting discoveries and explorations are going to happen. We certainly can survive but we can only do it by thinking in a rather larger and more collective way than we&apos;re accustomed to at the moment. The natural sciences will need to work in conjunction with the social sciences and governance if we are to ensure we will address challenges in an effective way. The challenges lie not so much in the natural sciences but in the social sciences and governance. Why might we not survive? We are hitting a number of very obvious resource limitations in terms of consumption and emissions. Some prefer to deny the importance or existence of anthropogenic climate change but I think there&apos;s no doubt at all. It&apos;s very clear that the framework is solid; we are heading for a warmer Earth and it is going to have a lot of consequences, among which will be increasing conflict and dangers of us not collectively surviving in the end. We need to head off the thing happening at all, if we can, and we need to head off the consequences in terms of conflict and ultimate conflagration. Underlying all our problems is that we are over-running the Earth. That&apos;s not to say that we should panic about it, but it is something we should discuss openly and manage. This is a challenge we can meet if we think more collectively. We&apos;re not good at doing that, especially in our current ethos. In the last 50 years, we have moved away from collective thinking: people are set up and educated more and more in the western style to compete. This is not a good way of solving these problems. On the small scale, and on a level playing field, the free-market structures are great; they&apos;re exactly what we need to flourish. But they don&apos;t work at all on the global scale, and it is there where we have to address the best way of going about it. We need a democracy that recognises that these large things matter. That&apos;s the conundrum, really, to see how we can use the security and individual freedom that comes out of the ballot box with sensible collective behaviour. That&apos;s something that is not been solved and it is a problem for social science and natural science working together. John Sulston is chairing the Royal Society&apos;s study on people and the planet. Andrew MotionCan someone explain adequately the meaning of infinite space? The idea of there being no end to space seems logically impossible. How can there be no limits to space? We know the universe is expanding, but what is it expanding into? Is it squeezing into something else and making that contract, or is the universe just venturing into nothingness? In which case, nothingness and somethingness appear to be much the same. We are also told the universe may contract in time; this raises similar questions. What replaces the space that was the something of the universe? On a more frivolous level, I&apos;d also like to know whether my cat is fully evolved as a species. She certainly gives every impression of having pretty much everything she needs. Following on from this, I&apos;d also like to know whether humans are the final step in the primate evolutionary ladder, or whether there will be another species running the world one day while we get locked up in zoos and forced to smoke cigarettes in laboratories. I&apos;d die a happy man with answers to these questions. Andrew Motion is a former poet laureate. Lionel ShriverWill I be able to record my brain like I can record a programme on television? I would like to be able to re-experience something significant in my life, such as falling in love. (Think how much safer it would be to take a hallucinogen once and then just replay it when you were in the mood.) I would especially like to be able to record my dreams \u2013 and I do not mean the sad little journal jottings of what I barely remember. I want to see those images again, rewind, and contemplate where I got those amazing stories from. I would never run dry on fiction ideas again. Assuming that other people could also play your tapes in their brains, the technology would be rife with problems, providing the ultimate in invasion of privacy. Secrets of any sort could become impossible. Worst of all, other people could get their hands on how tawdry and dreary most of your thought processes really are. On the other hand, it would also make it possible to truly experience what it is like to be someone else \u2013 though that might put fiction writers out of business. Lionel Shriver is a novelist. Piers SellersCan humanity get to the stars? In the next 100 years, we will have explored right to the limits of our solar system with people and thoroughly explored every nook and cranny with robots. I don&apos;t know when humans will start spreading out towards the stars after that; when someone can put a starship drive together \u2013 robots first and then people. We know there are planets out there and we know some of them live in the habitable zone. Robots will go out first to other stars and you will be able to see them in your living room. Humans will follow, though I don&apos;t know yet how they will keep people alive or frozen or whatever for the times and distances required. Even if humans creep around at 1% of the speed of light (and I&apos;m sure we could do better than that over time), we will have spread out over the galaxy in 10m years. It&apos;s not hard to do. With 10% of the speed of light, we will have gone around the whole galaxy in 1m years. There will be people everywhere. Every advance in science has changed the human perspective, the way we see ourselves. The idea that the Earth isn&apos;t the centre of the universe and the theory of evolution both changed things. I&apos;m pretty sure there is life out there somewhere and bumping into other lifeforms, intelligent or not, will be interesting. The descendants of the human race, whatever they are, will have to move away from this rock and this solar system to survive \u2013 stars have finite lifetimes. But that&apos;s a long way off: I wouldn&apos;t worry about selling your stocks and shares just yet.

This is not a war!&quot; Richard Branson declared, guns blazing, at the launch in New York today of his new digital venture \u2013 a monthly interactive magazine custom-designed for the iPad. Fighting words from the Virgin tycoon, intended to squash reports that his entry into the exploding iPad applications market brings him head-to-head with Rupert Murdoch who is soon to launch his own digital-only iPad publication, the Daily. Having told his audience of about 50 journalists and technophiles in a downtown Manhattan hotel suite that he was picking no fight with Murdoch, Branson went on to say that he was picking a fight with Murdoch over quality. &quot;If it&apos;s a battle, it&apos;s a battle over quality. Based on 30 years of reading News of the World and other papers [Murdoch] publishes, I think on quality we&apos;ll be willing to be judged.&quot; So that&apos;s clear then. This is not a battle, though it is a battle over quality. Then Branson unveiled his &quot;new baby&quot; which, after several incarnations, has settled on the name Project. Never short of a soundbite nor shy of hyperbole, he described it as &quot;the first truly digital magazine by creative people for creative people&quot;. For the price of a cup of coffee \u2013 &quot;an expensive cup of coffee,&quot; Branson said, earning brownie points for honesty \u2013 the iPad user can download Project through the Apple app store. For \u00a31.79 or $2.99 a month you will have about 100 pages of content poured into your tablet computer. Project&apos;s editor, Anthony Noguera, said the small team that developed the product \u2013 including Seven Squared, an agency part-owned by the Guardian Media Group \u2013 had tried to combine the best of print magazines with the opportunities of digital technology. The launch cover features actor Jeff Bridges whose sequel to Tron (1982), Tron: Legacy, is scheduled to hit cinemas in two weeks. At first glance the cover is conventional, staid almost, with a portrait of Bridges and elegant cover lines. Touch the iPad screen and it comes alive. Bridges starts to walk across the magazine front, which takes on the distorted feel of the sci-fi film. Inside, there is a gallery of photographs from Bridges&apos;s previous films; touch any one and the actor&apos;s grainy voice is heard recalling the making of each work. A travel feature about Tokyo is illustrated not only with photographs shown off to striking effect, but also videos that take you into the heart of the city. An item on a Jaguar car in prototype allows users to look around the inside of the vehicle as well as to listen to the engine sound. By bringing together traditional words and pictures with digital sound and video, Noguera said he hoped Project would stand out amid the cacophony of the internet. &quot;This is a much more immersive experience than a website. When you talk to iPad users they say they are reading more than they ever have.&quot; Specialist digital publishing websites that had the chance to test-drive the app were not entirely convinced. CNET said the Bridges videos were &quot;cringeworthy to watch&quot; and questioned the concept of a digital magazine that saddled itself with the restrictions of print. PaidContent found it to be frustrating and confusing, and more in tune with a print magazine than with the iPad. Project will have some obvious strengths and weaknesses when it does come up against Murdoch&apos;s effort, which is expected to go live in the new year.

Everyone was trying to warn me.&quot; Nevertheless, his fears proved ungrounded. &quot;It was actually very civilised and sweet and fun. Everyone was charmingly drunk. It wasn&apos;t degrading in the slightest.&quot; Groening is talking about his stint curating last spring&apos;s All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties, the cult music festival that takes place at Butlins in the Somerset town of Minehead. In 2007, GZA of New York rappers the Wu-Tang Clan had been less convinced by the event. &quot;He left the camp and found a big American sports bar in Minehead,&quot; recalls Geoff Barrow, of Portishead. &quot;That was the only thing that made sense to him: burgers and boxing.&quot; For the last 10 years, chalets and crazy golf have provided the backdrop for ATP, which has stood apart from other festivals by steadfastly championing the alternative and the arcane: Iggy and the Stooges, Nick Cave and Patti Smith have all performed, but so have Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Jackie-O Motherfucker and Hair Police. Each event is curated by a single band or artist, meaning Portishead, Mogwai and My Bloody Valentine have been able to invite their favourite acts to play, as have Vincent Gallo, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Groening (who was approached after being spotted enthusing about Captain Beefheart in a documentary). The resulting festival is like a mixtape: you&apos;re not always familiar with every band, but you&apos;re usually pleased someone has bought them to your attention. &quot;ATP is probably the most important festival of our generation,&quot; says Sonic Youth&apos;s Thurston Moore, who has both played and curated. &quot;The idea of an artist-run enterprise continues to serve the legacy of a post-punk, independent music scene.&quot; This month, ATP concludes its 10th anniversary celebrations with an event programmed by Belle and Sebastian, initiators of the festival&apos;s forerunner: the Bowlie Weekender, held at the Camber Sands Pontin&apos;s in East Sussex. From that small seed grew an event that has gone global. In February, Barry Hogan, who organised the Bowlie with Belle and Sebastian&apos;s Stuart Murdoch, will stage his first ATP in Tokyo, having already exported it to Australia and America. Rolling Stone deemed the New York event &quot;perfect&quot;, while Village Voice called it the state&apos;s best festival. &quot;That&apos;s quite nice, seeing as they stage their own festivals,&quot; says\u00a0Hogan. These days, festivals are so heavily commercialised \u2013 from banners on stages to logos on beer cups to branded wellies \u2013 that they can feel less like a weekend escape than a wander through a shopping mall. But ATP has stayed true to the independent ethos of its acts by forgoing all sponsorship. Hogan explains: &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to say to Fuck Buttons, &apos;You guys can&apos;t play because you&apos;ve got swearing in your name, and Evian doesn&apos;t like it.&apos;&quot; ATP, which Hogan co-runs with his wife Deborah, works because everyone involved \u2013 bands, curators, punters \u2013 are as fanish about the music as each other. Hogan operates a &quot;no arseholes policy&quot;: everyone mucks in, there&apos;s no VIP area. US rock band Cheap Trick once insisted on hypoallergenic pillows \u2013 they&apos;ve not been asked back. &quot;We&apos;re all in the same accommodation,&quot; says Sonic Youth&apos;s Moore. &quot;There&apos;s no velvet rope outside Iggy&apos;s chalet. The fact that you&apos;re all milling around, with all these musicians and artists, breaks down the barriers.&quot; Film director Jim Jarmusch curated an American ATP this September, at a dilapidated, century-old country club in the Catskill Mountains called Kutsher&apos;s. &quot;It&apos;s one weekend of super-concentrated music with bands you rarely get to see,&quot; he says. &quot;It would take years to see them all come through New York. The fans and the bands have\u00a0excellent taste, so it&apos;s a win-win situation.&quot; This inclusiveness was captured last year on an ATP documentary that featured songwriter Daniel Johnston performing to a crowd outside his chalet window, folk rockers Grizzly Bear leading a dawn sing-a-long across Minehead beach, and the musician Warren Ellis observing dozens of festival-goers shambling around, and declaring: &quot;This is pretty whacked out.&quot; This from a man who has spent the last 15 years adding violin and bouzouki to Nick Cave&apos;s gothic rock, and whose previous bands numbered Fungus Brains and People With Chairs Up Their\u00a0Noses. You can probably guess Hogan&apos;s thoughts on more mainstream festivals. &quot;They treat their fans like cattle, overcharging for everything,&quot; he says. &quot;They get all that sponsorship, then charge \u00a315 for a programme. They should be ashamed of themselves. It&apos;s a disgrace.&quot; And he&apos;s got little time for freeloading celebrities, wincing at the memory of Peaches Geldof turning up at one of his sold-out My Bloody Valentine shows. &quot;Her manager said, &apos;What can I do to get her in?&apos; I said, &apos;Get\u00a0in a DeLorean and go back in time to when the tickets went on sale and do what everyone else did \u2013 get her credit card out.&apos;&quot; What happens if a curator chooses a band Hogan doesn&apos;t like? &quot;There have been some strange choices,&quot; he says. &quot;I personally never want to see Blur at ATP. But if someone picked them, I would have to respect that. We could never afford them, though, so I don&apos;t have to worry.&quot; ATP hasn&apos;t all been plain sailing, though, with Hogan losing &quot;a six-figure sum&quot; at Kutsher&apos;s last year. And you could argue ATP has been the victim of its own success: it helped broker the idea of the &quot;boutique&quot; festival, events with a 6,000 capacity \u2013 and now the UK is crowded with them. Hogan is considering cutting back on the number of events, but with music business models collapsing all over the place, ATP&apos;s belief in staying small and looking after a faithful fanbase suddenly looks rather prescient. &quot;Those record labels regarded as &apos;indie&apos; \u2013 Sub Pop, Domino and XL \u2013 have now got the strongest promotion, the best teams working for them, they&apos;re really great at what they do,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;You&apos;re better off working for them than EMI.&quot; Hogan still has acts he would like to bring to Butlins: he&apos;s after Neil Young and Kraftwerk, and dreams of Wes Anderson curating. Certainly, performing at ATP does have unusual perks. Groening drew some of his acts, leading to speculation they might appear on The Simpsons. &quot;Joanna Newsom graciously denied the rumour,&quot; he says. &quot;But now I&apos;m going to make it happen.&quot; He also booked Jackie-O Motherfucker. Room for them on The Simpsons? &quot;That,&quot; he says, &quot;would be pushing it.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["JEF beat Nagoya 2-1 after being 1-0 down after 88 minutes (Leicester&apos;s Yuki Abe scored the winner), while Cerezo were leading FC Tokyo 2-1 with two minutes left, with one hand on the trophy, before a late equaliser handed the J-League title to their neighbours Gamba."], "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T00:05:00Z", "title": "The Knowledge | Have any footballers ever undergone cosmetic surgery?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/dec/01/footballers-undergoing-cosmetic-surgery", "article": "&quot;Which players have gone under the cosmetic surgeon&apos;s knife to enhance their looks?&quot; wonders Philip Genochio. Rumours spread among the Brazilian press in 2009 that Ronaldo had undergone liposuction. Joaquim Grava, the doctor at Corinthians, where Ronaldo was then playing, said: &quot;There are certain things a doctor can talk about, but others only with the consent of the patient. I am not allowed to confirm if the [surgery] has been done or not.&quot; Most cryptically, when asked directly whether he&apos;d had the procedure, Ronaldo replied: &quot;I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t even know if I did it. These are things we don&apos;t know ... What I do with my private life is my business.&quot; There is no doubt about the former Colombia goalkeeper Ren\u00e9 Higuita, however, who underwent surgery for all to see on the television reality show, Cambio Extremo, in 2005. &quot;I am tired of being ugly Ren\u00e9, I want to be handsome Ren\u00e9,&quot; he declared. As reported in the Observer, &quot;Higuita had televised nose surgery, a silicon chin implant, skin peel, eyelid skin cut away, &apos;aggressive&apos; liposuction and abdominal muscle enhancement after being voted Colombia&apos;s &apos;ugliest icon&apos;. After a month in isolation Higuita revealed his brand new look. &apos;Bodily, I am perfect,&apos; he said.&quot; Next up is Sasa Curcic, once of Bolton, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, whose wife Lisa told the Sunday Mirror in 1998 of the Serb&apos;s nasal surgery. &quot;Some of [my friends] couldn&apos;t understand why I&apos;d fallen for someone with such a big hooter,&quot; she said. &quot;But I&apos;ve never been attracted to pretty boys and I thought he had an interesting face and lovely eyes.&quot; She went on to explain that Curcic was operated on at a private London hospital, having complained about problems with his breathing. &quot;Well, that was his story,&quot; said Lisa. &quot;I think it was more to do with vanity because he was always telling me he&apos;d like to have a nose like mine. He got into trouble with Villa because he didn&apos;t tell them he was having the surgery and it meant he couldn&apos;t play until it had healed.&quot; Villa&apos;s secretary-director Steve Stride confirmed this to the News of the World in 2000, saying: &quot;While [Curcic] was with us he had his hair dyed, his teeth capped and underwent plastic surgery on his nose. I think he was trying to make himself more attractive to women but I suspect it had the opposite effect.&quot; Here&apos;s a more recent picture. Obviously there are a host of players that have had operations caused by injuries on the field of play. Then Liverpool striker Peter Crouch is just one example, telling the Daily Post in 2007 of his need to correct a broken nose sustained in a collision with Rob Hulse. &quot;If it&apos;s affecting my performances I&apos;m going to have to get it done,&quot; he said. There are also off-field injuries which have required some work. Earlier in 2010, Diego Maradona was bitten by his pet dog in Buenos Aires and headed off to the local Los Arcos clinic for surgery. &quot;He had a simple lesions and had surgery for about half an hour,&quot; said Julio Jiminez, the clinic&apos;s administrator. &quot;There&apos;s no problem. He was walking and left with his girlfriend.&quot; Finally (and admittedly rather tenuously), plastic surgery can come back to haunt footballers, as it did with Lothar Matth\u00e4us. His estranged wife, Liliana, demanded that the former Germany skipper foot the \u20ac2,800 bill for a breast augmentation reversal. &quot;I fail to see why I should pay for this and other plastic surgery bills,&quot; Matth\u00e4us told Bild. Any more for any more? Send them to the usual address. TIGHT AT THE TOP &quot;With the recent end of season shenanigans in F1 where four contenders could statistically win the title in the last game of the season,&quot; begins Paul Baker, &quot;I was wondering which league had the most amount of teams fighting for the championship on the final day? And conversely, which league has had the most amount of teams fighting relegation on the last day?&quot; Richard Ailes mails in with news from Mexico. Please try and keep up. &quot;On Thursday, 19 April 2001, the final day of the Mexican season, the title aspirations of 16 of the 18 teams in the First Division remained intact,&quot; he begins. &quot;True, we&apos;re taking about a &apos;regular season&apos;, with &apos;post-season&apos; play-offs (called &apos;Liguilla&apos; or &apos;mini-league&apos;, though it is run on a knock-out basis) to follow, but it&apos;s nevertheless worth documenting what was the high noon of a system of competition so complex and inclusive that television coverage of the last day of the season resembled an Election Night Special, with a baffling array of possible outcomes rotating with almost every goal. &quot;In order to work out who was going to be in the play-offs you had to cross-reference two different league tables: a regular, common-or-garden league table, and a &apos;groups&apos; table, which repeated the information on the league table but arranged the teams in four random groups. To qualify directly, a team needed to finish in the top eight of the regular league table and in the top two of its random group; teams which only met one of these criteria would have to play against a team meeting the other requirement in a pre-Liguilla &apos;reclassification&apos; duel. Thus, theoretically, 11 teams could get to the post-season. And the hopes and dreams of the mediocre were further bolstered by the short, twice-yearly seasons, which gave little time for a gap to open up. At the Estadio Jalisco that evening, for example, I watched 12th-placed Atlas scrape into a reclassification with just 22 points from a possible 51 (not that we had much of a clue, mind you, without Peter Snow to guide us ...). &quot;Meanwhile, over in Mexico City, 23 points was enough to earn Atlante (eighth in the overall standings, top of their random group) a direct place in the Liguilla. Or it would have been, had it not been for a third league table. Relegation was decided on a three-year points-per-game average, and Atlante&apos;s final-day defeat to local rivals Am\u00e9rica meant they were down. The first team to be relegated and make the play-offs simultaneously, Tigres UANL, had actually competed for the championship as a relegated team (passing reclassification and going out in the quarter-finals), but a subsequent ad hoc ruling prevented a repeat occurence, and Atlante were forced to relinquish their play-off berth along with their top-flight status. Le\u00f3n, the team that leap-frogged them on the last day, not only survived relegation but qualified for the Liguilla as well.&quot; There&apos;s more. There&apos;s always more, as Darren Beach explains of goings-on in Japan. &quot;The 2005 J-League was the first since 1996 to be run on a European-style single season rather than the South American-style double-season format followed by a play-off to decide the champion,&quot; he writes. &quot;With one match left in the 34-game season, five clubs had a chance of the title \u2013 leaders Cerezo Osaka on 58 points, then neighbours Gamba Osaka on 57, and then Urawa Reds, JEF United and Kashima Antlers on 56 points. &quot;On the final day, Gamba, Urawa and Kashima all won their final matches comfortably. JEF beat Nagoya 2-1 after being 1-0 down after 88 minutes (Leicester&apos;s Yuki Abe scored the winner), while Cerezo were leading FC Tokyo 2-1 with two minutes left, with one hand on the trophy, before a late equaliser handed the J-League title to their neighbours Gamba. Final standings: 1) Gamba 60. 2) Urawa 59. 3) Kashima 59. 4) JEF 59. 5) Cerezo 58.&quot; STADIUM PIPE DREAMS (3) In the last two weeks we have looked at ambitious stadium plans that failed to get off the ground. But here&apos;s a belter that slipped through the cracks ... &quot;Your feature on unlikely stadiums mentioned Luton Town, and this reminded me of a scheme their chairman once had that gave all us rival fans down the [Vicarage] Road a good laugh,&quot; begins Gavin Cleaver. Have a look at this, and especially section VII on &apos;Development&apos;. The second best bit is:  &apos;A new stadium built on a concrete raft over the current M1 spur road adjacent to our site between junction 10 and 10a. The stadium would have a &apos;Teflon&apos; roof kept up by air pressure similar to the Pontiac Dome in Detroit, Michigan. The stadium would have capacity for 50,000\u201375,000 people with a concentration on executive boxes and executive areas.&apos;  &quot;Yes, a stadium on a platform high up in the air. This isn&apos;t even the best part. What would be the reason for putting the stadium up in the air? Why, that would be the possibility of ...  ... &apos;an alternative scheme drawn up where the roads on the site would provide the possibility for a motor racing track. Planning permission will, therefore, be sought for a F1 track on the site. The Borough has indicated they would support this application. If the application were to be successful there would be one Grand Prix a year held on the site, which would attract income of more than \u00a3500,000,000 with a profit to the club of some \u00a3200,000,000. This one event would make LTFC the largest (in financial terms) club in Europe.&apos;  &quot;Yes. A floating stadium with the Formula 1 Luton Grand Prix underneath. Best. Plan. Ever. (This came shortly before Luton fans were encouraged to phone a premium rate phone line to vote for their new manager). Their club continues to provide us with chuckles galore even in these dark, dark times.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;My late uncle was a footballer playing for pre-communist China. He always boasted that he participated in the 1948 London Olympics. Was there a Chinese football team? And if so, have you got any details of the team and how did they do?&quot; wrote Rebecca Yau in 2008. Good news, Rebecca, your uncle was not a fibber. The Republic of China did indeed send a football team to the London Olympics in 1948, though sad to relate, their success was limited. They lined up for their first round match against Turkey at midday on August 2, 60 years ago, at the home of football, Green Pond Road, Walthamstow. They finished up on the wrong end of a 4-0 walloping, but were saved from any embarrassment by the USA&apos;s 9-0 capitulation to Italy hours later. And wearing the No5 shirt in that defeat was Man Chi Chau, Rebecca&apos;s late uncle. The team line-ups, goalscorers and all the other results can be found in Fifa&apos;s excellent archive. It would only be fair to note the football team&apos;s achievement in simply lining up at the Olympics. The Chinese government gave next to no funding to its Olympic delegation. In order to secure the finances to fund their Olympic journey, the football team embarked on a 32-match tour of Asia, pocketing their share of gate receipts as they went. The delegation even brought with them their own food, to save on inflated prices in post-war Britain. The Chinese Olympic team that year featured 33 athletes, all of them male, none of whom made it beyond the preliminary stages of their event. The delegation was then forced to borrow money to make it home. It would be fair to say that state funding for Chinese athletes has seen something of an increase in the last 60 years.

Smith for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 1. (C) Ambassador Holbrooke, Embassy Riyadh warmly welcomes you to Saudi Arabia, which, by virtue of its historical and cultural ties to Central Asia; personal relationships between Saudi, Afghani and Pakistani leaders; financial power; and leadership of the Muslim world, can play a central role in implementing the President&apos;s strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Your visit comes at a time of great potential but great uncertainty: the Saudi-Afghan relationship appears to be warming up, while the traditionally close Saudi-Pakistani relationship has grown increasingly strained. The Saudis are broadly supportive of our approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan, but occasionally express skepticism about our timing or our approach. Your visit provides an opportunity to mine the Saudis&apos; wealth of experience in dealing with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and extremism, and further explore ways to translate our shared goals into action in the unique Saudi context. We have requested meetings with GIP Director Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, Assistant Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayif, and Prince Turki Al-Faisal during your visit. 2. (C) SAUDI-AFGHAN RELATIONS WARMING: President Karzai&apos;s February 2-3 visit to the Kingdom, although richer in symbolism than substance, was a sign that lukewarm Saudi-Afghan relations may finally be warming up. In his official statement at the London Conference, FM Saud announced a $150 million pledge of additional financial support for Afghan reconstruction. He expressed broad Saudi support for reconciliation, adding that they would be willing to assist at the request of President Karzai-- on the condition that the Taliban sever its relationship with Al-Qaeda and cease providing refuge to its leaders. While not as forward leaning as we may have liked, FM Saud&apos;s statement put the Saudis on the record and created an opportunity to put reconciliation talks back in motion--eventually. Saudi participation at the Turkish-led regional conference on Afghanistan on January 26 was further evidence of the Saudi commitment to engagement. Karzai&apos;s visit showed that the King was ready to deal with Karzai as a legitimate, Muslim head of state. However, the Saudis continue to have concerns about Afghan corruption and believe greater political incorporation of the Pashtun community is essential. Their apparent wish to downplay Karzai&apos;s visit--as compared to the Afghans (reftel)--may also indicate the King&apos;s desire to keep some distance and maintain his credibility as a potential reconciliation mediator. 3. (S/NF) BUT MEDIATION NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME: Privately, the Saudis tell us it&apos;s still &quot;too soon&quot; to be publicly discussing technical and financial aspects of reintegration efforts. GIP Director Prince Muqrin has made clear that his marching orders are to work through intelligence channels only until progress becomes sustainable, at which point foreign ministries will be brought in. In a recent meeting with the Ambassador, Prince Muqrin hinted at but did not provide details about what appears to be significant movement on the Saudi mediation effort, with visits by high-level Taliban and Afghan officials, since the Hajj. We surmise that Muqrin is reluctant to share information because the talks remain delicate and he fears U.S. involvement could derail progress. He has also voiced concern about how to address UNSCR 1267 prohibitions on dealing with various Taliban members. 4. (C) ZARDARI STILL THE PROBLEM IN PAKISTAN: The Saudis generally agree that there is a need to deny terrorists safehavens in Pakistan, but question whether the methods we have outlined will be effective. Despite tense relations with the Zardari government, close military and intelligence cooperation continues between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The Saudis believe opposition leader Nawaz Sharif can play a &quot;great role&quot; in working with tribal chiefs and that &quot;money is better than bullets&quot; in the fight against the Taliban. They have started to fulfill their pledge from the Tokyo donor,s conference (over half of the $700 million pledged has been disbursed) and have expressed a willingness to continue with financial support for a stable Pakistan. Saudi interlocutors stress the importance of remembering that Pakistan remains RIYADH 00000182 002.2 OF 003 pre-occupied with issues on its Indian border, coloring its ability to deal with the Taliban. 5. (C) IN THE ARMY WE TRUST: The tumultuous democratic process in Pakistan makes the Saudis nervous, and they appear to be looking for &quot;another Musharraf&quot;: a strong, forceful leader they know they can trust. In his January meeting with General Jones, the King cited President Zardari as an impediment to denying terrorist safehavens, calling him an &quot;obstacle&quot; and &quot;a rotten head&quot; that was infecting the whole body. He maintained that the Pakistani Army was capable of being a strong partner for the U.S., and opined that U.S. development assistance would rebuild trust. He asserted that that the Army was staying out of Pakistani politics in deference to U.S. wishes, rather than doing what it &quot;should.&quot; FM Saud told General Jones that we must reach out to tribal leaders and separate &quot;those we could work with&quot; from &quot;those we must fight.&quot; He believed that using the military to fight extremists posed certain dangers, and that the credibility of the army must be maintained. The Saudis were pushing Pakistan&apos;s civilian leaders to work together, but &quot;compromise seemed alien to Pakistani politicians.&quot; 6. (C) TURKI&apos;S TAKE: During a recent meeting with Ambassador, former GIP Director Prince Turki Al-Faisal called Afghanistan a &quot;puzzle,&quot; where establishing trust with Afghan leaders, and recognizing the links between Pakistan and the Taliban, were keys to success. All financial aid to the Afghan government should be conditional: benchmarks must be set for the leadership, and aid must be withheld until these are met. Recent Saudi efforts to assist in Taliban mediation had failed, he said, when &quot;both sides fell short.&quot; He described the Taliban leadership as &quot;fractured,&quot; and suggested the U.S. and NATO needed to target criminal elements more vociferously and re-focus our attention on capturing Osama Bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. He suggested Saudi Arabia, the U.S., China, Russia, Afghanistan and Pakistan could join forces and share assets in order to capture or kill bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri. This would break the terrorists&apos; &quot;aura of invincibility&quot; and allow the U.S. to &quot;declare victory&quot; and move on. 7. (S/NF) TERRORISM FINANCE: Terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern. Over the last year, however, Saudi Arabia has made important progress in combating al-Qaida financing emanating from the country. Sensitive reporting indicates that al-Qaida&apos;s ability to raise funds has deteriorated substantially, and that it is now in its weakest state since 9/11. The Kingdom is also cooperating more actively than at any previous point to respond to terrorist financing concerns raised by the United States, and to investigate and detain financial facilitators of concern. Nonetheless, sustained engagement is required to maintain the current momentum, particularly in providing the Saudis with specific details and actionable information. Your visit provides another opportunity to welcome the progress Saudi Arabia has made, and reiterate the importance that President Obama and the USG place on curtailing fundraising activity by global terrorist groups in Saudi Arabia, particularly those that undermine the stability of Afghanistan and Pakistan. 8. (S/NF) TERRORISM FINANCE, CONTINUED: While in the past the KSA stood reluctant to pursue Saudi donors who backed groups that did not directly threaten the Kingdom, the Saudi Ministry of Interior (MOI) has now demonstrated willingness to take action, and has begun to detain individuals involved in funding networks for groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LeT), the Taliban, and in some cases even Hamas. Our TF cooperation with the MOI is of utmost strategic importance to U.S. national security as donors in Saudi Arabia continue to constitute a source of funding to Sunni extremist groups worldwide. Available intelligence reflects that the Kingdom remains an important fundraising locale-especially during the Hajj and Ramadan-for the Taliban, LeT, and other terrorist groups based in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The MOI remains almost completely dependent on the CIA to provide analytic support and direction for its counterterrorism operations. As such, our success against terrorist financing in the Kingdom remains directly tied to our ability to provide actionable intelligence to our Saudi counterparts. In order to enhance the USG&apos;s ability to influence and direct Saudi efforts to RIYADH 00000182 003.2 OF 003 disrupt terrorist financing, in 2008 we stood up a Treasury attach office in Embassy Riyadh. This office actively contributes to the daily intelligence sharing process that is led by CIA. 9. (S/NF) TERRORISM FINANCE, CONTINUED: Saudi Arabia has taken increasingly aggressive efforts to disrupt al-Qaida&apos;s access to funding from Saudi sources. An example of recent progress by the KSA is the conviction of over 300 people for involvement in terrorism, including some for providing financial support. News reports suggest that appeals may be opened to the media in order to enhance the deterrent effects of such prosecutions. In addition, Assistant Interior Minister for Security Affairs Mohammed bin Nayif stated that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) deliberately timed its August 19, 2009 press release regarding the arrest of 44 terrorist supporters to deter potential donors from giving money to suspected terrorist groups during Ramadan. Although a great deal of work remains to be done, Mohammed bin Nayif has given his commitment to work with the United States on Taliban finance, and has said that the MOI will arrest individuals involved in Saudi-based Taliban fundraising activities - even if involved in the reconciliation process - when provided with actionable intelligence. 10. (S/NF) IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES: The Saudis have expressed broad support for the President&apos;s strategy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, but often balk when asked to designate an SRAP to coordinate policy with the USG and others. In part, this reflects the centralized Saudi decision-making process and the reality that issues related to Afghanistan and Pakistan policy are not delegated, but rather dealt with directly by the King and members of the intelligence community. While the Saudis are hesitant to delegate authority and tend to make only broad-based commitments to high-profile, multilateral initiatives, they appear ready, willing and eager to share their experiences with us and identify greater opportunities for cooperation on a bilateral basis. Your visit provides an opportunity to further explore how we can best translate our shared goals into action in the unique Saudi context.

Ah, but Sega&apos;s Binary Domain, due out on Xbox 360 and PS3 next year, is being overseen by Toshihiro Nagoshi, the creator of the brilliant and offbeat Yakuza titles. And although the game is about humans battling an invading robot army, Nagoshi claims to be fed up with standard sci-fi blasters. &quot;What I wanted to create this time was a dramatic and energetic sci-fi shooter,&quot; he said recently, in earshot of whoever wrote Sega&apos;s press release. &quot;When you hear sci-fi you may think of cold, clinical environments but with Binary Domain I wanted to combine this with a deep human drama. The keyword we have in mind for this project is &apos;Life&apos;.&quot; Indeed, it seems that there is to be some ontological soul-searching amid the highly strategic battles. As the release continues:  Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peace-keeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they made. Are the robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines?  Hmm, it&apos;s Vanquish meets Bladerunner? Rainbow Six meets Akira?! Interestingly, both Sega and Nagoshi himself are keen to pitch this title at Western audiences, and hope that the theme of humanity wrestling with its own consciousness (as well as with giant battle droids) will have a universal appeal. The sentiment also echoes an ongoing crisis of confidence in the Japanese game design sector where studios are faced with both a declining native market and a global audience that has turned away from Japan&apos;s arcade-inspired titles, toward US mega-brands like Call of Duty, Halo and Grand Theft Auto (developed in the UK, of course, but for a US publisher).  Personally, I&apos;m a little worried about Nagoshi&apos;s leap into the Tokyo of 2080ad. What makes the Yakuza series so vibrant and enjoyable is the games&apos; side-quests and cultural meanderings, the strip tease joints and karaoke bars, the lively rendering of Shinjuku nightlife.

VFM Chun on Sino-North Korean Relations... ------------------------------------------ 2. (S) During a February 17 lunch hosted by Ambassador Stephens that covered other topics (septel), ROK Vice Foreign Minister and former ROK Six-Party Talks (6PT) Head of Delegation Chun Yung-woo predicted that China would not be able to stop North Korea&apos;s collapse following the death of Kim Jong-il (KJI). The DPRK, Chun said, had already collapsed economically; following the death of KJI, North Korea would collapse politically in &quot;two to three years.&quot; Chun dismissed ROK media reports that Chinese companies had agreed to pump 10 billion USD into the North&apos;s economy; there was &quot;no substance&quot; to the reports, he said. The VFM also ridiculed the Chinese foreign ministry&apos;s &quot;briefing&quot; to the ROK embassy in Beijing on Wang Jiarui&apos;s visit to North Korea; the unidentified briefer had &quot;basically read a Xinhua press release,&quot; Chun groused, adding that the PRC interlocutor had been unwilling to answer simple questions like whether Wang had flown to Hamhung or taken a train there to meet KJI. 3. (S) The VFM commented that China had far less influence on North Korea &quot;than most people believe.&quot; Beijing had &quot;no will&quot; to use its economic leverage to force a change in Pyongyang&apos;s policies and the DPRK leadership &quot;knows it.&quot; Chun acknowledged that the Chinese genuinely wanted a denuclearized North Korea, but the PRC was also content with the status quo. Unless China pushed North Korea to the &quot;brink of collapse,&quot; the DPRK would likely continue to refuse to take meaningful steps on denuclearization. XXXXXXXXXXXX ----------------------------------------- 4. (S) Turning to the Six Party Talks, Chun said it was &quot;a very bad thing&quot; that Wu Dawei had retained his position as chief of the PRC&apos;s delegation. XXXXXXXXXXXX said it appeared that the DPRK &quot;must have lobbied extremely hard&quot; for the now-retired Wu to stay on as China&apos;s 6PT chief. [NAME REMOVED] complained that Wu is the PRC&apos;s XXXXXXXXXXXX an arrogant, Marx-spouting former Red Guard who &quot;knows nothing about North Korea, nothing about nonproliferation and is hard to communicate with because he doesn&apos;t speak English.&quot; Wu was also a hardline nationalist, loudly proclaiming -- to anyone willing to listen -- that the PRC&apos;s economic rise represented a &quot;return to normalcy&quot; with China as a great world power. ...China&apos;s &quot;New Generation&quot; of Korea-Hands... --------------------------------------------- 5. (S) Sophisticated Chinese officials XXXXXXXXXXXX stood in sharp contrast to Wu, according to VFM Chun.XXXXXXXXXXXX Chun claimed XXXXXXXXXX believed Korea should be unified under ROK control.XXXXXXXXXXXX, Chun said, were ready to &quot;face the new reality&quot; that the DPRK now had little value to China as a buffer state -- a view that since North Korea&apos;s 2006 nuclear test had reportedly gained traction among senior PRC leaders. ...PRC Actions In A DPRK Collapse Scenario... --------------------------------------------- 6. (S) Chun argued that, in the event of a North Korean collapse, China would clearly &quot;not welcome&quot; any U.S. military presence north of the DMZ. XXXXXXXXXXXX Chun XXXXXXXXXXXX said the PRC would be comfortable with a reunified Korea controlled by Seoul and anchored to the United States in a &quot;benign alliance&quot; -- as long as Korea was not hostile towards China. Tremendous trade and labor-export opportunities for Chinese companies, Chun said, would also help salve PRC concerns about living with a reunified Korea. Chundismissed the prospect of a possible PRC military intervention in the event of a DPRK collapse, noting that China&apos;s strategic economic interests now lie with the United States, Japan, and South Korea -- not North Korea. Moreover, Chun argued, bare-knuckle PRC military intervention in a DPRK internal crisis could &quot;strengthen the centrifugal forces in China&apos;s minority areas.&quot; ...and Japan ------------ 7. (S) Chun acknowledged the Ambassador&apos;s point that a strong ROK-Japan relationship would help Tokyo accept a reunified Korean Peninsula under Seoul&apos;s control. Chun asserted that, even though &quot;Japan&apos;s preference&quot; was to keep Korea divided, Tokyo lacked the leverage to stop reunification in the event the DPRK collapses.

The list of transgressions ranges from the obvious (cranking up the volume on an iPod) to the more idiosyncratic (turning a wet umbrella into a makeshift nine-iron for a spot of golf swing practice). A personal favourite shows a cartoon rendering of a &quot;tired and emotional&quot; salaryman, sprawled across several seats, his head resting on his briefcase. That image will strike a chord with many Tokyo travellers as Japan gears up for the bonenkai \u2013 forget-the-year party \u2013 season, when groups of office workers spill out of restaurants and on to the underground.

As she discusses her\u00a0new movie Somewhere, her first for four years, she is so level, so calm, with a gently modulated voice and that very American kind of untroubled socio-conversational gyroscope that stays on an absolute horizontal, imperceptibly humming through the conversation. Famously the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, she already has an impressive body of work: The\u00a0Virgin Suicides (1999), Lost in Translation (2003) and Marie-Antoinette (2006). It was very much the second feature, a quirkily platonic, Tokyo-set romantic friendship between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, which catapulted her into the big league, and established the Coppola name as a directing dynasty, in the way that Iran&apos;s Samira Makhmalbaf carried on the reputation of her father, Mohsen. Her private life has not been without trouble: she married Spike Jonze in 1999; they were divorced four years later. Her partner now, with whom she has two children, is French musician Thomas Mars, frontman of the band Phoenix. Her films, however, do appear to remind us more pointedly of that other important man in her life: her\u00a0father. This fourth film tells the story of a feckless, pampered movie star, Johnny Marco (played by Stephen Dorff) as he lives a luxurious, meaningless life in the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles; drifting as if on an inflatable in a Hockneyesque pool. Frequently boozing and womanising, he is still often unhappily alone and, like a teenager in his bedroom, sometimes gets called down by the grownups to do publicity events for his latest action movie. In career and personal terms, he is on the verge of stagnation, but his life gets turned around when he has to look after Cleo (played by Elle Fanning), his 11-year-old daughter from a failed relationship. When I meet Coppola during the Venice film festival, in a shady garden on the Lido, her untroubled gaze and easy, musical tone unmistakably reproduce the authorial tone of the film; she has a gentle, lilting tendency to uptalk and a semi-articulacy, like a super-intelligent version of Valley-Girl speak. She is unjudging, pleasant, almost withdrawn, although cheerfully confesses to having a brain like &quot;jelly&quot; having gone through hour upon hour of interviews before I showed up. I ask if doing things like this \u2013 exactly the kind of publicity junket experiences that she coleslaws together into ironic montages \u2013 feels like being inside her own film. Coppola smiles and laughs a little quizzically, as if at an unfamiliar thought: throughout our conversation she affects to be surprised, albeit in the mildest possible way, by what seem to me the most screamingly obvious things. &quot;Well, when I was watching the movie, I felt I was . . . in the movie!&quot; she finally concedes, gently amused. The other side of celebrity Coppola says that she wanted to make a film about celebrity and its alienated, alienating effects, because she had been\u00a0away from the US, where the celeb cult is at its strongest. &quot;I don&apos;t feel\u00a0it, because I&apos;m not in public so much,&quot; she says, &quot;so it&apos;s not something\u00a0that I experience personally. There are all these problems in the press with all these actors having this party lifestyle . . .&quot; She continues: &quot;I was living in Paris, and I was taking some time off after my daughter was born, and sometimes people would come over and bring these tabloids from the US. It&apos;s not around in Paris, the way it is in America, this crazy obsession with celebrity, all these reality shows. I wanted to do something about this moment in our culture.&quot; Coppola adds that her film is not a satire, as such: &quot;I wanted to be empathetic and not judgmental, not putting over a big message, but more thinking about what&apos;s on the other side of all this?&quot; And how does she think Los Angeles comes across in the film? For example, that title, is it an allusion to Gertrude Stein&apos;s remark about Oakland, California: &quot;There is no &apos;there&apos;, there.&quot;? Coppola laughs, but says no. The title is inspired by the pop art paintings of Ed Ruscha, who produces billboard-style images of single words. Coppola now lives in New York, and has perhaps an east coast detachment from California.&quot;There are parts of it that I hate,&quot; she shrugs, &quot;all the strip malls; but there are nice parts. I lived in Los Angeles throughout my 20s; there wasn&apos;t the same tabloid culture when I was there. Being famous now seems like a realistic goal for everybody. Everybody wants to be famous.&quot; Meeting Castro with dad I move the discussion on to the father-daughter relationship in Somewhere, and how it echoes the quasi-father-daughter relationship in Lost in Translation. How was it, making what was surely an obviously autobiographical movie? The question appears to disconcert Coppola, as if it had not occurred to her. For a moment I felt like the man in the Monty Python\u00a0sketch who says to Mr\u00a0Smoke-Too-Much that he must get jokes about his name all the time, and Mr Smoke-Too-Much replies that no one has ever done so before. &quot;Is this psychoanalysis?&quot; she asks, smilingly. &quot;Well, I didn&apos;t think about that. The father relationship is an important relationship for girls and it figures in my work.&quot; But is hanging out with her dad in hotels something that Sofia Coppola used to do, like Cleo in Somewhere? &quot;I definitely put a lot of memories of being around that age \u2013 from kid to teenager \u2013 and travelling with my dad, being in hotels and being in this adult world. He took us to places that kids don&apos;t usually go. For example, when I was 16, we went to Cuba and met Fidel Castro. We went to Las Vegas and Reno. He usually wrote scripts in hotels there and I went with him. It&apos;s your first important relationship as a girl and it shapes you, growing up; I wanted to show the importance of that\u00a0relationship.&quot; And did her father have any advice or input into the work she did on Somewhere? Coppola nods. &quot;I showed the final cut to him \u2013 I didn&apos;t want to show the film to him before it was finished. I was happy that he really appreciated it. He told me that it felt like a movie that only I could have made. I used to show him rough cuts and get his advice. But now I have got more experience.&quot; She says that the film-maker who inspires her most now is Gus van Sant \u2013 from whom she has taken ideas and also, importantly, the cinematographer Harris Savides, who works with Van Sant a good deal. Certainly, Coppola may be her father&apos;s daughter in terms of confidence, but her film-making language has evolved a long way away from his; unlike a raft of male directors who have, consciously or not, imbibed his influence. Somewhere may come to be seen as a minor, self-indulgent part of her body of work: an autobiographical jeu d&apos;esprit, a mood piece, a movie conceived within a luxury hotel \u2013 a B-side to Lost in Translation that traces the charmed circle of celebrity without looking too deeply at what is within it. But Coppola Sr is right. It could only have been made by her, and she is a distinctive individual film-making voice. In person, Coppola\u00a0is charming,\u00a0if disconcerting. As our conversation ended, and I was ushered away by her PR, that easy smile\u00a0remained unchanged, its sphinxish reserve unchallenged."}, {"sentences": ["(C) Amano expects instructions from Tokyo &quot;very shortly&quot; to hand off to current Japanese DCM Nakane, who will take over formally as Ambassador.", "After a short congratulatory visit to Tokyo next week, Amano will stay in Vienna until the September GC approves his appointment; he does not expect any trouble on that score but will remain here &quot;just in case.&quot; Following the General Conference, he will go back to Tokyo and return to Vienna in early November for the transition.", "Amano will use his celebratory reception in Tokyo next week to lobby senior policy-makers (to include PM Aso), capitalizing on the &quot;extremely positive&quot; reaction to his election (with more than 2.3 million entries and growing on Yahoo.)"], "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "World news", "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)", "United Nations", "Iran", "Nuclear weapons"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-02T20:45:43Z", "title": "US embassy cables: UN nuclear chief promises to take a low-profile role on Iran", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/216128", "article": "Friday, 10 July 2009, 15:41C O N F I D E N T I A L UNVIE VIENNA 000331 SIPDIS FOR D(S), P, T, S/SANAC, IO, AND ISN DOE FOR NA-20, NA-24, NA-25, NE-1, NE-6 NRC FOR OIP DOANE, HENDERSON, SCHWARTZMAN NSC STAFF FOR SCHEINMAN, CONNERY EO 12958 DECL: 07/09/2019 TAGS AORC, KNNP, IAEA, TRGY, JA, IR SUBJECT: IAEA/DG: AMANO SKETCHES AMBITIOUS TRANSITION AGENDA REF: A) UNVIE 322 AND PREVIOUS B) UNVIE 321Classified By: CDA GEOFFREY R. PYATT FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D Summary --------- 1. (C) IAEA Director General-designate Yukiya Amano expressed gratitude for U.S. support during a July 9 congratulatory lunch and engaged Charge in a wide-ranging discussion of senior personnel, budget and compliance issues. Amano attributed his election to support from the U.S., Australia and France, and cited U.S. intervention with Argentina as particularly decisive. The Japanese Mission has set up a small transition team to quietly interface with the IAEA and Amano plans to stay in Vienna through the September IAEA General Conference, though he will shortly hand off his Ambassadorial functions to DCM Takeshi Nakane. Speaking as DG-designate, Amano supported a reasonable budget increase (supplemented by voluntary funding from the G-8) and saw the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) as the main priority, along with establishing the principle of regular budget funding for nuclear security. He agreed to speak to &quot;zero growth hawks&quot; France and Germany in his new capacity, urging flexibility. Amano shared his expectations for senior personnel/ Deputy Director General positions and strongly advised the U.S. to not/not relinquish the Management DDG slot for the less influential Safety DDG position; he also offered a senior nuclear security post to the U.S. While Safeguards DDG Heinonen would remain at least a year, Amano was contemplating eventual replacements, recognizing that Heinonen would not &quot;stay forever.&quot; Amano was also considering a possible role (undefined) for his former opponent, South African Governor Minty. Asked about DG term limits, Amano reiterated his campaign commitment but was cautious about the timing of such an initiative, fearing that the G-77 might link this to DDG appointments. 2. (C) Citing high-level U.S. interest, Amano identified nuclear security as his highest priority and was already planning IAEA participation in the March Nuclear Security Summit. He also recognized the need to highlight G-77 priorities such as technical cooperation. Overall, however, Amano&apos;s emphasis is clearly on verification and security issues. He distinguished his approach on Iran from that of ElBaradei; Amano sees the DG/IAEA as a neutral and impartial party to Iran&apos;s safeguards agreement rather than as &quot;an intermediary&quot; and saw his primary role as implementing safeguards and UNSC/Board resolutions. He stressed that the IAEA could not replace the P5 1 political framework for dialogue with Iran, nor vice versa. End Summary. Transition Planning ------------------- 3. (C) Japan has set up a three-person transition team within its Vienna Mission to interact with the IAEA Secretariat (they will do so quietly prior to General Conference approval of the Board&apos;s appointment of Amano.) Meeting with Amano July 8, DG ElBaradei was receptive and designated EXPO Director Vilmos Cserveny as the IAEA point-of-contact for the Amano transition team. Separately, we learned that at a July 10 senior staff meeting DG ElBaradei encouraged all to rally around Amano, reportedly saying that &quot;whatever you thought of Amano as a candidate, this is now about the institution.&quot; 4. (C) Amano expects instructions from Tokyo &quot;very shortly&quot; to hand off to current Japanese DCM Nakane, who will take over formally as Ambassador. After a short congratulatory visit to Tokyo next week, Amano will stay in Vienna until the September GC approves his appointment; he does not expect any trouble on that score but will remain here &quot;just in case.&quot; Following the General Conference, he will go back to Tokyo and return to Vienna in early November for the transition. Election Post-Mortem -------------------- 5. (C) Amano attributed his election to the very strong support he had received from the United States, Australia and France. While Australia was an early proponent, France was instrumental in securing the support of EU Board members with the exception of Spain. Grateful for U.S. efforts, Amano twice cited, in particular, our crucial influence on Argentina&apos;s fifth-round abstention, for which FM Nakasone had also personally thanked the Secretary. 6. (C) Amano admitted some unease that Japan can only authoritatively identify 10 of the 12 countries that voted for Minty in the first three head-to-head ballots July 2, and is not sure whether the two unknown countries made their decision at a national level or by the Governors in Vienna; Japan has not been able to identify any discrepancies between positions in capital and Vienna that could help identify the two &quot;betrayals.&quot; (Note: Based on discussions with the Japan Mission, they suspect Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, but will never know for sure. We counted Malaysia in Minty&apos;s camp. Saudi Arabia was one of only two Board members that did not deliver a congratulatory statement during the Appointment Stage July 3, the other being Albania which associated with the EU statement. End Note.) Recounting Japan&apos;s expectations between the July 2 vote and July 3 appointment, Amano now claims that Japan was fairly confident that rumors of a challenge in the Appointment Stage would not materialize. Japan had confirmed with the Secretariat that there would have been a vote by simple majority (which Japan would assuredly have won) on the question of holding an additional vote to confirm the two-thirds result during the Appointment Stage. Rather than entertain the ultimately unfounded rumors, Japan simply demarched Board capitals (i.e. Minty supporters) July 2 to deliver congratulatory messages during the Appointment Stage, a tactic that resulted in unified statements of support for the DG-designate. Budget ------ 7. (C) Charge assured Amano that the United States would do everything possible to support his successful tenure as Director General and, to that end, anticipated that continued U.S. voluntary contributions to the IAEA would be forthcoming. He also stressed the need to bring budget negotiations to a close as soon as possible. Asked for his views in his capacity as Director General-designate (rather than a national capacity), Amano offered that a &quot;reasonable increase&quot; in the regular budget would be helpful, but that the current proposal would not command consensus. A compromise at a &quot;little lower&quot; level (five to six percent), could be complemented with voluntary funding. Amano lamented that this year&apos;s G-8 did not produce a budget consensus and suggested that the G-8 could be a source of extra-budget support for IAEA nonproliferation programs and peaceful use, comparing the relatively small amounts involved to the 20 billion USD the G8 raised for Nuclear Threat Reduction. He added that Japan could help influence the sherpas in this regard, noting that we would have time to better prepare for the 2010 G-8 Summit. 8. (C) Among IAEA budget priorities, Amano cited funding for Seibersdorf/ Safeguards Analytical Laboratory (SAL) as the most important, in addition to establishing &quot;the principle&quot; of regular budget funding for nuclear security. He had already met with the Austrian Ambassador to solicit host-country support for SAL. Importantly, Amano also agreed to the Charge&apos;s suggestion that he speak to budget hawks France and Germany on these points in his DG-designate capacity, stressing that agreement on the budget would be helpful to starting his tenure on sound footing. 9. (C) It was apparent that Amano had more work to do to lock down the presumed Japanese &quot;dowry&quot; (ref b) to the IAEA following his election; he would not identify a specific amount, even in confidence. Japanese Msnoff noted that he was trying to get a first installment of 2.4 million USD in unused extra-budget contributions to the IAEA released for this purpose. Amano will use his celebratory reception in Tokyo next week to lobby senior policy-makers (to include PM Aso), capitalizing on the &quot;extremely positive&quot; reaction to his election (with more than 2.3 million entries and growing on Yahoo.) He plans to underscore that all international organizations are not equal and Japan should accord priority to the IAEA, and secondly that his success as Director General would be synonymous with the success of Japanese diplomacy. DDGs/Senior Staff: Keep Management DDG Slot -------------------------------------------- 10. (C) Turning to the most immediate order of business for the DG-designate, Amano shared his expectations with respect to Deputy Director General and senior staff positions. His first point was that Russia insists on keeping the Nuclear Energy DDG position. Amano solicited U.S. views with respect to retaining the Management DDG position, and strongly advised doing so, stressing that once ceded the U.S. could &quot;never&quot; expect to get it back, as there were lots of takers waiting in the wings. He noted that he was comfortable working with the current American incumbent DDG but open to considering anyone else the U.S. might propose. Recounting an earlier discussion with former Ambassador Schulte, Amano noted that the Safety and Security DDG position would be a poor substitute and nowhere near as influential across the board as Management. Current Japanese DDG for Safety Taniguchi would stay on for several months until the end of his contract (summer 2010); Amano did not speculate on successors, only that the position would certainly not/not go to a developing country. Rather than Safety DDG, Amano offered the U.S. a senior position that does &quot;real work&quot; in Nuclear Security, recognizing this as a U.S. priority. 11. (C) With respect to Safeguards, he expected that DDG Heinonen would stay for at least another year, and while welcome to stay as long as possible, Amano recognized that this would not &quot;be forever&quot; and had started thinking about possible successors. While Operations C Director Nackaerts &quot;was not bad,&quot; Amano also had a couple of good outsiders in mind (he intimated they were Northern European or Nordic but did not name individuals.) Msnoff noted that while Safeguards &quot;insiders&quot; might have institutional knowledge, they also have &quot;baggage&quot; particularly on Iran. Amano did not opine on other DDG slots, Nuclear Applications and TC, but Charge noted the need to shake up the TC Department and modernize its assistance philosophy. (Note: The TC DDG position was traditionally a G-77 slot and there are rumors that Asia Division Director Dazhu Yang (China) might be considered to replace Cetto. Nuclear Applications could be another possible G-77 slot. End Note.) 12. (C) Among other senior positions, Amano underlined that XXXXXXXXXXXX &quot;was out&quot; and that he sought a good replacement who was closer to his own line of thinking. The UK had already approached Amano about the DG&apos;s Scientific Advisor Graham Andrew, who enjoyed a very good reputation and Amano was happy to retain. (Comment: We wholly agree with Amano&apos;s assessment of these two advisors and see these decisions as positive first signs. End comment.) A Role for Minty ---------------- 13. (C) Amano also shared that he had spoken to South African Governor Minty about continuing to be involved in the IAEA. He did not specify in what capacity but asked for Minty&apos;s cooperation (to which Minty agreed), saying he was prepared to work with him. (Comment: It was clear that Amano would like to carve out a role for Minty, as a symbolic gesture and in a further effort to unify the IAEA behind his Director General-ship. While we would not expect Minty to be interested in a DDG slot such as Technical Cooperation, he could be involved in any future IAEA role in FMCT verification, for example. End Comment.) Setting Priorities ------------------ 14. (C) Amano underscored that nuclear security would be his highest immediate priority. He planned to attend the March Nuclear Security Summit and had already summoned DDG Taniguchi to discuss plans for IAEA participation. Coupled with this emphasis on nuclear security, Amano also recognized the need for a sop to the developing world that would be of equal stature, but was still thinking about what that might be. He noted that he was taking pains to stress the importance of technical cooperation as a developing country priority. Amano liked to refer to the Statute&apos;s dual emphasis on non-proliferation and peaceful use rather than to &quot;balance&quot; among &quot;three pillars,&quot; remarking that the more pillars you have the more you dilute non-proliferation. 15. (C) In a separate conversation, we learned from Israeli Ambassador Michaeli that he had consulted with Amano immediately after his appointment and was fully confident of the priority Amano accords verification issues. Michaeli understood that Amano had to persuade those who did not support him about his &quot;impartiality&quot; and had read Amano&apos;s remark to the press soon after his appointment -- that there was no evidence of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapons capability -- in that context (and did not ascribe any weight to it.) Amano had already agreed to consultations with the Director General of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission on the margins of the General Conference. 16. (C) Amano inquired about U.S. expectations on the fuel assurance issue. He indicated that this issue might take more time than we think and may require a change in method, but did not provide specifics. Amano listened instead to Charge&apos;s explanation of U.S. views, including our preference for the Russian eligibility criteria, and remarked rhetorically, &quot;How may fuel banks do we need ?&quot; Iran ----- 17. (C) Asked about the Director General&apos;s role with respect to Iran, Amano distinguished his approach from that of ElBaradei. For Amano, the IAEA is first and foremost one of two parties to the IAEA-Iran Safeguards Agreement. As a party, the IAEA cannot also play the role of intermediary without there being a conflict of interest. He noted that when ElBaradei was accommodating, Iran welcomed him as an intermediary, but was furious with him when he was not. Amano had no such confusion over his (the IAEA&apos;s) role as one who implements safeguards, including clarification of past activities, and responsibilities deriving from UNSC/Board resolutions. How far safeguards can be implemented depends on Iran (the other party to the agreement), but among the &quot;must-do&apos;s&quot; are implementation of Code 3.1 modified and the Additional Protocol. Amano added that the IAEA role with respect to UNSC requirements for suspension of enrichment activities was limited. This was more a question for the political (P5 1) dialogue with Iran. He stressed that the IAEA cannot substitute itself or this dialogue nor vice versa. 18. (C) Overall, Amano would position himself as Director General neither as &quot;tough&quot; nor &quot;soft&quot; on Iran but as a neutral, impartial and professional party to the safeguards agreement. Term Limits ----------- 19. (C) Finally, Charge solicited Amano&apos;s views on implementation of term limits for the IAEA Director General, which Japan understands (and shares) as a longstanding U.S. priority for international organizations. Charge indicated that there was discussion of raising term limits at the September Board with a view toward adoption by the General Conference. (Note: To have this included in the GC agenda, a Supplementary Item would need to be requested by August 13, i.e. in advance of any Board discussion. End Note.) Amano reiterated his campaign pledge about not seeking a third term but was not sure about the timing of such an initiative. He preferred that the issue be raised after the new DDG leadership team is in place (i.e. several months into his term), fearing that the G-77/NAM could link the issue of DG term limits to geographic distribution and tenure of DDG positions. Amano would prefer to have a free hand in making these determinations. (Comment: While the G-77/NAM may be more receptive to terms limits in the aftermath of his election, Amano makes a valid point and we would not want to undermine his decision-making authority on DDG slots. The G-77/NAM already linked DG term limits to distribution of senior positions in the March Board discussion of the issue. End Comment.) A Strong Partner ---------------- 20. (C) This meeting, Amano&apos;s first bilateral review since his election, illustrates the very high degree of convergence between his priorities and our own agenda at the IAEA. The coming transition period provides a further window for us to shape Amano&apos;s thinking before his agenda collides with the IAEA Secretariat bureaucracy.

(SBU) In several meetings with USG officials before he departed Vienna at the end of the IAEA General Conference, DG-designate Amano displayed remarkable congruence of views with us on conducting the Agency&apos;s missions in safeguards verification, nuclear security, and promoting peaceful uses of the atom as well as on reforming Agency management. Latest information from the Japanese Mission is that Amano will return to Vienna in late November and occupy an office in the IAEA during his final, intensive preparation to assume office December 1. This report responds directly to instruction ref A. End Summary. DG of All States, But in Agreement with Us ------------------------------------------ 2. (C) In a meeting with Ambassador on the eve of the two-week Board of Governors (BoG) and General Conference (GC) marathon of mid-September, IAEA Director General-designate Yukiya Amano thanked the U.S. for having supported his candidacy and took pains to emphasize his support for U.S. strategic objectives for the Agency. Amano reminded Ambassador on several occasions that he would need to make concessions to the G-77, which correctly required him to be fair-minded and independent, but that he was solidly in the U.S. court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran&apos;s alleged nuclear weapons program. 3. (SBU) Amano shared with Ambassador Davies his public stance on the role of the IAEA and the Agency&apos;s contribution to the global issues of proliferation, security, power, human health and water management. More candidly, Amano noted the importance of maintaining a certain &quot;constructive ambiguity&quot; about his plans, at least until he took over for DG ElBaradei in December. With a bow to the G-77, Amano felt obliged to emphasize the importance of &quot;balance&quot; regarding the Agency&apos;s work in peaceful uses of nuclear technology. For staff morale reasons, Amano planned to work on improving the quality of management while publicly praising the current standards and commending staff members for their dedication. 4. (SBU) In the course of conversation, Amano was careful to highlight the April 12-13 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington as &quot;the biggest event for me in the coming months.&quot; The Summit coming in spring would drive his winter agenda, including events in Davos and the IAEA&apos;s March meeting of the Board of Governors. Again for political considerations, Amano said he would balance visits to the U.S. with trips to South Africa, Egypt and Malaysia. Were he not to secure the cooperation of these countries, Amano felt he would make little progress on top priorities upon taking office. While acknowledging the increasing polarization between IAEA Member States, Amano was quick to point out areas of agreement, such as the need to upgrade the Seibersdorf laboratory complex, promote cancer therapy and safely introduce nuclear power. Amano promised to &quot;treat Iran with dignity,&quot; but followed up firmly with the claim that he had been granted the post of Director General &quot;to implement safeguards.&quot; He emphasized that Iran had specific obligations which the IAEA would enforce; he did not see himself as an intermediary between Iran and the rest of the world. Shaping IAEA Leadership ----------------------- 5. (C) On staffing issues at the Deputy Director General (DDG) level, Amano stressed his pleasure that DDG for Management David Waller had agreed to stay on in his current position. Amano described Waller as &quot;an old friend, an effective manager and a good speaker.&quot; Referring to his long-standing acquaintance with DDG for Safeguards Olli Heinonen, a manager he described as &quot;reliable and professional,&quot; Amano had also planned to retain Heinonen in his current position. He also intended to appoint another Russian to replace DDG for Nuclear Energy Sokolov. Amano noted that DDG for Security and Safety Taniguchi would be leaving during the summer of 2010 (when his contract expired) and said he hoped to identify a &quot;reliable person from a reliable country&quot; to succeed Taniguchi. Amano acknowledged that finding replacements for DDG Cetto (Technical Cooperation) and DDG Burkart (Nuclear Applications) would be trickier, as the jobs were rife with G-77 political considerations and he needed at least one DDG from a developing country. Amano described the complex issue of staffing at the IAEA - from technical expertise to geographical representation and gender balance - as a &quot;jigsaw puzzle.&quot; He planned to appoint only one advisor from Japan, someone who was &quot;not too visible.&quot; (Note: From subsequent USG-GOJ consultations in Tokyo we know the individual in question to be Satoshi Suzuki, whom we expect to serve as Special Assistant to the Director General for Management. End Note.) Holding Agency to Verification Responsibilities, Not Politics ------------------------------ 6. (C) Subsequently, White House WMD Coordinator Gary Samore and NSC Senior Director Laura Holgate met with Amano on September 15 on the margins of the General Conference. Amano noted that he knows everyone will be focused on the March 2010 Board of Governors meeting, his first as the new DG, to see what he does and says about Iran and Syria. He affirmed it was most important for the IAEA to stick strictly to its verification responsibilities and not offer political &quot;proposals&quot; or &quot;negotiations.&quot; Amano said that he would insist Iran to implement fully all Safeguards obligations and extend full cooperation with the IAEA, although he does not believe Iran will completely change its current position of stalemate. 7. (C) Amano indicated he had begun reaching out to key individuals in the IAEA, seeking their advice on managing tough issues. He said that, in particular, he had spoken to DDG Safeguards Olli Heinonen about whether or not the IAEA needed to change how the Iran and Syria reports were written. Amano also reaffirmed to Dr. Samore that he plans to keep DDG Management David Waller and Heinonen in their current positions, especially as it is important to maintain some level of consistency and continuity with the turnover of a new DG. 8. (C) Amano echoed these themes in a September 16 meeting with U.S. NPT Special Representative Susan Burk. Citing his own election, Amano noted warmly that &quot;if you are determined, the U.S. can do anything!&quot;, and he hoped the U.S. also be a driving force in the NPT Revcon. Asked about the need for increased IAEA authorities, Amano affirmed his commitment to keep pushing on the Additional Protocol. He also argued for greater work on the back end of the fuel cycle, suggesting that it would be useful to develop something analogous to the IAEA multilateral fuel assurances arrangement that deals with waste issues while reassuring developing countries that &quot;it&apos;s not just about new restrictions to be imposed.&quot; Winning &apos;em over, gradually --------------------------- 9. (SBU) Comment: By the time he departed Vienna with the GC&apos;s confirmation of his appointment, Amano appeared comfortable in his &quot;Director General&quot; shoes. He speaks with increasing confidence and clarity, having mastered his talking points and grown accustomed to his new title. Apprehensions linger among IAEA staff and diplomatic missions regarding his communications and leadership abilities, but with his performance during the GC he made progress in winning over skeptics. His wisdom in downplaying Japanese visibility among his senior advisors will also assuage staff fears that Amano would subvert the Agency with a Japanese corporate management style. On a grander stage, Amano&apos;s global political savvy was clearly in evidence, and his willingness to speak candidly with U.S. interlocutors on his strategy and various balancing acts bodes well for our future relationship. For example, his description of President Obama&apos;s Nuclear Security Summit as the biggest event of his early tenure was a deliberate and gratifying gesture. 10.

If successful, the shows could be spun into a world tour. &quot;I thought [it] would be great to sing and dance with the people who were around Michael, especially his family,&quot; AI explained to CNNgo. The 29-year-old is a huge star in Japan: her latest album features cameos by Snoop Dogg, Boyz II Men and K&apos;Naan. However, AI is not just set to perform with the Jacksons at the tribute show \u2013 she is also scheduled to record new songs with them in early 2011. &quot;We haven&apos;t talked about the kind of song yet, whether it will be for Michael or about us,&quot; AI said, &quot;but we think it will be nice to have one of the producers that Michael used to work with.&quot; This isn&apos;t the first time the Jacksons have planned a tribute concert. Shortly after Michael&apos;s death, an event was proposed for late August 2009 \u2013 around what would have been the singer&apos;s 51st birthday. The show, suggested for the O2 arena, never materialised. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to rush [it],&quot; sources said at the time. Shortly afterwards, Jermaine Jackson announced a massive concert in Vienna, with scheduled performances by Akon, Mary J Blige and Natalie Cole. This was cancelled less than a month later. Instead, Jermaine claimed, the Jacksons were planning a concert at Wembley stadium in June 2010. This also failed to materialise. Given this unreliable precedent, it is perhaps unsurprising that further details of the Tokyo concerts have yet to emerge. No venue has been announced, nor has a promoter come forward. The Japanese channel Music On TV is speculated \u2013 but not confirmed \u2013 to be involved.

(S) SUMMARY. The Secretary reviewed the status of the US-UAE 123 agreement and additional action the UAE can take to encourage a positive Congressional review. The UAE request for participation in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) is under serious consideration. The Secretary expressed her interest in participating in a GCC plus three meeting in Baghdad in the near future. The UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ) also suggested a GCC plus 3 and P5 plus 1 joint meeting to discuss Iran. AbZ confirmed his intention to participate in the Pakistan Donors conference in Tokyo and expressed concerns about Saudi back peddling. The Secretary thanked the UAE for the positive support for both the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Palestinian Authority. AbZ noted that Qatar wants the Arab League to request a meeting with the Quartet focused on settlements and East Jerusalem. END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------- Nuclear Cooperation and Export Control -------------------------------------- 5. (S) The Secretary expressed the Administration&apos;s commitment to the U.S.-UAE Agreement for Cooperation on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (aka 123 Agreement). She emphasized that our goal is to get the agreement completed as smoothly as possible. AbZ said that he is delighted with the progress on the agreement. He added that the UAE&apos;s goal is to create a gold standard for a nuclear power program. Then, because of the strong commitments the UAE has made, it will be impossible to have improper use of its nuclear facilities. 6. (S) Turning to the need to be prepared to respond to Congress, the Secretary committed to form a State Department committee including H, NEA and ISN to work on the notification. The Secretary noted the importance of implementing the UAE export control law and continued UAE efforts against illicit Iranian trade and Iranian front companies. The Secretary encouraged action on nonproliferation treaty commitments as especially helpful actions the UAE could take to support our efforts. AbZ noted that the UAE would formally join the additional protocol on April 8. 7. (S) AbZ agreed that the August 2007 export control law had some &quot;loopholes&quot; and said that the UAE Cabinet &quot;revisited&quot; the issue last week. Otaiba said that AbZ had personally intervened to ensure timely action. Otaiba elaborated that the committee charged with implementing the export control law will have its first meeting later this month to begin operations. 8. (S) Otaiba noted that, even in the absence of a formal implementation committee, the UAE is taking action - citing a recent case involving German-made Siemens computers and a Chinese ship bound for Iran interdicted in port in the UAE. --------------------- Major Economies Forum --------------------- 9. (S) The Secretary noted UAE interest in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF). While noting that the UAE does not technically meet the criteria for the meeting, based on size of the economy alone, the Secretary said there are many criteria that make it important for the UAE to attend, adding she will make a recommendation for UAE participation as an observer. AbZ said the UAE bid to host the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) headquarters would be very difficult to achieve if the UAE is locked out of the MEF preparatory meeting in Washington and promised &quot;we will remember your help.&quot; ---- Iran ---- 10. (S) The Secretary said the U.S. is looking to see if Iran can be engaged in any productive manner and noted that Special Advisor Ross would travel to the region soon for consultations. AbZ told the Secretary that UAE feels threatened by Iran today, even though Iran does not yet have a nuclear capability. AbZ asserted that the UAE is even more worried about Iranian intentions than is Israel. AbZ encouraged the U.S. to consider a GCC plus 3 and P5 plus 1 joint meeting. ---------------- Iraqi GCC plus 3 ---------------- 11. (S) The Secretary expressed interest in the Iraqi invitations for a GCC plus 3 meeting in Baghdad, at a date to be determined. She noted the value of the GCC plus 3 mechanism not only for furthering Arab engagement with the Iraqi government during a time of transition, but as a way to send a message to Iran that Iraq has broad support in the Arab world. -------------------- Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- 12. (S) The Secretary told AbZ that the U.S. needs help to stem the flow of funds from the Gulf to the Taliban. She noted that one area of potential action is reviving training related to bulk cash smuggling. 13. (S) Thanking the UAE for hosting the Friends of Pakistan preparatory meeting, the Secretary said she hopes AbZ would attend the April donors conference in Tokyo. AbZ confirmed that he plans to attend and said that the UAE will make a &quot;strong&quot; pledge, but no decision has been made on an exact dollar figure. 14. (S) AbZ express concern over Saudi Arabia&apos;s decision not to make a pledge at the Tokyo conference. AbZ said that the Saudis have never liked the Pakistan Peoples Party, and support Nawaz Sharif. In addition, AbZ posited that Saudi Arabia suspects that Zardari is Shia, thus creating Saudi concern of a Shia triangle in the region between Iran, the Maliki government in Iraq, and Pakistan under Zardari. Feltman noted a pattern of Saudi behavior of withholding financial assistance - not supporting March 14 in Lebanon, not sending funds to the PA, and not planning a pledge for Pakistan. Otaiba added that Saudi Arabia also failed make a commitment at the G20 meeting. ------- Lebanon ------- 15. (S) The Secretary noted the need to support Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in the run up to the elections with concrete displays of support. Feltman added that the UAE had been particularly helpful already by funding the delivery of the first ten refurbished tanks for the LAF. AbZ noted that he would meet with visiting Lebanese Minister of Defense Murr later on April 7. AbZ said the UAE will purchase additional munitions for LAF helicopters, donated by the UAE to LAF last year, but is waiting for France to provide a price estimate. ------------------------- Middle East Peace Process ------------------------- 16. (S) The Secretary thanked the UAE for its strong financial support for the Palestinian Authority (PA). The Secretary asked if AbZ had an update on the status of Palestinian unity talks. Acknowledging that Hamas and Fatah are not coming to an agreement, AbZ replied with a smile that things are &quot;going well.&quot; 17. (S) AbZ said that in addition to financial support for the PA it is important that the new Israeli government reach out to President Abbas. AbZ said that the Secretary should expect the Qatari Prime Minister to request an Arab League meeting with the Quartet focused on settlements and East Jerusalem. AbZ said the Quartet will need to use the same standards for the new Israel government as already applied to the Palestinians regarding respecting previous agreements. The Secretary agreed. AbZ said that it is important to create a road map of Israeli and Palestinian actions towards an end game. The Secretary agreed on the importance of simultaneous reinforcing actions in support of negotiations. AbZ said that the UAE candidacy to host IRENA could yield political benefits, if successful. Israel is already a signatory to the agreement, so it would have a representative IRENA mission in Abu Dhabi should the UAE be chosen to host headquarters.

It&apos;s a unique picture of US diplomatic language - including over 50,000 documents covering the current Obama administration. But what does the data include?     Wikileaks cables: word count of the stories so far. Graphic: Mark McCormick    The cables themselves come via the huge Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet. SIPRNet is the worldwide US military internet system, kept separate from the ordinary civilian internet and run by the Department of Defense in Washington. Since the attacks of September 2001, there has been a move in the US to link up archives of government information, in the hope that key intelligence no longer gets trapped in information silos or &quot;stovepipes&quot;. An increasing number of US embassies have become linked to SIPRNet over the past decade, so that military and diplomatic information can be shared. By 2002, 125 embassies were on SIPRNet: by 2005, the number had risen to 180, and by now the vast majority of US missions worldwide are linked to the system - which is why the bulk of these cables are from 2008 and 2009. An embassy dispatch marked SIPDIS is automatically downloaded on to its embassy classified website. From there, it can be accessed not only by anyone in the state department, but also by anyone in the US military who has a security clearance up to the &apos;Secret&apos; level, a password, and a computer connected to SIPRNet - which astonishingly covers over 3m people. There are several layers of data in here - ranging up to the &quot;SECRET NOFORN&quot; level, which means that they are designed never be shown to non-US citizens. Instead, they are supposed to be read by officials in Washington up to the level of current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The cables are normally drafted by the local ambassador or subordinates. The &quot;Top Secret&quot; and above foreign intelligence documents cannot be accessed from SIPRNet.      We&apos;ve broken down the data for you - and you can download the basic details of every cable (without the actual content) below. Each cable is essentially very structured data.

There was also another of day of tube strikes. Not, then, the most fortuitous of weeks to launch a game based on London&apos;s public transport system \u2013 but that&apos;s what the team behind Chromaroma has done. Developed by production studio Mudlark \u2013 creators of the RSC&apos;s Twitterised Romeo and Juliet project Such Tweet Sorrow \u2013 the objective is to reveal the hidden joy of a well-planned detour, luckily timed connection or surprise discovery. Players sign up using their Oyster card login and then every tube, bus and Boris bike journey automatically adds points to their score. As one of four teams, players earn extra points by exploring alternative routes, getting a little exercise by getting off a stop early or undertaking a &quot;psychogeographic&quot; mission \u2013 like trying to find the &quot;Faceless Woman&quot; at Becontree between 11pm and 1am. Chromaroma has been in production for twelve months, so would it have been better to launch in a week that wasn&apos;t so disastrous for public transport? &quot;Yes!&quot; chuckles Mudlark managing director Toby Barnes. &quot;It would definitely have been easier. But in the future we&apos;ll definitely reward people for making an effort, so it&apos;ll be about awards for being polite and helpful.&quot; Chromaroma&apos;s appeal lies in a combination of plotting our real-world movements on mesmerising moving maps, the charm of exploring and discovering new parts of the city, and competitiveness: can you get from Victoria to King&apos;s Cross faster than your friends? Barnes said the team could have built a check-in game for the iPhone rather than using real-world data they had persuaded TFL to share, &quot;but that would basically be Foursquare,&quot; says Barnes. &quot;The challenge we chose was to do things the hard way, to create something you don&apos;t necessarily need a smartphone for.&quot; Barnes speaks with affection for TFL, which he describes as &quot;having its feet in the Victorian age&quot;. He is also a fan of legendary London Underground map designer Harry Beck, whom he wanted to tip a modern hat to with Mudlark&apos;s visualisations of moving travel data. Barnes would eventually like to see Chromaroma go international, with teams in London, Moscow, Paris and Tokyo competing through their transport networks. In the meantime the spike in public transport users for the 2012 Olympics looks like a tasty opportunity. The concept of &quot;gameification&quot; \u2013 applying game dynamics such as points and rewards to marketing, education or anything else \u2013 has become increasingly mainstream, as have games like Farmville and Angry Birds, attracting new audiences of casual gamers. Alice Taylor, commissioning editor for Channel 4 Education \u2013 and a committed games geek \u2013 says there is a real benefit in game structures being applied to mundane tasks. &quot;Any repetitive chore could probably benefit from gamification to some degree. The EpicWin iPhone app does it for household duties. It could be applied to dieting or homework. &quot;Chromaroma takes something boring \u2013 commuting \u2013 and makes it more playful, more interesting, more surprising. With quests, a player might discover areas of a town she never visited before, so with the right kind of design applied, that means beneficial new experiences. &quot;Where gameification gets scary is when it&apos;s misapplied or misused ... [such as] &apos;You&apos;re a level 10 smoker!&apos; or &apos;Congratulations, you unlocked the 100 Big Macs badge!&apos;. There will be plenty of that ... and it&apos;ll be level 20 infuriating.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo that bandage came off completely against Buster Douglas, a\u00a0fighter who had gone down, like the 37 before him, but who somehow, that night, got back up."], "tags": ["Mike Tyson", "Boxing"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-05T00:04:01Z", "title": "Mike Tyson interview: The iron man melts", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/05/mike-tyson-interview", "article": "Today is one of The Champ&apos;s good days: the limo, the entourage, friendly cameras pointing at him, some decent money to be made, and, when the work is done, his family, ensconced in a super-luxury hotel suite, to come back to. Mike Tyson is back home today in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York. For the Animal Planet Network reality TV programme Taking on Tyson, due to air in early 2011, he&apos;s leading a film crew through the good part of his childhood here, the early mornings and long afternoons spent on the rooftops of abandoned Brownsville slums, breeding and flying pigeons. It&apos;s the part of his childhood that ended when he was arrested, aged 12, with $1,500 in his jeans pocket \u2013 his 38th arrest \u2013 and sentenced to Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx. It was the last he would see of Brownsville for years. Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where Tyson is thinking of relocating after a\u00a0quarter of a century in Las Vegas, boxing&apos;s youngest-ever heavyweight champion is devoting much of his retirement to pigeons again \u2013 magpies, tipplers, tumblers. His favourite is the deep roller, a difficult-to-breed bird that, with care and training, will soar to great heights, throw itself into a kamikaze dive, and somersault backward into its plummet to right itself, just in time, to land safely. Or not. The behaviour has never been explained. Brownsville&apos;s once-abandoned buildings can fetch up to half a million dollars these days. The rooftops that once housed Tyson&apos;s pigeon coops now have surveillance cameras, satellite dishes, even gardens. The streets are clean, the bricks of many houses show recent repointing. National chain stores have come to two of the high roads that warren Brownsville&apos;s maze of streets off from adjoining districts. Within those boulevards, Brownsville remained an essentially enclosed ghetto for a\u00a0century, unchanged since Bugsy Siegel&apos;s Murder Incorporated began here in the 1920s. By 1968 it looked like &quot;Berlin after the war&quot; to journalist Jimmy Breslin, reporting on riots that a teachers&apos; strike had brought. It was &quot;block after block of burned-out shells of houses, streets lined with decaying automobile hulks&quot;. It looked the same when Lorna Smith Tyson, unable to afford the nearby ghetto of Bedford-Stuyvesant, brought her family here in 1978. The 10-year-old Mike Tyson, near-sighted, fat and asthmatic, took to Brownsville&apos;s rooftops not only for his birds but to avoid the violence at street level, which mystified him, and for which he had no answer but running. The first punch he ever threw was at an older boy who destroyed one of his birds. He&apos;s one of three heavyweight champ-ions to hail from Brownsville.     Mike Tyson in his pigeon coop in 1985. Photograph: Manny Millan/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images    Now the only boarded-over doors within blocks of his Amboy Street childhood tenement are of the former 65th Precinct House, the local police station \u2013 a red-brick fortress that the pre-teen Tyson spent far too much time in. A\u00a0half-block of terraced houses stands on what were Amboy Street&apos;s rubble fields, gated by wrought iron enclosing gardens. It&apos;s hardly the area Tyson brought this crew to film. &quot;Nothing here looks like my childhood,&quot; he says out loud. Then to himself, looking down the street: &quot;My whole life must&apos;ve been a lie. Who am I?&quot; A woman comes out of the building behind the TV crew and approaches him. &quot;Are you Mike Tyson?&quot; she asks breathlessly. &quot;Are you white?&quot; he fires back. &quot;One hundred per cent,&quot; she says. The disconnect is starting to make his brain fry. If this woman had come up to a traffic light when I was a kid, she&apos;d have been robbed, raped , left for dead. This is a real strange scenario\u2026 &quot;I just wanted to cry,&quot; Tyson confides the next afternoon, his gaze stretching out to New Jersey&apos;s Absecon Bay and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. The hotel-suite butler has brought grooming products up to Tyson&apos;s 95th-floor eyrie from the lobby of Atlantic City&apos;s Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, and Tyson fingers the bag repeatedly, his eyes making significant contact, then drifting to the view. &quot;I&apos;m standing there, like: Who am I? Where&apos;s my heritage?&quot; The Maori warrior tattoo that adorns the left side of his face creases as Tyson flashes his signature gap-toothed, shy-devil smile and repeats himself: &quot;I just wanted to cry.&quot; Yes, I appreciate the irony of feeling self-estranged that a robbed and raped woman hasn&apos;t been left for dead. That&apos;s what the smile says. But I feel it intensely all the same.  That smile is harder to wrap your mind around in person than on camera. Naked/guarded, vulnerable/fierce, depressed/amused, man/child, it personifies the absurdity of the cruel chaos of the world outside and the cruel chaos inside his head. It lets you know he finds both too hard to handle, and that he&apos;s doing pretty well in them regardless. Today, at least. Today there are real-estate properties and business opportunities to ponder up the Jersey coast, as well as projects coming in for Tyson&apos;s unlikely, media-based second career. That took off with James Toback&apos;s sensitive 2008 documentary Tyson, and even more so with his extended cameo in The Hangover. Both came with Tyson well en route to becoming a recurring sideshow, featuring mostly drug-related arrests. Lennox Lewis, who effectively put an end to Tyson&apos;s career in 2002, called him a\u00a0&quot;train wreck waiting to happen&quot;. By 2008 he was a\u00a0350lb train wreck struggling to pay drug dealers and, as he&apos;s confided, to wipe his bottom: &quot;That&apos;s the hardest thing about being 350 pounds.&quot; He took the Toback project because he thought they could make a few bucks selling bootleg copies in New York&apos;s Times Square. The Hangover came at a similarly hopeless period a year later.     Mike Tyson bites a chunk out of Evander Holyfield's ear. Photograph: Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;This is Mike Tyson&apos;s brain on drugs,&quot; he smiles now of his motives in taking both movies: Tyson got a 10-minute ovation at Cannes in 2008 and won a special jury prize. The Hang-over is the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time. A funny but somewhat meandering film, it vaults to an immediate 10 the moment Tyson suddenly appears. Like Times Square itself \u2013 a formerly destitute strip \u2013 Tyson&apos;s image has had an upgrade. The &quot;Baddest Man on the Planet&quot; is, if not necessarily a good guy, a likeable monster now, no longer the man who told opponents he wanted to eat their children, and actually did bite off a piece of Evander Holyfield. It&apos;s a role that, day to day, he embraces or finds repulsive. In a long afternoon we spend together, Tyson speaks repeatedly of that dualism and of the fractured, almost Manichean either/or that touches everything in his life. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult for me,&quot; he begins, &quot;when people are offering me all that adulation and love. I just feel dirty. People want to take pictures with me, and I don&apos;t know why, I just feel dirty\u2026 I feel like dog food.&quot; Like his plummet, Tyson&apos;s redemption, onscreen and off, has the resonance and the publicness that people cherish in celebrities. His life was one long docudrama, followed by a series of hangovers. &quot;You were always so nakedly out there,&quot; I suggest. &quot;People feel they know you.&quot; &quot;No doubt about it,&quot; he says. &quot;No doubt whatsoever. My life is like a tornado, a hurricane. It&apos;s like I&apos;m a naked tornado that comes through town, and there&apos;s just so much wreckage. There&apos;s so much destruction. And when it&apos;s finally over it&apos;s like the morning after and you&apos;re sober and \u2013 what the fuck happened here?&quot; &quot;Been there, done \u2013 what?&quot;     Mike Tyson and his third wife Lahika Spicer. Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images    &quot;Boy I know that feeling!&quot; he shouts. &quot;Exactly.&quot; His entourage lounges on white couches, watching the stock-ticker on a financial news channel. Tyson&apos;s third wife, Lakiha Spicer, a\u00a0child on her hip and another at hand, comes over to ask when the butler should serve their vegan lunch, then disappears into the master bedroom of this 1,400sq ft suite. &quot;Nice digs,&quot; I say. &quot;My wife&apos;s lived with me in places I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t take a shit in,&quot; he says. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be a prostitute in some of the places we&apos;ve slept.&quot; I do the maths, or try to. Once on track to become the first billionaire athlete, Tyson was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2003. A\u00a0year earlier, his eighth-round loss to Lewis had netted $106.9m in pay-per-view receipts. That was Tyson&apos;s monster last paycheck, his final chance to regain the heavyweight titles he&apos;d seemed destined to go to his grave with\u2026 Until 1990, when 45-1 underdog Buster Douglas knocked him out in the 10th round in by far the greatest upset in boxing history. After a year of increasingly aberrant behaviour, in the ring and out, a 1992 rape conviction sidelined Tyson for three years of imprisonment. His bid to reunify the heavyweight division ended when Holyfield knocked him out in the 11th round in 1996. In their rematch, seven months later, Tyson bit Holyfield&apos;s ear twice, taking off a chunk the second time. It is four years since his 56th and last fight, a\u00a0sixth-round loss to Irish journeyman Kevin McBride. Tyson variously describes himself as &quot;totally broke,&quot; and &quot;living paycheck to paycheck&quot;. He and Spicer were married roughly a year ago, 10 days after the tragic death of his four-year-old daughter, Exodus, from injuries sustained on a freak exercise-treadmill accident. While reckoning with &quot;astronomical doctor bills&quot;, Tyson later confides, he staged a lavish funeral for Exodus. &quot;It came to\u2026 $200,000? Maybe $150,000 all told?&quot; &quot;How is money?&quot; I ask. &quot;I guess it&apos;s all good,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;I live in a\u00a0nice house, exclusive neighbourhood, but it&apos;s all just insignificant stuff. I&apos;m a vegan now: it&apos;s been like eight months, and my life is just different. I don&apos;t even recognise myself sometimes.&quot; I barely recognise him. He&apos;s shed a good 100lb, down to &quot;fighting weight&quot; again. His skin is luminous, his brow is unfurled, and his eyes have a light that &quot;Iron Mike&apos;s&quot; never had. Those were shark eyes. Eyes that opponents learned not to make contact with in the ring before the opening bell. I ask about a comeback and he laughs. &quot;The man I&apos;ve become?&quot; He shudders. &quot;Baddest Man on the Planet? I\u00a0wasn&apos;t half the man I ever thought I was. I&apos;m a pig. I have this uncanny ability to look at myself in the mirror and say: &apos;This is a pig. You are a fucking piece of shit.&apos; I have an idea who this person is, but\u2026&quot; He bows his head and finishes unintelligibly. &quot;Sounds painful.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he looks up, smiling. &quot;Not at all.&quot; This is a very different smile: straightforward, bright, I&apos;d even say enlightened. &quot;Because I&apos;m being very objective. Objectively, I&apos;m a\u00a0pig. I&apos;m 44, and I realise my whole life is just a\u00a0waste\u2026 I want to transcend.&quot; &quot;To what?&quot; &quot;To I don&apos;t know. Because I only know I&apos;m not supposed to be here. I&apos;m supposed to be in prison for murder. I&apos;m supposed to be dead by now, have Aids or something.&quot; &quot;Never thought you&apos;d make it to 44?&quot;     Down by law: Tyson leaves Marion County Courthouse in Indianapolis on 13 June 1994 after a sentence reduction for his conviction of rape. Photograph: Eugene Garcia/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;I never thought I&apos;d make it to 25, man.&quot; Mike Tyson has tried \u2013 needed \u2013 to regenerate himself twice before. Once, in the isolation cell of Indiana&apos;s Plainfield Correctional Facility, a bandbox of a room in which Tyson spent parts of his 1992-95 incarceration. &quot;Down in the Hole,&quot; Tyson smiles now, recalling the change. &quot;They thought they were punishing me in that little room: no toilet, no bed. I got myself put down there so I could read Chairman Mao and not have to deal with all the prison bullshit.&quot; &quot;What did you learn from Mao?&quot; &quot;&apos;No investigation, no right to speak.&apos; That&apos;s the thing that stuck.&quot; Tyson&apos;s regeneration, a largely intellectual, spiritual one, came from his long self-investigation in the Hole. It led him to the tennis great Arthur Ashe, and his pioneering work in civil rights, and then to\u2026 Che Guevara? &quot;He was just a pussy,&quot; Tyson explains. &quot;If he walked into this room, people would think he&apos;s a wimp. He can&apos;t kick no one&apos;s ass. But his intensity, his tenacity?&quot; Tyson has large images of each of the three men tattooed on his body. Meeting Muhammad Ali after his release from Plainfield, Tyson embraced Islam, a path he sees as one of learning humility. I ask about his faith, and he largely demurs: &quot;I can talk about humility, but I&apos;m not humble. I mean, if you say: &apos;I&apos;m humble&apos;, you&apos;ve contradicted yourself. But I&apos;m trying to be, man,&quot; he says, sounding like the Samuel Jackson of Pulp Fiction. &quot;I&apos;m trying so hard.&quot; He&apos;s far more comfortable talking about Ali, a fighter not normally understood to be so pivotal in Tyson&apos;s life. A much earlier encounter had led to Tyson&apos;s first rebirth. That came at 13, when he was in isolation at the Tryon School for Boys in New York. &quot;A bunch of bad kids no one cared about in a square box&quot; is how Tyson recalls Tryon, where he landed after proving too difficult for Spofford Juvenile. He was so violent and big that two adults and handcuffs were needed to subdue him when his outbursts led to solitary confinement. Ali had come to visit Tryon, and the impression he made on the 13-year-old was deep. From within his isolation cell after a subsequent outburst, Tyson yelled out that he wanted to see Bobby Stewart, a former Golden Gloves champion who had become the school&apos;s boxing coach. It was one of few intelligible sentences Tyson had uttered at Tryon: many there had simply assumed the huge boy was mentally retarded. He wanted to be a boxer. I ask what it was about Ali that resonated. The answer, like so much about Tyson, is surprising. &quot;With all that poetry and the butterflies,&quot; he says, &quot;what I learned from Ali was meanness. He was the meanest fighter of all time. He&apos;d be in there with Foreman, hardest puncher of all time, or Frazier, another hardest puncher, and he&apos;d be taking it: boom, boom, getting pounded. And then he&apos;d turn, when it was his time, and you&apos;d look at that face\u2026&quot; Tyson does a perfect Ali imitation: &quot;&apos;I&apos;m not [throws a punch] scared [another punch] of you, you fucking faggot [punch, punch]. You fucking punk. I&apos;m fucking God, and worship me. I&apos;m the greatest [punch, punch].&apos;&quot; He looks around the room, at my tape recorder. &quot;Don&apos;t write this man,&quot; he says, embarrassed to be talking out of school. Then he shrugs. &quot;Ah, he said all this stuff. Just nobody reported it.&quot; That exact meanness was what the legendary trainer Cus D&apos;Amato first saw when he took Tyson on at 13, eventually adopting him to live in his Catskill mansion in upstate New York. Fans of boxing call it &quot;heart&quot;. D&apos;Amato, who moulded champions such as Floyd Patterson and Rocky Graziano, turning both into latter-day Gentleman Jims, understood the difference. Tyson could channel Boris Karloff or Peter Boyle as the monster. D&apos;Amato, I learn, was his Victor Frankenstein. They were an unlikely match, united mostly in their alienation. D&apos;Amato had largely retired from the fight game, disgusted, he said, by its increasing corruption, but he was also just this side of paranoia \u2013 talking only on payphones, hateful of the US government, to the point of adopting Fidel Castro as his hero. His devotion to Tyson was absolute. By day they trained; at night Tyson did little but watch films of the great boxers. D&apos;Amato had perhaps the greatest library of fight films in existence. &quot;Cus had every last one of them and I\u00a0watched them all, every night,&quot; Tyson says. &quot;They were all so vicious, man. Jake LaMotta, Henry Armstrong, Carmen Basilio, Sugar Ray. God, Sugar Ray was vicious. But Jack Dempsey more than anyone. All these guys let you know they wanted to murder you, and they&apos;d take shots from you, over and over, and over, get beat senseless, just so they could get theirs in. Sugar Ray maybe most of all. But Dempsey? He wanted to maim you. He didn&apos;t want you dead. He wanted you to suffer. He wanted to shatter your eye socket, destroy your cheeks, your chinbone. That&apos;s what I learned from Mr Dempsey, and I believe I learned it well.&quot; &quot;Didn&apos;t you once say: &apos;I don&apos;t aim for a guy&apos;s head. I aim for the back of his head&apos;?&quot; &quot;Actually, I said: &apos;I aim to put it through his head.&apos; Same idea though. It was Bruce Lee who taught his students: aim at a target just behind their head. Yeah, and don&apos;t get me wrong, because I&apos;d never disrespect Bruce. But it wasn&apos;t his fighting that got to me. There was too much showmanship there, even in his real fights. It&apos;s his philosophy, the best ever, off the hook: &apos;You must be like water. The most insignificant substance, but the strongest and most destructive force on the planet.&apos; And the lesson of all that, it&apos;s so deep: you have to be both weak and strong. Strong alone is not enough. You cannot reign if you have not served. If you have not served a king, how can you ever know what it&apos;s like to demand that kind of obeying?&quot; I ask Tyson if D&apos;Amato was the king he obeyed, and quickly see it goes far deeper. D&apos;Amato didn&apos;t rule Tyson. He moulded him, breaking him, over and over, and remoulding. &quot;Day in and day out, as sure as Sunday follows Saturday,&quot; Tyson says. &quot;I&apos;d knock some guy out, and Cus would say: &apos;What&apos;cha doing, man!?&apos; I&apos;d say: &apos;Cus, I knocked the guy out in eight seconds. World record, man. And he&apos;d say: &apos;But you&apos;re no knockout artist. Joe Louis got to stand and watch people get counted to 10. No opponent of yours is going to be on his back when 10 comes. And he was right. My cleaner knockouts, Spinks, Botha \u2013 they all tried to get up on 10. They didn&apos;t have a shot at it, but they were trying, pathetic as it looked. He was teaching me the difference between good and perfect. Like Sunday follows Saturday: &apos;Mike, that was good but not perfect.&apos;&quot;     On the deck: knocking down Trevor Berbick at the age of 20 to become the youngest heavyweight world champion in history. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    &quot;And how do you learn a lesson like that?&quot; &quot;I knew when he stopped saying that.&quot; It&apos;s only by plumbing the depths of that bond that I finally understand his great mystery. It&apos;s not that he demolished so many great fighters \u2013 almost all bigger than him \u2013 often in the first round and at times, effectively, before the first punch was thrown. The mystery is that his reign was so brief: D&apos;Amato died a\u00a0year before Tyson became the youngest-ever world champion, at 20. In the ring, for the next three years, he could feel D&apos;Amato inside his head, with every punch, every feint, every step. Then that Band-Aid started coming off, mostly outside the ring, gradually exposing the 13-year-old who&apos;d never grown up but had simply become moulded. In Tokyo that bandage came off completely against Buster Douglas, a\u00a0fighter who had gone down, like the 37 before him, but who somehow, that night, got back up. You can see it happen, metaphorically, when a\u00a0Douglas uppercut knocks out Tyson&apos;s mouthpiece in the 10th round, and The Champ, on his knees, blindly looks for it. Twenty years later, it&apos;s an unspeakably shocking moment. Tyson says the end came before that punch was thrown. &quot;I&apos;d just stopped caring,&quot; he says. &quot;I just stopped feeling Cus inside me. I didn&apos;t care about boxing. And when Douglas got up after I knocked him down, and came back at me, I didn&apos;t have it in me. I didn&apos;t have it in me when I knocked him down, either. It&apos;s just \u2013 more power to him, he got up.&quot; &quot;And with Holyfield?&quot;     Mike Tyson with his daughter Milan. Photograph: Terry Richardson for the Observer    &quot;Man, I wasn&apos;t thinking about boxing when I bit him. I didn&apos;t care about boxing. I was wrong to do that, all wrong, crazy to do that. But that wasn&apos;t about boxing.&quot; So what were you thinking?&quot; &quot;I was on fucking drugs, thinking I was a\u00a0god\u2026 I was already done.&quot; The butler has brought the family&apos;s vegan meal, and his wife and kids emerge from the bedroom. I ask: &quot;All the lessons from boxing, what you learned from studying film, then wielded so successfully in the ring, can you apply them to a second chapter now?&quot; &quot;Definitely,&quot; says Tyson. &quot;But it takes rationality. And it takes balance. I can&apos;t live in the world like I lived in the ring, always at some extreme, always looking for that edge that&apos;ll tip the balance.&quot; &quot;So if boxing is the art of taking rage and terror and disciplining them into assets\u2026&quot; &quot;There&apos;s no rage and terror in boxing. If there is, they&apos;re counting to 10 over you.&quot; &quot;So what is the discipline you need now? &quot;Discipline is doing what you hate to do, but nonetheless do like you love it.&quot; He&apos;s clearly quoting. &quot;You learned that\u2026&quot; &quot;From Cus D&apos;Amato. I&apos;m not a guru follower. No, I have to be my own Cus. I have to be the man who takes the boy under his wing, protects him, knows him better than. I&apos;m still that little boy. I just have to learn to protect him a\u00a0little better.&quot; &quot;You have to learn to love him.&quot; Tyson bows his head, as if in prayer. &quot;He has to learn to love himself.&quot; Ivan Solotaroff is an American journalist and author.

Ito has a special interest in issues of copyright in the digital sphere and is CEO of the organisation Creative Commons. He is now based in Dubai. What is Creative Commons? It is a non-profit organisation with volunteer judges, lawyers and activists in 80 to 100 countries. We create software and technical and legal tools that allow people who create content to mark their works with permissions and restrictions that they would like other people to adhere to. People don&apos;t have to ask each time how they can use the work and search engines and software tools know the intent of the author, lowering the friction of sharing and encouraging collaboration. How does it work? It establishes a standard set of legal and technical tools that allows interoperability. When the web came along, it was based on an open standard, so anyone could create a website or a little start-up company. The web is interoperable, which reduces the friction [of any transaction] and lowers the costs of creating things. This creates lower costs of innovation. Look at Wikipedia or Skype or eBay \u2013 all of these would have seemed like dumb ideas before they were created, yet in retrospect they seem obvious. By reducing the cost of failure and allowing all kinds of people to try things, you get an abundance of innovation. So my assertion is: as each layer involved in a transaction becomes cheap and interoperable, the next layer becomes the friction spot. We&apos;ve been going up, from the telecommunications layer, to the content layer to the point at which there&apos;s an abundance of information that can connect \u2013 but we&apos;ve hit the legal friction spot. Now, just as we got network and software guys out from the stack and got them to move on to do more interesting things \u2013 solving successive problems and reducing friction \u2013 we&apos;re trying to remove lawyers so they can do more interesting things. The result, I hope, is we&apos;re going to have an explosion of innovation in the content-sharing space. Aren&apos;t our concepts of copyright ownership outdated in the digital age, where it&apos;s easy and cheap to copy and distribute anything? As CEO of Creative Commons, I have a very clear position: we&apos;re pro-copyright and we work within the constraints of copyright. It&apos;s a hack; we&apos;re trying within copyright to lower friction as much as possible without breaking the law or forcing people who use copyright to have to change what they do. We believe open is better. But we don&apos;t go around telling people they should give things away. Where do you think things are heading? Well, I do think the models we&apos;ve created around ownership and copyright are outdated. I&apos;m not sure about the idea that information is the same as a thing \u2013 so if you give it away, you don&apos;t have it anymore. A banana is worth a dollar, you give it away and you don&apos;t have it anymore. But that&apos;s a very simplistic view of the way in which the information economy works. It&apos;s never worked that way before. If you are an academic, your value increases every time someone references one of your papers. If you charged a dollar for everyone to cite your paper, that would increase the friction involved in that transaction. And which would you rather? That you get paid or that everyone cites your work? It&apos;s obvious. If you&apos;re a musician and a DJ had to pay a dollar every time he wanted to tell someone he liked your music, would that be a good business model? Of course not. There&apos;s a tremendous amount of value in getting attention and being cited. You have to make a decision: is it more valuable for me to get cited or to create a barrier to access and get paid? If you&apos;re Madonna and everyone knows who you are and wants your music, then you probably favour strict copyright. But if no one&apos;s ever heard of you and some people are happy to cite you but don&apos;t really want to pay, then a Creative Commons licence probably makes sense. We have six different licences with a variety of different restrictions. For example, you can restrict free sharing to non-commerical use \u2013 a lot of professional photographers and musicians do that, so they can make money from commercial users, but allow fans to use their work for free. There are ways to preserve the business model. We&apos;re not against making money You have invested in some great start-ups. What trends do you see emerging on the web? The growth of venture capitalism in New York and London is interesting. Silicon Valley doesn&apos;t really get cool. Compare products and websites developed in those places. Steve Jobs [at Apple] is one of the few design-oriented people in Silicon Valley, which is why he&apos;s been able to push things forward. As we start moving up the stack, and ask how we bring museums online, how we fund music, how we make art projects, it&apos;s very difficult to find people in Silicon Valley who understand those ideas and that sensibility. A lot of innovation is shifting to New York and London. The guys who created open-source software and sites such as Google \u2013 they understood the problem and they also understood the tools they needed to solve it. It was easy for them to create these new technologies. The problem for journalists, artists, curators and scientists is that they don&apos;t know how to hack the internet. But software development is getting easier and easier. An artist or scientist could knock out a website in a weekend now. These people for whom the internet was a black box \u2013 that will change and then we&apos;ll see a lot more innovation. Why are you now based in Dubai? The Middle East is underdeveloped in many ways, but there&apos;s a lot of money, even if it&apos;s not well distributed. And with 9/11, a lot of talent is moving back there. Just look at Beirut. It takes a while for an ecosystem to kick in, but it will and the trick for venture capitalists is that you&apos;ve got to be there before it happens."}, {"sentences": ["But there were plenty of highs, too: ultra-rare record shops in Brooklyn; bullet trains in Kyoto and novelty top shops in Tokyo; alligator steaks in Louisiana."], "tags": ["The xx", "Indie", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Jamie xx"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-05T00:05:48Z", "title": "The xx: the band with the world at their feet | Music", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/05/xx-world-tour-pictures-feature", "article": "Sixteen months ago, in August 2009, the xx launched their dark and often mysterious debut album with a gig in London&apos;s Hoxton Hall.

Here&apos;s a fun citizen-science project that twitchers, birders, parrot enthusiasts, naturalists and their families can participate in: the World Parrot Count.  This international census is organised by the Parrot Researchers Group, which is part of the International Ornithological Union (IOU). Day-to-day coordination is done by Roelant Jonker, a doctoral student in the department of environmental sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and by Michael Braun, a graduate student in the department of biology at Heidelberg University in Germany.  The census, which will take place in January 2011, is designed to gather information about feral parrots: their habits and numbers. Since the coordinators cannot visit every city in the world where feral parrots reside, they are asking for your help: they want you to locate and count feral parrots in their roost trees and report this information on the World Parrot Count website, hosted by Leiden University.  &quot;Organisations like Observado, Sovon and my own City Parrots have been counting parakeets in different collaborations over the years,&quot; wrote Mr Jonker in an email.  Mr Jonker and Mr Braun are charged with developing strategies for conserving the increasing numbers of endangered parrot species.  &quot;When I look ahead, I see an ever-growing human population for the planet,&quot; writes Mr Jonker. &quot;With finite resources available, the conservation of many species will inevitably do without the ... attention they deserve. The focus of conservation biology has already shifted from preserving everything to preserving what is most precious -- for example the biodiversity hotspot concept.&quot; A biodiversity hotspot is a region that has a significant reservoir of native wildlife and plantlife that is under threat from humans. At least 25 areas around the world are recognized as biodiversity hotspots with nine more potential candidates. Together, these sites support nearly 60% of the world&apos;s plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with a very high number of endemic species. To achieve World Parrot Count&apos;s goals, the team realised that an organised census of feral parrots around the world was necessary. The first of these counts was conducted in 2004. Already, this small data set revealed that feral ring-necked parakeets, Psittacula krameri, of The Hague and Amsterdam are growing in number and are colonising new cities.  &quot;We know this because the roost counts from 2004 had about half the birds that we counted [in the following] year and we found new roosts in towns where parakeets were not known in 2004,&quot; explained Mr Jonker.  These data also provide unexpected insight into the feral parrots&apos; habitat preferences.  &quot;So we know they are expanding but also that they prefer urban areas to the agricultural and forested lands between towns. Now we [want] to get the same information for the many different urban parrot species around the globe for comparisons.&quot;  Starting in the 1960s, just a few of the smaller and less expensive parrot species successfully established feral breeding populations in a few locations where they are not native. These birds either escaped or were intentionally released. But now, more than 50 of the 356 extant parrot species have established viable breeding populations in urban and suburban areas, mostly throughout the Northern Hemisphere.  For example, I&apos;ve seen ring-necked parakeets in London and in Tokyo; red-masked parakeets, Aratinga erythrogenys, in San Francisco; hybrid conures in Seattle, and monk (Quaker) parakeets, Myiopsitta monachus in Brooklyn.  But these parrots are controversial.  &quot;Most [people] really like them but others are quick to remind them [that parrots] don&apos;t belong here and should be seen as alien invasives,&quot; remarked Mr Jonker.  But unlike other free-roaming alien species, such as domestic housecats, dogs, pigs, goats, and other animals, there aren&apos;t any published studies suggesting that feral parrots pose a problem to either native flora or fauna. Even ornithologists, bird watchers and naturalists are not sure what impacts, if any, that growing feral parrot populations have on native wildlife.  This is because, with rare exceptions, feral parrots live almost exclusively in or near cities, feeding on bird table offerings and other items that humans directly provide to them. They also feed on plants that humans cultivate -- many of which are alien species, too.  There is no scientific evidence that feral parrots out-compete native species for nest sites because most native cavity-nesting birds don&apos;t breed in cities unless (like woodpeckers) they construct their own nests or (like tits) use abandoned cavities or bird houses provided by humans.  Parrots are creative in their nesting behaviours: if they cannot find appropriate nesting sites, they&apos;ll come up with alternatives.  &quot;A population of ring-necked parakeets in Germany now actually prefers to breed in the nooks and crevices of city buildings -- a niche not usually exploited by native birds,&quot; report Mr Jonker.  Further, the &quot;urban habitat&quot; is a profoundly disturbed and altered niche that most native animals fled long ago, leaving the biologically impoverished concrete jungles to man and his coterie of pets, pests and domestic animals. Whilst most feral populations of parrots consist of common species, some are endangered in their native lands. Mexican yellow-headed amazons, Amazona oratrix, have become established in parts of Texas and -- perhaps surprisingly -- in Stuttgart, Germany (a city that suddenly has rocketed to the top of my &quot;must visit soon&quot; list).  Mr Jonker&apos;s main research interests include understanding why parrots are so successful in cities and how this quality can benefit parrot conservation in general. He finds that urban and suburban areas are attractive to parrots because they provide security. Cities offer suitable habitat; parks, zoos, botanical gardens and even golf courses. People don&apos;t walk around cities with shotguns in-hand and they rarely hunt birds for food. Further, some city-dwellers regularly feed birds and most large urban areas don&apos;t have many parrot predators.  So learning more about the growing urban populations of yellow-headed amazons and other endangered species can provide conservationists and parrot researchers with valuable information that might be useful for propagating rare or endangered parrots in cities for conservation purposes.  &quot;Many parrots have proven able to live in cities,&quot; Mr Jonker pointed out. &quot;We&apos;ve counted over 50 species. Since natural habitats tend to [become] more and more degraded, fragmented or even disappear altogether, it is only logical to shop for alternative habitats that could help the survival of parrots. We believe cities in the native ranges of these parrots could be such an alternative.&quot;  It is not known if certain species might be better candidates for this project, but among the new world parrots, Amazona, Brotogeris and many of the Aratinga species have shown remarkable abilities to colonise cities.  &quot;But this ability is by no means restricted to these genera,&quot; said Mr Jonker. &quot;[But] I would concentrate on species that need conservation. The species on the IUCN redlist will be our guide.&quot;  As proof of concept, the team is developing a plan to release captive-bred golden conures, Guaruba guarouba, in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil. These birds, a gift from a couple who resides in Brazil, were tentatively scheduled for release by the Bel\u00e9m Zoo in 2010. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funds to pay for airfare and pre-release enclosures, this project has stalled.

Conscription cannot be abolished as such because it is enshrined in the German constitution and a change would be complex to achieve and, it is thought, politically unwise just now. But defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, riding on a white charger of personal popularity, is pushing through a measure that his recent predecessors have baulked at. Many young men within my acquaintance regard their period in the military as being boring and a waste of time. Many others who knew this beforehand opted for civil Dienst, service in a civilian organisation within the voluntary or statutory welfare system, which was not difficult to do because the rules concerning pacifism and poor health have over the years been &quot;flexibly&quot; applied. They only received a small amount of pocket money for their work. And here is the rub: from the middle of 2011 at least 90,000 jobs will be open to people being paid the agreed rate for the job they fill. The difference is enormous. So much so that I strongly suspect only now has the urgent need to modernise the German army finally outweighed the welfare organisations&apos; call to retain military service and thereby retain civil Dienst. These organisations are also asking the crucial question: are there people out there willing to do the jobs done now by the &quot;civvies&quot; even for the going rate of pay? Michael Booth Kassel, Germany \u2022 Kate Connolly&apos;s article gives wrong information and therefore the wrong impression. Call-up in Germany is not going to be abolished; it is to be suspended. Young men will not be called up but the legislation will stay on the statute books so that call-up can be reintroduced, if the need arises. Derek Murphy Bad Pyrmont, Germany \u2022 German military bureaucracy inefficient? Surely not. Then again, what your reporter slipped into her article as fact, that the Bundeswehr&apos;s bureaucracy is inefficient, seems more like an opinion \u2013 one that may not even be her own. It sounds more like the government&apos;s party line. Reporting such views as fact because they are &quot;official&quot; is a sloppy habit that I do not expect to find in the Guardian Weekly. MC Warrior Ladysmith, BC, Canada The allure of Hitler I have just read Timothy Garton Ash&apos;s reflections \u2013 as usual, stimulating and perceptive \u2013 on the Hitler exhibition in Berlin (German shoulder absent at the wheel, 12\u00a0November), in which he touches on, but does not answer, the question of &quot;why Hitler fascinated and enthused so many Germans&quot;. The answer seems to me obvious: it was the &quot;feel-good factor&quot;. After the traumatic and humiliating disaster of the first world war (a trauma from which even the victors are still licking their wounds nearly a century on), and the further humiliation of the punitive Versailles settlement, Hitler&apos;s nationalist rhetoric and bellicose stance made many Germans feel good about being German again. It was exactly the same as the way Ronald Reagan&apos;s aggressive nationalism made many Americans feel good about themselves again after the humiliation of the Vietnam war. It seems we really don&apos;t learn the lessons of history. Geoffrey Allen Pilzone, Italy Loneliness and fear The proneness of young men to become the recruits of terrorist groups that seek to eliminate those they refer to as infidels, like the gangs of young men that plot widespread graffiti assaults on our cities in an obvious attempt to degrade the environment and soil their nests, are living metaphors for a 21st-century anarchic, dystopian mindset. Similarly, the enormous growth in the appeal of increasingly violent pornography among young males (Pornography from a male perspective, 26 November) is one more glaring metaphor that reveals the loneliness and fear of love apparent in these men, and suggests their likely sense of abandonment by distant parents, or their feelings of helplessness in a world of oligarchic and patriarchal masters. Allied to these feelings, as explained by gender expert Michael Kimmel, is their &quot;anger at the loss of privilege&quot;, and what these men assume to be their heretofore &quot;unchallenged authority&quot;, both of which are no doubt related to equally deep-seated feelings of being emasculated by the advances achieved by the feminist movement. All the above grim, extended metaphors seem to hint at the fact that the biggest threat to civilisation and world peace is nature&apos;s too-generous gift of testosterone, the overabundance of which causes the male of the species to lose all restraint, in spite of their otherwise well-developed human brains. But instead of artificially reducing levels of this irksome hormone, perhaps we still have time to seriously reflect upon the wisdom gained over centuries, that we are not, in fact, animals rooting in the fields. Richard Orlando Montreal, Canada Role of good governance Jonathan Glennie&apos;s article emphasises the importance of encouraging governments in African countries to improve governance drawing on Ibrahim Index (Africa must heed good governance call, 5\u00a0November). I do think that the kind of index is significant to complement conventional, growth-oriented, indicators. Yet, I think the article (and the index) still emphasises too much the performance of African national governments. The article says that &quot;the key is accountability&quot;, but studies of Latin America, for example, have shown that improving accountability requires a wide range of institutional arrangements that create possibilities for civic participation to monitor public services from much lower levels of formal governance. Besides, governance needs to be defined clearly in the conjunction with informal organisations, including village councils, community-based organisations, influential religious organisations etc in the first place, because if we do not consider sociocultural aspects of governance, we will not be able to find the social basis to ensure the national governments&apos; good performance. In addition, as your paper often persuasively demonstrates, African countries have experienced too much of &quot;bad&quot; international aid and all sorts of external interventions, even after they decolonised themselves. Instead of just insisting that the African people need to improve themselves, don&apos;t we need to show another type of index that visualises the performance of all the aid agencies acting in Africa, and indicate who could really be helpful to assist with establishing &quot;good governance&quot;? Kei Otsuki Tokyo, Japan Names, Spanish-style I was interested to read that the Spanish custom is to link a married couple&apos;s surnames with the husband&apos;s name first (Spanish surname shake-up, 12 November). Here in Portuguese-speaking Brazil, the custom is reversed. When I married my Brazilian wife, her name was already half a mile long \u2013 her first name a merger of her father&apos;s and mother&apos;s first names, her second name that of her saint, her third her mother&apos;s surname, preceded by de (meaning &quot;belonging to&quot;) and her final surname the same as her father&apos;s surname. When she married me, in Wales, she could have dropped the mother&apos;s name, but opted to simply add my surname at the end of all that, which gave rise to a pub quiz question: &quot;Whose name became even longer by becoming Short?&quot; Keith Short Fortaleza-Ce, Brazil Briefly \u2022 Regarding Armageddon for trees (26 November): this occurred many centuries ago in Scotland, leaving the once forested Highlands almost totally bare, remaining so to this day apparently so that the extremely wealthy could continue to enjoy shooting animals and birds for sport. I imagine the reforestation of the Highlands would not be impossible, would be a significant step forward in carbon capture, and would affect only a few, who could well afford it. Judith Wallace Harkaway, Victoria, Australia \u2022 It is entirely predictable that the US will be exerting pressure on its allies to make life as difficult as possible for WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. It is also ironic, because \u2013 already \u2013 the revelations reveal the superpower&apos;s diplomatic integrity is more dubious than WikiLeaks&apos;s journalistic integrity.

Here are a few of their replies. Plus some of the comments about the summit coming through on Twiter. Kirsty Wright, climate campaigner, World Development Movement As we move into the second week of negotiations, Canc\u00fan looks destined to be a repeat of the catastrophe we saw in Copenhagen. Developing countries currently have little to be optimistic about. WikiLeaks confirmed that the UK has been lobbying for climate finance to be provided as loans through the much-loathed World Bank, instead of grants through the more democratic UN. Unless the UK and other rich countries have a wholesale change of heart, millions of people will be locked into deeper debt and poverty, as well as a climate crisis they have no historical responsibility for causing. There are also serious concerns about the ever decreasing space for civil society. We are far from an outcome that has justice at its heart. Bill Mckibben, founder of 350.org As usual, almost all the pressure is on the developing countries in week one of these talks. America&apos;s ongoing attempt to cast itself as a poor country (or China and India as rich ones) dominates most of the discussion - the pressure is on to scrap Kyoto&apos;s two-track system and make everyone commit to cuts, even if some countries have not had a century of coal-burning to make them wealthy. Washington might get away with it, I suppose, if it was willing to pony up to help the global south pay the cost. But the really ominous news came last week when four Republican senators wrote to secretary of state Clinton demanding that she withhold even the relatively small sums the US has pledged towards a climate finance package. Those senators - and their brethren in the House majority - may well be strong enough to block the climate aid. This raises the question of why on earth anyone listens to threats and promises from the US. Since the Kyoto talks, Washington&apos;s refrain has always been the same: water down the agreements or the Senate won&apos;t go along. The watering-down duly takes place, but the Senate action never follows. Alberto Gomez, from La Via Campesina It&apos;s a disgrace that the UN space intended to tackle climate change has been converted into a platform to legitimise the commercial strategies of transnational corporations [TNCs]. Multinationals benefit from an ever increasing number of compensating mechanisms for carbon capture, all of which are only new opportunities for them to grow and consolidate their control over water, land and seeds. We denounce the false solution of carbon markets and the fact that numerous governments have reconciled themselves to it and don&apos;t seek a compromise with their populations. Our task is to foil the carbon markets. This is why we came. Olegario Carrillo, national leader, National Union of Autonomous Regional Peasant Organisations (UNORCA)   We must at least qualify as irresponsible, although many call it criminal, the attitude of those who support these schemes for the privatisation/commercialisation of the world, its forests and atmosphere, that only bring us closer to the brink every time. From here we can see the thick smog of transnational interests hang above the Canc\u00fan summit. Rich countries and their satellites try to confer legitimacy on false solutions like Redd [Reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation]. Octavio Rosas Landa, from the National Assembly of Those Affected by the Environment (part of Via Campesina)  We have the same message: we don&apos;t want the false solutions that COP16 stands for. We don&apos;t want Redd. We don&apos;t want them to carry on poisoning us with their lies and their false solutions. This is what we said and heard everywhere the caravans stopped, throughout their journey through this country where they bore witness to the environmental and social devastation of Mexico. COP16 only seeks to benefit from the environmental crisis, while people continue to fall ill and to die as a result of these corrupt policies and of the various activities of all these TNCs that are appropriating the air, water, land, forests, seeds, and all the other common goods which make up the patrimony of humanity.

Ichikawa conceded that his &quot;arrogance and impudence&quot; may have brought on the attack, adding: &quot;I won&apos;t feel like having a drink for a while.&quot; Police have issued a warrant for the arrest of a 26-year-old man accused of attacking the actor. While Ichikawa denies provoking his assailant, who is described as a member of a bosozoku motorcycle gang with ties to the underworld, reports said he behaved aggressively in the moments before the fight. The Japanese media have followed every twist in the saga, noting that this was not the first time the outspoken actor had engaged in a reckless drinking spree. According to one report, on the night he was attacked Ichikawa pulled the hair of a drinking partner and made him drink tequila from an ashtray. The actor, however, insists his attempts to help a member of the party who had over-indulged had created a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;. Ichikawa, known as the prince of kabuki, must wait before attempting to regain his place in the affections of the entertainment establishment, after the theatre company Shochiku suspended his performances indefinitely. The cancellation of a series of shows over the New Year are expected to cost Shochiku as much as $2.4m, while three companies have pulled TV adverts in which Ichikawa appears. Perhaps of more concern to the actor is the suggestion by some medical experts that an injury to his left eye could impair his ability to execute the nirami, a protective, cross-eyed glare that has become his family&apos;s trademark. Custodians of the centuries-old art are treated with the kind of reverence reserved for leading Shakespearean actors. Although kabuki&apos;s early performances were often accompanied by bawdy, drunken behaviour among audiences, Ichikawa&apos;s fall from grace has shocked his fans. Many are asking why Ichikawa decided to go drinking with friends, then join a group of strangers only hours after pulling out of a media appearance citing ill health. The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan&apos;s biggest-selling newspaper, described the incident as a &quot;major blow to kabuki&apos;s frontman&quot;. &quot;It could also hurt the overall image of the world of kabuki,&quot; it said. Kabuki, a highly stylised performing art that originated in the 1600s, combines music, dance and acting. The stories, performed by all-male actors dressed in elaborate costumes and colourful makeup &quot;masks&quot;, deal with samurai rivalry, love, suicide and more pedestrian accounts of city life. Ichikawa&apos;s good looks and acting style have helped revive interest in kabuki, especially among younger people, and has secured a fanbase overseas. The actor was made a member of L&apos;Ordre de Arts et des Lettres in 2007 after wowing audiences in Europe, Australia and the US. His celebrity status was earlier underlined by his marriage to the popular TV personality Mao Kobayashi."}, {"sentences": ["The outfit cost \u00a338 and was available in at least two stores in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Judaism", "Christianity", "Religion", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-08T17:30:01Z", "title": "Divine dispatches: a religion roundup | Riazat Butt", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/08/japan-nazi-costume-divine-dispatches", "article": "Don&apos;t know about divine dispatches but I could certainly do with some divine inspiration.

Reasons 1.4( b) and (d). 1. (C) SUMMARY. PolOff and PolAsst&apos;s trip to Limpopo Province on 24 April confirmed press reports that Zuma&apos;s camp has made inroads in gaining provincial support for Zuma as ANC President, but the province remains split and difficult to call. As expected, Zuma&apos;s supporters were fervent but short on substance, never making a case for what Zuma would bring to the party as ANC President. Instead, they emphasized that the ANC as an institution is greater than the sum of its members, dismissing the importance of leadership in the process. END SUMMARY. ---------------------------------- A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT WAS TO COME ---------------------------------- 2. (C) PolOff and PolAsst traveled to Limpopo Province on 24 April to gauge support for the upcoming ANC presidential election. Though several officials agreed to meet, some refused. Joshua Matlou, ANC Youth League (ANCYL) Provincial Chairperson, told PolAsst that &quot;it would be useless for both of us since I would only talk about things that are in the newspaper.&quot; Matlou added that ANC members do not trust American diplomats because &quot;they have seen what the U.S. government does to elections in other countries when they do not like the locally preferred candidate.&quot; Matlou believes this attitude cuts across the spectrum of ANC members. (NOTE: With almost 53,000 ANC members, Limpopo is the ANC,s fourth-largest province after Eastern Cape, Gauteng, and KwaZulu-Natal. At the 2002 national conference, it fielded 324 candidates, almost twice those of the smallest province, the Northern Cape, but half that of the largest, Eastern Cape. Limpopo will host the December 2007 ANC conference where the next ANC President will be chosen. END NOTE) ------------------------------- ANC LARGER THAN LIFE, LITERALLY ------------------------------- 3. (C) ANC Provincial Secretary Cassel Mathale refused to be drawn into a conversation about who he supports for ANC President, even though he is widely reported to be pro-Zuma. Instead, Mathale, who was polite, persistent, and yet unpersuasive, argued that the ANC as a party is so strong that it does not matter who becomes President. He added that the ANC would soon be finishing what it started in 1994 -- building strong institutions so that no one person would have too much power. (COMMENT: This is likely a reference to next month&apos;s ANC policy conference which will debate transferring some powers from the ANC President to the ANC Secretary General (septel). END COMMENT) 4. (C) Rosina Semenya, Provincial Minister for Public Works and the ANC Women&apos;s League&apos;s (ANCWL) Provincial Chairperson, echoed Mathale&apos;s comments that the ANC as a party, institution, and culture is more important than any individual leader. When asked how the ANCWL and ANCYL work together at the provincial level given the ANCYL&apos;s outspoken support of Zuma, Semenya surprisingly asked what was wrong with Zuma. She added that &quot;people should be willing to overlook certain qualities if someone was brought up in ANC culture and tradition. That is what is most important.&quot; To maintain and enrich this tradition, she told us the ANC is creating a policy institute to inculcate its members in ANC policies and that former controversial Limpopo Premier Ngoako Ramathlodi, who fell out of favor with Mbeki last year, is in charge of the project. XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE) ------------------------------------ YOUTH LEAGUE: YOUR WORST BEST FRIEND ------------------------------------ 5. (C) ANCYL Provincial Secretary Julius Malema, who was frank and friendly, started the conversation with stories of his &quot;young pioneer&quot; days when the ANC taught him how to use a gun 17 years ago, at the tender age of 9. He then boasted that Limpopo&apos;s ANCYL has more members than any other province and is &quot;100 percent united&quot; in its support of Zuma. Malema never explained why he or the league supports Zuma, but did PRETORIA 00001712 002 OF 002 admit that Zuma would likely not have been picked up by the ANCYL &quot;if Mbeki hadn&apos;t gone after him.&quot; Malema stated matter of factly that Zuma is &quot;a victim of a conspiracy similar to what would happen in American politics.&quot; When PolOff politely challenged him about his analogy, he backed off and said, &quot;Well, that&apos;s how it&apos;s portrayed in movies.&quot; When asked what triggered the loss of Mbeki&apos;s support from the ANCYL, he replied that &quot;Mbeki thinks he&apos;s too clever for all of us and he won&apos;t engage with us.&quot; In a subsequent aside, Malema admitted that ANCYL President Fikile Mbalula did not want to support Zuma during the rape trial but that the regional leadership insisted, arguing that if the YL defended Zuma on corruption charges, they could defend him on rape charges since both acts are immoral. He also hinted that Fikile was told his position depended on his support of Zuma. 6. (C) PolOff was shut down every time she tried to turn the discussion to other potential candidates. When asked about the possibility of a female successor, Malema dismissed the idea, saying South Africa needs a &quot;man who is ahead on issues, but who can walk with the masses.&quot; He also dismissed Tokyo Sexwale saying he had his chance. When asked if Tokyo&apos;s involvement in big business soured the ANCYL, he said that he is not against the rich, just capitalists, but that Sexwale is not a capitalist &quot;because he only owns shares of companies, not actual means of production.&quot; (COMMENT: Malema wore a sweatshirt with NIKE emblazoned on it and also complained about the bank&apos;s right to repossess his Audi if he does not make payments. END COMMENT) When asked what the league plans on doing if Zuma goes to jail, he said they would accept the decision and throw their support behind ANC Secretary General Kgalema Motlanthe. However, he added that SIPDIS though &quot;Motlanthe is brilliant, you can&apos;t understand anything he says.&quot; --------------------------------------- LIMPOPO UNLIKELY TO LAY CARDS DOWN SOON --------------------------------------- 7. (C) Mathale told us that Limpopo will hold its provincial conference to declare its candidate for ANC President in late November or early December, but admitted that the province will know long before the conference where the regions stand. In fact, soon after the June policy conference, the ANC will send out a communiqu urging regions to start sending in their preferred names and delegates. Semenya also said that Limpopo&apos;s ANCWL has not yet set a date for its provincial conference, but will wait until after June&apos;s policy conference as to not &quot;distract from ANC policymaking.&quot; 8. (C) Malema could not say when Limpopo would hold its regional conference, but did mention that the national ANCYL would not be holding a conference at all this year (in violation of its constitutional requirement to do so every three years), having already decided to support Zuma. Malema justified the position by echoing Fikile&apos;s statements that the league &quot;already has leaders in place who can influence the outcome and that they want to keep it that way.&quot; When asked how this strategy differs from the ANC&apos;s Eastern Cape youth league, which was &quot;officially&quot; disbanded in part because they had not held their regional conference in time, Malema said with a straight face that Eastern Cape postponed for a year, while the national level is only postponing six months. (COMMENT: Eastern Cape&apos;s ANCYL branch was disbanded unofficially because of its support of Eastern Cape&apos;s call for a third term for Mbeki. END COMMENT) ------- COMMENT ------- 9. (C) Despite the fact that most of those free (or willing) to talk with us were pro-Zuma, we should not overestimate his supporters&apos; bark nor discount the pro-Mbeki camp within the province. The ANCWL and ANCYL will have approximately 53 votes each for the entire country in December, likely a third to a quarter of Limpopo&apos;s vote as a province. Moreover, heavyweights like Limpopo&apos;s Premier Sello Moloto, ANC Regional Secretary David Magabe, and ANC Regional Chairperson Dickson Masemola are pro-Mbeki, having publicly declared their continuing support to the current elected leadership.

(C) SUMMARY: According to a source in Mitsubishi XXXXXXXXXXXX, PDVSA is seeking to close at least $13 billion in finance deals. Senior PDVSA officials are reportedly upset over the failure to solicit bids from international companies for the Mariscal Sucre offshore natural gas project; PDVSA announced it would develop the resources on its own. Energy Minister Ramirez is traveling to Moscow, Beijing, and Japan in an attempt to move other projects forward. Shortage of natural gas is forcing PDVSA to prioritize projects and slow-down or cancel projects in the pipeline. The Vice Minister of Energy and Petroleum for Petrochemicals reportedly is not honoring any natural gas commitments made prior to his assumption of the post. Petrochemical projects in the Jose condominium are working to secure an electricity generation capacity in the face of the current crisis. END SUMMARY. 2. (C) PDVSA Finance: Petroleum AttachC) met with Mitsubishi XXXXXXXXXXXX on XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX spoke freely on a range of issues impacting the energy sector. His comments on the bids in the extra heavy crude Carabobo Round are reported in septel. With respect to PDVSA&apos;s financing needs, XXXXXXXXXXXX shared that PDVSA is seeking to close several international financing deals, including an $8 billion offer from the &quot;Icc Consortium,&quot; a $1.5 billion loan from Deutsche Bank for a power plant, and a $1.5 billion corporate line of credit from Banco Espirito Santo (BES). 3. (C) Mariscal Sucre: On Wednesday, January 20, in a signing ceremony for the petroleum workers&apos; new collective bargaining agreement, President Chavez announced that PDVSA would develop the Mariscal Sucre offshore natural gas fields independently. The bid round failed to attract any international interest. [NOTE: During the ceremony, Minister of Energy and Petroleum Rafael Ramirez also announced that PDVSA would develop the Junin 10 block of the Faja on its own, effectively eliminating Statoil and Total from continued participation. The range of costs involved in other Junin projects with international oil companies are between $16 billion and $25 billion. Chevron XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested to PetAtt on January 29 that neither company was willing to pay PDVSA a bonus to be awarded the block and that PDVSA &quot;kicked&quot; them out as a temporary negotiating measure. END NOTE] XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that privately, senior PDVSA leadership is extremely upset with the failure of international companies to register bids. XXXXXXXXXXXX added that Mitsubishi sent a letter to PDVSA explaining why the conditions offered by Venezuela were insufficient and what would need to be changed to make a bid commercially viable. XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested the obstacle to Mitsubishi&apos;s bid was the expected price for natural gas that participating companies would receive from the GBRV (GBRV wants to buy natural gas for $1.25/million cubic foot and international companies are looking for a price above $3/million cubic feet). Estimates published in local media put Mariscal Sucre development costs at over $8 billion. 4. (C) Ramirez Travel: After receiving last second permission from President Chavez to add a stop in Tokyo onto his current travel plans, Energy and Petroleum Minister Ramirez is currently in Moscow and will be in Beijing through February 3. He is scheduled to meet with private sector and Japanese government officials in Tokyo on February 4 and 5. XXXXXXXXXXXX speculated that Ramirez&apos;s goal in Moscow would be to advance the Russian petroleum consortium&apos;s Junin CARACAS 00000147 002 OF 002 project. In Beijing, XXXXXXXXXXXX expected Ramirez to focus on &quot;bringing CNPC&quot; back in line and advancing the various Chinese heavy oil projects in the Faja. XXXXXXXXXXXX believed Ramirez&apos;s stop in Tokyo would be designed to seek additional financing for PDVSA, to advance the Junin 11 reserve certification study (Ref B), and to reprimand the Japanese companies for not submitting bids in the Mariscal Sucre bid round. 5. (C) Jose Petroleum and Petrochemical Condominium: XXXXXXXXXXXX mentioned that the private sector petrochemical tenants have all been given contradictory information regarding possible electricity rationing measures that Pequiven will execute. None of his interlocutors had heard of possible electricity rationing in Jose&apos;s petroleum upgraders. XXXXXXXXXXXX shared that Mitsubishi is organizing a joint lease of a 25-30 MW electricity barge that could be brought in on a 2-3 year contract. Mitsubishi believes this size generator could satisfy all of the petrochemical company electricity requirements. 6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that Mitsubishi is also trying to confirm the supply of natural gas from PDSVA to Pequiven and its mixed company enterprises in Jose. Mitsubishi financed a methane plant whose construction is expected to be completed within two months. The Japanese firm has a contract with Pequiven and an additional &quot;back-to-back&quot; contract with PDVSA to supply natural gas to Pequiven for the mixed company. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, Vice Minister for Petrochemicals (and PDVSA Vice President for Refining, Trade, and Supply) Asdrubal Chavez reportedly told another Japanese firm recently that any natural gas supply deal signed before he assumed his current position at the Ministry is invalid and that it was not in PDVSA&apos;s interests. The other Japanese firm has been working for several years to finalize an olefins project in Jose. 7. (C) COMMENT: PDVSA&apos;s reported search for loans, lines of credit, and bonus payments for new production companies suggests it continues to suffer from a lack of liquidity. The failed Mariscal Sucre natural gas bid round represents a significant setback for PDVSA. That Russian and Chinese national oil companies did not submit bids in Carabobo suggests the Minister&apos;s travel is to ensure support from &quot;like-minded&quot; countries and to avoid new public setbacks. PDVSA&apos;s search for financing and credit, a failed natural gas bid round, a (to date) inconclusive Carabobo round signal, as well as the company&apos;s 2009 expropriations of petroleum service companies and on-going service company arrears (estimated to exceed $8 billion), signal that PDVSA has much work to do to turn its fortunes around. Unfortunately, it appears that its management may not be up to the task. END COMMENT.

To dissidents, he is a champion of democracy. To Robin Munro, he may have been the difference between life and death. As dawn approached on 4 June 1989, two men stood with the few hundred students left in Tiananmen Square. The streets nearby were bloodied by the authorities&apos; brutal crackdown. With troops surrounding the last protesters, it was Liu and a handful of fellow intellectuals who brokered a peaceful exit. &quot;In the final moments it was Liu who took the microphone and said &apos;We have to leave: this is it,&apos;&quot; said Munro, who was then a human rights activist in Beijing and who will attend tomorrow&apos;s ceremony honouring the jailed writer. &quot;[Student] leaders were saying: &apos;We will die here for democracy.&apos; He said: &apos;We have done everything we can.&apos; I will always be grateful to Liu Xiaobo \u2026 He may have saved my life.&quot; Liu had been working at Columbia University when he learned of the protests and decided to go home. He was changing planes in Tokyo when he heard that the government had condemned the movement and realised how dangerous it was to return. &quot;I even asked about flights returning to New York. But then I heard the boarding call for my flight to Beijing. I didn&apos;t have time to hesitate. I thought, what the heck, live or die, I&apos;ll just go,&quot; he recalled years later. The decision would lead to the first of several incarcerations. But friends suggest his subsequent persistence was just as meaningful. Liao Yiwu, one of his oldest friends, said: &quot;Because of him, Chinese history does not come to a stop. After 1989, many people chose to forget what had happened, chose to go abroad, chose to divert themselves into doing business, or even to work with the government \u2013 but he did not.&quot; Yang Jianli, another close friend now living in exile, says Liu&apos;s thirst for justice and reform began much earlier. Born in 1955 in Jilin province, north China to an intellectual family \u2013 his father was a Communist party member \u2013 he was part of the generation of &quot;educated youths&quot; sent to labour in the countryside in the Cultural Revolution. &quot;Some took it as suffering and thought they should reward themselves when they had power and money later. Liu Xiaobo took it as experience that helped him understand the real suffering of the Chinese people at the hands of the Chinese government,&quot; said Yang. In 1977 Liu was admitted to Jilin University to study Chinese literature, but he soon became interested in western philosophy. After finishing his postgraduate studies at Beijing Normal University he became a professor there. He married and had a son, although it is thought he divorced his wife in 1989, hoping to protect his family. Despite his commitment to activism, friends say he is far from austere. &quot;This is a huge misunderstanding,&quot; said Liao. &quot;Actually he is less of a political figure to me than a passionate poet. And we often make him sing. He sings terribly and we always make fun of him. He is nice, and funny too. He himself is not Charter 08, although he drafted it. He is human after all.&quot; In the 1980s he alienated people with his outspoken remarks and abrasive, some thought arrogant manner. &quot;[But] he has transformed himself over the past 20 yearsfrom an individual fighter and thinker to a leader; he has matured,&quot; said Yang. &quot;My old impression of him was that he [didn&apos;t care] how other people felt when he made comments \u2026 He has changed tremendously.&quot; His second marriage, to fellow poet Liu Xia, who is under house arrest, is a source of strength: &quot;[It] gives him force to stand against the pressure,&quot; said Liao Tienchi, another friend in exile. They married in a labour camp in 1996, where Liu was serving a three-year sentence for speaking out against one-party rule. Liu Xia&apos;s concerns about his involvement in Charter 08 \u2013 a manifesto to promote political reform in China \u2013 proved correct. Hours before it was published on the internet two years ago, he was seized at the couple&apos;s flat. A year later, he was sentenced to 11 years for incitement to subvert state power, one of the harshest sentences handed to a dissident in years. &quot;We think the charge is against the Chinese constitution, because in the constitution it says that Chinese people have the freedom of speech, publication and demonstration,&quot; said Liu&apos;s lawyer Shang Baojun. &quot;One-party rule or multi-party rule \u2013 it is just an argument about the form of the state, it is not trying to overthrow the government.&quot; Jean-Philippe B\u00e9ja, a friend of Liu and a China scholar at the Paris-based Centre for International Studies and Research, said: &quot;Although he was convinced a lot of things were not right in China, he has always been ready to acknowledge positive developments. He said the space for civil society was developing. &quot;He never went underground and he took responsibility and wrote and talked in the open. I think that shows he was not the radical, revolutionary subversive described in the verdict.&quot; Many believe the sentence was intended to make an example of Liu. But it also galvanised dissent at home and concern about human rights abroad. The Nobel judges say it convinced them to give him the prize. Liu remains in prison in Jinzhou, six hours drive north of Beijing, and a swift release seems unlikely even if authorities were minded to consider a compromise such as medical parole, often applied to high-profile dissidents. He has repeatedly refused to leave his homeland. &quot;I think he is a person that feels he has a mission in China,&quot; said Yang. Whether he can achieve that mission remains to be seen. The signs are not encouraging. Thanks to China&apos;s strict censorship, Liu&apos;s name is barely known in the country. And since his win, pressure on fellow activists has intensified, not relaxed. But Yang insisted that was only the surface. &quot;With the help of the internet, Liu Xiaobo&apos;s name will reach every corner of China very, very soon and people will know his name,&quot; he predicted."}, {"sentences": ["There are reports this morning that Japanese negotiators had also come around to proposed solution on the Kyoto problem late on Thursday - only to pull back after instructions from Tokyo."], "tags": ["Canc\u00fan climate change conference 2010 | COP16", "Global climate talks", "Climate change", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-10T09:00:00Z", "title": "Canc\u00fan climate change summit: The final day as it happened", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/dec/10/cancun-climate-change-summit-final", "article": " .  09.00am: Two weeks of wrangling over the fate of the world come to a climax today at the UN climate summit in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. At stake is not just whether billions of people will have &quot;shrinking horizons and smaller futures&quot;, as Ban Ki-moon puts it, but the credibility of the UN body overseeing the talks.  Unlike Copenhagen last year, no one is expecting a binding deal at Canc\u00fan that will commit countries to cut the carbon emissions responsible for climate change. That much has been clear since as early as February, and since then everyone from the UN to key countries and NGOs has been conducting expectation management.     Chris Huhne    But the talks could still produce modest successes on forest protection, the speed and amount of financial aid developed countries give to developing ones to adapt to climate impacts, the transfer of clean technology, and monitoring of countries&apos; efforts to cut greenhouse gases. Or it could end in a procrastinating failure, with key decisions deferred another year, until Durban in South Africa. Such failure, the energy and climate secretary Chris Huhne warned yesterday, could result in a vicious downward spiral as countries send increasingly more junior representatives each year:   Next year people will say, well, we&apos;re not going to make any progress, and we end up with a zombie conference where there won&apos;t be anybody at a senior enough level to take any serious decisions at all  So far, the talks in Canc\u00fan have followed a familiar narrative for UN climate talks. Poorer countries have threatened to walk out over uncompromising negotiating stances taken by rich ones, the Kyoto protocol \u2013 the legally binding treaty that compels developed countries to cut emissions by 2012 \u2013 has been at heart of disagreements, and leaked texts have revealed backroom deals (this time the EU and small island states \u2013 last year&apos;s was the controversial &apos;Danish text&apos;). Plus this year we&apos;ve had the added spice of cables released by WikiLeaks that show how the US used its diplomatic muscle to get support for the weak Copenhagen accord document that emerged this time last year. Officially, we should hear the outcome of Canc\u00fan at midnight (the summit is six hours behind UK time). But judging from the final day at Copenhagen last year, when Barack Obama delayed his flight home for last-minute negotiations, it&apos;s likely to go on until the early hours. This live blog will try to keep going until the end result - Damian Carrington will be taking over from me this afternoon.  9.16am: India&apos;s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, has said India may eventually commit to legally binding cuts in emissions. Here&apos;s Ramesh, according to an Indian TV news broadcast this morning that Reuters is reporting:      Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister    All countries must make binding commitments in appropriate legal form. This does not mean that India is for a legally binding commitment at this stage. That&apos;s our position. There are changing realities that we have to understand. Increasingly, more and more developing countries are asking questions of India, China and the United States, the three big countries saying they will not accept an international legally-binding agreement. I have nuanced our position ... Let&apos;s keep this discussion going, let&apos;s understand the sentiments of the rest of the world, and let&apos;s not be painted as the bad guy. However tentative the remarks, they&apos;re a relatively big deal for India. Previously it&apos;s only talked about voluntary cuts, and even then only cuts in &quot;carbon intensity&quot; - carbon emissions per unit of GDP - meaning in a fast-growing economy such as India, emissions could still continue to rise. An Indian official, speaking to Reuters, confirmed Ramesh&apos;s slightly coded words: &quot;What the minister said was that India is willing to open a dialogue on taking binding emission cuts going forward as a means to keep the negotiations meaningful and alive.&quot;  9.36am: You&apos;d be forgiven for having missed Canc\u00fan over the last fortnight, what with that other small story about WikiLeaks and the low expectations for the summit. To get up to speed, I highly recommend our primer to this year&apos;s UN climate conference, which lays out the key players, issues and background. And to get the full back story to the negotiations, which have been going on for years to secure a new international deal to cut carbon emissions, take a look at our beautiful timeline of the talks.  9.45am: John Vidal&apos;s roundup of week one also gives a handy overview on the key areas negotiators and environment ministers need to agree today:\u2022 A deal to cut emissions and prevent a dangerous rise in future temperatures.\u2022 Setting up a plan to protect forests and keep emissions locked away, while helping developing countries in the process.\u2022 Raising billions of pounds in climate aid to help poor countries adapt to the impacts of climate change.\u2022 Extending the Kyoto protocol, which is set to expire in 2012.\u2022 Closing loopholes in the text that could see emissions actually rise.\u2022 Improving transparency of countries&apos; carbon cuts \u2013 a key US demand, more geekily known as monitoring, reporting and verifying (MRV).  9.54am: This in from Suzanne Goldenberg, our US correspondent who is on the ground at Canc\u00fan, who says the final hours of the summit have started to &quot;bring out leaders&apos; dramatic flair.&quot;     Suzanne Goldenberg    Mexico&apos;s president, Felipe Calderon, compared the negotiations to an airplane disaster movie. At an event yesterday he said:&quot;Sometimes I think we fail to understand that we&apos;re all passengers in the same vessel, in the same aircraft, or the same vehicle. Our aircraft has now seen the disappearance of the pilot. Something happened in the cabin. And all the passengers are responsible for the aircraft, and we&apos;re squabbling about these matters. Whether the guilt lies with those in the tourist class or those sitting up front in first class and the plane continues to go down. It&apos;s as if we were in a truck on a winding road and the driver has had a heart attack, and we&apos;re all on the edge of hitting a tree, going over into a ravine, squabbling again. I think, friends, somebody has to take control of the aircraft or put on the brakes.&quot;  10.20am: Not a great start to the final day of the talks. Last night Russia said no to an extension of the Kyoto protocol, which developing countries are adamant is crucial for agreement on other aspects of a climate deal. Canada is also understood to oppose the extension. The pair join Japan, which last week cast a negative shadow over the talks by announcing it would not back an extension of the treaty that was created in its former capital. The protocol, which binds rich countries to cut their emissions, is due to expire in 2012. Japan has since hardened its position, with one of its ambassadors telling John Vidal this week:  We are not moving. This is a fact. Many people have had the illusion that Japan might change its position. Well, we are sorry, but we are not going to. There is 0% possibility  We&apos;ll have the full story for you in a few minutes, courtesy of Suzanne Goldenberg.      Nnimmo Bassey. Photograph: Romel De Vera/FoEI/EPA    ... when rich countries are finally being asked to recognise this through taking strong action to cut their emissions, they are using Africans as a mouthpiece to help them wriggle out of it. What they should do is clear: commit unconditionally to an extension of the Kyoto protocol, cut their emissions by at least 40% by 2020 (without carbon offsetting), and provide more money for developing countries to tackle the problem.  10.42am: Nnimmo Bassey, the African chair of Friends of the Earth International, has written an interesting comment piece for us on Africa&apos;s role in the talks. One of his main complaints is that some leaders of the continent - which is expected to suffer some of the worst effects of rising temperatures, particularly on food supplies - are being used to promote the agenda of developed countries. He singles out the prime ministers of Kenya and Ethiopia:  10.50am: Australia-based youth climate activist and student Tim Hall, who is at Canc\u00fan, emails me with a plea to the officials and ministers who will be waking up in a couple of hours for today&apos;s crunch negotiations. It&apos;s written on behalf of the generation who will be affected by many of the predicted impacts of global warming:  It is now the final day and negotiations are still in a deadlock. You still haven&apos;t agreed on steps to fight climate change. The &apos;balanced package&apos; of a fund to oversee climate aid, ways to slow deforestation, steps to help poor countries adapt to climate change and a mechanism to share clean technologies, remains unfinished. You have had sixteen years of this negotiating. You&apos;ve had twelve months to ensure progress was made here at COP16. Yet you still bicker and delay, you still lose sight of the big issue. It seems it&apos;s the small things which create the biggest differences. You still can&apos;t compromise. If you can&apos;t agree on these things, what hope is there for us at all?  A little heads-up: we&apos;ve got a great blog on upcoming youth climate activists coming in the next hour.  11.03am: Here&apos;s the news on Russia&apos;s opposition to extending the Kyoto protocol. Russia&apos;s climate change envoy, Alexander Berditsky, said:  Russia will not participate in the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol... Russia has repeatedly stated, including at the highest political level, that the adoption of commitments for the second commitment period under the Kyoto protocol as it stands now would be neither scientifically, economically or politically effective.  Looks like we can expect opposition (Russia, Japan, Canada) and support (most developing countries, potentially EU) for the Kyoto protocol to become a pivotal stumbling block today. But will countries compromise, as executive secretary of the UN climate secretariat Christiana Figueres has repeatedly asked them too?  If you find your national position is in opposition to that of others, don&apos;t ask for compromise, think of our common planet and offer the compromise first. The deal here in Canc\u00fan will not guarantee all your short-term national interests, but reaching no outcome here in Canc\u00fan will endanger everyone&apos;s long-term well-being   11.17am: My colleagues on the Guardian&apos;s global development site have just published a blogpost on &apos;energy apartheid&apos;, or the fact that over a billion people still don&apos;t even have electricity - let alone worry about whether it&apos;s green or dirty, the issue that Canc\u00fan is interested in. It&apos;s by Drew Corbyn, from the charity Practical Action:  Some find the link between energy access and climate change a source of tension, arguing that it is foolhardy, given that the world is hurtling towards dangerously high levels of carbon in the atmosphere, to encourage nearly half the world&apos;s population to use more energy. This position is short-sighted and unjust. Meeting the basic energy needs of all the world&apos;s people would contribute less than 2% to current global emissions. People living in poverty should not be deprived of the opportunity to improve their lives because of the developed world&apos;s historical profligacy.       Greenpeace and tcktcktck activists, perform in Cancun, Mexico. Photograph: J under watason Taylor/Greenpeace/EPA    11.36am: To get a flavour of what it&apos;s been like at Canc\u00fan, check out our gallery of week two.  It has everything from activists&apos; protests and photo stunts - including this particularly spectacular underwater one - to life inside the halls of the Moon Palace hotel and Cancunmesse, where the negotiations are taking place.  12.18pm: It was clearly a late night for many in Canc\u00fan last night. Negotiators were reportedly working into the early hours and activists such as Change and Switch&apos;s Linh Do were still tweeting at 1am, Canc\u00fan-time. But while we wait for the Mexican resort to wake up in the next hour, here in the UK Greenpeace&apos;s Joss Garman is an upbeat mood, despite the developments overnight:     Joss Garman    Not so gloomy bout #COP16 as many. If Japan can agree to allow Kyoto issue to be resolved later, there&apos;s other key areas for agreement now  12.24pm: Just seen this on Twitter. Christian Aid says it&apos;s staging a protest at the Japanese embassy in London at 1pm, presumably as a reaction to its hardline stance on not extending the Kyoto protocol:  12.53pm: Early-rising delegates at the Canc\u00fan conference will be waking up now, and preparing for a day that officially closes around midnight (6pm in Canc\u00fan). Sceptical types will likely take that with a pinch of salt, despite Mexican president Felipe Calderon saying it will finish on time. Last year in Copenhagen, the feverish last-minute wrangling went on until 12.58am the following day, amid a swirl of rumours and impromptu press briefings.  Those final hours also featured a star cast of world leaders, including Obama, Merkel, Lula da Silva and Brown. This year is quite a different deal - Chris Huhne specifically asked David Cameron not to go. Here&apos;s a list of the world leaders in Canc\u00fan that I&apos;m aware of:\u2022\u00a0Jacob Zuma, South Africa\u2022 Evo Morales, Bolivia\u2022 Felipe Calderon, Mexico\u2022 Bharrat Jagdeo, Guyana\u2022\u00a0Jens Stoltenberg, Norway\u2022 Doris Leuthard, Switzerland\u2022 Meles Zenawi, Ethiopia\u2022 Raila Odinga, Kenya(let me know if I&apos;ve missed any - I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;m missing several, and am struggling to find a single source at the UN that lists those attending)       We cannot wait any longer naively expecting the UN process to lead selfish states to an agreement. It is now time to look for an alternative solution. If no global agreement can currently be reached, Europe should take the initiative and pursue a regional agreement.  While political and media attention has fixed on glitzy summits like Copenhagen and Cancun, an existing EU agreement that could provide the solution gathers dust. The Cotonou Agreement was signed in 2000 between the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of 79 states and the European Union (EU) for economical, social and environmental cooperation. It provides a framework through which development policy is deployed. It contains an environmental aspect and it could be extended. ...The agreement could be a model for a global agreement and reassert the EU&apos;s leadership role at global negotiations.   1.16pm: So if Canc\u00fan does end in a deadlock - and that&apos;s still a very big if - what happens next? Professor Ludwig Kr\u00e4mer, an environmental law expert who works at ClientEarth, has emailed me his idea for an alternative to the current UN process:  1.47pm: John Vidal, one of our two correspondents in Canc\u00fan, has woken up and recalled yesterday&apos;s late night events over the phone to me:     John Vidal    [Bolivian president] Evo Morales stole the show with the most theatrical press conference, which included Mayan priests, admirals, indigenous peoples, advisers and anyone else he could think of. It was followed by a rally in downtown Cancun, which featured brass bands, music and denunciations of the American empire and the whole approach of the west to cutting carbon emissions using carbon markets and offsets. &quot;If we send the Kyoto protocol to the rubbish bin, we are responsible for ecocide and genocide, because we will be sending many people to their deaths,&quot; said Morales.  1.59pm: Some light relief on YouTube that sums up the Groundhog Day feeling some close followers of the climate talks might be experiencing, courtesy of the still-surprising-popular Xtranormal &apos;text-to-film&apos; service:            (hat-tip to Alex Randall)  2.13pm: Guest blogger Sylvia Rowley has written an inspiring post for us today on upcoming youth climate activists. There are no Tamsin Omonds, Ben Stewarts or Leila Deens - these are the next generation of names to watch. They&apos;re a diverse bunch. Here&apos;s Naomi Ralph, a 25 year-old climate justice campaigner:  Environmental problems are not just a white, middle-class, liberal concern  And Isabel Bottoms, a 21 year-old co-founder of UNfairplay:  It sounds boring [doing admin to help poor countries at UN climate negotiations], and in all honesty it is pretty boring, except it happens to be essential.   2.19pm: While we wait for things to get moving in Canc\u00fan, here&apos;s PricewaterhouseCoopers&apos; take on what would be a &apos;good outcome&apos; today:  There is optimism in Cancun that an agreement will be reached on fast-start funding, despite attempts by some countries to link this to other, more difficult, issues such as MRV and technology transfer. For some that will be progress since Copenhagen, but for many the reality is that this will simply release funds pledged a year ago. That in itself is important given the frustration that little has been dispersed [in funding]. - Jon Williams, PwC  And Oxfam&apos;s:  It is essential that a new fair Climate Fund be established at Cancun, with at least 50 per cent of climate funds allocated for adaptation needs. Women must be at the heart of the Fund so that the money is delivered to them and other groups affected most by the impacts of climate change.    2.23pm: There&apos;s a webcast due to start in 10 minutes at the conference - watch this space for any interesting developments.  2.45pm: Okay, so that opening meeting has been postponed for another 50 minutes. In the meantime, the Canadian member of the Adopt a Negotiator site has just posted this forceful blogpost about deferring action (see also the YouTube video further down this live blog):  Canc\u00fan should not be a stepping stone! This year&apos;s conference in Canc\u00fan should be doing what Copenhagen was supposed to do last year: establish a fair, ambitious, and legally binding agreement. Short-sighted politics, disconnected from climate science, disconnected from those whose lives will be affected by climate change (read: all of us), and disconnected from principles of justice or equity, are driving these negotiations, and driving those who are happy to call Canc\u00fan a stepping stone. Let&apos;s just say that those who are willing to step on Canc\u00fan likely won&apos;t hesitate to step on a lot more.   3.02pm: Here&apos;s some good video footage of yesterday&apos;s speeches by ministers at the summit, including Japan on its Kyoto protocol stance, Saudi Arabia&apos;s oil minister saying the outcome must not affect petroleum products (no big surprise there), as well as statements from Russia, Spain, Canada and more.           Australia&apos;s climate minister explicitly drew the link between today&apos;s result and the future of the UN talks:  it is imperative for the credibiltity of this process [at the UNFCCC negotiations] that we are able to make progress here at this conference.  Todd Stern, the US lead negotiator, had little to offer beyond promises that America would continue to work towards domestic policies to cut emissions. But prospects don&apos;t look too bright there - after the US mid-term elections, our US correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg wrote that Obama&apos;s green agenda had been &quot;crushed&quot; due to the presence of several new Republican members of Congress who deny the existence of man-made climate change.  3.23pm: John Ashe, who is chairing talks on the future of the Kyoto protocol, tells Reuters it is &quot;hard to say&quot; whether there will be progress today, despite last minute efforts by Mexico:  At least there&apos;s confidence that she [Mexican foreign minister Patricia Espinosa] could put something for them [governments] to consider. This was not the case in Copenhagen. If there&apos;s one thing that we&apos;ve learned in Cancun is that trust has been restored  Overall, the mood music coming out of Canc\u00fan is pretty hard to interpret. The general consensus, put forward by Chris Huhne yesterday, seems to be that they&apos;re on a knife-edge and could go either way, though Russia&apos;s unequivocal statement last night opposing an extension of the Kyoto protocol has certainly cast a cloud on today&apos;s talks.  3.50pm: Mexico&apos;s foreign minister and president of the summit, Patricia Espinosa, has just delayed her 8.30am (Canc\u00fan-time) conference a second time, and it&apos;s now scheduled for 11am (i.e. 5pm here in the UK). None of this bodes particularly well for the assurances that this wouldn&apos;t be a summit that went down to the wire... and then kept on going into the early hours.  3.54pm: Here&apos;s an amusing - but related - diversion from the talks. This press release, purportedly from Koch Industries which is infamous for allegedly donating millions of pounds to climate sceptics, has just landed in my inbox:      KOCH INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES NEW ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS WICHITA, Kan. \u2013 Koch Industries remains committed to environmental responsibility and stewardship, announcing today that it will restructure its support for organizations that undertake climate change research and advocacy. Since its founding, Koch Industries has been focused on achieving environmental excellence and using resources efficiently. Through extensive and award-winning efforts and investments, Koch Industries has implemented innovative practices that reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacture and distribution of our products. Based on recent internal evaluations of Koch Industries priorities, the company will be restructuring its support of climate change research and advocacy initiatives and will discontinue contributions to groups whose positions on climate change no longer match those of the company&apos;s leadership, beginning in January 2011. This has hoaxsters The Yes Men written all over it, I think, not least in the tell-tale fake domain name given for the press officer at the bottom. What do you think?  4.20pm: James Randerson, our science and environment news editor, writes:  Before the talks are even over, Japan is already being cast as the villain of Cancun (much in the same way that China was seen by some as the wrecker of Copenhagen - a position that had some truth to it but was far from the whole story). TckTckTck has produced a spoof movie poster (see below) that parodies the animated film Spirited away . It proclaims: &quot;Japan present a threatening to abandon Kyoto film Climate treaty: Washed away?&quot; Meanwhile, environmental campaigner Joss Garman speculates about dire diplomatic consequences for Japan if it does not soften its position in a piece by the BBC&apos;s Richard Black: &quot;It may be possible that if Japan keeps blocking the progress of these climate talks, and if they&apos;re seen to be undermining the UN process, it could start to threaten their hopes for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.&quot; I have no idea whether that is true or not, but despite the diplomatic pressure being thrown at Japan at the moment they show no sign of changing their position. It is interesting though that Japan has been singled out rather than others opposed to moving on with Kyoto such as Russia, Canada and Turkey.      Spoof movie poster, inspired from Spirited away, and starring Japan Prime minister Naoto Kan issued by Avaaz.org & Tcktcktck.org to protest against Japan refusing to inscribe its emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Photograph: Tcktcktck.org     You can hear a discussion of Japan&apos;s emphatic announcement in the first week of the conference on our Canc\u00fan podcast. That panel includes Michael Jacobs, former special adviser to Gordon Brown on climate change, and senior research fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Rob Bailey, Oxfam&apos;s climate change adviser.  4.36pm: Development campaigners at the World Development Movement are not too impressed by progress at Canc\u00fan. The UK-based NGO&apos;s Julian Oram emails to say:      Despite the urgent threat of climate change is urgent, rich countries have continued to engage in playground politics at these international negotiations. Countries which dare to dissent from flawed approaches to reducing emissions, such as carbon markets or tree plantation offsets, are excluded, marginalised and vilified. It&apos;s also worrying that civil society groups here as official observers to hold governments to account are increasingly finding it harder to access the meetings spaces, or even to raise objections around un-transparent and undemocratic processes. It remains to be seen if the next few hours will improve Oram&apos;s view of the process.  4.38pm: John Vidal has just been briefed by the UK energy and climate secretary Chris Huhne on his view of where the talks are at. Huhne is particularly well placed to give oversight, as he&apos;s been tasked by the Mexican president of the talks to build bridges on one of the key areas of disagreement - whether or not to extend the Kyoto protocol. We&apos;ll have a story shortly.  5.04pm: Our correspondent John Vidal emails with some good news:     John Vidal    If you&apos;re into peat, cheer. After four long years negotiation, the draft Kyoto protocol text on wetlands is out and, amazingly for campaigners, it will allow countries to reduce their emissions from degraded peatlands under the Kyoto protocol by rewetting them. This is a huge step forward, and hats off to Iceland and Belarus. It&apos;s good news for Britain too, because Scotland has extensive degraded peatlands. The main beneficiary will be Indonesia, one of the biggest carbon emitters in the world because of its deforestation, which has dried out thousands of square miles of peat for its oil palm plantations. But don&apos;t jump for joy too soon! It&apos;s a voluntary measure, which means there will be no compulsion on countries to rewet their peatlands, and it depends on the final package of agreements made here. Because it comes under both the LULUCF (a wacky acronym for land use change and forestry, which only about eight people in the world understand,) and Redd (reduced emissions from deforestaion and deghradation) negotiations, if either of these fall in the final negotiations later today, all could be lost. But this is the first good news in these talks.   5.08pm: From our US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg on, respectively, email and Twitter:  It&apos;s worth noting that the most positive comment the EU could muster in their briefing just now was &quot;Everybody is still on speaking terms&quot; (Joke Schauvliege).   5.23pm:   We really do not have more time  So says the president for the conference, Mexican foreign minister Patricia Espinosa. Things are starting to move in Canc\u00fan. The texts that could (or could not) form the basis of a deal are expected in roughly three hours&apos; time - so expect the &apos;big reveal&apos; around 8pm UK-time and 2pm Canc\u00fan-time. John Vidal and Suzanne Goldenberg will be on hand to pick up reaction, and we&apos;ll scoop that onto the live blog here.  5.27pm: Damian Carrington, our head of environment, will be taking over the live blog shortly. He&apos;s getting his head round the state of play now and wrestling with why Russia is anti-Kyoto:      I&apos;m puzzled by Russia&apos;s refusal to sign up to another round of Kyoto protocol commitments. Why? Because Russia, along with other ex-Soviet states, are sitting on a goldmine of &quot;hot air&quot; carbon credits. The Kyoto baseline year is 1990, when the Soviet Union&apos;s heavy industry was belching out vast clouds of greenhouse gases. When the state collapsed, so did the industry, meaning Russia et al were way under their Kyoto targets, and so have tens of billions of dollars of spare permits. Russia said last night that another round under the existing Kyoto protocol &quot;would be neither scientifically, economically or politically effective&quot;. Scientifically, they are right, as the cuts would not be enough to keep warming to under 2C, as the world&apos;s governments have pledged. Politically, they are also right: Kyoto excludes the big emerging economies of China, Brazil and India, and the US and Japan, won&apos;t accept that.  But economically? It&apos;s true that trading all the Soviet hot air permits would be a waste of money \u2013 but is Russia really offering up the billions it can lay claim to? Ideas very welcome by Twitter or in the comments.  5.36pm: James Randerson has been watching the EU press conference. As I wrote in my first update this morning, it&apos;s clear that the credibility of the UN process is very much on the line here, no matter how low expectations are:     Guardian science correspondent James Randerson    Firstly, they were not giving much away on the details of the negotiations but made clear that all aspects of the negotiations are still on the table - nothing is locked down. When asked about progress on verification of carbon emissions reductions (something that the US believes is essential but China, for example, has resisted) Schuvliege said, &quot;I think everybody is still on speaking terms in smaller groups...I think it&apos;s not wise here and now to go into details to say what is really the problem.&quot; On Japan and Russia&apos;s position, that they will not move to a second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol, Schauvliege said that there had been a lot of contact between the EU and both delegations last night. She said that both are arguing, &quot;Kyoto as such is not enough. There must be more...I hope they want to compromise like we want to do.&quot; Hedegaard added, &quot;We had a very frank exchange of views with Japan,&quot; which is of course diplomatic speak for a stand up blazing row. Echoing comments from Chris Huhne about the prospect of a &quot;zombie conference&quot;, she said that the entire UN process is now at stake if there is not some kind of result from Canc\u00fan. &quot;Everyone who believes that we should have an international process...must also realise that if we do not get things done here in Cancun then its hard to see how we will get from A to B,&quot; said Hedegaard. &quot;I think that everybody realises what&apos;s at stake including the two countries that you mentioned.&quot; She even raise the prospect of the talks turning into the so-called &quot;Doha round&quot; of international trade talks that have achieved virtually nothing despite zeppelins full of diplomatic hot air. The Alliance of Small Island States have suggested putting a time limit for a deal of Durban in South Africa next year. &quot;Our wish has been to get the legally binding deal in South Africa,&quot; said Hedegaard, adding that whether that is possible depends on how much progress the negotiators make tonight. But she pointedly did not endorse the notionof a time-limit.  5.48pm: Here is an early evening summary: \u2022 Russia has said it will not renew its commitment to the Kyoto protocol.  The country&apos;s climate change envoy, Alexander Berditsky, said: &quot;Russia will not participate in the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol.&quot; (see 11.03am).\u2022 The talks look certain to run on late into the night - and probably early hours of tomorrow - despite earlier assurances that they would finish around midnight UK-time. A state-of-play opening statement by Mexican foreign minister Patricia Espinosa was repeatedly delayed, who is now telling the media &quot;We really do not have more time.&quot; (see 5.23pm and 3.50pm)\u2022 With hopes poised on a knife-edge, Chris Huhne says that the credibility of the UN process is at stake, and warns against the talks generating a &quot;zombie conference&quot; in South Africa next year. &quot;Next year people will say, well, we&apos;re not going to make any progress, and we end up with a zombie conference where there won&apos;t be anybody at a senior enough level to take any serious decisions at all,&quot; he said. (see 9am, 4.38pm and 5.36pm) That&apos;s it from me for today. I&apos;ll hand you over now to the capable hands of our head of environment, Damian Carrington, who will be doing his level best to keep blogging until the outcome of Canc\u00fan becomes clear.  6.06pm: @jossgarman tweets me with an explanation for the Russian stance against another Kyoto round (see 5.27pm). It&apos;s because they want to hang on to their hot air credits. Other European countries don&apos;t want them to - so Russia is saying, OK we&apos;ll bring the whole thing down.    6.14pm: John Vidal, our environment editor and in Cancun, has just been speaking to the UK&apos;s climate change secretary Chris Huhne, on the prospect for a deal tonight. Read the full blog here, but here&apos;s a key quote. John says to remember Huhne is a glass-half-full type of guy:  Everything could come unravelled but I got the impression that we have found a potential way through, and with political will, it could work. There&apos;s still all to play for. We&apos;re in a much better position at this stage than we were in Copenhagen. But there is nothing to stop one or more countries having a hissy fit and throwing their toys out of the pram.   6.54pm: If you missed Suzanne Goldenberg&apos;s startling blog yesterday, you missed an excruciating demonstration of how hard getting agreements on climate is. The prime minister of Norway and the president of Guyana were on stage, apparently to extol the virtues of the deal they had agreed in which Norway paid Guyana to stop deforestation. Bharrat Jagdeo, Guyana&apos;s president, hadn&apos;t read the script:  It&apos;s a nightmare. It is a test of the sincerity of the developed world, and the delivery on development assistance has been abysmal. We have not seen a single cent.   7.05pm: The latest from our environment editor John Vidal in Cancun:       The 34 least developed countries, the 50-plus in the Africa group, as well as the 27 small island states and the Alba countries of Latin America \u2013 basically the poor world outside India and China \u2013 are positioning themselves in a series of moving and passionate statements in case there is a bust up later.  Bruno Sekoli of Lesotho, chair of the Least developed countries (ldcs) talks for them all: &quot;The obective of these talks is to mitigate climate change and help developing countries adapt. The situation in these talks is extremely disappointing. Concentrations of greenhouse gases have risen at alarming rates and its worrying to think of the situation in just 10 years time. Most ldcs are already fighting for survival. The situation is worsening by the day.  &quot;We have the Kyoto protocol on the table. It remains the only document on the table. Any attempt to do away with it would be a disaster. Our message to the rich governments is this: I appeal to developed countries to do what is right. They have shown economic, even military leadership. They must now show climate leadership.&quot;   7.15pm: Another live update from Cancun, this time on the Kyoto problem dogging the talks, from our environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg:     Suzanne Goldenberg     Brazil&apos;s chief climate negotiator Luiz Figueiredo has just done a walk-by of the press with a relatively sunny view of efforts to find a way around the showdown over the future of the Kyoto protocol. When the summit chair, Mexico&apos;s Patricia Espinosa, was pairing up countries and dividing up work topics at the beginning of this week Britain and Brazil got Kyoto. Figuerido said he believes progress has been made in working groups to draft a text that will extend Kyoto and ensure there is no gap when the first commitment period ends at the end of 2012. &quot;I am optimistic that we are going to get to an adequate solution,&quot; he said. It&apos;s not immediately clear when the talks took place or which countries were in the room. Of the Kyoto refusniks, Japan and Russia were there but not Canada. Other so-called Basic countries, China, India and South Africa were there. So were Bolivia and Venezuela. Figuerido suggested their presence means that the solution could fly. &quot;I am confident due to the number of countries involved in producing the text including these with very strong opinions,&quot; he said.  But the people that were in the room are not necessarily those with the power to approve such deals. There are reports this morning that Japanese negotiators had also come around to proposed solution on the Kyoto problem late on Thursday - only to pull back after instructions from Tokyo.  7.21pm: Live update from Cancun on the negotiations over how the money promised in Copenhagen by rich nations will be delivered, from our environment editor John Vidal:       My mole in the finance talks tells me that countries have reached broad agreement on setting up a Climate Fund. It would come under the UN, will be set up in a year, and negotiations are going on over who is on the board. From being a low 3 out of ten on the optimism scale for the talks this morning, he is now at 4.5.   7.32pm: Here is one \u2013 much needed \u2013 tiny ray of light, says our environment correspondent in Cancun, Suzanne Goldenberg. It comes from dark soils of peatlands, which store vast amounts of carbon but have been vulnerable to destruction:     Suzanne Goldenberg     Campaigners say negotiators have produced a draft agreement to include peatlands in forest protection or REDD programmes. That&apos;s a breakthrough for those who have been working to get the international community to focus on peatlands. The effort got a boost in making their case on Wednesday when the billionaire financier George Soros told a side event he was very concerned about emissions produced by destruction of peat in Indonesia. He noted that millions of acres of peat land in rain forest had been cleared out in the 1990s with the intention of growing rice. But Soros, who is investing in conservation projects in Indonesia, said he had seen a recent shift in policy with the authorities imposing a temporary two-year ban on cutting peatlands. He said the move had required a total change in thinking about forests and natural resources. &quot;Forests were treated earlier like a gold mine or like oil. It was mining basically and now it has to be preservation.&quot;  7.45pm: Bill McKibben, founder of the 350.org campaign and influential environmentalist has just emailed a statement from Cancun. It is a useful reminder of the gap between even the best possible deal on offer and what the science says is needed to prevent dangerous global warming:       These talks enter their final hours shrouded in a fog of unreality - the biggest and most powerful nations on earth simply aren&apos;t paying attention to physics and chemistry. Which is why we&apos;ll continue to have unprecedented strings of disasters. And it&apos;s also why the grassroots movement to demand real action will continue to mushroom.  We&apos;re not big enough yet to beat the fossil fuel industry and its allies, but we&apos;re gaining. And if the most vulnerable nations will stand with civil society and ignore the bullying and buyoffs from the US, the movement will grow faster still.  8.20pm: A new development from our environment editor John Vidal in Cancun, which could be read as a sign of hope or of desperation:       Both the UN and the US have cancelled their press conferences. This usually means that things are going wrong, big time. Or possibly that things are going well but they don&apos;t want to share the news (ha ha!). Or, most likely here, they are all so tired that they can&apos;t wake up the officials.  Meanwhile Nnimmo Bassey, the chair of Friends of the Earth International, is saying that the talks may now be officially extended a full 24 hours. So in theory we could all be here until midnight Saturday (UK time) and beyond. I&apos;ve also bumped into Hermantha Withanage, a Sri lankan environmental scientist, who says the politicians need to wake up to the reality of what is happening at the grassroots. &quot;The solutions are in the hands of local people but people in these negotiating rooms are not listening to them. They are struggling to keep their politics while most people are struggling to survive. No one will excuse the negotiators and the Annex 1 [rich] countries if they try to kill Kyoto&quot;, he says. On a lighter note, the British delegation offices are about a kilometre from the negotiating halls - though only 50 yards from the turquoise Caribbean - but the negotiating team has taken to bikes which they whizz around on, striking fear into walkers. And no, Reuters pics prove there are no ministerial cars following them with boxes of papers.  8.32pm: More suggestions that the climate talks are going into overtime  9.15pm: The climate talks really are going into overtime, says our environment editor John Vidal in Cancun:  We&apos;d better dig in for a long night. I&apos;ve just heard from the most reliable source that the final plenary session of the 193 countries will now not start till around midnight Cancun time. That&apos;s 6am in UK. If that is so, then the earliest any decision will come is likely to be after lunch on Saturday in Britain, or even later because countries tend to take a very long time to debate this complex stuff. When the Mexican chair of the talks said she was confident that the talks would conclude by 6.30pm, she may well have been right. Shame no-one thought to ask her which day!   9.20pm: And here&apos;s our take for the first edition of the paper tomorrow. The way things are going it may not be far off being right (ie talks still on a knife edge).  The future of international climate diplomacy was put into jeopardy today as the UN global warming conference at Canc\u00fan entered its final hours with no resolution to the divide between rich and poor countries. &quot;We have very limited time to make a last push,&quot; warned Mexico&apos;s foreign minister, Patricia Espinosa. &quot;No party can lose sight of what is at stake.&quot; On what should have been the final hours of two weeks of negotiations, Connie Hedegaard, the European Union&apos;s climate change commissioner, warned that the UN process was at risk of becoming a never-ending set of meetings unless they reach a positive outcome at Canc\u00fan. &quot;Everyone must realise that if we don&apos;t get things done here in Canc\u00fan, it&apos;s very difficult to see how you go from A to B,&quot; she said. &quot;If we leave Canc\u00fan without getting anything out of this, I think multilateralism has a problem.&quot; After two weeks of talks, despite an all-night bargaining session, ministers had managed by mid-morning on the final day to agree on just one paragraph of text.  Read the rest of the story here.  9.44pm: This just in from Reuters, on the latest version of the negotiating text:  UN climate talks on Friday produced a new text that hinted at compromise over an impasse on emissions targets between rich and poor nations, which could unlock a modest deal on climate funds. The text reflected &quot;the current status of the negotiations,&quot; said a note from the Mexican hosts of the 192-nation talks in Cancun in its preamble. The draft referred to a &quot;second commitment period&quot; of the Kyoto Protocol, the extension of which beyond its first 2008-2012 round has been a central roadblock in the two-week talks.It said that it &quot;agrees ... to ensure that there is no gap between the first and second commitment periods.&quot;   The Kyoto protocol is the only existing legally binding treaty, but only demands cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from rich, industrialised nations.  9.51pm: The global diplomatic offensive launched by the US to get as many nations as possible to back the Copenhagen Accord reached as far as the Vatican, according to a diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks tonight. From the cable:  [Vatican diplomat] Conversi&apos;s offer to support the U.S., even if discreetly, is significant because the Vatican is often reluctant to appear to compromise its independence and moral authority by associating itself with particular lobbying efforts. Even more important than the Vatican&apos;s lobbying assistance, however, is the influence the Pope&apos;s guidance can have on public opinion in countries with large Catholic majorities and beyond.  I wrote a full account of the US tactics revealed in the leaked cables last week.  10.04pm:   10.08pm:  10.11pm: More on the new negotiating text from our environment editor John Vidal in Cancun:       The draft text for the one of the two UN negotiating strands is now out: the Kyoto Protocol strand, which excludes the US. But we will have to wait for the parallel strand, the Long-term Cooperative Action strand.  The good news is that the KP text specifically mentions that a 25-40% cut is needed in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to 1990. Plus it refers to the &quot;gigatonne gap&quot;, the 2bn tonnes of CO2 missing between the ambition to keep temperature rises to 2C and the pledges nations have made so far. People here are enthusiastic:  &quot;If this gets approved we are far further than we thought coming into Cancun,&quot; says Greenpeace international climate policy director Wendel Trio. &quot;It mentions the gigatonne gap and the process needed to review the pledges later, and it urges countries to make deeper cuts. It&apos;s very positive. We knew that the pledges were not going to change but we needed recognition that more work is needed. At the moment the level of ambition of pledges is 11-16%, so 25-40% would double this. If this reflects the ambition in the LCA text, then we have a party. Its not what we want, but given the politics here this is OK.&quot; The billion dollar question is whether this text will be knocked down in the final plenary session of the summit here in Cancun. The most likely suspects would be Canada, Russia, or Japan, who don&apos;t want a second commitment period for Kyoto.  What we do not know, and won&apos;t for many hours, is whether deals have already been done. It could sail through or it could fall - but so far it lives.  10.47pm: A quick aside from my colleague James Randerson on an interesting scientific spat. It centres on a paper by Dr Andrew Dessler at Texas A&amp;M University from Science today. It is about whether, on average, clouds increase or decrease warming. The paper has been attacked by Dr Roy Spencer, a scientist who is sceptical about anthropogenic global warming (and also happens to be a proponent of intelligent design). The two have an interesting but technical disagreement that sometime when it is not so late I&apos;d like to think about more carefully. But leaving aside the content of the science for now, Spencer makes one outrageousclaim:  Dessler&apos;s paper is being announced on probably THE best day for it to support the IPCC&apos;s COP-16 meeting here in Cancun, and whatever agreement is announced tomorrow in the way of international climate policy. I suspect \u2013 but have no proof of it \u2013 that Dessler was under pressure to get this paper published to blunt the negative impact our work has had on the IPCC&apos;s efforts.  He seems to be suggesting that Dessler decided the publication timing for political ends. As any scientist will tell you, it is hard enough getting journals to publish in the year of their choosing, let alone on a particular day. Dessler has responded to the critique of the science and the conspiracy charge on RealClimate:  I can assure everyone that no one pressured me in any aspect of the publication of this paper. As Dr. Spencer knows well, authors have no control over when a paper ultimately gets published. And as far as my interest in influencing the policy debate goes, I&apos;ll just say that I&apos;m in College Station this week, while Dr. Spencer is in Cancun. In fact, Dr. Spencer had a press conference in Cancun \u2014 about my paper. I didn&apos;t have a press conference [anywhere] about my paper. Draw your own conclusion.   11.19pm: Here&apos;s more on the Kyoto issue from Cancun, from our environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg:     Suzanne Goldenberg     A European proposal to resolve the extremely difficult question of the future of the Kyoto Protocol would extend simply extend the current phase of the treaty for two years beyond its end date of 2012. But how would that actually work? That&apos;s not at all clear, even to the experts. There is no mention of such an extension in the most recent draft text. Some have suggested the fix could be done through a &quot;gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; not to raise objections over Kyoto. The main thing consideration though is to patch together a solution now and avoid a collapse in Cancun. &quot;It&apos;s looking for a way to kick the can down the road and give them more time to work out the things that are not right,&quot; Jennifer Haverkamp of the Environmental Defence Fund tells me.   11.20pm: While we&apos;re waiting for the other (LCA) draft negotiating text to appear - and a possible statement from hosts Mexico - my colleague James Randerson has a quick plug for the Guardian&apos;sUltimate Climate FAQ:     Guardian science correspondent James Randerson     The plan is to build up a set of clear, accurate and balanced answers to all the questions that our readers have ever asked themselves about climate change. The initial aim is for the Guardian team, with the help of various partners and, crucially, our millions of readers, to produce online the world&apos;s best user-friendly guide to all aspects of climate change, from the science to the politics, economics and more. We will be partnering with expert organisations and individuals to inform the project, and are pleased to announce the first of those is the Met Office, which will be offering scientific advice. We launched the first answer today - the question &quot;What exactly is the climate?&quot; Please submit your questions here.  11.44pm:   11.55pm: The second draft negotiation text is out: the Long-term Cooperative Action strand, which includes the US and runs alongside the Kyoto Protocol-based strand (see 10.11pm below). Oxfam have sent me their response, from their international climate change policy adviser Tim Gore:        This breathes new life into the talks, tackling the Kyoto conundrum and setting up a Climate Fund. Progress in the mitigation package would provide confidence to developing countries that richer nations are serious about a second commitment period. Emission cuts pledged under the Copenhagen Accord could also be set as a minimum. However, more needs to be done to address long-term finance for the Climate Fund and while there is reference to funding both adaptation and mitigation this is only a first step in addressing balance between the two. It is very disappointing that any reference of gender has been dropped. More soon.  12.01am:   12.20am: John Vidal, our environment editor in Cancun, gives an instant assessment of the new negotiating text from the Long-term Cooperative Action strand, which includes the US and runs alongside the Kyoto Protocol-based strand:       The LCA text, the parallel negotiating text to the Kyoto text, is at last out. It&apos;s long and detailed but immediate impressions suggest ambition has not entirely vanished. It has references to a long-term goal of holding temperatures to 2C and a future review of whether the target should be revised to 1.5C, which is as good as it was going to get. But any reference to a legally-binding instrument that might follow the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 is out. Good points include, as I predicted on this blog a few hours ago, are that agreement has been reached on a new Climate Fund, to be administered by the UN not the World Bank. The details are interesting: it will have 25 members of developing countries on its board, compared to only 15 for developed countries. This gives developing countries a much stronger role. The World Bank is a trustee. On cutting emissions, the numbers that countries pledged in the Copehagen Accord now go into the final text (though they are way short of keeping temperature rise to 2C). And on the controversial issue of the monitoring and verification of countries&apos; actions, the developing countries have mountains to climb: there are pages and pages of text about what they will be expected to do. But there is next to no reference to how the US will be inspected, or by whom. Global goals for emissions cuts and proposed peak emissions years are pushed down the road to next year.  12.29am: Patricia Espinosa, Mexico&apos;s foreign minister and the president of this summit, has just made a brief announcement on the release of the two draft texts (see below). Our correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, was there:     Suzanne Goldenberg     She has congratulated negotiators for making &quot;remarkable progress&quot; but also reminded them that the world will have to live with the decisions that lie ahead. She gave the delegations two hours to review the drafts, and then reconvene in the series of plenary sessions that will \u2013 eventually \u2013 produce a concrete outcome of one kind or another at Cancun. But nobody expects the real work to get going much before midnight, local time.  12.50am: Right, that&apos;s it for now, but we&apos;ll be back later this morning UK time to let you know what&apos;s been happening through the night in Cancun. The final note has been a positive one, with the two key draft negotiating texts (see below) winning a standing ovation for the summit president, Patricia Espinosa who is Mexico&apos;s foreign secretary, and positive reactions from quite a few of those at COP16 (see below).  There&apos;s a long way to go to get agreement on a final text which solves key issues of finance, Kyoto, verification and more. And the measures in the texts will need to be strengthened in future to really tackle global warming. But bright moments have been pretty rare in climate change summits over the last few years, so here it is, via YouTube:             8.54am:      Guardian science correspondent James Randerson    Good morning all.James Randerson taking over the baton with the latest from the UN climate talks in Cancun. A quick update:Two draft negotiating texts (one on the Kyoto Protocol and one on the Long-term Cooperative Action (LCA) strand - the bit that includes the US) were presented around 9 hours ago, or around 6pm in Cancun.  Since then delegates have had time to digest what is in those documents and no doubt engage in some back-stage arm twisting. I just spoke to Guardian environment editor John Vidal. He tells me that the mood at the talks is cautiously optimistic that there will be some kind of agreement, but there are plenty of spanners that could be about to be lobbied into the works. The resumption of the plenary session had bee scheduled for 00.30 Cancun time, but it was later put back by 3 hours - presumably to allow for more arm twisting.  8.59am: Patricia Espinosa, Mexico&apos;s foreign secretary and chair of the talks has just reopened the plenary session. She said, &quot;tonight we will make some historic decisions&quot;. She gave a brief summary of what will happen. First the ad-hoc working group on the Kyoto Protocol will report, then the ad-hoc working group of the Long-term Cooperative Action (LCA) strand. Then there will be statements from the floor. Then - maybe - they will make a deal.  Bolivia&apos;s Pablo Solon has been expressing his country&apos;s reservations with the Kyoto Protocol text to the meeting.  9.13am:   9.15am:  Espinosa, the chair of the talks, has gavelled through the Kyoto text, over Bolivia&apos;s objection to rapturous applause from the floor.  9.18am:  This is great drama. You can watch it live here - although at the moment proceedings are in Spanish and there is no translation.  9.21am:  Espinosa is now inviting the full meeting to adopt the LCA text and make it part of the &quot;Cancun agreement&quot; - &quot;A new era of international cooperation on climate change&quot;. Bolivia now has the floor and is objecting.  9.25am:  Bolivia appears to be conducting diplomacy/negotiations by tweet.  9.26am:   9.29am:  Todd Stern, the US negotiator, has just intervened to suggest that the meeting adopts procedures that are &quot;closer to general agreement than consensus&quot;. In other words - &quot;we should ignore what Bolivia is saying&quot;.  9.33am:  Espinosa: &quot;The decision is thereby adopted.&quot; Standing ovation and cheers around the hall.  9.36am:  Bolivia is extremely unhappy.  9.39am:   9.41am:  Guardian US Environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg is tweeting from the Conference hall. Mexican President Calderon is addressing the meeting.  9.44am:  Calderon has praised the negotiators for restoring hope in multilateralism. Also, Friends of the Earth UK has been in touch via twitter.  9.47am:  Calderon, the Mexican president, is still addressing the meeting.  9.52am:  Bolivia is objecting on twitter to some of the triumphalism of the International Youth Climate Movement. &quot;An agreement that allows a 4 degree increase is no victory for the vast majority of humanity&quot; Here&apos;s the response from @IYCM  10.01am:  Suzanne Goldenberg has pointed out this disturbing video of a man who is reportedly a Reuters photographer being roughed up by UN guards on a bus. It is not clear why (via @democracynow twitter feed). More on that later if we get it.             10.10am:  The negotiator from Bangladesh is addressing the plenary: He praised the Mexican presidency of the talks for having &quot;restored the faith of all the parties&quot; and hailed the Cancun agreement as a &quot;great compromise&quot;. But he said the Least Developed Countries have made &quot;great sacrifices on the altar of United Nations cooperation&quot;. But he ended on a note of urgency. &quot;We simply can&apos;t wait because hundreds of millions of people...are suffering day in day out and they can&apos;t wait.&quot; Norway&apos;s lead negotiator praised Patricia Espinosa, Mexico&apos;s foreign secretary and chair of the talks in the plenary, &quot;You have got more praise tonight than most human beings will get in a lifetime.&quot;  10.47am:  We are moving our live coverage of the talks to a new blog today. Please follow reaction to the Cancun accord there."}, {"sentences": ["Set in 1960s Tokyo, the Japanese-language film centres on the troubled, at times tortuous, life of a 19-year-old university student, Toru Watanabe, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, and his relationships with Naoko and Midori.", "&quot;I&apos;ve read some other love stories, but this one is very special,&quot; he said during a recent visit to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Film", "Haruki Murakami", "Culture", "Books", "Venice film festival 2010", "Japan", "World news", "Venice film festival", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-10T13:09:29Z", "title": "Bated breath as Norwegian Wood film opens in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/10/norwegian-wood-film-haruki-murakami", "article": "Any film director who adapts an acclaimed novel runs the risk of upsetting the author&apos;s hypersensitive fans. The risks magnify when the writer is the famously ruminative Haruki Murakami. The Japanese author&apos;s surreal treatment of the ills of modern society has won him millions of fans worldwide and a reputation for introspection that will now extend to the big screen. The film adaptation of his bestseller Norwegian Wood opens in cinemas in Japan tomorrow, 23 years after the book first enraptured readers with its themes of love, loss and mental illness. Aware that Murakami&apos;s devotees will be looking to pounce on every perceived deviation from the novel, the movie&apos;s director, Tran Anh Hung, says every effort has been made to capture the essence of the writer&apos;s work. &quot;Murakami protected his work,&quot; Tran said of his first meeting with the &quot;quiet, very serious and very careful&quot; author in 2004. &quot;He gave us two conditions. One is that he would like to see the script. The other is that he would like to know what the budget would be for the movie.&quot; The French-Vietnamese director, and the film&apos;s producer, Shinji Ogawa, corresponded with Murakami for four years before winning his approval to make the film in 2008. Set in 1960s Tokyo, the Japanese-language film centres on the troubled, at times tortuous, life of a 19-year-old university student, Toru Watanabe, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, and his relationships with Naoko and Midori. Rinko Kikuchi, who was nominated for an Oscar for her supporting role in the 2006 movie Babel, plays the vulnerable Naoko, while the model Kiko Mizuhara makes her film debut as Midori. Tran said he had wanted to turn Murakami&apos;s best-known novel into a film since reading it in French translation in 1994 and was convinced the book&apos;s universal themes would work as well on screen as they had in print. &quot;I&apos;ve read some other love stories, but this one is very special,&quot; he said during a recent visit to Tokyo. &quot;The book reveals some shadows that are hidden inside you. &quot;It was just a story of first love, but the first love that you lose almost immediately once you have it. &quot;I think this is a universal experience. This is probably why the book was such a success worldwide.&quot; That said, the 47-year-old director admitted there were moments when he wondered if he had done justice to a book that turned Murakami into an internationally acclaimed author. &quot;When I read the book, I really had this intuition that it was possible to make a film out of it,&quot; Tran said. &quot;And then, when you start working on it, everything that&apos;s left is fear \u2013 fear of not being able to do it.&quot; Norwegian Wood has sold more than 10m copies in Japan and 2.6m overseas since it was published in 1987. His other books, notably Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, have been translated into dozens of languages. Norwegian Wood represents another shift in emphasis for Tran, whose first movie, the moody The Scent of Green Papaya (1993), won the Camera d&apos;Or at Cannes and was nominated for an Academy award. He won the Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival for Cyclo, his gritty 1995 film about a young rickshaw driver. Reviews in Japan have been mostly positive, although the film, nominated for the Golden Lion in Venice in September, did not win the prize. In the Japan Times, the veteran critic Mark Schilling praised the Taiwanese cinematographer Pin Bing Lee&apos;s &quot;dramatically stylish visuals&quot; but said that &quot;the drama of the characters&apos; intertwined and tangled lives feels curiously inert&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Muramoto, a 43-year-old Japanese citizen based in Tokyo, was killed by a high velocity bullet wound to the chest while covering protests in Bangkok&apos;s old quarter."], "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "Reuters", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-10T14:29:55Z", "title": "Leaked report reveals Thai military responsible for protesters' deaths", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/10/thai-protest-deaths-military-may", "article": "Thai soldiers were responsible for the deaths of three people at a Bangkok Buddhist temple during demonstrations in May, leaked government documents revealed today. The preliminary investigation, seen by Reuters, concluded that Thai special forces on an elevated railway track fired into the grounds of a temple where several thousand protesters had taken refuge on 19 May. A separate leaked report concluded that the bullet that killed a Reuters cameraman in protests the following month was also probably fired by a Thai soldier. The findings of the investigation flatly contradict statements by the Thai military, which has denied soldiers were responsible for the temple deaths. The report from Thailand&apos;s department of special investigation (DSI) said there was not enough evidence to determine who was responsible for three further deaths in the temple, but said all six victims were hit by high velocity bullets. &quot;There is a reasonable amount of facts, evidence and witness accounts to believe that [three] deaths resulted from security officials&apos; actions on duty,&quot; Reuters quoted investigators as saying. The report recommended that police investigate the deaths further. At the time of the protests, Amnesty International condemned the use of live ammunition against demonstrators. Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty&apos;s Thailand researcher, spoke of eyewitness accounts and video recordings showing the military firing live rounds at unarmed people. Wat Pathum Wanaram, a Buddhist temple, had been designated a safe zone for women, children, the elderly and the infirm. Thousands fled there when the military used force  to disperse protesters occupying a nearby commercial district. According to the DSI&apos;s investigation, witnesses reported scenes of chaos outside the temple as gunshots rang out and civilians fled a shopping area. One witness said he saw soldiers firing from the raised train track into a medical tent inside the compound, where two nurses treating wounded civilians were killed. In total, 91 people were killed and at least 1,800 were wounded during the unrest in April and May. More than 30 buildings were set on fire in the worst political violence in modern Thai history. The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, blamed armed elements among the protesters for the temple deaths. Another DSI report, into the death of Reuters cameraman Hiro Muramoto, quoted a witness as saying that Muramoto collapsed as gunfire flashed from the direction of soldiers. Muramoto, a 43-year-old Japanese citizen based in Tokyo, was killed by a high velocity bullet wound to the chest while covering protests in Bangkok&apos;s old quarter. &quot;There is a reasonable amount of facts and evidence to believe that the death of Hiro was due to an act of the security forces who said they were acting according to official duty,&quot; the DSI report said, recommending police investigate the case further. Thailand&apos;s government has not yet publicly released the report into his death despite intense diplomatic pressure from Japan. The leaks came amid reports that the centre for the resolution of emergency situations (CRES), an ad hoc civilian-military body, will recommend a lifting of the state of emergency that came into force in April, as it believes that the political situation has returned to normal. The US group Human Rights Watch said last month that the Thai authorities were using emergency powers to violate fundamental rights and obstruct efforts to bring abusers to justice after the clashes. It said under the state of emergency, the authorities had detained suspects without charge for extended periods, using unofficial detention facilities with inadequate safeguards against possible abuse, and had imposed widespread censorship. In addition, officials in effect have immunity from prosecution for most acts committed under the decree. The protests began in March when the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship, known as the redshirts, took to the streets calling for the dissolution of parliament and new elections. Many of them back the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in a 2006 coup and is currently in voluntary exile. Shinawatra has called for an international investigation into the violence, including the deaths at the temple."}, {"sentences": ["Its range is wide: the life of four-year-old Kaya in her toy-packed bedroom in Tokyo is contrasted with that of another (anonymous) four-year-old who lives in a makeshift encampment on the outskirts of Rome, sharing a dirty single mattress with his family."], "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Books", "Art and design", "Culture", "Don McCullin"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-12T00:06:02Z", "title": "Photography books of the year \u2013 reviews", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/12/photography-books-of-the-year-sean-ohagan", "article": "Best music book A Star is Born: Photography and Rock Since Elvis (Steidl \u00a326) A provocative, and seldom seen, portrait of the young Patti Smith \u2013 taken by Lynn Goldsmith in 1976 during a protest by Iranian students against America&apos;s support of the soon-to-be-deposed Shah \u2013 is just one of many extraordinary images in A Star is Born, a chronological record of photography&apos;s reflection of, and impact upon, the culture of rock. Smith (below right), as her T-shirt shows, is also protesting \u2013 against the arrest of Keith Richards on drug charges in Canada. &quot;There is something about the static image that imprints on the mass psyche,&quot; notes Mick Rock, whose defining images of David Bowie at his most androgynous are included here. There are several rare photographs of rock greats but also images from fan magazines, seminal periodicals and classic album sleeves. Photographers include Dezo Hoffman and Astrid Kirchner (each of whom styled the Beatles in their own image \u2013 wacky and moody respectively), Gered Mankowitz (who famously photographed the Stones stoned on Primrose Hill), Stephen Shore (who shot the Velvet Underground at Warhol&apos;s Factory in the late 1960s), and Charles Peterson (who chronicled\u00a0the\u00a0nascent grunge\u00a0scene\u00a0in\u00a0Seattle). A series of illuminating essays also traces the trajectory of rock photography from its glossy showbiz roots to the rise of lo-fi digital photographs taken by amateurs and posted on the internet. Best genre book Street Photography Now by Sophie Howarth and Stephen McLaren (Thames\u00a0&amp; Hudson \u00a329.95) Street photography made the news earlier in the year when several practitioners were stopped, questioned and, in some cases, held under the Terrorism Act. Sophie Howarth and Stephen McLaren&apos;s book is not an exhaustive study of the form or its trajectory from the halcyon days in the early 70s when pioneers such as Gary Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz roamed the same New York turf. It does, though, provide invaluable insight into contemporary practice as well as collecting some great on-the-ground anecdotes. The 46 contemporary photographers selected highlight the range of styles and approaches that make it such an intriguing \u2013 and often provocative \u2013 genre. The best images are often the most iconoclastic, as illustrated by Trent Parke&apos;s technically breathtaking shots of Sydney and Mimi Mollica&apos;s street scenes from Dakar. Best fashion book UFO by Albert Watson (Hardie Grant Books \u00a355) For the seriously style conscious, this big sumptuous book looks back over Albert Watson&apos;s 40 years as a fashion photographer. Watson has notched up more than 250 Vogue covers and is the master of clean, clear portraits of the beautiful and the famous, both in moody black and white and pristine colour. There are few surprises here, bar the odd evocative landscape, but Watson can shoot even the most over-exposed model or celebrity and tease out something new in their sculpted features. His portrait of the young Kate Moss is a case in point: he covered her face in a torn lace veil that somehow accentuates her girlish beauty. Oh, and UFO stands for Unified Fashion Objectives \u2013 though Objects might have been more accurate. Best compilation A Year in Photography: Magnum Archive (Prestel \u00a322.50)  The title is misleading. This is not so much a year in photography as a seasonal compilation that contains 365 images from the vast archive of the Magnum agency \u2013 one for every day of the year. As such, it is the perfect gift for anyone interested in the trajectory of photography over the past 60 years. All the big names are here, including Abbas, Capa, Cartier-Bresson and Eve Arnold as well as younger Magnum members such as Alec Soth and Martin Parr. Co-founder Henri Cartier-Bresson memorably said the agency should reflect &quot;a community of thought, a shared human quality, a curiosity about what is going on in the world, a respect for what is going on and a desire to transcribe it visually&quot;. That, against all the odds in this digital age of image overload, just about remains the case. Best war book Shaped by War by Don McCullin (Jonathan\u00a0Cape \u00a325) War photography as it used to be by the greatest living exponent of the genre. This is, essentially, a visual narrative of McCullin&apos;s life on the front lines in Belfast, Beirut, Biafra, Vietnam, Palestine and El Salvador. It is also an elegy for the golden age of reportage, containing several powerful spreads from McCullin&apos;s time at the Observer in the 1960s and the Sunday Times in the 70s as well as personal documents, mementos and souvenirs. Among the latter is a close-up of McCullin&apos;s Nikon F camera after it had been smashed by a sniper&apos;s bullet in Cambodia in 1970. In an age where photographers are embedded with troops, this is a reminder of the objective power of great war photography and a testament to 30-odd years of living \u2013 and seeing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0dangerously. Best book for families Where Children Sleep by James Mollison (Chris Boot \u00a320) A collection of photographs of children in their bedrooms, this book is essentially a clever visual essay on global inequality. Its range is wide: the life of four-year-old Kaya in her toy-packed bedroom in Tokyo is contrasted with that of another (anonymous) four-year-old who lives in a makeshift encampment on the outskirts of Rome, sharing a dirty single mattress with his family. It&apos;s a heartrending book that is pitched at adult and child readers alike \u2013 the accompanying texts are designed to be understood by nine-year-olds. &quot;I hope this book will help children think about inequality, within and between societies around the world,&quot; says Mollison in his introduction, &quot;and perhaps start to figure out how, in their own lives, they may respond.&quot; A tall order, but a book that will certainly make you \u2013 and your children \u2013 think. Best posthumous book Katherine Avenue by Larry Sultan (Steidl\u00a0\u00a345) Larry Sultan, who died, aged 63, in December 2009, was a mischievous chronicler of the American Dream, whether in his oftenstaged photographs of his immediate family or his unreal-looking images from the manicured hinterlands of suburban California. Sultan&apos;s best photographs capture or \u2013 to be more precise \u2013 re-create the abiding unreality of his adopted Californian homeland. A fitting testament to a playfully serious\u00a0pioneer.

Lyngen Lodge, Tromso, Norway     tromso    Lyngen Lodge sits in a natural forest clearing above a fjord with a striking mountain backdrop. High in the Arctic Circle, it&apos;s as remote a\u00a0ski spot as you could hope to find, in\u00a0Europe at least. Co-owner Graham Austick, who grew up in the north of England before defecting to St Anton to become a ski instructor and mountain guide, spotted the site when hiking through a nearby forest. He wanted to create a place which complemented rather than offended the nature around it, so he used a traditional Norwegian &quot;lafting&quot; pine timber frame with a thick grass roof, which also insulates the property. Fast boats transport you direct to the snow, where you can ski down from spectacular summits to snow-covered beaches \u2013 potentially basking in the midnight sun if you&apos;re there in May.

The show&apos;s presenter Kevin McCloud likened the finished product to &quot;something from a James Bond set&quot; and he wasn&apos;t far off the mark. The Ferme du Moudon combines a traditional chocolate-box exterior with a high-concept Scandi interior; the kitchen alone cost \u00a332,000. Lying in the shadow of Mont Blanc, it has its own private grounds in a hamlet just three minutes drive (chauffeured, of course) from the slopes of Les Gets, an untapped gem of a ski area if ever there was one.

Chalet Gerard, Dolomites, Italy     dolomites    Once a lowly wooden ski hut, Chalet G\u00e9rard was transformed into a chalet in the late-1970s by former Italian Olympic skier G\u00e9rard Mussner. It&apos;s been in the family ever since and recently had a stylish, curvy refit, which saw the addition of a relaxation lounge, complete with fireplace and knockout mountain vistas, and the upgrading of the restaurant and bar area. Mamma Helga (G\u00e9rard&apos;s wife) still lovingly presides over the popular kitchen that serves up all manner of South Tyrolean delights, including handmade venison ravioli, speck ham and walnuts. At 2,000m, the chalet also offers rapid access to the ever-scenic slopes of Val Gardena in the northern Dolomites.Book it From \u20ac98 per person per night; chalet-gerard.comGet there EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from London Gatwick to Innsbruck from \u00a342.98 return.

Hidden Dragon, Veysonnaz, Switzerland     switzerland    Finding a chalet that employs Shinto-Buddhist principles might not be a crucial factor for everyone booking a winter break, but it&apos;s the ethos that underpins the new, super-exclusive Hidden Dragon lodge. But, as is often the way, such spirituality comes at a price \u2013 it&apos;s one of the most expensive chalets in the Alps, though that could also be due to its idyllic setting, nestled discreetly among conifer trees with uninterrupted panoramic views of the Rh\u00f4ne valley. It could also be the restaurant-level gastro-cookery, fine-wine selection, private cinema, holistic therapies and ski-in/ski-out access to some of the best slopes in Europe. Veysonnaz is part of Les 4 Vall\u00e9es, which also includes Verbier, Nendaz and Thyon, and though it isn&apos;t especially well known in its own right, it has been the training ground for Swiss World Cup races for decades.Book it From 30,000 Swiss Francs (\u00a319,000) for the whole chalet per week, which sleeps 12; hidden-dragon.comGet there EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from London Gatwick to Geneva from \u00a337.98 return.

La Source, Samoens, France     samoens    Many chalets proudly tout their eco-credentials, but it can be hard to separate those who actually make a difference from those who simply say they do. La Source appears to be the former. Along with discounts for arriving by train or by shared car, they encourage ski-touring, cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing \u2013 activities that &quot;outwit&quot; the lift system, as they put it. However, for those happy to harness its power, they are only five minutes from the Samoens lifts. The chalet, in a converted farmhouse, is well insulated, they recycle and compost heavily and their food is 80% vegetarian, organic and local. Their guides, who are paid full rates with no mark-up, are encouraged to expound on the local culture, flora and fauna.Book it From \u20ac680 per person, per week; greenalpinechalet.comGet there EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from London Gatwick to Geneva from \u00a337.98 return; gather in the Airport Jazz Caf\u00e9 at 3pm on Sunday for a free group transfer (one hour).

Mountain Bug, Bareges, France     bareges    Tourmalet is perhaps best known for providing epic climbs during the Tour de France, but it&apos;s also the largest ski resort in the French Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. Unlike much of the Alps, it&apos;s relatively crowd-free and more popular with the French than the English. It is great for beginners, intermediates and ski-tourers, and what it lacks in steep faces it makes up for in sunshine and snow. Robert and Emma Mason, who run Mountain Bug, are both qualified International Mountain Leaders, with a passion for the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. They have one of the few chalets in the region, situated in a\u00a0converted 18th-century house in the heart of Bar\u00e8ges.Book it From \u00a3440 per person per week; mountainbug.comGet there Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies to Pau from \u00a316 return.

Working under the name Propaganda Snowboards, which must amuse the English-speaking village elders, they are now heading into their sixth winter, yet are still more than happy to host you up the mountain on a daily basis at no extra cost. Jasna has a good snowpark and designated free-ride zones, and a recently modernised lift system. It also represents some of the best-value snow time you&apos;re likely to find anywhere this winter, with three-hour group lessons from \u20ac25, decent three-course meals from \u20ac6 and beer from \u20ac0.70 a pint.Book it From \u00a3179 per person per week; propagandasnowboards.comGet there Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies to Bratislava from \u00a327.58 return.

At Chalet Rozov, mod cons such as Wiis and docking stations sit alongside a traditional mehana-style dining room, which has an open log fire that the chef uses for cooking.

Morino Lodge, Hakuba, Japan     japan    From Whistler to Chamonix, via New Zealand&apos;s Southern Alps, the men behind Morino Lodge have visited the key spots on everyone&apos;s snow wishlist. Hakuba made the strongest impression and Scottish snowboarder Matt Dunn and his Canadian business partner moved there four years ago to set up the lodge in the picturesque village, dwarfed by 3,000m peaks. Thanks to a kindly Siberian weather system, Hakuba boasts an average of 12m of top-quality powder a season, a\u00a0stat European resorts can only dream of. There are plenty of tree runs and great terrain, so you can make the most of those soft fluffy landings. Morino Lodge is five minutes from the lift and has a mix of western and Japanese tatami mat rooms and weekly &quot;Nabe&quot; parties, where they serve noodle broth with sake.Book it From 4,000 yen (\u00a330) per person per night; morinolodge.comGet there British Airways (ba.com) flies from London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita from \u00a3720.10 return; private transfers can be arranged to the lodge for 13,000 yen (\u00a397) per person. 11. Custard Mountain, Meribel, France Having lessons is often one of the most expensive components of a snow holiday, especially in France, so many of us don&apos;t bother, soldiering on with bad technique in the hope that no one will laugh at us from the chairlift. But at Custard Mountain you don&apos;t have to worry as on-tap snowboard lessons, tailored to your level, are included in your holiday price. Or if you don&apos;t fancy lessons you can opt to be guided around all that Les Trois Vall\u00e9es has to offer.

Chill Chalet, Les Arcs, France Bonus-laden bankers might seem a more potentially fruitful target market than teachers, yet it&apos;s the latter that Chill Chalet are keen to help out. Co-owner Chris Cracknell says, &quot;We&apos;re not teachers, but do believe they do an amazing job. And even if they don&apos;t have children themselves they&apos;re tied to travelling during expensive periods.&quot; So they offer a teachers&apos; discount during the Easter holidays. Other thoughtful touches include discounts for those who travel by train and an in-house nanny, who for \u20ac15 an hour will build snowmen and igloos with your kids while you tear up the 568km of piste on your doorstep (Les Arcs being part of Paradiski, the largest ski area on the planet).Book it \u00a365 per person per night; chillchalet.comGet there EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from London Gatwick to Geneva from \u00a337.98 return; Ben&apos;s Bus runs transfers from Geneva from \u00a369 return (bensbus.co.uk).

Heinz Julen Loft, Zermatt, Switzerland Entering this 300m2 Manhattan-style loft, housed implausibly yet successfully in a wooden chalet, will involve a degree of picking your jaw up off the textured concrete floor. Lavish doesn&apos;t always equal tasteful when it comes to luxe residences but then this grandest of designs is the creation and former home of architect Heinz Julen. The blurb tells us he hosted many a rock star party here and it&apos;s easy to see why. Acres of glass, steel, stone and wood combine to give a sense of space and light, while the vast views of the valley below remind you of a deep proximity to nature. From the baby grand Steinway piano to the remote-control curtains, the interior is full of imaginative touches. Should you ever want to step out during your stay, the slopes of Zermatt are a mere six-minute walk away via the private Omnia Hotel lifts, for which you&apos;ll have a special key.Book it \u00a31,854 per person per week, based on six people sharing; mountainexposure.comGet there EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies from London Gatwick to Zurich from \u00a350.98.

Snowpod, Tignes, France Having visited ample ski resorts and experienced an excess of what she calls &quot;Heidi-on-a pine-rampage&quot;-style lodgings, Yvonne Russill, the brain behind Snowpod, knew she wanted to do something different. The resulting pods, which are basically serviced apartments, have a strong design focus, with graffiti art, salvaged finds, shagpile carpets and mountain-view photo wallpaper, all incorporated into a look which saw them win an award at last year&apos;s Cardiff Design Festival. The pods, which are left to you for the week save a midweek tidy, are packed with all manner of kidult toys from Xbox and Wii to Scrabble and films on flat-screen TVs. Snowpod is based in Val Claret, which at 2,100m is the highest of the villages in Tignes, itself part of the vast Espace Killy that also includes Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re.

Such a move is reminiscent of the clever Mitchell and Webb skit where two vaingloriously unaware Nazi SS soldiers are chatting and one suddenly remarks to the other: &quot;Uh, Hans \u2026 I have just noticed something. Have you looked at our caps recently? The badges on our caps. Have you looked at them?&quot; The first soldier then says incredulously: &quot;They&apos;ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps actually have little pictures of skulls on them.&quot; He then pauses and upon deeper reflection asks: &quot;Hans, are we the baddies?&quot; For a British audience, this ironic questioning of how the Nazis saw themselves is deeply satirical because everyone is in on the gag: of course we know how horrible Nazis were, and it&apos;s doubly funny that they don&apos;t realise it themselves. Such a skit tickles our sensibilities because, as Woody Allen once had a character in a film remark: &quot;Comedy is merely tragedy plus time.&quot; But as much as pinning the comedic punchline on the Nazis is funny, and Mel Brooks&apos;s entertaining songs pushed the limits of making them fodder for light entertainment, most of us are aware that actually dressing like a Nazi foot soldier moves from the comedic into the farcical, but only making a joke of oneself in the process. Such subtle understanding of the difference between humour and just plain bad taste seems to have been in short supply for both the owners of the Don Quijote department store chain and the makers of the costume, a Japanese party goods company called Aico. Don Quijote sells masses of low-priced goods, and is thus a popular venue to shop in increasingly penurious times, but why a costume maker believed it to be a profitable venture to produce such garb, complete with swastika armband and the slogan &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;, remains to be revealed. More importantly, the mere availability begs the even more puzzling question for Tokyo-ites and other urban shoppers \u2013 where exactly would you wear such a costume, and what does this say about modern Japan? Are middle-class Japanese that politically out of touch with common sense? On one hand, the availability of Hitler costumes demonstrates that the Japanese have an immense capacity for historical amnesia. A Japanese colleague of mine, who teaches at a respectable university in Tokyo, swears to me that his students will sometimes stare at him in a stupefied manner when they discover that Japan actually fought the US and Great Britain during the second world war. Given the fact that modern history is no longer compulsory for Japanese students wishing to enter university, such ignorance should not necessarily surprise us. It is not that Japanese school textbooks and historians don&apos;t cover such topics (including Japan&apos;s own 1936 alliance with fascist Italy and Nazi Germany), it is more the fact that contemporary Japan is so dissimilar to what it was a half-century ago that the next generation can almost not conceive that their parents, or rather grandparents, could possibly have any connection to the Nazis. Divorced from the lived history of previous generations, and ensconced in the effluvia of the international Hollywood culture of movies, books and television shows, many younger Japanese in their 20s to 40s \u2013 the potential customer base for such a costume \u2013 see no discord in enjoying the cinematic blockbusters that retell the Pearl Harbour story from the American side, or appreciating the Clint Eastwood film about Iwo Jima. The war took place in another Japan, in such a distant past that a visceral link is impossible to build. This separation from a historical reality, combined with Japan&apos;s own domestic nostalgia for its empire (to the exclusion of how that empire linked into world history), allows for a measure of distance between Japan and the European world wars. Many Japanese have heard of the Holocaust and are certainly aware of their own aggressive military past, but the leap to connecting that to their current lives as well empathising with the suffering of others, as opposed to just Japan&apos;s own victimhood after the dropping of the atomic bomb, seems at times to be sorely lacking. The company that produced the costume stated that they &quot;meant it merely as a joke&quot;. To be sure Nazis can be funny, but there is also a very fine line between clever and stupid. Watching a Nazi make an arse of himself is comedic, but being a Nazi just makes an arse of oneself \u2013 and that is why wearing the Hitler costume treads on the wrong side of bad taste."}, {"sentences": ["Muramoto, a Japanese national, was based in the Reuters Tokyo bureau."], "tags": ["Media", "Journalist safety", "Thailand", "Reuters", "News agencies", "World news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-13T11:10:02Z", "title": "Thai investigators refuse to release report on shot Reuters cameraman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/dec/13/journalist-safety-thailand", "article": "Thailand&apos;s department of special investigation (DSI) is refusing to release the full report on the death of Reuters cameraman Hiro Muramoto following a leak that he was killed by a Thai soldier.

The DSI has already submitted its initial findings to police about 13 of 89 deaths, including Muramoto&apos;s, which indicate troops were involved.

Although the shift towards a more assertive military stance has been under discussion in Tokyo for some time, an angry maritime confrontation with China in September and the recent North Korean attack on South Korean territory have lent urgency to discussions on how to deal with the challenges both countries pose to Japan. At the same time, moves by Japan to break the bonds of its postwar pacifist constitution and take a more proactive military role both regionally and internationally are certain to ring alarm bells in neighbouring states, including modern-day de facto allies such as South Korea, which have not forgotten or forgiven the past. Japanese media reports suggest the review, which is expected this week and is the first update of the so-called &quot;national defence programme guideline&quot; for six years, will identify North Korea as a threat and categorise China&apos;s military activities as a concern. The Nikkei business daily said it would call for creation of a &quot;dynamic defence capability&quot; specifically tasked with deterring Chinese incursions around Japan&apos;s disputed southern islands, in part by mobilising units of Japan&apos;s self-defence force more rapidly. If the Democratic party prime minister, Naoto Kan, adopts the recommendations in full, Japan&apos;s submarine fleet could grow from 16 to 22 boats, the air force would gain additional advanced fighter jets and self-defence force troops will be redeployed south from Hokkaido, given the reduced threat from Russia. Defensive alliances with the US, Australia, India and even South Korea, stressing military integration and interoperability, may also be pursued under the plan. That would be welcomed by Washington, which has long pressed for greater burden-sharing. Following the North Korean attack, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, called for a triple alliance between Japan, the US and South Korea. Worried about already strained relations, Kan has given assurances that the evolving strategy is not aimed at China, even though Beijing&apos;s military spending has almost quadrupled in the past 10 years. &quot;To organise our own defence capabilities is something that our country certainly needs to do. This does not directly link to posing a threat to another country,&quot; Kan said. But the prime minister came under pressure to stand up to China after last September&apos;s incident, when a Chinese trawler apparently deliberately rammed a Japanese coastguard vessel. Kan&apos;s initial response was criticised as weak and his opinion poll ratings plunged. Ironically, Kan came to office last year pledging to push US forces out of a controversial base on Okinawa. Now he is cuddling ever closer to Washington, which has its own worries about Beijing. The new guidelines are expected to draw on recommendations produced last summer by a government-nominated panel of experts. According to Michael Auslin, director of Japan studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writing in the Wall Street Journal, the panel&apos;s ideas, if fully implemented, would &quot;place Japan as firmly as it&apos;s ever been on the side of upholding the post-war international order\u2026 If the government follows these recommendations, it will become a force in creating a community of liberal interests in the Asia-Pacific region&quot;. That&apos;s exactly what some wary neighbours are worried about. Writing for the International Relations and Security Network, Axel Berkofsky of the Milan-based Istituto per gli Studi di Politica Internazionale said the panel&apos;s ideas had raised &quot;quite a few eyebrows&quot; among analysts. &quot;The report recommended not only an upgrade for Japan&apos;s navy, coastguard and ballistic missile capabilities \u2026 but also a review of Japan&apos;s &apos;three non-nuclear principles,&apos; which forbid the country from introducing, stockpiling and manufacturing nuclear weapons inside its borders.&quot; At least one of the principles has been routinely violated in the past by visiting nuclear-armed US ships. That said, Berkofsky predicted there would be no formal move to change Japan&apos;s policy on nuclear weapons \u2013 or to acquire offensive ballistic missiles designed to attack North Korea pre-emptively, as hawks would like. Fears of a return to Japanese militarism were wholly misplaced, he said. All the same, there&apos;s no doubt life is getting riskier in east Asia \u2013 and that Japan has little choice but to react, Berkofsky warned. &quot;In a region where China continues to rapidly modernise its armed forces, and North Korea&apos;s missile and nuclear programmes remain top security concerns, Japan is responding in kind \u2013 just in case.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["What&apos;s striking about the images in photographer Michael Wolf&apos;s new book Tokyo Compression, aside from the lengths to which people will go to wedge themselves into a bulging carriage, must be the looks of resignation among the victims.", "But it is the ability to tolerate an elbow in the back and a cheek pasted against a window that sets Tokyo&apos;s commuters apart."], "tags": ["Business", "Banking", "Japan", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-14T14:01:41Z", "title": "Japan struggles to cope with China's ascendancy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/14/japan-china-economy-review-mccurry", "article": "The past year has underlined how Japan&apos;s future is inextricably linked with that of China and, by extension, why it may have to stop thinking of itself as an economic superpower. As Japan staggered through one of the hottest summers in recent memory, confirmation arrived that China had replaced it as the world&apos;s second-biggest economy, after the US. The Japanese reaction ranged from studied insouciance \u2013 it wasn&apos;t as if it hadn&apos;t been warned \u2013 to resignation and anger. Some questioned the validity of GDP figures as a reliable indicator, pointing out the vast differences in per capita income between the two countries. Conservative commentators, meanwhile, issued an increasingly hollow-sounding exhortation: that in the Asian context at least, Japan should never be comfortable with second place. But with some economists expecting Japan to give way to several other countries, including the likes of Indonesia and Turkey, by the middle of the century, the icy blast of economic realism from its neighbour has left the Japanese approaching 2011 in contemplative mood. After 20 years of stagnation, a decade of battles with deflation, and the dual spectres of a shrinking workforce and rising elderly population, some are suggesting that Japan should lower its expectations and embrace a future of frugality and sustainability. And, in recognising that the ceaseless quest for growth may not be at the heart of a nation&apos;s wellbeing, Japan could offer lessons for other developed economies as they scramble to avoid their own versions of the &quot;lost decade&quot;. Shikataganai, an oft-heard expression here, is a verbal shrug emitted when hopes are dashed by the supremacy of external forces \u2013 and that Japan is at the cusp of a transition from economic miracle worker to a less obtrusive participant in global capitalism has a feel of inevitability to it. Few people believe the current members of the political class that authored Japan&apos;s postwar transformation have the wherewithal to conjure yet another miracle. Nor, despite the best intentions of the left-of-centre government, do they appear to believe their future lies in recalibrating foreign policy away from the US and towards the rest of Asia. On the contrary, relations with China will remain Janus-faced for the foreseeable future. Japan views China as an economic and military rival, but also as a site for its manufacturing plants and, thanks to the rise of a Chinese middle class, a crucial market for the cars and electronics it produces. While conservatives fret over the pace of China&apos;s economic development, and the size of its defence budget, a new voice is emerging: one that asks why a country that spent 250 years in sakoku isolation \u2013 a period that saw little economic growth \u2013 cannot beat a retreat into a modified version of the past. It isn&apos;t hard to see why such a radical rethink of Japan&apos;s economic raison d&apos;etre should at least be debated. The Nikkei stock index is only at about a quarter of its all-time high of 1989; real estate is worth about a quarter of what it was in 1974. While Japan&apos;s (reformed) banks dodged the worst of the Lehman shock, the country is displaying the symptoms of a malaise it once dismissed as a western disease: unemployment, the emergence of the &quot;working poor&quot;, a widening income gap, and the ignominious spectacle of a corporate icon, Toyota, called to account for shoddy workmanship in the committee rooms of the US Congress. It is easy to overstate Japan&apos;s sense of disquiet, but even optimists accept that the certainties of the postwar period are creaking under the strain of economic realities. Graduates are no longer guaranteed lifetime employment with major companies and, even if they were, fewer are willing to submit to the work ethic expected of their baby-boomer fathers. The previous generation endured commutes on packed trains, long working hours, few holidays and a cramped existence in the soulless suburbs. Employers&apos; expectations have changed little, but the old quid pro quo \u2013 that workers will see their standard of living improve \u2013 no longer applies. While the postwar generation worked at a time of population growth and rising wages, the young workers of today have only ever known weak consumption, falling prices and contraction. Japan&apos;s skewed demographics will only lend weight to the view that its people will have to recalibrate their expectations. Government figures estimate that the population, now at 127 million, could fall by about 40 million by 2050, when almost 40% of the population will be aged 65 or older. Japan depends heavily on Middle East oil and imports around 50% of its food, but its comparatively homogeneous society has never shown much enthusiasm for similarly impressive influxes of foreign labour, despite warnings that it will need to accept 10 million immigrant workers over the next half -century to keep its economy ticking over. There is little sign now, however, soon after Japan&apos;s parliament approved yet another stimulus package, that policy-makers are about to accept the case for sustainability over growth. Two decades ago, a group of economists predicted that 2010 would be the year that Japan finally overtook the US as the world&apos;s biggest economy. How long will it be before bets are being taken on when it becomes the first economy to shake off its addiction to growth and give other mature economies a glimpse into a more frugal future? No change hereThe &quot;luxury&quot; of using one of the world&apos;s biggest and most efficient public transport systems still comes at a price: the experience must be shared with more than 8\u00a0million fellow commuters. What&apos;s striking about the images in photographer Michael Wolf&apos;s new book Tokyo Compression, aside from the lengths to which people will go to wedge themselves into a bulging carriage, must be the looks of resignation among the victims. But it is the ability to tolerate an elbow in the back and a cheek pasted against a window that sets Tokyo&apos;s commuters apart. There are few arguments: it&apos;s as if the powerless, massed ranks of the travelling public have entered into a non-aggression pact."}, {"sentences": ["Others claimed that Earhart was executed by the Japanese for spying, was pressed into making propaganda broadcasts from Tokyo during the war, or that she secretly returned to the US under an assumed identity."], "tags": ["Archaeology", "World news", "Women", "Japan", "Samoa", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-14T19:26:36Z", "title": "Finger may point to solution in Amelia Earhart disappearance riddle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/14/finger-amelia-earheart-disappearance", "article": "The riddle of Amelia Earhart&apos;s disappearance has only grown more complex in the 73 years since the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic went missing attempting to fly around the equator. One theory had it that she crashed into the sea after running out of fuel during her expedition over the Pacific Ocean. Others claimed that Earhart was executed by the Japanese for spying, was pressed into making propaganda broadcasts from Tokyo during the war, or that she secretly returned to the US under an assumed identity. But now an array of artefacts from the 1930s and bones found on the uninhabited Pacific atoll of Nikumaroro suggest that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, endured lingering deaths as castaways on a desert island and were eventually eaten by crabs. Researchers from The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (Tighar) found what appears to be a phalanx from a finger and two other bones, one of them from the neck, alongside a host of other clues after two decades and 10 expeditions attempting to solve the mystery. The suspected finger is being tested for human DNA. It may turn out to be from a turtle \u2013 which have similar bones in their flippers. But the other discoveries lend credence to the theory that Earhart died on the atoll after going missing en route to Howland Island in July 1937 at the age of 41 \u2013 she was declared legally dead 18 months later. They include part of a mirror from a woman&apos;s compact, a zip from a Pennsylvania factory and travel-sized bottles made in New Jersey as well as a pocket knife listed on her aircraft&apos;s inventory, all manufactured in the 1930s. Alongside the goods are the remains of small fires with bird and fish bones, and empty oyster shells laid out in a row as if to collect water, suggesting someone was trying to survive on the island. Three years after Earhart disappeared British colonial authorities, who then administered Nikumaroro, found 13 bones from a human skeleton at the site of the latest discoveries. The bones were later assessed to be &quot;more likely female than male&quot; and &quot;more likely white than Polynesian or other Pacific Islander&quot;. Those bones have since been lost. Ric Gillespie, the executive director of Tighar, said the combined evidence points to Earhart dying on Nikumaroro. &quot;The bottom line is we have this archaeological site on this island where so much other evidence points to the Earhart flight having ended up. We know there was this castaway found there who appears to have been an American woman of the 1930s and there&apos;s only one of those missing out there,&quot; he said. Gillespie said that the condition of some of the discoveries added to the evidence that there were people attempting to survive on the island. &quot;We could see that the knife had been beaten apart with a blunt object \u2026 apparently in order to remove the blades. We can only speculate but if you&apos;re a castaway and you need to make a spear to catch fish, maybe the blades are more useful that way than still attached to the knife,&quot; he\u00a0said. Gillespie said a member of Earhart&apos;s family had provided a DNA sample for testing if the suspected finger bone turned out to be human. But he added that the family would prefer a different ending to the Amelia Earhart story. &quot;A crash at sea, that&apos;s nice and clean and a quick ending. Ending up as a castaway on a waterless atoll, and struggling to survive for a time and failing and ultimately being eaten by crabs is not nearly as pretty. They&apos;re hoping that we&apos;re wrong and I can&apos;t blame them for that,&quot; said Gillespie."}, {"sentences": ["What do the seemingly aimless chattering of a Tokyo based tweeter and a scheme to improve links with a local Muslim community in Leeds have to do with each other?", "The connection between the world&apos;s 20 billionth tweet in Tokyo and an email vote for a community cohesion project in Leeds doesn&apos;t seem so tenuous after all."], "tags": ["Housing Network", "Housing network blog", "Housing careers"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-15T11:59:43Z", "title": "Why the housing sector should embrace social media", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2010/dec/15/housing-sector-should-embrace-social-media", "article": "What do the seemingly aimless chattering of a Tokyo based tweeter and a scheme to improve links with a local Muslim community in Leeds have to do with each other? On Saturday, 31 July the 20 billionth tweet was sent on Twitter since the service launched. It took four years to record the 10 billionth tweet, sent in March this year, and just four months to double the number. Meanwhile, the annual awards programme for the National Federation of Arms Length Management Organisations (Almos) this year and for the first time, included a special people&apos;s choice award for which the public could vote by viewing films of all the finalists posted on a special awards micro-site. The category was publicised to Almos around the country and then posted on Twitter, Facebook and other social networks. Although the decision to include a people&apos;s choice was taken relatively late, we received almost 5,500 votes in little more than a week. The winner was West North West Homes Leeds&apos; Armley Mosque Project which aimed to build social cohesion with the local Muslim community. The explosion of digital communications now offers the ability to engage communities in debate and discussion about the changes, challenges and choices they face. And with the government lauding localism and &quot;big society&quot; \u2014 whilst at the same time set on deep cuts \u2014 the role of social media in providing effective and inexpensive channels of engagement and service is being taken increasingly seriously. Britons love their gadgets. According to an Ofcom survey Britons are willing to give up almost anything except the technology which allows them to talk, text, tweet or interact over the internet. Asked which areas of spending they were most likely to cut, 47% said dinner and 41% holidays, compared with just 19% who said they would cut mobile phone spending, 16% on TV subscriptions and 10% on broadband services. The digital future is about building communities, sharing common interests and information needs and interacting. A perfect model for housing communities. The opportunities are endless but not always obvious, housing managers need to think outside the box. For instance, a number of Almos which have a high take up of Sky subscribers among their tenant base, have found communicating with residents via DigiTV to be highly effective. Others are keen to use new technology websites to support wider community aims beyond Decent Homes. In the Midlands, Solihull Community Housing has been commended for its use of IT to increase efficiency, such as the use of text messaging to remind people of appointments. The organisation also developed an initiative to use the internet to tackle social exclusion by enabling broadband access to six tower blocks alongside schemes to educate residents in the benefits of using the internet and how to use computers. In London, Homes for Islington, another Almo, is providing broadband for residents to enable and encourage them, particularly those who are elderly and vulnerable, to access services online, such as reporting repairs. Other Almos are using tweets to keep their local media up to date with developments. Service users have embraced social media and the digital revolution. In order to keep up with them, those working in the housing sector are going to have to do the same. If we can come up with ideas which improve both the service we offer and save money, then everyone wins. The connection between the world&apos;s 20 billionth tweet in Tokyo and an email vote for a community cohesion project in Leeds doesn&apos;t seem so tenuous after all.

The announcement came as a US politician, Bill Richardson, arrived in Pyongyang at the invitation of North Korea. He has previously acted as a go-between and said he hoped to &quot;lessen tensions&quot; in the wake of last month&apos;s artillery barrage. North Korea blamed similar military exercises off Yeonpyeong island for provoking its attack last month, in which two soldiers and two civilians died. Seoul said it was firing away from the North, but Pyongyang disputes the maritime boundary drawn at the end of the Korean war and says any such drills will affect its waters. The manoeuvres would take place between Saturday and Tuesday, the joint chief of staffs said. A source said they would last one day. Dr Leonid Petrov, a Korea expert at the University of Sydney, warned that the move could inflame tensions on the peninsular. &quot;It is appalling. If it was a bona fide need for artillery practice they have plenty of islands in the Western sea,&quot; he said. &quot;This is simply sending a message that the South is putting pressure on the North \u2013 but at the same time refuses to negotiate.&quot; He said South Korean society was too complacent about the danger of war. &quot;Seoul is so vulnerable and so close to the demilitarised zone [that divides the peninsula] and the infrastructure is so fragile.&quot; Petrov argued that North Korea&apos;s recovery from the famine of the 90s and the advances in its nuclear technology had made it more confident. Professor Han Seung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, said South Korea&apos;s military needed to show their defence capabilities. &quot;I don&apos;t think this is meant to be provocative,&quot; he said. &quot;If North Korea are looking for an excuse like they did before, they will use any kind of excuse.&quot; The military stand-off comes amid growing concern about North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme. Recent reports have suggested the country may have built more plants to enrich uranium and a South Korean newspaper reported yesterday that there were signs it might be preparing to test a third nuclear device next spring. North Korea&apos;s foreign ministry said today that it supported dialogue to defuse tensions and denuclearise the Korean peninsula but would never beg for it, Seoul&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported. It reiterated that its uranium enrichment programme was for peaceful purposes. The North wants the resumption of the stalled six-party aid-for-denuclearisation talks, but is unlikely to accept the preconditions demanded by the US, South Korea and Japan, who want a concrete commitment to denuclearisation. &quot;When they call me they always want to send a message of some kind,&quot; said Richardson, New Mexico governor and a former UN ambassador, as he stopped in Beijing en route to Pyongyang. &quot;My hope is that they provide messages that will lower tensions on the Korean peninsula. My message to them will be: we need peace, we need to stop some of these aggressive actions, especially with respect to South Korea.&quot; Richardson, who has travelled to North Korea more than half a dozen times, said he would encourage Pyongyang to engage in &quot;some kind of negotiations&quot; but would not put forward a specific framework for dialogue. He was invited by North Korea&apos;s chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye Gwan, and has requested a trip to the main nuclear facility at Yongbyon. The US deputy secretary of state, James Steinberg, is in Beijing for a meeting with the senior foreign policy official Dai Bingguo, who met Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang last week. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo are putting pressure on Beijing to take a tougher line on its ally. It has refused to criticise the Yeonpyeong attack.

This is thought to occur because the patterns of neural activity that encode memory traces are &quot;replayed&quot; \u2013 and therefore strengthened \u2013 during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. On the other hand, sleep loss is known to impair memory and other cognitive functions, and according to one recent study it also promotes the formation of false memories. New research published in the journal Biological Psychiatry now suggests that sleep deprivation may benefit sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), by preventing the consolidation of traumatic memories. Kenichi Kuriyama of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry in Tokyo, Japan, and his colleagues recruited 28 healthy students and split them into two groups. Both were presented with 14 short film clips in a randomised order, each showing a typical city street from the viewpoint of somebody driving a car. Seven of the clips showed safe driving, while the others contained a gruesome crash with an oncoming or crossing bike or car, which appeared suddenly during the second half of the clip. Afterwards, the experimental group was asked to stay awake throughout the night, and the controls to sleep normally. The following day, the participants&apos; recognition of the film clips was assessed using three different measures. First, they were shown a series of pictures and asked to indicate, by pressing a key, whether or not they had seen each picture in any of the film clips. They were then asked to rate the degree of fear evoked by each picture, by drawing a vertical line at the corresponding position on a horizontal scale. Finally, skin conductance was measured to evaluate their physiological responses to each picture. The same tests were repeated three and ten days later. The researchers found no difference in the accuracy of event recognition between the sleep-deprived and control groups. Participants in both groups performed well on the picture test on day one, but their accuracy had decreased to chance level by day 10. Controls rated pictures from clips containing crashes as being fearful throughout the whole 10 days, and their physiological responses to these pictures remained high. Their fear responses became generalised too \u2013 pictures from clips that did not contain a crash were rated as fearful, and also led to increased skin conductance. The sleep-deprived participants performed differently, however, even though they had recovered adequately from the sleep loss and had normal vigilance levels. They initially rated pictures from the traumatic clips as fearful, and they also exhibited generalised fear responses. But by day 3, all their physiological and generalised fear responses had been extinguished. The authors suggest that this was due to sleep loss on the first night of the experiment, which prevented proper memory consolidation. They conclude that &quot;insomnia might provide prophylactic benefits in reducing the development of post-traumatic stress disorder via extinction of the fear-magnifying effects of memory.&quot; There is some evidence that sleep deprivation can alleviate the symptoms of depression, and that this may be due to its effects on stress hormones. One recent study, for example, showed that sleep deprivation combined with sertraline \u2013 an antidepressant related to Prozac \u2013 improved quality of life in patients with major depressive disorder more than antidepressants alone. Other recent research shows that sleep deprivation impairs fear conditioning in mice, but the new study is the first to examine the phenomenon in humans. Kuriyama and his colleagues suggest that the effects they observed could also be due to the effects of stress hormones on the hippocampus, a brain structure known to be critical for memory formation. Not everyone is convinced by the findings, however. &quot;Generalising from a night of total sleep deprivation to the milder sleep loss of insomnia is overblown,&quot; says Professor Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University. &quot;People with PTSD have enough troubles with their sleep as it is,\u00a0and to suggest that their insomnia is good for them is ill-conceived, especially as it might make them fearful of even sleeping.&quot; Nevertheless, the study was well conducted, with the authors taking possible confounds into account. They measured the participants&apos; vigilance levels, for example, to ensure that the performance of the sleep-deprived group on the memory tasks was not affected by impaired attention. It&apos;s interesting to note that generalised fear responses were extinguished in the sleep-deprived subjects, because it is now thought that exaggerated responses to unrelated events contribute to PTSD symptoms. Also noteworthy is the timing of the sleep loss \u2013 would the same effects have been observed if the experimental group had been deprived of sleep on day 2 or 3 of the experiment? Replicating the findings would add more weight to this preliminary study, and further work is needed to determine whether sleep deprivation and insomnia really could be of clinical value to people who have experienced traumas.

The civil penalties will settle investigations into how Toyota dealt with recalls over accelerator pedals that could get trapped in floor mats and steering relay rods that could break and lead to drivers losing control. The latest settlement, on top of a $16.4m fine Toyota paid earlier in a related investigation, brings the total penalties levied on the company to $48.8m. It caps a difficult year for the world&apos;s biggest car manufacturer, which recalled more than 11m vehicles globally since autumn 2009 as it scrambled to protect its reputation for safety and reliability. Toyota&apos;s board of directors agreed to pay the fines today at the company&apos;s board meeting in Japan, according to an official familiar with the case, and the company said it agreed to the penalties without admitting to any violations of US laws. However, that does not free Toyota from potential civil and criminal penalties in private lawsuits and other federal investigations. Steve St Angelo, Toyota&apos;s chief quality officer for North America, said in a statement that the company has &quot;worked very hard over the past year to put these issues behind us and set a new standard of responsiveness to our customers. These agreements are an opportunity to turn the page to an even more constructive relationship with NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration).&quot; In April, Toyota agreed to pay the maximum fine allowed under law for a single case \u2013 $16.4m \u2013 for failing to promptly alert US regulators to safety problems over sticking accelerator pedals. Under federal law, car manufacturers must notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days of determining that a safety defect exists and promptly conduct a recall. At the time, Toyota denied attempting to hide a safety defect and said it agreed to the penalty to avoid a lengthy legal battle with the government. Jesse Toprak, vice-president of industry trends and insight at TrueCar, an automotive consulting firm in Santa Monica, California, said Toyota was trying to put its recalls behind it at a time when the company&apos;s US sales have been flat while many rivals have increased sales. But he said rebuilding trust would take time. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a far lengthier process. Consumer loyalty is not what it used to be. The choices are plentiful now,&quot; he said.

Bill Richardson, governor of New Mexico, said North Korea has promised to re-admit United Nations nuclear inspectors and to sell its neighbour 12,000 plutonium fuel rods, which would reduce its potential bomb-making stockpile. &quot;My sense is the North Koreans realise that they have moved too negatively against negotiations, that they have taken some very bad steps and they wanted to move in the right direction,&quot; Richardson told reporters. &quot;I think it is important that a new effort at re-engagement takes place among the six-party countries [involved in nuclear talks]. Maybe now is the time for the six-party countries to reach out to North Korea and say, &apos;Okay, let&apos;s get down to business.&apos; &quot; Richardson, a veteran intermediary on the peninsula, was returning from an emergency mission to Pyongyang where he was trying to ease one of the most dangerous outbreaks of hostilities since the 1950-53 Korean war. Following the sinking of a South Korean naval ship with the loss of 46 lives in March, North Korea killed two civilians and two marines last month with an artillery barrage of Yeonpyeong island, carried out in retaliation for a live-fire drill in disputed waters nearby. The government in Pyongyang warned that it would launch an even greater counter-strike if South Korea went ahead with a second military exercise yesterday, but after a frantic burst of last-minute diplomacy the drill passed without response. &quot;I pushed them very hard not to respond. They make their own decisions, but I think our trip had a good impact,&quot; said Richardson. &quot;I noticed a pragmatic attitude on their part, a more realistic attitude, a view perhaps that they&apos;d moved a little too far down the precipice and it was time to come back and pull back and start negotiations again.&quot; North Korea has also agreed to consider Richardson&apos;s proposal for a military commission between the US, North and South Korea, and a hotline, according to a CNN crew that joined him on the trip. Russia, one of the six parties involved in previous nuclear talks, has proposed using the hiatus in the conflict to send a special UN delegation to the region. The envoy&apos;s mission would be to &quot;ensure the normalisation of the situation&quot;, Sergei Razov, Moscow&apos;s ambassador to China said. Along with Richardson, Russia and China hope for a resumption of six-nation talks, which broke down in April 2009 when the UN security council condemned Pyongyang for a rocket launch, and North Korea ejected inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA chief, Yukiya Amano, said in Tokyo on Friday that the nuclear watchdog has an essential role to play and is prepared to dispatch inspectors once an agreement is worked out. But given the long history of breakdowns and broken promises, South Korea, the US and Japan remain deeply suspicious that the sudden talk of conciliation is anything more than a tactical gambit. &quot;North Korea talks a great game. They always do,&quot; said US state department spokesman PJ Crowley. &quot;The real issue is what will they do.&quot; The South Korean military kept fighter jets and Aegis-equipped destroyers on patrol in the disputed area. &quot;When it provokes, we will firmly punish North Korea,&quot; defence minister Kim Kwan-jin said. The government in Seoul has cut aid and tourism projects, dispatched more troops to the frontline and threatened air-strikes in an increasingly hardline stance. Even Christmas festivities have been caught up in the propaganda war. For the first time in seven years, South Korea has illuminated a 30m steel Christmas tree near the demilitarised zone dividing the two Koreas. The practice was stopped by the previous government as it was deemed a provocative act that emphasised the difference in religions and living standards between the prosperous, largely Christian south and the impoverished and mostly secular north. The government in Pyongyang, itself no stranger to provocation, accuses the US and South Korea of &quot;absolutely unfair bellicose provocation&quot;, that, it warns, could lead the situation on the peninsula to an explosion. &quot;The world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war,&quot; the North&apos;s military command said yesterday in a statement on the official news agency KCNA."}, {"sentences": ["Further notable work abroad included his guest conductorship of the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus and the Central Philharmonic Society of China in Beijing (1989-97)."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Pink Floyd"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-21T17:54:55Z", "title": "John Alldis obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/21/john-alldis-obituary", "article": "John Alldis, who has died of pneumonia aged 81, was one of the foremost chorus masters of his generation. His own professional ensemble, the John Alldis Choir, was a pioneer in the high-calibre performance of adventurous choral repertoire, but also participated in major recordings of opera alongside such artists as Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa. He additionally acted at different times as chorus master to the London Symphony and London Philharmonic Orchestras, preparing those choirs for numerous recordings. He was educated at Felsted school in Essex (1943-47), from where he won a choral scholarship to King&apos;s College, Cambridge (1949-52), the choir of which was then under the direction of Boris Ord. It was in 1962 that Alldis founded the choir that bore his name, a professional 16-voice ensemble which from the start gave prominence to contemporary music in its repertoire. Indeed, it was with the world premiere of Alexander Goehr&apos;s A Little Cantata of Proverbs that the choir made its debut, going on to include works by Malcolm Williamson, Richard Rodney Bennett, Elisabeth Lutyens, Harrison Birtwistle and others in its programmes, many being recorded on the Argo label. Alldis&apos;s handpicked singers included a number \u2013 Philip Langridge, Ian Partridge and John Shirley-Quirk among them \u2013 who went on to achieve celebrity as soloists. The choir also gave in 1967 the first European performance of Stravinsky&apos;s Requiem Canticles, conducted by Pierre Boulez, and was featured in many opera recordings for Decca and RCA. But if the choir broke new ground with contemporary repertoire, it also did full justice to traditional composers such as Beethoven and Bruckner. Nor was the fare exclusively classical: in 1970 the choir participated in the rock album Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd; and in 1973 it appeared, again under his direction, in the Westminster Abbey performance and recording of Duke Ellington&apos;s Third Sacred Concert \u2013 the celebrated bandleader&apos;s last recording. In tandem with this work with his own choir, Alldis was involved in preparing the choruses of major symphony orchestras. He was originally approached in 1966 by the LSO, which wished at that time to form a permanent choral ensemble \u2013 previously it had engaged choirs on an ad hoc basis \u2013 and he established and trained a group of singers for that purpose. He remained the director of the London Symphony Chorus until 1969, when he moved to a similar position with the London Philharmonic. From 1966 to 1977, Alldis was also a professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and from 1972 to 1977 conductor of the Danish Radio Choir. Other posts he held were musical director of the Groupe Vocal de France (1978-83), music director and consultant for the Cameran Singers in Israel (1989-90), guest conductor of the Hall\u00e9 Choir, and conductor of the American Choral Symposium in Manhattan, Kansas (1978\u201387). He was also permanent guest conductor of the Netherlands Chamber Choir (1985-98), with whom he made several recordings of English choral music on the Globe label. Further notable work abroad included his guest conductorship of the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus and the Central Philharmonic Society of China in Beijing (1989-97). Closer to home he was able to explore more orchestral repertoire with the Wimbledon Symphony Orchestra, which he conducted from 1971 to 2004. He won Grammy awards for his work with choruses on recordings by Adrian Boult and Georg Solti, and was awarded an honorary fellowship of Westminster Choir College, Princeton, in the US. In 1994 he was made a Chevalier de l&apos;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. With all his ensembles, Alldis had the ability to draw the best from his singers. Inspired by his affability and charisma on the one hand, and his seriousness of purpose and dedication on the other, they would routinely deliver their maximum potential for him. He cared particularly deeply about the texts of works \u2013 he was also a voracious reader \u2013 for him the starting point of any interpretation of vocal music. He is survived by his wife, Ursula, a violinist and teacher, and by his two sons, Dominic, a professional pianist, singer and conductor, and Robert. \u2022 John Alldis, chorus master, born 10 August 1929; died 20 December 2010"}, {"sentences": ["Nakamura (her surname) depicts the adventures of the two religious founders as they room together in Tachikawa (a suburb west of Tokyo) while vacationing in Japan."], "tags": ["Japan", "Comics and graphic novels", "Religion", "Buddhism", "Christianity", "Religion", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Manga"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-22T10:00:00Z", "title": "What would Jesus and Buddha do \u2026 on holiday? | Jolyon Baraka Thomas", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/22/jesus-buddha-japan-manga-novel", "article": "What would Jesus and Buddha do if they were suddenly thrust into contemporary society, and how would they react to what they found? Japanese author-illustrator Nakamura Hikaru has sketched an answer to this provocative question in a very popular manga, or illustrated serial novel, entitled Saint Young Men (Seinto oniisan). Nakamura (her surname) depicts the adventures of the two religious founders as they room together in Tachikawa (a suburb west of Tokyo) while vacationing in Japan. Humour, rather than veneration, sets the tone for the series, which is replete with visual gags and puns. For example, when the roommates discover that the prizes they have won at a shrine festival are cheap imitations of coveted handheld videogames, Nakamura quips: &quot;The two were enlightened as to the true flavour of Japanese festivals,&quot; playing on a double sense of the word daigomi, which can either mean sublime Buddhist teaching or \u2013 more colloquially \u2013 the &quot;true charm&quot; of something. Similarly, quirky interactions that juxtapose episodes from Jesus&apos;s ministry with hilarious social faux pas provide opportunities to chuckle. When Jesus says that he &quot;just wants to wash his [disciples&apos;] feet,&quot; a local gangster who overhears him misinterprets this phrase in its figurative sense as an indication of one&apos;s desire to start afresh after a life of crime. Jesus, oblivious to this misunderstanding, unwittingly gains notoriety among the mob as a particularly tough villain. Nakamura&apos;s protagonists, though saintly, are hardly infallible. Jesus&apos;s all-encompassing love makes him excessively enthusiastic (Nakamura portrays him as a compulsive shopaholic), while Buddha&apos;s ascetic tendencies make him seem \u2013 as the back of one volume states \u2013 like &quot;the parsimonious lady next door&quot;. The roommates drink beer, update blogs, and play online games, generally trying to have a good time while assiduously attempting to blend into contemporary. Like many tourists, however, they stick out like sore thumbs. Teenage girls swoon over Jesus because of his resemblance to Johnny Depp, while neighbourhood boys tease Buddha for the auspicious tuft of hair on his forehead. Inadvertent performance of miracles also threatens to reveal their true identities. Jesus, for example, mistakenly turns the water of the local public bath into wine, while Buddha literally glows in moments of excitement. Nakamura&apos;s rather irreverent depiction of these religious founders may seem blatantly sacrilegious, but upon investigation something more intriguing is apparent in her work. Statistically speaking, levels of religious belief and affiliation are strikingly low in contemporary Japan, and most people prefer to describe their participation in apparently religious activities as custom or amusement. This has led some observers to anticipate the incipient demise of religion in the country, and no doubt some might be tempted to use Nakamura&apos;s work as evidence in support of this hypothesis. However, whereas some author-artists have tended to downplay religion in their works or have used manga as a vehicle for criticism of the allegedly pernicious nature of marginal religious groups, Nakamura makes religion startlingly normal. Her story is not an introduction to abstruse religious doctrines, nor does it feature much overt commentary on the role of religions in contemporary society. Rather, she invites her readers to view contemporary Japan through the eyes of protagonists who are unambiguously religious. While Saint Young Men hardly exhibits strict fidelity to canonical sources, Nakamura has done her homework. She seamlessly weaves tales of the Buddha&apos;s former lives and gospel accounts of Jesus&apos;s ministry into her narrative, loosely citing the biographies of these founders while (literally) drawing those stories into the present. While it is doubtful that her audience reads the manga for religious inspiration (and it is similarly doubtful that Nakamura intends to proselytise), one possible result of the work may be increased audience familiarity with \u2013 and even interest in \u2013 such canonical stories. It is therefore not insignificant that Nakamura&apos;s farfetched plot demands willing and sustained suspension of disbelief. While it remains to be seen how Saint Young Men will be interpreted over the long term, for the moment it has successfully captured the mercurial interests of contemporary Japanese audiences. The incongruous juxtaposition of ostensibly sacrosanct figures with mundane situations such as overpriced cafes, busybody landlords and free refills at family restaurants is inherently humorous, and through their eyes quotidian Japan suddenly looks exciting and new. Jesus and Buddha enter the audience&apos;s imagination not as staid preachers, but rather as the adventurous boys who live next door. The manga therefore demonstrates that venerable religious figures lead active lives outside the hallowed halls of church and temple and beyond the margins of scripture. While religion may be a laughing matter for Nakamura and her audience, the role this manga might play in building and sustaining familiarity with the biographies of religious founders is certainly not to be scoffed at."}, {"sentences": ["Recent snowy days have seen Heathrow-bound British Airways passengers from Bangalore, Boston, Cairo, Istanbul, Montreal and Tokyo making unwanted diversions to Newcastle airport."], "tags": ["Newcastle United", "Sunderland", "Football", "Sport", "Steve Bruce"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-26T07:00:05Z", "title": "Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce could take the north-east into Europe | Louise Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/dec/26/alan-pardew-steve-bruce-newcastle-sunderland", "article": "Recent snowy days have seen Heathrow-bound British Airways passengers from Bangalore, Boston, Cairo, Istanbul, Montreal and Tokyo making unwanted diversions to Newcastle airport.

Just as their local airport is proving rather good at coping with adverse weather, Newcastle United have a habit of rising to the occasion. If erratic home results against the Premier League&apos;s lesser lights were largely responsible for Chris Hughton&apos;s sacking, Pardew inherited a side who had won at Arsenal as well as thrashing Aston Villa 6-0 and Sunderland 5-1. It has left Newcastle eighth, two places behind a Sunderland side whose reaction to that autumnal humiliation on Tyneside has been the mounting of a concerted Europa League push symbolised by a startling 3-0 victory at Chelsea. The outside air temperatures may still be sub-zero but things are warming up nicely in the north-east, where last season Newcastle were in the Championship and Sunderland were worried about relegation. Boxing Day offers a litmus test of the Tyne-Wear rivals&apos; progress and potential. While Pardew pits his wits against the Blue half of Manchester, Steve Bruce takes Sunderland to Old Trafford seeking a maiden win against his old manager at United, Sir Alex Ferguson. Neither Ferguson nor Roberto Mancini will be remotely complacent. While Pardew says he possesses &quot;four or five top players&quot; Bruce \u2013 whose decision to revert from 4-5-1 to 4-4-2 since the Newcastle debacle has paid dividends \u2013 talks of building the best squad in Sunderland&apos;s history and hosting &quot;fabulous European nights&quot; at the Stadium of Light. It could all turn out to be a cruel chimera. Yet with Asamoah Gyan, the \u00a313m African Footballer of the Year, alongside Darren Bent and the United loanee Danny Welbeck in attack, Jordan Henderson pulling strings in midfield and Craig Gordon marshalling a defence that has produced the most Premier League clean sheets this season, there seems genuine cause for optimism by the Wear. For all that, the attacking relationship between Bent and Gyan is not always smooth and, although Bruce&apos;s team are slowly evolving from reactive scrappers to pass and move stylists, there is a lack of midfield flair. &quot;We can&apos;t get carried away,&quot; acknowledges Gary Rowell, a goalscoring Sunderland cult hero of the 1970s and 1980s who is now a local radio match analyst. &quot;We&apos;ve seen numerous false dawns. But we are level on points with Tottenham and Harry Redknapp is still talking about their chances of challenging for the league title. We&apos;re not in a false position. Sunderland are in a good place at the moment; we can go to Old Trafford and express ourselves.&quot; Public expression is not something to which Ellis Short and Mike Ashley, the rich owners of Sunderland and Newcastle, are prone; Short has refrained from uttering a word to the media since buying the Wearside club. Omert\u00e0 is not the only thing they have in common. If Ashley&apos;s highly impulsive, knee-jerk stewardship of Newcastle contrasts with Short&apos;s infinitely more patiently measured delegation to his eloquent chairman, Niall Quinn, the pair share some broadly similar strategies. Both owners have a deliberate policy of signing, and then honing, young, often hitherto little known, players. Sunderland&apos;s Ahmed Elmohamady and Newcastle&apos;s Cheik Tiot\u00e9 are prime\u00a0examples. While Short&apos;s initial patience with Bruce is paying off, Pardew&apos;s somewhat demanding brief is to ensure his new team immediately start winning with panache. Ashley deemed Hughton&apos;s tactics overly cautious. Newcastle&apos;s latest manager, judging by his liberal use of the word &quot;aesthetic&quot; in discussing varying the service to Carroll and enthusing about hurting opponents courtesy of a &quot;possession game&quot;, Newcastle&apos;s latest manager seems to have taken that message to heart. Preventing things from ending in tears will, as ever here, not be easy but equally there is no reason why a now mercifully less brash Pardew should not reprise the purple patch he enjoyed in charge of West Ham. At least after spending a few early adult years working as a glazier on skyscrapers in London and the Middle East, he has acquired the knack of holding his nerve in precarious situations. Newcastle players are already describing his heavy deployment of psychology as mind strengthening. Providing he can cling on to Carroll next month, it is not impossible that Pardew&apos;s head for heights could come in handy as his side challenge Sunderland for Europa League qualification. Newcastle airport&apos;s autumn schedule may yet feature flights to exciting new, football-centric, continental destinations."}, {"sentences": ["At Zojoji, a 600-year-old Buddhist temple in central Tokyo, thousands released balloons at midnight carrying notes with their hopes for 2011."], "tags": ["New year", "World news", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2010-12-31T13:57:00Z", "title": "New Year's Eve parties kick off around the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/31/new-years-eve-parties-world", "article": "     Vast crowds in Sydney welcomed the new year in a blaze of fireworks described as the city&apos;s best party since the 2000 Olympics. Celebrations kicked off with displays by vintage aircraft and a parade of 50 illuminated boats, and culminated in a 12-minute firework extravaganza set to music. An estimated 1.5 million people lined the harbour, some arriving as early as 6am for the celebrations that took 15 months to prepare. At the Sydney Opera bar, people paid $A500 (\u00a3330) for the privilege. Mary Richards, a 49-year-old teacher from Bournemouth, said she had refused tickets to the Melbourne cricket Test after her son, Craig, 16, told her he would rather be partying in Sydney. &quot;We had been offered tickets for Melbourne but didn&apos;t bother going because we wanted to drive up to Sydney in time,&quot; she told the Australian Associated Press. &quot;It&apos;s not often you get to watch England win the Ashes in Australia, but we felt it was even rarer that we would get to see these fireworks.&quot; The Australian newspaper asked the public to remember north-eastern Australia, where some 200,000 people are affected by floods covering an area larger than France and Germany. According to its website, &quot;the party [in Sydney] went off at the cost of [Aus] $5m \u2013 five-fold the start-up fund provided for Queensland&apos;s flood relief&quot;. In Christchurch, New Zealand, two minor earthquakes failed to dampen enthusiasm for all-night celebrations. Thousands of revellers shrugged off a 3.3 magnitude quake that struck just before 10pm to celebrate in Cathedral Square. This year also marked the first time the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, officially celebrated the new year with a countdown party attended by an estimated 55,000 people, complete with a light show and foreign DJs in front of the city&apos;s elegant French colonial-style opera house. The move reflected growing western influence in a country which has paid little attention to the changing of the calendar in the past, instead devoting its attention to celebrations during Tet, the lunar new year that begins on 3 February. As rainclouds cleared in Madrid, thousands of people, many sporting large, brightly coloured wigs this year, gathered in the city&apos;s central Puerta del Sol square to take part in &quot;Las Uvas,&quot; or &quot;The Grapes,&quot; a tradition in which people eat a grape for each of the 12 chimes of midnight. Chewing and swallowing the grapes to each tolling of the bell is supposed to bring good luck, while cheating is frowned on; revellers believe it brings misfortune. In South Korea, up to 100,000 people attended a bell-ringing ceremony in central Seoul, with officials and citizens striking the large bronze bell in the Bosingak bell pavilion 33 times at midnight. At midnight in Taipei fireworks formed a spiralling dragon climbing up the city&apos;s tallest skyscraper. In Japan, New Year&apos;s Eve is generally spent at home with family but those who venture out go to temples to pray for good luck in the new year. At Zojoji, a 600-year-old Buddhist temple in central Tokyo, thousands released balloons at midnight carrying notes with their hopes for 2011. In New York, which has been blanketed by a snowstorm, nearly a million revellers were expected to cram into the streets around Times Square to watch the traditional midnight ball-drop. In Dublin people flocked to the Christchurch cathedral to listen as the bells chimed in the new year. In Scotland, tickets for the biggest of the celebrations in Edinburgh had sold out after forecasts of clear skies, after a fortnight of snow and ice. Around 10,000 people were thought to be at Newcastle and Gateshead&apos;s joint Snow Queen event, while the predicted size of crowds in London prompted the Metropolitan police to set up a Twitter feed to update partygoers on bottlenecks and public transport."}], "docs": 484}
