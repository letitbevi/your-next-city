He and his partner, Alexis Zerroug, have created a multi-modal, spatial augmented reality, a system that instantaneously changes household objects into communication devices. The effect, known as &quot;invoked computing&quot;, is a process that has enabled Cassinelli to transform a discarded pizza box into a laptop computer and a banana into a telephone. The idea won the grand prize at Laval Virtual, an international conference and exhibition on virtual reality and converging technologies. How did you come up with the idea of &quot;invoked computing&quot;? The project started with a self-imposed challenge which had both ecological and geeky motivations. The question was: could we revive an old laptop computer thrown in the garbage, not by repairing its internal components but by using augmented reality (our speciality), thus transforming this inert, rain-soaked object into something functional again \u2013 something that looked &quot;alive&quot; for any casual observer from the outside? Soon, we realised that, were we to succeed, something very interesting would be happening: although the computer would be &quot;dead&quot;, it would perform fine thanks to the intervention of external, invisible powers. Life would be instilled from the outside; the corpse of the computer would be &quot;possessed&quot;, animated like a puppet by a ubiquitous &quot;ambient intelligence&quot;. And nobody would notice the difference. When looking for a name, I first thought about &quot;poltergeist computing&quot; or &quot;zombie computing&quot;, but the connotations were all too negative. We settled on invoked computing which seemed more appropriate: it makes you think about spiritual invocation (of invisible, higher powers) as well as of the software engineering technical expression: &quot;invoking an application&quot; meaning &quot;to launch it&quot;. Why the banana and the pizza box? In the invoked computing scenario, the object itself works as an &quot;invocation&quot; trigger and supports interactivity. We naturally looked for trigger-objects that are more or less pervasive in the real world, hence food-related items (the banana and pizza box). As triggers, they operate in ways similar to icons in a computer operating system: these are not the applications themselves, but keys to open them, to invoke them. On the other hand, real physical objects become the support for the interaction, provide surfaces on which to project images or sound. So, in effect, you&apos;re turning everyday objects into touchscreens? Not exactly. The invoked computing project proposes systems to project &quot;function&quot; on real objects, but without making the interactive space resemble a screen with icons. Indeed, we are not trying to project icons or conventional representations of computer applications into the real world that when touched will launch a particular computing routine. Instead, affordances in the physical world itself should suggest and trigger function \u2013 even new, improvised functions. So gestures bring the objects to life?  An evocative gesture can be very informative of the intentions of its performer. I&apos;ve been living in Japan for 11 years now and I know first hand that this form of non-verbal communication was (and still is) the most reliable device I have when I want to avoid ambiguity in everyday situations In the case of the banana phone, a real handset is not really required, only something that suggests the action of calling on a phone. That &quot;something&quot; can be a combination of a referential object, reinforced by an unequivocal, perhaps exaggerated theatrical gesture. Is this something that could be made commercially available? Clearly, this could be used in controlled situations. If you&apos;re in a bar and you want to read the menu, you could open your napkin and the menu could be projected there. It&apos;s totally feasible. There&apos;s also the idea that instead of a device dying and you having to buy a replacement, what if the obsolete one started working to make an augmented environment? Perhaps to the point where maybe you wouldn&apos;t need to buy a new computer again. I&apos;m not saying we shouldn&apos;t continue evolving more powerful computer systems, but they could have a longer life. Is the idea that having the newest thing is the best thing a false one? Exactly. Maybe writing on a typewriter is more efficient than using an iPad. Invoked Computing gives you the opportunity to use what you know best and continue to use it, even if it doesn&apos;t work any more. It&apos;s like having an old car you like very much; you don&apos;t want to throw it away but there are no spare parts to repair it. Never mind \u2013 let&apos;s just make it work from the outside. It&apos;s using these very powerful resources to make things live again. It&apos;s more than just personalising your desktop, it&apos;s like personalising your physical world. You don&apos;t need to be influenced by designers at other companies: you decide and the function will come to you. People like to follow trends. If this technology were to work very well, it would be a problem. Instead of an iPhone, you would just have cardboard or a deck of cards, so it would change the way people relate to objects. We&apos;ll see what happens."}, {"sentences": ["At the same time, the resilience of the yen is giving exporters a headache, and Tokyo&apos;s feuding politicians are still wrestling with how the country will manage its eye-watering debt burden.", "Tokyo has long been able to rely on the deep pockets of Japanese savers to fund much of its borrowing; but the savings ratio \u2013 the share of their income consumers put by for a rainy day \u2013 has dropped from 10% a decade ago to 3% today, while the ageing population means a growing number of people will be spending their savings."], "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Banking", "Financial crisis", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:05:37Z", "title": "If RBS takes stakes in its ailing debtors, who knows what George Osborne could end up owning?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/01/rbs-debtors-osborne-owning", "article": "For the coalition&apos;s intellectual leading lights, not least George Osborne, rolling back the boundaries of the state is not just a short-term necessity imposed by the demands of the sovereign bond markets, but a deep-seated article of faith. So it&apos;s a strange irony that bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, more than three-quarters of which is owned by the state, carries the fate of a large swath of Britain&apos;s ailing corporate sector in its hands. It&apos;s not in RBS&apos;s remit to safeguard the livelihoods of the tens of thousands of workers whose future depends on the struggling firms it lent money to back in the boom years. But this year, as more and more private employers appear to be heading for the buffers, scrutiny of the role being played by major corporate lenders \u2013 and particularly taxpayer-owned RBS \u2013 looks destined only to intensify. Already, it&apos;s not impossible to envisage a situation where shop staff at struggling high street chains HMV, Peacocks and Clinton Cards join maids and receptionists at Jarvis Hotels and staff at Four Seasons care homes who are already \u2013 albeit indirectly and partially \u2013 employed by RBS. Like it or not, Osborne has a portfolio of interests that stretches way beyond the family wallpaper business, and that portfolio is likely to grow significantly. As Simon Bowers explains on page 34, the taxpayer bank has shown itself unafraid to step in with bold remedial action in the case of large but struggling businesses \u2013 including taking controlling stakes. The same fate could yet befall TV production house Endemol, Thomas Cook and even sub-prime doorstep loan collector Cattles. As we slip with trepidation into 2012, it may well be that, whether the government wishes it or not, another stealthy wave of quasi-state expansion emerges. Employers large and small are expected to come cap in hand to RBS and fellow state-backed lender Lloyds. It was Alistair Darling and his apparatchiks who decided it wasn&apos;t for the Treasury to second-guess the management of the banks it had bailed out. The decision was in tune with the mood of the moment: Osborne had accused Labour of harking back to 1970s-style nationalisations in rescuing the banks, and the government was petrified of exacerbating the already febrile mood in the markets by appearing to seize control of the financial sector. Yet that was before a shortage of credit to the real economy threatened to choke off what scant recovery there was, and before the eurozone crisis raised the spectre of a new global recession. We have already been treated to the bizarre spectacle of ministers negotiating with banks they largely own about how much the lenders will deign to make available for small and medium-sized businesses. With a string of high-profile firms likely to be forced into the hands of the taxpayer in the coming months, Osborne and business secretary Vince Cable should make it clear to the banks that they must be run in the long-term interests of the economy, not for a short-term return to the private sector, which, as the cut-price sale of Northern Rock to Richard Branson earlier last year showed, is unlikely to be a boon to taxpayers. It&apos;s an unenviable tightrope-walk: Japan&apos;s experience shows that propping up &quot;zombie&quot; banks with balance sheets stuffed full of non-performing loans can weigh on growth for years. Equally, some of the debt-burdened firms that found their way onto RBS&apos;s books in the early 2000s were only viable in boom years. But 2012 is going to be a(nother) grim year for businesses up and down the country: they need to know their banks are in it for the long term, and if the job losses start to pile up, the role of RBS and Lloyds could become increasingly controversial. For the time being, it looks as though rolling back the boundaries of the state will just have to wait. \u25a0 Observer reader John Webster has risen admirably to the challenge of suggesting an appropriate soundtrack for the economy in 2012. Instead of listing a few suitably apocalyptic hit tunes from the recession-hit 1980s, he&apos;s composed one of his own, available here, which takes in a broad sweep of history, from Waterloo to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. His refrain is simple: &quot;Turbulent times, turbulent times, sometimes you&apos;re gonna live in turbulent times.&quot; Indeed. The euro crisis was so last year. Now it&apos;s the yen It&apos;s been All About The Euro for the past 12 months, barring a few days of panic about America&apos;s credit rating. But this year, we may have to spread our worries a bit more thinly. In the dying days of 2011, early warning signals began to suggest that as the euro crisis rumbles on, Japan could be next in the markets&apos; firing line. The Japanese central bank made heavy use of the US Federal Reserve&apos;s currency-swap arrangements in Christmas week, borrowing $9bn to pass on to the financial sector. That&apos;s tiny compared with the $33bn guzzled up by eurozone banks, but it does suggest Japan&apos;s financial sector is fragile. At the same time, the resilience of the yen is giving exporters a headache, and Tokyo&apos;s feuding politicians are still wrestling with how the country will manage its eye-watering debt burden. Japan&apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio, at over 200%, dwarfs that of Greece or Portugal, and more than half its firms pay no tax to the state. Tokyo has long been able to rely on the deep pockets of Japanese savers to fund much of its borrowing; but the savings ratio \u2013 the share of their income consumers put by for a rainy day \u2013 has dropped from 10% a decade ago to 3% today, while the ageing population means a growing number of people will be spending their savings. A recent IMF report warned that Japan should take urgent action to prevent these deteriorating debt dynamics from forcing up bond yields: but one of the few proposed measures to bring in more revenue \u2013 an increase in the consumption tax \u2013 prompted nine members from the ruling DPJ party to resign from the house of representatives last week. Their reticence is understandable: a premature increase in the consumption tax was seen as one of the key reasons Japan slumped back into recession in the mid-1990s after a market crash at the start of the decade. But as the travails of Italy in 2011 illustrated, if a country&apos;s debt burden is large enough, a loss of market confidence is catastrophic, because even a relatively small increase in borrowing costs can rapidly create an economic and political crisis.

It has emerged that Hirata, a former member of the Aum Supreme Truth doomsday cult, was sent away by the officer on duty when he first tried to turn himself in, late on New Year&apos;s Eve. The policeman thought it was a prank. But the supposed prankster was a former member of a fanatical group whose members carried out a fatal sarin gas attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995, killing 12 people and making 6,000 others sick. The terrorist attack remains the worst on Japanese soil. Hirata, wanted in connection with the kidnapping and death earlier that year of a civil servant whose sister was trying to leave the cult, tried again but failed to convince the officer that the face that had been staring down from 150,000 wanted posters for almost 17 years was his. According to media reports, the 46-year-old suspect was arrested only after he walked, at the officer&apos;s urging, to a smaller police station several hundred metres away. Hirata&apos;s hair was longer than in photographs taken in the mid-1990s but his facial features and physique had barely changed during the years in hiding. &quot;He apparently hasn&apos;t had any plastic surgery,&quot; a police source told the Yomiuri Shimbun daily. Only sketchy details have emerged of Hirata&apos;s life as a fugitive since his arrest, in the early hours of Sunday. According to the Yomiuri he claimed shame had led him to turn himself in after he witnessed the misery caused by the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. &quot;The senseless scenes from Tohoku after the earthquake made me question by own situation,&quot; he was quoted as telling Taro Takimoto, a lawyer who helped people leave the cult, and who agreed to meet the suspect in custody. &quot;I decided I would turn myself in before the year was up.&quot; How Hirata managed to evade detection for so long remains a mystery. Dressed in jeans and a quilted jacket, he was carrying a rucksack containing underwear, clothes, shampoo and other items. &quot;He was as neat as a pin,&quot; one officer was quoted as saying. He reportedly refused to explain the 100,000 yen (\u00a3834) in cash found in his possession, although he is understood to have received 10m yen from the cult shortly after the attacks. Hirata is suspected of conspiring to kidnap and confine Kiyoshi Kariya, a notary official who died after cult members injected him with an anaesthetic to get him to talk about his sister, who had escaped from the group. Hirata is not thought to have taken part in the gas attacks that destroyed Japan&apos;s faith in its public safety on the morning of 20 March 1995. Aum&apos;s former leader, Shoko Asahara, and 12 other senior cult members have been given the death penalty, although these sentences have not been carried out. A further two cult members \u2013 Katsuya Takahashi and Naoko Kikuchi \u2013 remain at large. Police also suspect Hirata was involved in the 1995 attempted murder of Takaji Kunimatsu, the then chief of the national police agency. He denies any involvement in the shooting, and reportedly decided to avoid arrest in connection with that crime by turning himself in after the statute of limitations expired in 2010. Police suspect Hirata&apos;s decision was influenced by the death last July of his mother, to whom he was very close. In the few reported comments he has made to investigators, Hirata appears to be trying to distance himself from the cult, which has renamed itself Aleph and claims to eschew violence but remains under police surveillance. He reportedly told Takimoto, who was injured in a separate sarin attack in 1994, that he no longer believed in the teachings of Asahara, adding that the former guru deserved to be hanged."}, {"sentences": ["We played this XBLA treat at the Tokyo Game Show, and it is ludicrously entertaining."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "PC", "PS3", "Wii", "PS Vita", "3DS", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-04T12:08:00Z", "title": "The 25 most anticipated original games of 2012 \u2013 part one", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jan/04/25-original-games-2012", "article": "If you had a bit of time on your hands over the festive break, you may have already cast your eyes over half a dozen &quot;most anticipated games of 2012&quot; lists.

But what of the new games \u2013 the originals, the titles that don&apos;t belong to a rolling franchise? Are there any of those to look forward to this year? Yes, of course there are \u2013 and we&apos;ve tracked down 25 of them for your anticipatory pleasure. Yes, many of the following titles do look rather familiar, but there is some genuine innovation in here and \u2013 I&apos;ll stupidly venture \u2013 one or two potential game of the year contenders.  If you&apos;re determined to limit your intake of heavily processed, endlessly re-packaged entertainment brands this year, this is a good place to start. Look out for Part Two on Thursday. Journey (Sony/thatgamecompany, PS3)            Developer thatgamecompany has purposefully kept the narrative details of its intriguing adventure title secret, but the gist is, you&apos;re in a desert kingdom trying to reach a distant mountain, and you can team up with another player to get there. Everything else is a delicious mystery. We wrote a lot about this fascinating and highly experimental project last year and we&apos;re desperate to see how the unique anonymous co-op mode works. For now, check out our interview with producer Robin Hunicke, which provides a glimpse into the ideas behind the game. The Last Guardian (Sony/Team Ico, PS3)            There were fears at the close of last year that we&apos;d never see this third endeavour from celebrated Sony development studio, Team Ico \u2013 but despite the departure of the director Fumito Ueda (who retains control in a freelance capacity), it seems the title will arrive in 2012. Although details are sketchy, we can expect another mournful third-person adventure in the style of predecessor Shadows of the Colossus, but this time revolving around a boy trying to rescue a giant feathered creature named Trico from a looming citadel. Heartache, wonder and beauty are sure to follow. Lollipop Chainsaw (Warner Bros/Grasshopper, PS3, Xbox 360)            Ah yes, it&apos;s the latest Grand Guignol slaughter-fest from the wonky mind of creative director Suda 51, previously responsible for the likes of Killer 7, No more Heroes and Shadows of the Damned. Set in a US high school that&apos;s suddenly overrun with zombies and featuring a sexy cheerleader as its lead character, we&apos;re expecting a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawn of the Dead, as re-imagined by Troma Entertainment. Boasting oodles of gore, politically incorrect sex appeal and hallucinogenic visuals \u2013 it could either turn out to be the exploitation hit of the year or a leering, misogynistic fantasy with lots of swearing. Either way, we&apos;re keen to see it.  Overstrike (EA/Insomniac, PS3, Xbox 360            Having spent the last decade as a PlayStation-only developer cranking out hit franchises Ratchet and Clank and Resistance, Insomniac is going multi-platform in 2012. Overstrike is a four-player co-op shooter, where a ragtag group of mercenaries, thieves and scientists must prevent a global terrorist group from destroying mankind. Boasting slightly cartoon-ish visuals, ridiculous gadgets and over-sized weaponry, Overstrike&apos;s metaphorical tongue is placed firmly in its cheek here \u2013 and while the set-up hardly screams innovation, we&apos;re hoping the co-operative dynamics lead to lots of fun sci-fi blasting.  Devil&apos;s Third (THQ/Valhalla Game Sudios, PS3, Xbox 360)            The latest title from every feminist&apos;s favourite game designer Tomonobu Itagaki (the creator of bosom-fest Dead or Alive), Devil&apos;s Third looks to be a thematic continuation of his work on the Ninja Gaiden series \u2013 with a slight deviation: it&apos;s still about bloody third-person hyper-violence, but now it&apos;s a shooter rather than a sword-slasher. Other than that, little is known about the game at the moment, but the trailers look \u2026 intense.  Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (EA/38 Studios, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            With the RPG landscape currently dominated by monsters like Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Fable and Final Fantasy is there rooms for another epic universe to sidle in and wave its morning star about? Well, yeah, if the RPG in question is designed by Elder Scrolls veteran Ken Rolston, with a story by fantasy novelist RA Salvatore and art styling from Todd McFarlane. The promise is smooth combat, constant character customisation and an engrossing narrative \u2013 it&apos;ll need all of them to prise fans away from last year&apos;s behemoths Skyrim and Dark Souls. The Secret World (Funcom/EA, PC)            If you&apos;re looking for a whole new massively multiplayer online experience to dominate your life this year, the latest ambitious creation from Age of Conan creator Funcom could be just the thing. The Secret World is a conspiracy-fuelled adventure in which players join one of three arcane societies \u2013 the Illuminati, the Dragon or the Templars \u2013 and then battle their enemies across a modern day setting splattered with mythological and religious elements. Apparently, there will be no levelling up and no classes \u2013 players will customise their characters via a freeform, skill-based system, ridding the game of the grinding process that puts many off the whole MMORPG concept. Previews have been positive and a beta is due to start soon. Escape Plan (Sony/Fun Bits, PlayStation Vita)            Although Uncharted: Golden Abyss is attracting much of the attention, the most interesting PlayStation Vita launch title is actually an idiosyncratic monochrome puzzler from Seattle-based developer Fun Bits. Your aim is to help two weird characters named Lil and Laarg escape from a labyrinth filled with fiendish traps. Naturally, this involves using the console&apos;s array of touchscreen and analogue inputs to prod, squeeze and shove the duo through a deadly mass of spikes, chasms and hammers. As Fun Bits are the chaps behind acclaimed multiplayer strategy game, Fat Princess, we&apos;re expecting bags of offbeat fun and charm.  I am alive (Ubisoft, PS3, Xbox 360)            Ubisoft&apos;s survival horror adventure has been &quot;downsized&quot; to a digital release since its original announcement three years ago, but this still looks to be an ambitious and intriguing title. Your job is to help an everyman survivor track down his family in a post-apocalyptic America, in the immediate aftermath of some kind of massive global disaster. Exploration is the key activity, but players will also have to find, use and/or barter goods like food, climbing equipment and cigarettes with other survivors. Think The Day After Tomorrow crossed with Irem&apos;s Disaster Report series. Fez (polytron, Xbox 360)            Pitched on some uncanny plane of the imagination between Super Paper Mario and Echochrome, Fez is a gorgeous 2D/3D platformer, which uses Escher-esque optical illusions and perspective shifts to create new pathways for the player. The retro-tinged visuals, chiptune soundtrack and brilliantly lateral puzzles have made it a favourite on the indie scene, but we expect creator Phil Fish \u2013 who has laboured over this gem for three years \u2013 may well have a crossover hit on his hands. Asura&apos;s Wrath (Capcom/CyberConnect2, PS3, Xbox 360)            Oh okay, another third-person hack-&apos;em-up. But it&apos;s okay, because this one intriguingly mixes mythological and sci-fi themes and locations, and is by CyberConnect2, the studio responsible for the cult .hack series of action RPGs. Asura it turns out is an ancient warrior, re-animated after 12,000 years and out for revenge on those who betrayed him. Retribution will involve highly charged melee combat, interactive cinematic sequences and an episodic TV series-style structure. Botanicula (Amanita design, PC, Mac)            A real crowd-pleaser at 2011&apos;s GameCity festival, Botanicula is the latest eerily atmospheric point-and-click puzzle adventure from Czech studio, Amanita design. Players control a group of surreal woodland creatures as they attempt to save their enormous tree habitat from a dark force. Each screen is filled with beautiful animations and mini-games the likes of which you&apos;ll find absolutely nowhere else. We can&apos;t wait to gaze at it in quiet awe. Sound Shapes (Sony/Queasy Games, PS Vita)            Is it a 2D scrolling platformer? Is it a music creation app? Why, this highly stylised Vita title from Toronto-based Queasy Games is both! As players explore the vibrant environment, they lay down new musical notes, creating a sort of emergent ambient soundtrack \u2013 which can then be uploaded and shared with other players. Set to feature tracks by dance music superstar Deadmau5 this one could be muscling in on Wipeout 2048&apos;s role as the hippest title on Vita. BattleBlock Theater (The Behemoth, Xbox 360)            When renowned adventurer Hatty Hattington washes up on a tropical island, the last thing he expects to find is a gladitorial threatre run by a demonic civilisation of intelligent cats. Yet that is exactly where he and his faithful servant end up in this crazed comic book-style platformer from indie legend Behemoth, famous for catapulting Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers onto an unsuspecting public. What follows is a series of fiendish puzzle platform levels in which players can take part together, switching between co-op and competitive tactics as they help each other through the traps, while also trying to pick up the most gems. We played this XBLA treat at the Tokyo Game Show, and it is ludicrously entertaining. Likely to be one of the downloadable highlights of the year. Beat Sneak Bandit (Simogo, iOS)             Billed as a rhythmic puzzle adventure, the latest visual treat from Swedish duo Simogo has you stealing clocks from evil genius Baron Von Clockface on a series of platform levels. Every move in the game, from opening doors to evading guards, has to be matched to the soundtrack, so learning the rhythms and stepping accordingly is the key. Like its predecessor, Bumpy Road, Beat Sneak Bandit has a lovely, whimsical look reminiscent of old Friz Freleng cartoons. It&apos;s just about as far from Devil&apos;s Third as you could hope to get."}, {"sentences": ["Xbox 360)            One of the more visually arresting titles on show at 2011&apos;s Tokyo Game Show, Blades is yet another hack-&apos;n&apos;-slash romp, this time from Russian developer Gaijin Entertainment, best known for flight sims such as IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PS3", "Xbox", "PC", "Wii", "3DS", "PS Vita", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T11:24:00Z", "title": "The 25 most anticipated original games of 2012 \u2013 part two", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jan/05/25-original-games-2012", "article": "On Wednesday we posted the first 15 of our 25 new games to look forward to in 2012, eschewing sequels such as Diablo III and Borderlands 2 in favour of originals such as Botanicula, Lollipop Chainsaw and Escape Plan.

Put at least one of these on your must-have list this year and you can smugly relax in the knowledge that you&apos;re supporting new development in the games industry. Then you can always buy Diablo III as well. NeverDead (Konami, PS3, Xbox 360)            Looking very much like a cross between Devil May Cry and Shadows of the Damned, this third-person hack-n&apos;-slasher features immortal demon hunter Bryce Boltzmann who has a novel way of dealing with potentially disabling combat injuries. Whenever some hellish foe lops off one of his arms or legs, he can use it as a weapon before re-attaching it. Boltzmann can even remove his head and roll it into inaccessible areas to check for possible escape routes. I think that&apos;s all we need to say, really. ETA: 3 February Blades of Time (Konami/Gaijin Entertainment, PS3. Xbox 360)            One of the more visually arresting titles on show at 2011&apos;s Tokyo Game Show, Blades is yet another hack-&apos;n&apos;-slash romp, this time from Russian developer Gaijin Entertainment, best known for flight sims such as IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey. Here, statuesque treasure hunter Ayumi finds herself stranded on a dangerous island with bizarre physical properties, allowing her to rewind time and engage the help of her past selves. Or something like that. The environments \u2013 all deadly chasms and rolling jungles \u2013 look to have come straight out of a Henry Rider Haggard book, while Ayumi may well have sauntered straight from the pages of Hustler. If there is a large crossover between fans of time travel and statuesque treasure hunters, this should do really well.ETA: Q1, 2012 Anarchy Reigns (Sega/Platinum Games, PS3, Xbox 360)            The latest title from Platinum Games, the creator of cult favourites Bayonetta and Vanquish is a sort of distant cousin to insane monchrome Wii blaster MadWorld. It&apos;s an online multiplayer brawler set in a series of near-future arenas. Combat involves cybernetic ninjas, armoured battle mechs and mercenaries with chainsaws, and we can expect visual subtly to be reasonably low on the developer&apos;s list of priorities. ETA: 6 July Awesomenauts (Ronimo Games, PS3, Xbox 360)            The Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre \u2013 which combines the strategy elements of titles like Starcraft, with team-based action shooter components \u2013 really started to hot up last year, with titles like Dota 2 and League of Legends proving immensely popular. Now, talented Dutch developer Ronimo, respnsible for the excellent Wiiware RTS Swords &amp; Soldiers, is entering the fray with this futuristic blaster, pitching up to six players against each other in tactical galactic war. We&apos;re promised a huge array of weapons and items, as well as six different mercenaries, each with their own upgrades. And the 2D visuals make a change from the usual isometric view. Set to arrive on PSN and XBLA in February, it&apos;s another highly tempting digital treat. And just listen to the theme tune on the trailer \u2013 it&apos;s like the eighties never ended.ETA: February The Last Story (Nintendo/Mistwalker, Wii)            Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi returns with this promising action RPG following the advetures of young mercenary Zael who must navigate the dangerous island of Lazulis and its vast medieval city on a quest to become a worthy knight. We&apos;re promised an innovative combat system which includes a cover mechanic and a team-based attack known as The Gathering. Weapons and items are customisable through the game, and there&apos;s an online multiplayer mode to accompany the single-player campaign. With Nintendo&apos;s focus inevitably shifting to its next console this year, The Last Story may well prove a poignantly fitting title for the old Wii. ETA: 24 February Ruin (Sony/Idol Minds, PS3, Vita)            Seamless cross-platform gaming is likely to be a key theme in 2012, and this Diablo-style dungeon crawler from the makers of PSN hit PAIN could well be a key indicator of how the concept works. Vita owners are able to hack and slash their way through the isometric levels while out and about, then they can save their progress and pick up again on the PS3 version back at home. There is also Facebook support and Demon&apos;s Souls-style online functionality, allowing players to talk and trade with each other while on a mission. Both versions of the game are expected to be sold together as a package, but no release date has been announced. ETA: Erm, 2012 Dishonored (Bethesda/Arkane Studios, PC, PS3, Xbox 360      From Harvey Smith, lead designer on Deus Ex, and Viktor Antonov, art director on Half Life 2, comes this fascinating first-person stealth adventure, set in a retro-futuristic industrial city. Mixing elements of Deus Ex and the famed Thief titles, Dishonored revolves around a deadly assassin framed for the murder of an empress and now out for revenge. Players can choose to sneak about and spare enemies or take bloody retribution with a variety of weapons and emergent techniques. With Smith at the helm, it&apos;s likely to be dripping in atmosphere and narrative detail, and the combat mechanic, which also lets you use sinister powers to bend time and teleport, should be exact and satisfying. ETA: spring Retro City Rampage (VBlank Entertainment, Wii, Xbox 360)   Retro City Rampage OFFICIAL Trailer from Vblank on Vimeo.   It&apos;s rare that games even try to be funny these days \u2013 it&apos;s even rarer for them to succeed. But we have very high hopes for this colourful and painstakingly conceived Grand Theft Auto pastiche, lovingly crafted by Canadian games industry veteran Brian Provinciano and a small team of contributors. Set for release on WiiWare and XBLA, it&apos;s a mission-based open-world crime shooter, re-visualised as an 8-bit era home console game, then filled with daft jokes and cunning jabs at the gangsta genre. The indie crossover hit of the year? Could be.ETA: Q1 for the XBLA version, TBC on the WiiWare one. Mutant Mudds (Renegade Kid, NIntendo 3DS)            The 3DS line up for 2012 is dominated by sequels and continuations of ye olde Nintendo franchises \u2013 and certainly, colourful platformer Mutant Mudds looks like it could have begun life as a NES title. However, this retro-tinged oddity is in fact a total newcomer, created by Texan indie studio Renegade Kid \u2013 previously responsible for the implausibly scary DS horror title Dementium: The Ward. There are 40 levels to scorch through, and although the visuals are 2D, players are able to leap between foreground and background platforms adding some depth to the pixelated action. It&apos;ll be available from the eShop soon.ETA: Late January or early February, according to the game&apos;s Facebook page. Star Command (War Balloon Games, iOS)      Originally conceived as a PC game several years ago, this long-awaited sci-fi strategy sim should finally enter orbit this year \u2013 as an iOS title. Your job is to build a spaceship then command your crew on a voyage of discovery and combat, all in chunky isometric visuals. Comparisons are being drawn with Kairosoft&apos;s excellent Story titles, but this looks to be a deeper, more expansive challenge, allowing you to modify the craft to your play style (be a Picard-style diplomat or a Kirk-esque hothead), and reverse engineer alien technologies. So Game Dev Story meets Xcom via Sim City. Yes please.ETA: Don&apos;t hold your breath. And five more games we might not see until 2013... The Last of Us            Revealed with much fanfare at last year&apos;s Spike Video Game awards, The Last of Us is a post-apocalyptic survival horror adventure, pitting two survivors \u2013 14-year-old Ellie and bearded, wizened hard nut, Joel \u2013 against the zombie-like victims of a nightmarish fungal plague. Developer Naughty Dog is promising a much darker, bloodier and more mature experience than Uncharted, while the vision of a post-apocalyptic city, over-run with vegetation, hints at the movies I Am Legend and 28 Days Later, but also Ninja Theory&apos;s under-rated Enslaved \u2013 indeed, Mark Richard Davies, that game&apos;s lead designer, is working on this supposedly genre-defining experience. Fortnite (Epic Games)            The latest work from Gears of War creator Epic Games has groups of players scavenging for equipment and fortifications during the day, before defending their compound against enemies at night. Yep, it&apos;s Team Deathmatch meets Minecraft, with cartoon-style visuals and a typically large helping of Epic attitude. There are no platform or release details yet, but no doubt we&apos;ll hear more at E3 in the summer.  SpyParty      Veteran coder Chris Hecker has been working on this ingenious &quot;asymmetrical multiplayer&quot; experience for a couple of years and though a 2012 release is possible, 2013 could be more likely. The setup is simple: one player takes on the role of a spy attempting to carry out covert missions while attending an important diplomat&apos;s party; the other player is an assassin, watching the party from another building and waiting for the spy to reveal him or herself before shooting them. It&apos;s an incredibly tense game of body language and deduction \u2013 calling on interpersonal skills that this industry has rarely ever bothered with. I played for a few minutes at GameCity in 2010 and was utterly engrossed (see my interview with Chris here). Can&apos;t wait, then \u2013 but might have to. The Witness (Jonathan Blow, PC)      Jonathan Blow&apos;s follow up to his agenda-setting indie treasure Braid is a mysterious puzzler set on a richly detailed island. Comparisons have been made with PC classic Myst, though Blow&apos;s title is likely to be a much stranger, more interesting proposition. He&apos;s a perfectionist though, and working with a very small team, he could well allow the expected 2012 release to slip. Fingers crossed, he doesn&apos;t \u2013 Braid dragged indie gaming onto the mainstream agenda back in 2008, who knows what The Witness could do. Agent (Take-Two/Rockstar North, PS3) Rockstar&apos;s &apos;70s-based espionage thriller was officially announced at E3 back in 2009, promising us a globe-trotting interactive take on movies like the Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor. But then the PR machine spluttered to a halt, with only vague promises and assurances emanating from Take-Two HQ. With GTA V also in development at Rockstar&apos;s Edinburgh studio it&apos;s possible this one has been shunted along \u2013 or even off \u2013 the development calendar. But we&apos;re being optimistic."}, {"sentences": ["A Japanese restaurateur has parted with almost half a million pounds for a single bluefin tuna at the first auction of the year at Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji market.", "Last year, the Hong Kong restaurateur Ricky Cheng joined forces with an upmarket sushi restaurant in Tokyo to produce the winning bid."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fishing", "Environment", "Fish", "Life and style", "Food", "Food & drink", "Seafood"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T12:53:32Z", "title": "Bluefin tuna fish sells for record \u00a3473,000 at Tokyo auction", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/05/japanese-half-million-pound-tuna", "article": "A Japanese restaurateur has parted with almost half a million pounds for a single bluefin tuna at the first auction of the year at Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji market. Kiyoshi Kimura, who runs a chain of sushi restaurants, paid 56.5m yen (\u00a3473,000) for the 269-kg fish, which carries enough flesh for an estimated 10,000 pieces of sushi. The sum is almost twice the 32.49m yen paid at last year&apos;s opening auction, a largely symbolic affair and not \u2013 diners will be relieved to hear \u2013 an accurate reflection of wholesale fish prices. Japan has come under pressure to decrease its catch of Pacific and Atlantic bluefin, whose stocks have reached dangerously low levels, according to campaigners. Kimura, however, said he has made his record-breaking bid in an attempt to &quot;liven up Japan&quot; as it attempts to recover from last year&apos;s tsunami. &quot;Japan has been through a lot the last year due to the disaster,&quot; he said. &quot;It needs to stay strong. That&apos;s what I tried to do and I ended up buying the most expensive one.&quot; The businessman, who runs the Sushi-Zanmai chain of 46 restaurants, also claimed he was acting on behalf of homegrown sushi lovers, who for the past three years have seen the first big fish of the season snapped up by overseas bidders. Last year, the Hong Kong restaurateur Ricky Cheng joined forces with an upmarket sushi restaurant in Tokyo to produce the winning bid. But this year Kimura said his restaurants would slice up and serve the entire fish \u2013 caught in Oma off the northernmost tip of the main island of Honshu \u2013 in Japan, rather than let it go overseas. Although the restaurant needs to sell each piece of sushi for more than 6,000 yen to break even, Kimura is already selling prized slices of fatty otoro for a far more affordable 418 yen each, with the cheaper akami cuts going for about 130 yen apiece. &quot;It&apos;s unbelievable, Kosuke Shimogawara, a diner, told Associated Press. &quot;President Kimura is so generous. All I can say is thank you.&quot; Japan consumes about 80% of Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna, and has been accused of stifling international attempts to dramatically reduce fishing quotas or ban the trade altogether."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo recently became the last of Japan&apos;s 47 prefectures to introduce local laws aimed at depriving crime syndicates of income by targeting firms that knowingly do business with them."], "tags": ["Japan", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T15:17:05Z", "title": "Yakuza gangs face fight for survival as Japan cracks down on organised crime", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/05/japanese-yakuza-gangs-face-crackdown", "article": "After decades of tacit acceptance, Japan&apos;s yakuza gangs are facing their biggest challenge: not from the police, but from ordinary citizens who are under pressure to shun the mob or be named and shamed. Tokyo recently became the last of Japan&apos;s 47 prefectures to introduce local laws aimed at depriving crime syndicates of income by targeting firms that knowingly do business with them. Under the nationwide ordinances firms that help the yakuza earn money will be warned, and their names made public if they refuse to sever their ties. Repeat offenders face fines of up to 500,000 yen (\u00a34,200) and company officials can face jail terms of up to a year. The idea, say law enforcement officials, is to shame businesses into turning their backs on the mob. &quot;It is going to be more difficult for the yakuza to collect funds,&quot; said Akihiko Shiba, a former police superintendent who is now a lawyer specialising in corporate compliance. &quot;Police once concentrated on the gangs themselves, but the new approach is clamping down on those who help the gangs make money.&quot; The authorities&apos; fight against organised crime took another step forward on Thursday when the national police agency unveiled a new bill enabling officers to step up surveillance of the most violent gangs and take pre-emptive measures if necessary. The yakuza, a network of 22 gangs divided into factions that compete for wealth and influence, have had to rethink their operations after crackdowns on traditional sources of income such as prostitution, loan sharking, gambling and drug smuggling. Faced with depleting returns from traditional cash cows, many became active in the stock market, earning their money via front companies that appear to be respectable. The national police agency warned in a 2010 report that some firms had no idea they were dealing with the underworld. &quot;As crime syndicates have become very sophisticated in making their activities to acquire illicit funds opaque in recent years, it is quite possible that ordinary companies unknowingly conduct economic transactions with them,&quot; the report said. In 2009 Takaharu Ando, then chief of the police agency, declared war on the yakuza, ending a long-established practice of tolerating the mob, which in turn kept down street crime and adhered to established rules of engagement. The roots of that arrangement can be traced back to the 1800s, when the forerunners of the yakuza were permitted to carry weapons, provided they helped to maintain order when the police were short of manpower. The yakuza have since found it harder to bid for major construction projects through front companies, and to open new offices or buy private homes amid opposition from residents. The prospect of being shamed in public, as well as losing potential customers and bank loans, has prompted some legitimate businesses and groups to sever their yakuza ties. Last year Enryakuji, a prestigious Buddhist temple near Kyoto, said it would refuse to allow members of the Yamaguchi-gumi, the country&apos;s biggest crime group, to pay their respects there. The entertainment world was rocked by revelations that one of Japan&apos;s most successful TV celebrities, Shinsuke Shimada, had ties to organised crime. Shimada&apos;s immediate resignation was followed by vows from TV executives and a film studio in Kyoto to steer clear of the mob. A company that prints business cards said it would no longer accept orders from gang members. But Japan&apos;s most powerful yakuza don ridiculed the latest crackdown. Depriving large numbers of gang members of their livelihoods could damage public safety, Kenichi Shinoda, head of the Yamaguchi-gumi, said in a rare media interview. &quot;If the Yamaguchi-gumi were to be disbanded, public order would deteriorate immediately,&quot; he told the Sankei Shimbun. The result, he warned, would be the creation of a population of dispossessed mobsters who could turn to violent crime to make a living. &quot;Yakuza gangs are amazingly gentlemanlike,&quot; he said, citing the traditional respect for seniority that binds gangs together. &quot;[We] adhere to those values more than ordinary people do.&quot; The gangs themselves have produced manuals showing members how to sidestep the new laws. Some of the measures border on the banal: faxing documents rather than using made-to-order stationery, and cancelling contracts with outside caterers. The Yamaguchi-gumi is reportedly considering a ban on sending traditional gifts to business associates, and holds weekly meetings to discuss its response to the new ordinances. Other groups have distributed in-house guides to the legal changes, and even hold funerals for members on their own premises rather than risk entrapping privately run crematories. &quot;These moves demonstrate an awareness among gangs of how businesses they are associated with might fall foul of the law,&quot; an unnamed investigator told the Mainichi Shimbun. &quot;We want to cut off the gangs&apos; funding sources.&quot; But innocent citizens, too, risk having their livelihoods ruined by unwittingly providing services to the yakuza, said writer Atsushi Mizoguchi, Japan&apos;s foremost expert on organised crime. &quot;Some companies have already been named and shamed,&quot; he said. &quot;They can&apos;t get bank loans, or lenders have cancelled existing loans. In a few cases they have even gone bankrupt. Before, it used to be the police v the yakuza; now it&apos;s the people v the yakuza. The police have taken a step back and put more pressure on companies themselves to confront the yakuza.&quot; The police agency says total membership of crime syndicates fell from 88,600 in 1990 to 78,600 in 2010. Despite the dip, the yakuza remain a powerful force in Japanese society. Incredibly, yakuza membership is not illegal, even if the new ordinances will make it more difficult for gangsters to earn a decent living. &quot;In most other countries crime syndicates are banned, but Japan still recognises their right to exist,&quot; Mizoguchi said. &quot;The penalties for breaking these ordinances are quite light, but as the economy worsens, yakuza finances will weaken, so I at least expect to see more people dropping out of these organisations.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Domestic audiences in Taiwan are unafraid to embrace all things &quot;sentimental&quot;, a term of criticism elsewhere in the world, and so Chinese-language chart music is often perceived by outsiders as lacking the dynamism of the best acts from Seoul and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T16:14:13Z", "title": "Pop musik: the sound of the charts in \u2026 Taiwan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/jan/05/pop-musik-taiwan", "article": "     Viewed through reports in the western press, the battle for domination of Asia&apos;s charts would appear to be a straight fight between established superpower Japan and effervescent upstart South Korea. Rarely meriting a mention is the primary hub of Mandarin pop, Taiwan. This island state shares a language with mainland China but is free from the weight of its political control and has a cultural influence vastly disproportionate to its size. Domestic audiences in Taiwan are unafraid to embrace all things &quot;sentimental&quot;, a term of criticism elsewhere in the world, and so Chinese-language chart music is often perceived by outsiders as lacking the dynamism of the best acts from Seoul and Tokyo. Slow jams and gentle serenades rule the airwaves. But a new generation of Taiwanese stars drawing on US R&amp;B is significantly increasing Mandopop&apos;s crossover potential. On paper, a collaboration between a former telemarketer who describes himself as &quot;Christ&apos;s servant first, entertainer second&quot; and Ryan Tedder, lead singer of OneRepublic, may not sound a particularly appealing prospect. However, those able to extend the benefit of the doubt to California-born Van Ness Wu&apos;s Is This All will be rewarded with one of the most effective pop ballads of the year. Tedder, who produces hits for big-name US stars when not serving as America&apos;s least charismatic frontman, has spent a career attempting to combine the intimate and grandiose. With its rousing strings and Wu&apos;s impassioned delivery, the single pulls it off with more aplomb than anything he has been involved in since Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s Halo. Within the Sinosphere, Wu still has some way to go to match the popularity of compatriot Leehom Wang. Better known in the west for his role in Ang Lee&apos;s Lust Caution, the New York-born singer and actor is famous for a style he describes as &quot;chinked out&quot; \u2013 fusing elements of traditional Chinese and Taiwanese music with contemporary urban pop and reclaiming a racial slur along the way. Recent single Huo Li Quan Kai (Open Fire) contents itself with blending Michael Jackson and Ke$ha but lyrics about cultural imperialism and prejudice maintain the patriotic theme.            Wu and Wang may have closer family ties to the US but the Taiwanese star who has made the biggest impression overseas remains Jay Chou. His concerts at venues such as the MGM Grand in Las Vegas may appeal primarily to the Chinese and Taiwanese diaspora, but his recent turn as Kato in Hollywood blockbuster The Green Hornet and an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel have broadened his name recognition. With 30m legitimate albums sold in a section of Asia where the vast majority of CDs bought are unregistered pirate copies, there&apos;s little need for him to worry about running out of fans at home either. Eleventh album Exclamation Mark is at its best when playing with Timberlake-style dance pop, as on the nimble Shadow Puppetry. Taiwan may not be able to claim any girl groups on a par with Seoul&apos;s extraordinary 2NE1 or After School but, in Lollipop F, it has a contender for one of the wider region&apos;s most exciting boybands. Dance, the quartet&apos;s first single since returning from a stint on Korean television, borrows K-Pop&apos;s maximalist approach to bludgeoning effect. The video, which features lasers, luminescent robots and neon Hammer pants, would almost be enough to induce sensory overload even if it wasn&apos;t accompanied by such insidiously catchy, bass-heavy rave pop. With Hong Kong&apos;s enormous entertainment industry diversifying away from Cantonese, and the mainland&apos;s scene flickering into life, there&apos;s no telling how long Taiwan will retain pole position in the Mandopop world. For now, though, it&apos;s without equal in serving as a conduit for the flow of talent and ideas between Mandarin-speaking communities internationally and as a window on Chinese-language pop for the rest of the world."}, {"sentences": ["The promotion, which has meant a move to Tokyo, makes him the second Welshman to rise to the upper echelons of one of the world&apos;s biggest brands, after Sir Howard Stringer \u2013 now chief executive, president and chairman of the parent company, Sony Corporation.", "I joined Sony in Tokyo immediately after.&quot; Since then his career with the firm has taken him to the US and back to Britain, running SCE Europe, before his recent return to Japan.", "It looks to be a far more positive year, I hope, than 2011, and one that yields great benefits to gamers around the world.&quot; CV Age 46 Education BA in English language and literature, Oxford University Career 1990-95, corporate communications, Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo; 1995, transferred to Sony Computer Entertainment America; 1996, vice-president, marketing; 2000, senior vice-president, marketing and third party; 2003, executive vice-president, marketing, third party and development; 2005, chief marketing officer and group executive, Sony Corporation; 2009, president, chief executive and co-chief operating officer, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, based in the UK; September 2011, president and chief executive, Sony Computer Entertainment, based in Tokyo Family Married; one son and one daughter"], "tags": ["Sony", "PlayStation", "Technology sector", "Technology", "Business", "Games", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T20:43:00Z", "title": "Andrew House of Sony: 'It's been a pretty tough year, no question'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/05/sony-andrew-house-tough-year", "article": "For a one-company man like Andrew House, with 20 years&apos; service at Sony, 2011 must have been a year to look back on with mixed feelings. For Sony as a whole, it was an unmitigated annus horribilis: the electronics and entertainment conglomerate sustained painful blows from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the much-publicised hacking of the PlayStation Network, the riots in London, which saw its warehouse in Enfield burned down, and the flooding in Thailand. In March, it posted its second biggest ever loss, although the PlayStation side of the business, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE), posted a profit. But for House, it was a banner year: in September, he was made president and chief executive of SCE. The promotion, which has meant a move to Tokyo, makes him the second Welshman to rise to the upper echelons of one of the world&apos;s biggest brands, after Sir Howard Stringer \u2013 now chief executive, president and chairman of the parent company, Sony Corporation. Speaking the day before the Japanese launch of the PlayStation Vita, Sony&apos;s next-generation handheld console, which comes to Europe and America next month, a jacketed but tieless House proves impressively articulate, as you might expect from someone who spent five years working in Sony&apos;s corporate communications team. But he doesn&apos;t hide behind corporatespeak or duck tough questions and doesn&apos;t duck Sony&apos;s problems: &quot;Yes, it has been a pretty tough year, no question. If I draw a positive out of it, I think that has been unity in the face of adversity. We had episodes of great kindness during the earthquake, when one of our plants in Tohoku was affected: people were immediately engaged in rescue efforts. We&apos;ve had senior executives wading through the water in Thailand to check on the situation at our factories and make sure that employees are doing well. So I think it has had the effect of pulling the company together.&quot; And what of his own division? &quot;For the PlayStation business, there was the hacking incident. Not to sound like an excuse, but we&apos;re now in very solid company with many other institutions and companies suffering under the same sort of threat. But it galvanised us: we&apos;ve hired an extremely experienced chief information security officer \u2026 There were some very ugly threats going on, and we became the target.&quot; House, unsurprisingly, views the arrival of the PlayStation Vita (the UK launch is on 22 February) as a welcome moment of catharsis. &quot;It&apos;s important for the employee base \u2013 certainly here in Japan \u2013 that there is something of a morale boost with a great product launch.&quot; But although it is a hugely important product for Sony, the Vita has been criticised by some commentators, who claim that mobiles and tablets will supersede more conventional handheld consoles as gaming platforms. House is having none of it: &quot;We would point to two factors. One is content-based: what we&apos;re providing \u2013 even in the launch line-up \u2013 is what&apos;s in our DNA: deeper, more immersive, really compelling gaming experiences, with a great sense of realism and strong storylines. Then we&apos;ve married those with some great network features, but also with a set of interfaces that I don&apos;t think really exist right now in any other devices out there.&quot; House has ridden the computer-game wave to perfection. Now 46, he first worked in Japan as a teacher after graduating and doing a bit of temping in the City. &quot;As I had always wanted to work abroad, I applied for the Japan exchange and teaching programme run by the Japanese ministry of education. I taught in Japanese high schools for two years while studying Japanese, including teaching myself to read and write the language. I joined Sony in Tokyo immediately after.&quot; Since then his career with the firm has taken him to the US and back to Britain, running SCE Europe, before his recent return to Japan. &quot;The challenge for me has been getting back to a point where I&apos;m operating for 90% to 95% of the day in Japanese. I was about two weeks into the job, it was six o&apos;clock in the evening, and I was feeling kind of strange and somewhat tired. I thought: &apos;What&apos;s up with me?&apos; Then I realised I hadn&apos;t spoken a word of English all day, since I got up in the morning. The advantage of being able to access Japanese dictionaries online immediately is something that didn&apos;t exist when I was here last, and that&apos;s been very helpful. &quot;As far as the family is concerned, I&apos;m blessed, really, in making this transition. My wife is Japanese and my children are bilingual. Interestingly enough, in my son&apos;s case, he&apos;s just been like a duck to water. My children are both enjoying life. They are 16 and 12 \u2013 not necessarily the easiest age to move countries. And it was their second move, so they&apos;re essentially Californian kids \u2013 they&apos;re going to an American school here. They&apos;ve made friends \u2013 my son has a great social life, which I&apos;m envying, as most parents do.&quot; With a high-powered job, you imagine House doesn&apos;t manage quite such an active social live for himself. So what does he do to wind down? Wallow in domesticity, it seems. &quot;I run four to five times a week, usually in the early mornings, and my favourite activity is cooking Saturday dinnerwith the family \u2013 enjoying the meal with them and sometimes a family movie night to follow.&quot; He also reveals that he shares another passion, his support of Manchester United, with Stringer. House doesn&apos;t say whether they discuss the recent reorganisation of the company over live feeds from Old Trafford, but he offers insight into the shake-up that Stringer initiated earlier this year, part of which included buying out Ericsson&apos;s stake in the Sony Ericsson mobile phone business. &quot;He decided to take all the consumer businesses and house them under one single leadership \u2013 my boss, Kaz Hirai. That included the PlayStation division, and any of the other products that have a consumer touch-point. The opportunity, then, is to have a really strong, frequent engagement and interchange between the different business groups. The final goal is to have a much more Sony-esque, integrated user experience.&quot; House is proud that after years of losses, the PlayStation side of Sony has finally posted a profit, explaining that, five years into its lifecycle, the PlayStation 3 has reached its most profitable phase: &quot;It now has an installed base north of 55m units worldwide. And on a per-console basis, I&apos;m pleased to say, we&apos;ve seen people buying more games per console than we&apos;ve seen on previous generations, and that has a direct impact on profitability.&quot; Given Sony&apos;s trials in 2011, House is understandably looking forward to 2012: &quot;From the SCE perspective, I think a lot rests on the success of PS\u00a0Vita. We went through a very tough time in the company in getting to a point of profitability, and I think we&apos;re now beginning to enjoy the benefits of that \u2013 it gives us some more leeway in being able to look at the future and areas of new investment in terms of new business models and new approaches to gaming. It looks to be a far more positive year, I hope, than 2011, and one that yields great benefits to gamers around the world.&quot; CV Age 46 Education BA in English language and literature, Oxford University Career 1990-95, corporate communications, Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo; 1995, transferred to Sony Computer Entertainment America; 1996, vice-president, marketing; 2000, senior vice-president, marketing and third party; 2003, executive vice-president, marketing, third party and development; 2005, chief marketing officer and group executive, Sony Corporation; 2009, president, chief executive and co-chief operating officer, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, based in the UK; September 2011, president and chief executive, Sony Computer Entertainment, based in Tokyo Family Married; one son and one daughter"}, {"sentences": ["Ballistic missile defence co-operation with Tokyo is well advanced, although this has more to do with North Korea than China."], "tags": ["China", "Barack Obama", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US military", "US politics", "Asia Pacific", "Afghanistan", "Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa", "North Korea", "India", "Japan", "Eurozone crisis", "Africa", "William Hague", "Taiwan", "Vietnam", "George Bush", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "South Korea", "Singapore", "Malaysia", "Australia news", "Pakistan", "Sri Lanka", "Tanzania", "Syria", "Iran", "Sudan", "Myanmar"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-06T18:54:35Z", "title": "China syndrome dictates Barack Obama's Asia-Pacific strategy | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/06/china-barack-obama-defence-strategy", "article": "Barack Obama made a special trip to the Pentagon this week to unveil America&apos;s post-Iraq, post-Afghanistan defence strategy. But amid all the president&apos;s talk about a leaner American military, evolving challenges of the new century, and shifting priorities after a decade of warfare, one particular word was nowhere to be heard: China. The omission is understandable, but misleading. As a politician running for re-election as a peacemaker, Obama has no wish to conjure the spectre of a new cold war with the only serious challenger to America as number one global superpower. But as his recent Asian tour made clear, Obama \u2013 born in Hawaii \u2013 is determined to beat back any Chinese bid for hegemony in Asia-Pacific. The focus of the strategy is concentrated on this cockpit region. As chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey likewise has no interest in starting a fight with Beijing so soon after extricating US forces from Baghdad. But Dempsey knows China&apos;s defence spending is growing each year. As the strategy document urges, this growth &quot;must be accompanied by greater clarity [about] strategic intentions in order to avoid causing friction in the region&quot;. Dempsey sees how China&apos;s submarines and missile platforms, soon to be backed up by an aircraft carrier taskforce, are projecting naval power into regions where the US has dominated since 1945. In short, he can read the writing on the Chinese wall and understands that one day, however reluctantly, the US military may be obliged to overtly confront China just as it faced down the old Soviet Union. &quot;The strategy talks about a shift to the future,&quot; Dempsey said, standing alongside Obama at the Pentagon. &quot;And all of the trends, demographic trends, geopolitical trends, economic trends and military trends are shifting toward the Pacific. So our strategic challenges will largely emanate out of the Pacific region, but also the littorals of the Indian Ocean.&quot; Still no specific mention of China. But there was no doubting who and what Dempsey was talking about. And in case anybody missed the point, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, drove it home with due deference to both sides&apos; political sensibilities. &quot;This region is growing in importance to the future of the US economy and our national security. This means, for instance, improving capabilities that maintain our military&apos;s technological edge and freedom of action,&quot; he said. Beijing has yet to give a direct response. But the Global Times, an offshoot of the Communist party&apos;s People&apos;s Daily, swiftly made it clear China would be ready to match the US step for step, wherever that uncharted path might lead. &quot;Of course we want to prevent a new cold war with the United States, but at the same time, we must avoid giving up China&apos;s security presence in the neighbouring region,&quot; it said in an editorial. The Xinhua news agency warned that increased US engagement could boost stability but warned American militarism might &quot;endanger peace&quot;. The parameters of the coming 21st century US-China contest are already fairly clear. In purely physical terms, they include obvious potential flashpoints such as Taiwan, last resting place of the defeated nationalist Kuomintang. Beijing regards Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot;. Although bilateral relations have improved of late, itChina still menaces Taipei across the Taiwan strait with hundreds of land-based missiles. As de facto guarantor of Taiwan&apos;s security and chief arms supplier, the US is caught in a frozen conflict that could catch fire at any time. China&apos;s pursuit of territorial and resource claims in disputed archipelagos across the East and South China seas provide other flashpoints, not just with the US but with neighbours such as Vietnam, which have been tightening security ties with Washington. Fears about the implications of China&apos;s rise are producing a similar circling of the wagons in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, notwithstanding their close trading relationships with Beijing. During his Asian tour, Obama signalled the opening of a military base in Darwin and possibly one in the Philippines. Ballistic missile defence co-operation with Tokyo is well advanced, although this has more to do with North Korea than China. Amid overall global troop cuts, the US military presence in South Korea and Japan will be maintained. Safeguarding international sea lanes is a key priority. The US-China standoff has numerous other potential and actual aspects. In geo-strategic terms, Washington&apos;s desire to manage if not contain China&apos;s ambitions lies behind the rapprochement with India begun by the Bush administration. China&apos;s efforts to expand its presence in the Indian Ocean, through trade, aid and investment deals with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, to name three, are seen in Delhi as the south Asian equivalent of America&apos;s perceived &quot;encirclement&quot; of China. The US took on China at its own game in Burma, expanding diplomatic relations with an unpleasant regime to counter Beijing&apos;s position as a key ally. The desire to support democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is genuine. But calculated self-interest was at work, too. Perhaps somebody should tell William Hague. On a bigger scale again, a battle for raw materials, economic resources, political influence and military footholds is under way in sub-Saharan Africa, where China has placed commercial advantage ahead of governance and human rights concerns, and increasingly in Latin America. US behaviour is not exemplary, either. It talks a lot about democracy but its chief concern, especially in the Maghreb and Sahel regions, is security and terrorism, hence the recent creation of the Pentagon&apos;s Africa Command. China also presents a growing diplomatic and political challenge, whether it be through its protection of North Korea or its reluctance to support action against problematic regimes such as Syria, Iran and, arguably, Sudan. China&apos;s failure to act responsibly as a &quot;good citizen&quot; on the world stage, as American critics see it, is mirrored economically by its policy of maintaining an artificially under-valued currency to boost its exports, and its reluctance to help bail out stricken eurozone economies in the absence of specific rewards. The fact that it is by far the biggest holder of American government debt is a two-edged sword \u2013 but undoubtedly places Washington at a potential disadvantage. A 21st century US-China cold war is not an inevitability. It&apos;s possible the relationship can be managed to the benefit of both sides, given goodwill, good leadership and good luck. But fundamental ideological differences about democracy, openness, values, and religious belief, compounding political and economic rivalries, may ultimately confound efforts to work together. Historically, China is behaving just like any other up and coming great power, just like Britain in the 19th century and the US in the 20th: confident, brash and convinced of its own superiority. Obama&apos;s defence strategy hopes for the best \u2013 and prepares for the worst."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;You can catch the early cherry blossom in Tokyo, or try the epic skiing."], "tags": ["Cheap flights", "Flights", "Travel", "Budget travel", "City breaks"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-06T22:45:00Z", "title": "How to get cheap long-haul flights", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/06/cheap-long-haul-flights-experts", "article": "If you want a bargain flight, it&apos;s almost always better to book as far ahead as possible.

Adam Cooper from Netflights.com says that the cheapest times to travel to the US are January-March and November. The company has considerable savings on Delta fares for travel until 31 March 2012 (book by 2 February), such as New York from \u00a3349 from Heathrow (compared with \u00a3456 for 1 April-22 June). STA Travel&apos;s (statravel.co.uk) cheapest fare to New York is \u00a3345 return \u2013 book before 2 February, for travel 12 January-31 March. To find the cheapest fares to the US, kayak.co.uk is a brilliant resource that compares dozens of airlines. Latin America Laura Rendell-Dunn, of Journey Latin America (journeylatinamerica.co.uk), says: &quot;Book early. At the moment there are some terrific special offers, such as Lima for \u00a3546 return.&quot; You must book by 24 January but you can fly any time until June.

Santiago in Chile is usually the most expensive. Generally, airfares are highest from July to August and in December.

A return to Perth or Melbourne with Cathay Pacific for April-June costs from \u00a3699, as opposed to more than \u00a31,000 if booked later. If you&apos;re looking to travel towards the end of the year, aim for September to November, rather than the peak times of December or January, when the same flight will cost around \u00a31,500.&quot; For New Zealand, fares are lowest around May-June, but sometimes you can cut the cost by flying on a secondary, more indirect route. Air New Zealand (airnewzealand.co.uk) offers a ticket flying out via LA and back via Hong Kong. This trip in May would cost around \u00a3870 return, compared with \u00a3840 for a direct return.

It is understood that they are competing for the best academic job in the world: the vastly well-paid, commitment-free Unesco Chair of Literary Criticism. Each of the academics represents an approach to criticism, but each also represents a nation. The Englishman is an anti-theoretical humanist, who inevitably begins by quoting Dr Johnson. The Frenchman is a leathery structuralist, interested only in the universal binary principles of all texts. The German tries to trump the Frenchman with his even more universalist reception theory. The Italian proffers an Althusserian critique of the very notion of literature, which she reveals to be an instrument of bourgeois hegemony. And the American performs a loosely Freudian, fearlessly meretricious meditation on the similarities between literary criticism and striptease, from his party piece at another conference at the start of the book. To girdle his &quot;small world&quot; of academics from different countries, Lodge needs national stereotypes. Even his protagonist Persse McGarrigle, an innocent abroad, is something of a stereotype. A young lecturer at (the fictional) University College Limerick, he wanders into the world of vainglorious international academics, winning his way by charm and good fortune: what could he be but Irish? The seasoned American professor who befriends him, Morris Zapp, strides out of Lodge&apos;s earlier campus novel, Changing Places, and has acquired a life that animates the stereotype. Amazing his British peers by being louder, richer and more confident than they can ever be, even his shameless opportunism and lack of intellectual principle are disarming. Lodge earns his right to stereotype academics from other nations by caustically stereotyping the shabby British. We often feel that we should not be amused by a stereotype, as though it were inherently an insult. Yet satire, which deals in typicality, often relies on stereotypes. In the works of some satirical novelists these can indeed be insults: there are Frenchmen in the novels of Tobias Smollett or Fanny Burney that could only entertain a Francophobe. To be credible, and to amuse the undogmatic reader, a stereotype above all needs animation. The Italian Marxist Fulvia Morgana, who wears gorgeous clothes from Milan fashion houses and lives in a sumptuously tasteful villa, is certainly a two-dimensional character. Yet she is an entirely satisfying one. Hypocrisy knows no national borders, but there is an especially Italian gusto about her reconciling of Leninist principles with la dolce vita. It is caught perfectly when she is giving Morris a lift from Milan airport in her Maserati coup\u00e9 and raises her fist in solidarity to striking workers on the picket line, who smile broadly and return the gesture. The Italian way. The word &quot;stereotype&quot; is a metaphor from printing \u2013 a block of characters that could be reused \u2013 so the art of the stereotype becomes one of avoiding mere repetition. When he comes to his German academic, Professor Siegfried von Turpitz, Lodge does not so easily avoid repetition. Von Turpitz&apos;s appearance \u2013 the &quot;pale and expressionless&quot; face of a former Panzer commander beneath his &quot;skullcap of flat blond hair&quot; \u2013 reminds you rather readily of film cameos, while the black kid glove in which his right hand is always sheathed \u2013 no one dares ask why \u2013 is perhaps too reminiscent of the brilliant ex-Nazi scientist in Dr Strangelove. Yet this is an aberration. The rest of Lodge&apos;s national stereotypes have just enough quiddity to be believable. Akira Sakazaki, the Japanese academic living in his tiny Tokyo capsule, is attempting to translate an English novel of working-class life. He fires off missives to the novelist Ronald Frobisher enquiring about the meanings of demotic phrases. &quot;p. 107, 3 down, &apos;Bugger me, but I feel like some faggots tonight.&apos; Does Ernie mean that he feels a sudden desire for homosexual intercourse. If so, why does he mention this to his wife?&quot; With his earnestness and complete incomprehension of the novel&apos;s idioms, you might say that Sakazaki is a stereotype, but you laugh because here is one stereotype perplexedly confronting another. Frobisher, a superannuated Angry Young Man, made his name peddling northern &quot;reality&quot; to the educated reader. And stereotypes can include their own correctives to our expectations. When McGarrigle takes refuge from the rain in a bar in Tokyo and encounters the delights of karaoke, he also comes across a party of Japanese translators. In drunken chat, they introduce him to their Japanese versions of Shakespeare titles: The Merchant of Venice is &quot;The Strange Affair of the Flesh and the Bosom&quot;; Romeo and Juliet is &quot;Lust and Dream of the Transitory World&quot;. Those mistranslating Japanese are poets too. \u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London."}, {"sentences": ["Mars-Jones, in taking on the specialists, is open about his ignorance (&quot;I can hardly be accused of being an expert on Japanese film&quot;; &quot;I don&apos;t pretend to be an expert on Japanese family structure&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m not claiming any actual knowledge of the layout of Tokyo&quot;)."], "tags": ["Yasujiro Ozu", "Adam Mars-Jones", "World cinema", "Film", "Essays", "Books", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-08T00:05:09Z", "title": "Noriko Smiling by Adam Mars-Jones \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/08/noriko-smiling-mars-jones-review", "article": "Adam Mars-Jones&apos;s new book, which arrives less than a year after his novel Cedilla, is an attempt to save postwar Japanese cinema from its reputation as a museum of mystical objects, a body of work so &quot;hushed, serene and inexplicit&quot; that the only sensible, even possible, response is to keep your mouth shut and bow. His favourite among these films, Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s domestic drama Late Spring (1949), has been discussed almost solely in terms of Japaneseness. But this is not a contribution to the study of &quot;orientalism&quot;, a term that, as formulated by Edward Said (and critically parsed by Mars-Jones), &quot;reduces all the ways in which cultures can misunderstand each other to mechanisms of control&quot;. The villains of Noriko Smiling aren&apos;t those who patronise Ozu, or overlook him, but who admire him in the wrong way. &quot;Sometimes, works of art need to be defended against their advocates,&quot; writes Mars-Jones, for whom attack is the best mode of defence. Donald Richie, the leading western authority on Japanese cinema, and the screenwriter Paul Schrader, who wrote a book about &quot;transcendental style&quot; in cinema, are given a tough ride for their readings of Ozu: &quot;Schrader takes the Zen note struck by Richie and runs with it \u2013 in fact running doesn&apos;t do justice to his athleticism.&quot; Richie may have been responsible for western audiences&apos; exposure to Ozu, but this &quot;vindicated championing&quot; has allowed him a stranglehold on his reputation. Mars-Jones, in taking on the specialists, is open about his ignorance (&quot;I can hardly be accused of being an expert on Japanese film&quot;; &quot;I don&apos;t pretend to be an expert on Japanese family structure&quot;, &quot;I&apos;m not claiming any actual knowledge of the layout of Tokyo&quot;). Since the purpose of his book is to offer a fresh perspective, his outsider status can only be an advantage. His eyes are open and receptive, rather than blinded by familiarity: censorship of Japanese cinema during the American occupation, while &quot;not exactly a secret&quot;, is &quot;something that people keep on forgetting to mention&quot;; the popularity, during the silent era, of the narrator-explainer or benshi shows that Japanese audiences, rather than fetishising implication, had always &quot;wanted things spelled out&quot;. Taking on the widely held view that Ozu was indifferent to history, &quot;except as it impinges on family relations&quot;, he demonstrates that, in telling the story of a 27-year-old woman who is gradually persuaded into marriage, Ozu was alive to, and touched by, history of various kinds. Without seeking to replace Ozu&apos;s taste for &quot;inner unity&quot; with an equally static image of, say, Ozu the sociologist, he scrutinises the film for moments in which everyday reality makes its presence felt, or rather seen and heard. The film&apos;s opening scene is a case in point: the heroine Noriko (Setsuko Hara) is in traditional dress, &quot;naturally enough (culturally enough)&quot;, but she&apos;s also holding a handbag. For Mars-Jones, the film isn&apos;t in retreat from history so much as a reckoning with it, but such as acknowledgement carries its dangers too. Confronting a critic who sees Ozu as a traditionalist disgusted by western ways but prevented by censorship from saying so, he writes: &quot;After all we&apos;ve been through, I&apos;m not going to let Late Spring be turned into a sort of coded gazetteer of nostalgic militarism.&quot; Mars-Jones acknowledges that there&apos;s a certain amount of adjustment necessary if we&apos;re to have any understanding of Japanese cinema, that watching an Ozu film is not the same as watching a George Cukor film with subtitles and a foreign setting; but critics who treat Ozu&apos;s work as ungraspably alien (&quot;wholly enclosed by Japanese art, which is wholly enclosed by Zen aesthetics&quot;) are letting themselves off the hook. &quot;Common sense,&quot; being a relative concept, isn&apos;t much help, but dialectical reason might be. It is Mars-Jones&apos;s habit to confront, and resolve, sources of potential discord between Japanese cinema and Western viewers, presenting Ozu&apos;s disregard for continuity editing as neither imperceptible nor totally disruptive, but akin to a printing error: &quot;Audiences rapidly work out what was &apos;meant&apos;, and then forget that there was ever any doubt.&quot; Noriko Smiling, which comes without chapters or even subheads, is published by an imprint &quot;devoted to the best in essay writing&quot;. If an essay is, in Dr Johnson&apos;s phrase, a loose sally of the mind, then this is about as loose as they come \u2013 but what a mind! Mars-Jones writes as well about Ozu&apos;s style, his &quot;strategic management of effects&quot;, as he does about the legibility of human impulses, both those of real people (Ozu, Kurosawa) and invented characters (Noriko, her father, her friend Aya, her aunt Masha). And yet despite his ethical seriousness, Mars-Jones&apos;s tone is talkative, at times even flippant. The effect is not to undermine his insights but to ground them.

There would have been cards from businessmen, politicians, actors, celebrities, and possibly even envelopes stuffed with wads of yen. But alas, not this year. The Yamaguchi-gumi (39,000 members) did not hold the traditional rice cake-making ceremony with the neighbours in front of their headquarters in Kobe; the godfather, Shinobu Tsukasa, did not hand the neighbourhood children traditional otoshidama (new year&apos;s gifts) \u2013 envelopes with the Yamaguchi-gumi symbol on them with 30,000 yen inside. The much feared and respected Yamaguchi-gumi emblem is vanishing from the business cards of the gangsters as well. New laws are pushing Japan&apos;s very public organised crime groups underground. Whether that will result in a more orderly and peaceful Japan, no one really knows. Japan has taken an interesting approach to dealing with organised crime since the second world war. They have not banned the yakuza, who claim to be humanitarian organisations with ancient roots in Japanese culture; instead the government has recognised their right to exist and regulated them with increasingly stringent laws. Thus, you still have yakuza fan magazines, comic books about their lives, and office buildings. A year ago it was still not unusual for yakuza members to wear their organisation badges on their Italian-made suits and to carry business cards with the group logo and their job title printed on them. The 22 officially designated organised crime groups (numbering roughly 79,000) continue to operate as usual and being a member is not a crime. However, on 1 October in Tokyo and Okinawa the organised crime exclusionary ordinances went into effect, thus making every single local government have on the books new laws that criminalise paying off the yakuza or using them to conduct business. This may seem surprising but it was not a crime to do so in the past. As late as 2008, Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed companies like Suruga Corporation were able to hire yakuza thugs to evict tenants from buildings they wished to purchase and only the yakuza were arrested. Suruga Corporation executives who had authorised the payouts were untouched. The new ordinances make using the yakuza very expensive. The police will only warn companies involved with the yakuza to cease relations once. After that the police can release the name of the company, shaming them publicly. However, what is at stake for the business isn&apos;t just loss of face \u2013 it&apos;s tremendous financial loss as well. Standard contracts in Japan now include organised crime exclusionary clauses that allow banks and other institutions to unilaterally nullify any agreement if the signer turns out to be yakuza affiliated. Companies exposed by law enforcement will lose their bank accounts and financing; they will be evicted from their offices and delisted from the stock market. It&apos;s a lie that crime doesn&apos;t pay but when the cost of doing business with criminals is financial ruin, most businesses would rather not pay the criminals. That is what the government of Japan is banking on. The national police agency last week proposed new legislation that gives the police greater power to arrest and target members of designated &quot;dangerous organised crime groups&quot;. These new powers will be used to stifle yakuza retaliation towards businesses that decide to cut ties with them. This is unlikely to drive the yakuza out of business but it will damage their power base. After all, &quot;the war on the yakuza&quot; in Japan dates back to 1965, making it longer and perhaps less fruitful than the war on terror. However, there are concerns among the cops and the yakuza themselves that the new laws will simply turn the yakuza from thugs with a bare minimum code of honour and conduct into ruthless outlaws akin to terrorists in many ways. The yakuza have been allowed to exist in Japan for decades because each organisation has a code of ethics that keeps them from disrupting the public order or sense of public security. The codes, usually written on the wall on a scroll in Japanese cursive, prohibit armed or unarmed robbery, theft, rape, the use or selling of drugs, or any other act in disharmony with &quot;the chivalrous way&quot;. Violations usually result in immediate banishment. One high-ranking yakuza boss puts it this way: &quot;We have taken in the dregs of society, taught them discipline, and kept them in check \u2013 at least we don&apos;t engage in street crime. We are ninkyo dantai \u2013 humanitarian groups.&quot; Many police acknowledge that the yakuza do play a role in keeping street crime low and that after major disasters they contribute to the relief effort. However, when there is no longer any advantage to keeping up the pretence of being a &quot;humanitarian organisation&quot;, there is a risk that Japan&apos;s large organised crime groups will be replaced by disorganised crime \u2013 groups of criminals that care little about currying public favour or civilian casualties. Already, groups like Kanto Rengo, which are not &quot;designated organised crime groups&quot; nor traditional yakuza, have begun to seize power in Tokyo \u2013 engaging in mugging, drug dealing, purse-snatching and other crimes traditional yakuza would shun. There would be a terrible irony if the victory against the yakuza turns into a defeat in the war on crime. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["In 2010, Sea Shepherd member Pete Bethune boarded a whaling ship and was later given a suspended sentence at a court in Tokyo.", "The Institute of Cetacean Research, a quasi-governmental body in Tokyo that manages the annual hunts, said the activists were unhurt and being questioned."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Activism", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Whales", "Environment", "World news", "Japan", "Australia news", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T07:18:31Z", "title": "Sea Shepherd supporters held on Japanese whaling vessel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/09/sea-shepherd-supporters-held-whaling", "article": "Three Australian anti-whaling activists who illegally boarded a Japanese whaling vessel on Sunday could face trial and imprisonment in Japan, prompting attempts by the two countries to head off a diplomatic clash over the annual hunt. The men, supporters of the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group, boarded the Shonan Maru 2 security vessel under cover of darkness and demanded that the fleet abandon its hunt in the Antarctic. The three Australians carried with them a message that said: &quot;Return us to shore in Australia and then remove yourself from our waters.&quot; Australia&apos;s attorney general, Nicola Roxon, called for their immediate release. &quot;We are representing our views most strongly that they should be released promptly and returned to Australian soil,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;There are a number of different ways that could be done.&quot; The boarding took place about 16 miles off the west coast of Australia, reports said. The men are members of Forest Rescue, an Australia-based environmental group that has been travelling with Sea Shepherd as it attempts to locate and obstruct the whalers. They have been named as Geoffrey Tuxworth, 47, Simon Peterffy, 44, and Glen Pendlebury, 27. On Monday Japanese and Australian officials were embroiled in a dispute with activists over the exact location of the Shonan Maru 2 when the incident took place. Roxon said negotiations over the men&apos;s fate could be complicated as the incident occurred inside Australia&apos;s exclusive economic zone \u2013 not in its territorial waters \u2013 which meant Australian law was not in force. &quot;At this stage the boat hasn&apos;t sought to come into port,&quot; she said. &quot;We may, of course, in the coming days want to have discussions to do just that if it&apos;s one way to be able to get these three Australians safely back to Australia.&quot; Roxon said the Shonan Maru 2, which has been shadowing the activists, was &quot;not welcome&quot; in Australia&apos;s exclusive economic zone. &quot;This ship, people need to remember, is not directly involved in whaling activities, but it is clearly providing a support role and that may give us some other options if it was trying to come into our territorial waters.&quot; Sea Shepherd&apos;s founder, Paul Watson, said the vessel was in Australian waters when the incident happened and urged the government in Canberra to prevent the three men from being taken back to Japan to face trial. &quot;It really is disgraceful that the Australian government has not done anything to help,&quot; he told BBC Five Live from Australian vessel the Steve Irwin. &quot;We&apos;re of the opinion that the Australian government should rescue them but it seems more interested in appeasing the Japanese. Watson described the trio as &quot;prisoners&quot; and said GPS data on board the Shonan Maru 2 would prove the ship was in Australian waters when it was boarded. &quot;If this goes to court that evidence will have to be produced,&quot; he said. The whaling fleet, which left Japan last month, plans to catch more than 900 minke whales and about 50 fin whales during the current season. The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986 but Japan is permitted to catch a limited number of whales for what it calls scientific research. Last year Sea Shepherd claimed a significant victory after the fleet returned to port with one-fifth of its intended catch after a series of clashes with activists. In 2010, Sea Shepherd member Pete Bethune boarded a whaling ship and was later given a suspended sentence at a court in Tokyo. The Institute of Cetacean Research, a quasi-governmental body in Tokyo that manages the annual hunts, said the activists were unhurt and being questioned. Reports said the men had gone on hunger strike to protest against their detention. Glenn Inwood, a New Zealand-based spokesman for the institute, told Australian radio that they could remain on board the Japanese ship for as long as four months, depending on how long it continued to tail the Steve Irwin. &quot;Not only are they facing that, but they certainly risk being taken to Japan to be tried for trespassing or whatever other charges that Japan feels they may want to issue against them,&quot; he said. Donald Rothwell, an international law expert from the Australian National University, said the activists could face charges under Japanese law and may even have broken Australian law. &quot;Unauthorised boarding of a Japanese vessel is an act of trespass wherever that act may have taken place at sea,&quot; he told Reuters."}, {"sentences": ["Google&apos;s databases contain more indexed user-generated content about the Tokyo metropolitan region than the entire continent of Africa."], "tags": ["Global development", "Technology", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T10:25:00Z", "title": "In a networked world, why is the geography of knowledge still uneven?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/09/networked-world-geography-of-information-uneven", "article": "Digital information \u2013 photographs, blogs, videos, tweets, Wikipedia articles, reviews, descriptions, stories, and myriad other types of content \u2013 surrounds us. The amount of (mostly unpaid) human labour behind this content is astonishing. Wikipedia alone is the result of over 100m hours of work. These online layers of content matter not just because they are an increasingly important way in which we access and produce information, but also because they materially shape how we move through, understand, and enact our physical environments. Traditionally, information and knowledge about the world have been geographically constrained. The transmission of information required either the movement of people or the availability of some other medium of communication. Historical maps offer perhaps the best illustration of the geographic limitations to knowledge transmission. Take the 13th-century Carta Pisana, the world&apos;s oldest surviving navigational chart. Produced in Italy, the chart depicts relatively accurate information about the Mediterranean, less accurate information about the fringes of Europe, but no information at all about the world beyond Europe. Up until the late 20th century, almost all mediums of information \u2013 books, newspapers, academic journals, patents and the like \u2013 were characterised by similar huge geographic inequalities (pdf). The global north produced, consumed and controlled much of the world&apos;s codified knowledge, while the global south was largely left out. In the internet era, however, the movement of information is no longer constrained by distance. Very few parts of the world remain disconnected from the grid, and over 2 billion people are now online (most of them in the south). IBM, recognising this fact, has recently proclaimed the &quot;digital divide will cease to exist&quot; in the next five years. Unsurprisingly, many believe we now have the potential to access what Wikipedia&apos;s founder refers to as &quot;the sum of all human knowledge&quot;. Theoretically, parts of the world traditionally left out of flows and representations of knowledge can quite literally be put back on the map. However, potential has too often been confused with actual practice. Profound digital divisions of labour are evident in all open platforms that rely on user-generated content. On Flickr, countries in the north are covered by much thicker clouds of information. Google&apos;s databases contain more indexed user-generated content about the Tokyo metropolitan region than the entire continent of Africa. While on Wikipedia, there is more written about Germany than South America and Africa combined. In other words, there are massive inequalities that cannot simply be explained by uneven internet penetration rates. A range of other physical, social, political and economic barriers reinforce the digital divide, amplifying the informational power of the already powerful and visible. That&apos;s not to say the internet doesn&apos;t have important implications for the developing world. People use it not just to connect with friends and family, but to learn, share information, trade, and represent their communities. Consequently, it&apos;s important to be aware of the internet&apos;s highly uneven geographies of information. These inequalities matter to the south, because connectivity \u2013 though a clear prerequisite for access to most 21st-century platforms of knowledge sharing \u2013 is by no means a determinant of knowledge production and digital participation. How do we move towards encouraging participation from and about parts of the world left out of virtual representations? The first step is allowing people to see what is, and isn&apos;t, represented.\u00a0After that, there is also a clear need for plans like Kenya&apos;s strategy to boost local digital content, or Wikimedia&apos;s\u00a0Arabic Catalyst project, which aims to encourage the creation of content in Arabic and provide information about the Middle East. It remains to be seen how effective such strategies will be in changing the highly uneven digital division of labour. As we rely increasingly on user-generated platforms, there is a real possibility that we will see the widening of divides between digital cores and peripheries. It is crucial to keep asking where visibility, voice and power reside in an increasingly networked world."}, {"sentences": ["Just look what they did in Tokyo to that Brit who finally became the first such to head a major Japanese firm \u2013 only to be fired for exposing a big financial scam at its heart."], "tags": ["Conservatives", "David Cameron", "Margaret Thatcher", "Executive pay and bonuses", "London", "Hedge funds", "Ed Miliband", "Business", "Rick Santorum", "George Osborne", "Gordon Brown", "Tony Blair", "European Central Bank", "NHS", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T11:14:28Z", "title": "Executive pay: what would Margaret Thatcher have done?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/jan/09/executive-pay-margaret-thatcher", "article": "When David Cameron criticised salary excesses evident among leaders of &quot;crony capitalism&quot; at the weekend, I thought of a recent remark made by a clever Tory minister. &quot;What would Margaret have done?&quot; will be a question often asked in tough 2012, he predicted. It prompts me to wonder whether Mrs Thatcher, in her prime, would have handbagged the boss class for their evident greed rather more effectively than the coalition plans to do, at least on current evidence. Unlike Ed Miliband, I don&apos;t doubt Cameron&apos;s sincerity in wanting to clean things up, but I doubt his will or capacity. &quot; Don&apos;t be so daft,&quot; I hear you answer. &quot;Thatcher was a champion of free market capitalism, the woman to blame for much of the ugly distortions and inequalities in our society.&quot; Yes, that&apos;s true: she explicitly said she wanted the Britain of the 1970s \u2013 not a very attractive place, despite its social democratic credentials \u2013 to become a more unequal country, more like the risk-taking US. Indeed, I heard Rick Santorum, currently a high-flying Republican candidate for the White House, say on Radio 4 the other day: &quot;Ask Margaret Thatcher why she was never able to do to the UK what Ronald Reagan did for this country: &apos;the British NHS&apos;, is what she said.&quot; That&apos;s an irony-free sentiment, all right, especially because Mrs T (as I still think of her) was a smart enough politician to grasp that she couldn&apos;t handbag the NHS after all. Clever Maggie. But Thatcher was also a fierce moralist, raised by that Grantham shopkeeping father of hers to believe in hard work and responsibility. That credo would be difficult to square with the squalor we&apos;ve all been seeing lately. And it&apos;s not just those investment bankers, who privatised their profits via absurd bonuses but socialised their debts when they crashed the car, either. According to the Rowntree-funded High Pay Commission and other analysts, the total rewards package of directors of FTSE 100 companies rose last year by 49% \u2013 taking the average to \u00a32.7m \u2013 at a time when average pay (for those in work) rose by around 3%, and many people&apos;s salaries (including yours and mine?) remained frozen. Then there are the footballers and other sports stars, too \u2013 though the media soft-pedals on their greed, bankers being more (un)popular with the readers/viewers. Did you notice that Wayne Rooney was fined a week&apos;s pay for misconduct last week? That&apos;s \u00a3200,000 by the way. Yes, I realise he scored two goals on Sunday against Manchester City. About time, too. It&apos;s a truism that most of us don&apos;t mind people earning pots of money if they have really earned it. I doubt Scousers resent Paul McCartney his millions (well, not much). Neither do most people resent entrepreneurs who have invented great products or built great firms \u2013 the Bransons or Dysons. But \u00a3100,000 a goal seems quite a lot. And entrepreneurial or innovative greatness rarely applies to FTSE 100 bosses, who supposedly manage big firms on behalf of shareholders who are, so we are reminded again today, mostly hedge funds and other foreign owners far more remote even than the UK pension funds that look after our little pots (or don&apos;t). Not only is it usually hard to justify in terms of performance; it is also very opaque (even in great liberal newspapers), as well as difficult for shareholders, analysts, lesser staff and customers to work out exactly how much a CEO has actually got by way of pay \u2013 mere pay! \u2013 and how much via bonuses, share options and, of course, pension contributions (though these are not quite as outrageously tax-deductible as they were). There was a perfect example on Radio 4&apos;s Today this morning. Some poor sod representing the supermarket chain Morrisons was asked whether the boss deserved a \u00a35m package for what had been a pretty mediocre year&apos;s performance. &quot;We think transparency is very important, and that isn&apos;t the right number,&quot; he replied. So what was the right number? He never told us. Cameron has been busy since the new year polishing his credentials as a champion of fairness in hospitals and schools. It&apos;s all on the Tory website. And his attack on crony capitalism was reiterated on the Andrew Marr show. He wants shareholders to have the power to stage binding votes on executive pay but is cool on suggestions that pay ratios (top to bottom) within firms should be published and on Labour&apos;s plan for worker representatives to sit on boards (&quot;a gimmick&quot;, says Dave). Ministers are consulting, and there may even be a bill in the Queen&apos;s speech. But don&apos;t hold your breath: they are already taking on the City over the Vickers report on how to make too-big-to-fail banks safer, and are trying to squeeze the more egregious tax-avoiding rackets. That&apos;s quite a big agenda. And we shouldn&apos;t pretend we don&apos;t need the City: its jobs, its expertise, its tax revenues. Meanwhile, a succession of experts and flacks is popping up all over the media to explain that Cameron&apos;s notion that executive pay committees are full of back-scratching execs who nod through each other&apos;s bonuses is out of date. The BBC&apos;s own Robert Peston, a man who likes to ride fashionable waves (he was briefly a Gordon Brown enthusiast), is saying that only 50 FTSE 100 directors sit on other FTSE 100 boards and only 20 on remuneration committees \u2013 none reciprocally. In other words, it&apos;s all very difficult. Don&apos;t we realise that hedge funds take a global view, and that \u00a32.7m a year is small potatoes? Don&apos;t we understand that the market for mediocre chief execs is a global market? Just look what they did in Tokyo to that Brit who finally became the first such to head a major Japanese firm \u2013 only to be fired for exposing a big financial scam at its heart. He won&apos;t be doing that again in a hurry, and nor will any other CEO. That doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not worth trying, not worth bearing down hard on them. It&apos;s not that they are all rascals: one even occasionally hears one on TV or giving an interview to the FT who really has something interesting to say, though they tend to be the entrepreneurial types, the innovators, not the apparatchiks. It&apos;s just that most of them aren&apos;t worth all that money \u2013 certainly not when their corporate performance is judged. A chap called John Hourican, who runs RBS&apos;s investment bank division, is reported by the FT today to be in line for a \u00a34m bonus \u2013 actually, share options with that value, as of close of trading on Friday. This seems hard to explain, in the circumstances. RBS is being forced out of that side of the business \u2013 reluctantly, I think \u2013 and there is talk (also in the FT) of up to 10,000 more job losses. Since we taxpayers own 83% of RBS, this might be a chance for Cameron to show his mettle by signalling his displeasure. Back to Mrs Thatcher. My hunch is that if she had swept to power in 2010 (and not, like Dave, only crawled to it) she might not have turned her firepower against the postwar quasi-collectivist ethos she grew up in and reacted against in 1979. Thirty years younger, and therefore a child of someone else&apos;s Reagan-style lurch to the free-market right, she might have seen how badly it had gone wrong and decided that she would be the person to put it right. No: I&apos;m not convinced by the thought, either. But it&apos;s worth contemplating. The social democratic model was under a lot of pressure in the 70s. Some were external, such as the Opec oil price rises and the emergence of Asia as a manufacturer; some were internal, such as the undemocratic excesses of the trade union shop stewards&apos; movement, whose militancy undermined poorly run and under-capitalised companies. (Who would invest in a strike-prone, under-productive firm and pay up to 83% in tax rates, or higher for some &quot;unearned&quot; income, as investments were quaintly called?) Thatcher did something about it. After a 20-year boom \u2013 the &quot;great moderation&quot; \u2013 the consequences of barely trammelled market power have been visited upon us. Perhaps she would have spotted the problem coming, as the Bush, Greenspan, Brown and Blair crowd (plus the Bank of England, ECB etc) did not. And maybe she would have acted sooner to head it off, in the name of responsibility and morality. More than once, she showed the will and capacity to face down real threats from people who could do her harm \u2013 something Cameron and George Osborne have yet to do, despite December&apos;s Euro-drama, the outcome of which we await with interest. It&apos;s easy to bash town hall excesses; the big boys are a tougher nut to crack. Perhaps Thatcher would have decided that pay boards needed honest toilers, like her old dad, Alderman Alfred Roberts, on the team to stop those execs, with their smooth manicured hands, filling their boots. Perhaps not. But after the well intentioned brutality of Phyllida Lloyd&apos;s The Iron Lady, she needs a kind thought."}, {"sentences": ["That is a direct result of their failure to finish in the top eight at the world championships in Tokyo last year.", "Jones said the performance in Tokyo was a reality check for a group who had overachieved in the two years following the Beijing Games.", "So the expectation of everyone, including ourselves, was high for Tokyo.", "The disappointing thing was that it was the first time in this cycle we&apos;d produced a below-par performance.&quot; Jones said it was important that the team faced up to the reasons for their failure in Tokyo but had &quot;regrouped and refocused&quot; for this &quot;defining moment&quot;."], "tags": ["Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Gymnastics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T20:45:05Z", "title": "British gymnasts in shootout to repair pride and secure Olympic place", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/09/british-gymnasts-olympics", "article": "At the venue at which they hope to be competing in front of 20,000 spectators this summer, the British men&apos;s artistic gymnastics team will face a stark shootout for Olympic qualification on Tuesday night. Given the extent to which Beijing raised expectations and the hopes pinned on a London Games for a sport that is poised for lift\u2011off, it would be viewed as nothing short of catastrophic if they failed. The cavernous arena formerly known as the dismal Millennium Dome, successfully reinvented as the O2 and for the next 10 days adopting its Games-time name of the North Greenwich Arena, will play host to the latest in a series of Olympic test events designed to help organisers iron out teething problems. But this time there is more at stake for the British men&apos;s team than simply testing scoring systems and getting used to the home atmosphere. That is a direct result of their failure to finish in the top eight at the world championships in Tokyo last year. Their 10th place left them needing to finish in the top four on Tuesday in order to secure qualification for the Games. Ironically, for previous Games it would have been enough to qualify, but the criteria were changed in order to make London Prepares a second qualifying event. The men&apos;s artistic team include Daniel Keatings, the Olympic medallist Louis Smith, Daniel Purvis, Kristian Thomas, Ruslan Panteleymonov, Max Whitlock and the reserve Sam Hunter. Keatings has fond memories of the O2, having won all\u2011round silver there in 2009 when it hosted the world championships. &quot;There will be some nerves as it&apos;s qualification and every athlete gets nervy. It&apos;s how you deal with it,&quot; he told his local paper, the Cambridge News. &quot;The home crowd will be the key factor and they will be creating a big, positive atmosphere.&quot; Tim Jones, British Gymnastics Olympic performance director, also said he expected the venue and the home crowd to play a role: &quot;It&apos;s a fantastic venue. It&apos;s the most spectacular of the venues we&apos;ve been to in this four-year cycle because of its size and the whole feel of the place.&quot; They will be competing against Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Spain, France, Italy and Puerto Rico to secure that top-four finish. If they miss out, it is likely Britain will be able to send only one male gymnast to London 2012 \u2013 likely to be Purvis or Smith. Jones said the performance in Tokyo was a reality check for a group who had overachieved in the two years following the Beijing Games. &quot;It was not the result we had wanted or planned for. At the start of this cycle, we expected to be between eighth and 12th at this point. But we had some outstanding results early in the cycle. Our 2010 result at the world championships was terrific, the boys qualified fourth and finished seventh. So the expectation of everyone, including ourselves, was high for Tokyo. We were the first to admit that on a day when a par performance would have been good enough, we were below par. The disappointing thing was that it was the first time in this cycle we&apos;d produced a below-par performance.&quot; Jones said it was important that the team faced up to the reasons for their failure in Tokyo but had &quot;regrouped and refocused&quot; for this &quot;defining moment&quot;. &quot;We never doubted ourselves but we had to go away and focus on our shortcomings. We have moved on and we have been in camp since the start of December. We back ourselves to produce a performance to qualify a full team for the Games.&quot; Shortly before 10pm Tuesday, Britain&apos;s men will know whether their London dreams are still alive. Jones is confident they will not slip up a second time and hopeful that even bigger prizes may await in the same arena this summer. &quot;We&apos;ve got more gymnasts now capable of winning medals on an international stage. Going into Beijing, you hoped Beth [Tweddle] would do something. Louis was a bit of an outsider but he seized his opportunity. People&apos;s perception of British gymnastics is a long way from where it was five or six years ago,&quot; he said. Jones said the routines had been calibrated to deliver good scores but wouldn&apos;t be so ambitious that they risked shooting themselves in the foot. In the women&apos;s team competition, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Spain, France, Italy, South Korea and the Netherlands will fight for the remaining places. Britain have already qualified and will not be in action at the test event but two of the younger team members, Jocelyn Hunt and Rebecca Tunney, will compete as part of a mixed group to gain experience. &quot;Our women are fifth in the world. In a sport like gymnastics, when you&apos;re up against China, Russia and America that&apos;s almost as good as we can possibly be,&quot; Jones said. &quot;You&apos;ll always be able to take pot-shots at them from time to time but there is something of a glass ceiling. We&apos;ve got more people in the box seat now and able to produce when it matters. &quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Concern that the men - Geoffrey Tuxworth, Simon Peterffy and Glen Pendlebury - would be held on board the ship and taken back to Tokyo to face possible criminal charges faded after Japan agreed to release them without charge.", "&quot;If the Australian government would do their job and fulfil their election promises, these things wouldn&apos;t happen.&quot; Watson said on Monday the boarding had taken place while the Japanese vessel was in Australian territorial waters, a claim denied by authorities in Tokyo and Canberra.", "In 2010, a Tokyo court gave Sea Shepherd member Pete Bethune a suspended sentence after he boarded the Shonan Maru 2 to protest against a collision in which the group&apos;s hi-tech speedboat sank."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Australia news", "World news", "Conservation", "Environment", "Marine life", "Wildlife", "Activism", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-10T04:35:41Z", "title": "Japan to release Australian activists who boarded whaling ship", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/10/japan-release-australian-activists-whaling-ship", "article": "Japan and Australia have avoided a diplomatic row following the decision to release without charge three environmental activists who clambered aboard a Japanese whaling ship off the west coast of Australia at the weekend. The three Australian citizens boarded the Shonan Maru 2, which is providing security to Japan&apos;s whaling fleet, to demand an end to this year&apos;s hunt in the Antarctic. Concern that the men - Geoffrey Tuxworth, Simon Peterffy and Glen Pendlebury - would be held on board the ship and taken back to Tokyo to face possible criminal charges faded after Japan agreed to release them without charge. Australia&apos;s prime minister, Julia Gillard, thanked the Japanese government for its co-operation, but warned activists against attempting another boarding as they attempt to disrupt the hunt. Gillard said in a statement that the men&apos;s actions had been &quot;unacceptable and will ultimately be costly to the Australian taxpayer&quot;. She added: &quot;No one should assume that because an agreement has been reached with the Japanese government in this instance that individuals will not be charged and convicted in the future. Kyodo quoted unnamed sources as saying Japan had decided not to charge the activists because no crew members had been harmed during the boarding. Gillard said Australia would continue its legal campaign to end the hunts. Last year, Australia filed a complaint against Japan at the world court in the Hague. A decision is expected in 2013 at the earliest. The detained men, who belong to a group called Forest Rescue, will have to remain on board the Shonan Maru 2 for several days while an Australian customs vessel sails out to collect them. Japan is permitted to catch a limited number of whales every year under a clause in the 1986 ban on commercial whaling. Last year the fleet returned to port with just one-fifth of its quota after a series of confrontations with Sea Shepherd. The group&apos;s founder, Paul Watson, welcomed Japan&apos;s decision but repeated calls for the Australian government to honour an election pledge to end the whale hunt. &quot;We are down there to protect the whales, we are not down there to make everybody happy,&quot; he said in a radio interview from the Steve Irwin, a Sea Shepherd boat being shadowed by the Shonan Maru 2 as it attempts to locate the whaling fleet&apos;s mother ship. &quot;If the Australian government would do their job and fulfil their election promises, these things wouldn&apos;t happen.&quot; Watson said on Monday the boarding had taken place while the Japanese vessel was in Australian territorial waters, a claim denied by authorities in Tokyo and Canberra. In 2010, a Tokyo court gave Sea Shepherd member Pete Bethune a suspended sentence after he boarded the Shonan Maru 2 to protest against a collision in which the group&apos;s hi-tech speedboat sank."}, {"sentences": ["Now, there are at least 39 cat caf\u00e9s in Tokyo alone, and variations which specialise in housing black cats, rare cats and even fat cats."], "tags": ["Pets", "Pubs", "Beer", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-10T10:30:00Z", "title": "Cat caf\u00e9s and doggy dining rooms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jan/10/cat-cafes-doggy-dining-rooms", "article": "Non-alcoholic beer, previously the preserve of the kids&apos; table at family gatherings and desperate new year&apos;s resolutionaries, has finally found a market \u2013 though perhaps not quite where the manufacturers expected it. The Brandling Villa, in South Gosforth, Newcastle has started serving up an imported non-alcoholic beer with hops, malt and meat extract to give its pet-owning punters no excuse for staying away - particularly as the pub already serves up a range of dog-friendly dishes like &quot;chicken a la franc&quot; and &quot;Eggs Ladybird&quot;. The &quot;beer&quot; is obviously hitting the spot for its four-legged demographic, as the first 48 bottle run sold out in less than a fortnight despite the pub&apos;s owner admitting that his own dog doesn&apos;t like the &quot;pretty revolting&quot; brew.It&apos;s not the first dog beer to hit the market. Bowser Beer from Phoenix, USA, and selling at $19.99 for a pack of 6, proudly declares itself to be carbonation-, alcohol- and hop-free and made with USDA chicken or beef and is seemingly equally popular - all stocks are sold out and won&apos;t be available again until mid-January. On this side of the pond, one Yorkshire pub has got in on the act. The King&apos;s Head in Gunnerside stocks Dutch pet care giant Beaphar&apos;s dog beer for service alongside &quot;home roasted pig cheeks&quot; at 40p a pop - a bargain in a culinary climate where offal has an increasing cachet. But are pets really welcome in eating and drinking establishments from the bipedal customer&apos;s point of view? A quick straw poll showed a distinct split between those who believe that a &quot;well-behaved dog in a pub is one of the glories of England&quot; and the virulently opposed, who think they &quot;stink, make a racket and jump up at people&quot;. There&apos;s also a difference in opinion about a pets&apos; place in a restaurant as opposed to a pub. Craig Butcher, editor of MSN Food, believes that dogs in &quot;pubs [are] fine, but restaurants - no&quot; and I&apos;m inclined to agree. Pets, like children, are a disruptive influence. In the more relaxed atmosphere of a pub meal, that element of barely-contained chaos that pets and children share is not necessarily an issue. But in the more formal setting of a restaurant - where the meal is, to a greater extent than in even the best gastropub, an event that goes beyond the quality of the food - they impact upon and detract from the experience. Obviously, there are those who feel very differently - the cat caf\u00e9s of Japan are proof positive of that. In these caf\u00e9s, in return for an hourly cover fee punters share the space with a clowder of resident cats - though even these establishments have rules regarding small children for fear that they&apos;ll disturb the main attraction. Cat caf\u00e9s have proven wildly popular. The first opened in Taiwan in 1998 before spreading to Japan in 2004. Now, there are at least 39 cat caf\u00e9s in Tokyo alone, and variations which specialise in housing black cats, rare cats and even fat cats. The success of Japan&apos;s cat caf\u00e9s can be put down to the tight apartment spaces in which pets are often forbidden, but the motivations for bringing a pet to a restaurant are a little less clear. Obviously some pets can&apos;t be left alone (though this is surely a relatively easily circumvented issue) and as a former pet owner I do understand the emotional bond to one&apos;s furry companion, but can they be anything but a hindrance when trying to socialize with one&apos;s same-species friends? Would you like to be able to take your pet with you when you eat out? Or does the idea of having a dog in the dining room set you on edge? And does it matter whether it&apos;s a caf\u00e9, a gastropub or a full-blown restaurant?"}, {"sentences": ["Island airports have been built, and the Japanese bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka, which opened in 1964 \u2013 I have ridden on it (they put orchids in the loos) \u2013 has been copied in many places (though not yet in the US, whose overcrowded east-coast corridor, from Boston to Washington via New York, cries out for such a solution; they are still thinking about it)."], "tags": ["HS2", "Rail transport", "UK news", "Politics", "Transport policy", "Transport"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-10T12:38:53Z", "title": "High-speed rail: beware of politicians in love with big projects | Michael White", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/jan/10/high-speed-rail-politicians-projects", "article": "Call it defeatism, if you like, but we bus pass-holders aren&apos;t eager to book a ticket for the opening of the HS2 high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham, which the transport secretary, Justine Greening, announced today. Because the train won&apos;t be leaving Euston station until 2026, if it&apos;s lucky, by which time ... There again, our OAP taxes will be helping to pay for it, and you can&apos;t escape big transport infrastructure projects, which have a habit of infecting lives in ways both good and bad.  I had a pub lunch in the &quot;No to HS2&quot; Chilterns the other weekend and you could see why the local are upset: all that noise and disruption \u2013 and they don&apos;t stand to benefit. On the other hand, I live under what would have been the flightpath into Heathrow&apos;s third runway if the coalition hadn&apos;t killed Labour&apos;s commitment. I was resigned to suffering for the greater public good \u2013 at present we see the big jets to the south but barely hear them \u2013 while aware that the case for shrinking Heathrow in favour of better-sited airports (Boris Island, anyone?) is also a strong one. Come to think of it, for a brief period the east-west route for the biggest transport project since the Channel Tunnel, Crossrail, was scheduled to emerge from its tunnel at my local tube station, barely 500 yards away. You can&apos;t get away from these things. Our west London streets are going to be clogged for months while they fix the Hammersmith flyover to prevent it collapsing any time soon. You probably have similar stories and similar mixed feelings. The value of effective transport networks is so enormous to those who travel \u2013 which means most of us, one way or another \u2013 and the downside of bad ones is so costly and frustrating that it&apos;s important governments make the right decision on where to invest our money. If you want to explore how complicated it all is, the Commons transport select committee report, High Speed 2 (HS2): the debate, is a very good introduction. It was produced last November, with ministers edging towards today&apos;s decision all too aware that Tory MPs along the route \u2013 including the Welsh secretary, Cheryl Gillan \u2013 may be tempted to vote against the enabling bill or, in Gillan&apos;s case, resign from the cabinet. It would not be an earth-shattering event if she did. Junior minister Maria Miller, MP for Basingstoke and brought up in Bridgend (born in Wolverhampton), is tipped by some to succeed her, though tipping a minister for promotion is often the kiss of death. Putting aside the environmental factors (surely trains are always greener than the alternatives? Apparently not), I&apos;m not sure about HS2 as an instrument of economic regeneration in less-favoured regions, with the capacity to generate up to 1m new jobs in return for a \u00a332bn investment. There&apos;s always a lot of supposition and wishful thinking in such projections, often made by people with a vested interest in the scheme \u2013 keen to make money from it or to be remembered for thinking big. Beware of politicians attracted to big projects, but also of politicians too lacking in confidence to take big decisions. Was the new Blair government right to press ahead with the Major government&apos;s plans for the Millennium Dome, which had been started too late to carry out properly? Or should it have killed off what is now the successful O2 Arena in a regenerated corner of south London? It&apos;s a tough one. Thinking BIG is what attracts all sorts of people to urging the government to build one version or another of the Thames estuary airport \u2013 a 1940s scheme that nearly got off the ground (so to speak) when Ted Heath was PM, in the early 70s, and the airport was brilliantly named Foulness, after the mudflat on which it would have been built (but wasn&apos;t). Fog, bird strikes and cost all helped drag it down. Technology has improved since then, on land, sea and air as well as beneath the ground. Island airports have been built, and the Japanese bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka, which opened in 1964 \u2013 I have ridden on it (they put orchids in the loos) \u2013 has been copied in many places (though not yet in the US, whose overcrowded east-coast corridor, from Boston to Washington via New York, cries out for such a solution; they are still thinking about it). But after all the expert advice for and against \u2013 it&apos;s all in that select committee report \u2013 has been sifted, someone has to take a big decision: yes or no. Britain has been fluffing the high-speed option since it abandoned the wonky advanced passenger train (APT) project in the early 80s, just as it flunked Foulness airport. Yet we did upgrade some of our long-haul rail routes, and passenger usage is now at its highest level since 1945. And we did build a big network of motorways, especially across northern England (Glasgow to Edinburgh too) to help revive struggling regional economies (which they did). We did build the M25 orbital ring road around London \u2013 admittedly by stealth, so the anti-car lobby wouldn&apos;t make too much fuss \u2013 and it does work. We did build the Channel tunnel, with the French (who need it less), and it&apos;s hard to imagine life without it: yesterday Eurotunnel helped put SeaFrance, the French ferry firm, out of business. We are also building Crossrail, which Alistair Darling rescued from the axe when he was chancellor, having put it in the programme when he was transport secretary. Without it, the experts say, London will soon be close to gridlock, even without the Olympics in July. Come to think of it, that&apos;s a pretty big engineering project, too, one that looks set to be delivered on time and leave a useful legacy in a long-blighted area. So we shouldn&apos;t be defeatist, whether bus pass-holders or not. What we should all do is listen carefully to the arguments \u2013 especially the cost-benefit arguments \u2013 in the long months ahead, when this issue becomes a pressing one. The legislation, which is complex because it&apos;s &quot;hybrid&quot; (ie affects specific private interests as well as general public policy), isn&apos;t due until 2013, so Cheryl Gillan and her constituents will have plenty of time to think it over. Is speed everything in our times? We&apos;re often told so, and cars are sold on their top speed to the Jeremy Clarkson lobby. Yet even Clarkson has noticed that ever-greater speed restrictions are the norm in most countries (we&apos;ll believe the coalition&apos;s plan to raise speeds when it actually happens); and Concorde turned out to be glamorous but an economic failure. An idea ahead of its time and technology? Well, maybe. That&apos;s always part of the gamble. Critics say the money would be better spent on less glamorous relief of congestion for local rail commuters. The Sunday Telegraph reported this week that the Dutch high-speech line is a costly flop, to be avoided, and that HS trains merely suck more activity into the richer areas (ie the south-east). But the Telegraph is a Chilterns sort of newspaper, with a reader axe to grind at David Cameron&apos;s expense. There are a lot of axes grinding on HS2. This one will run and run.

Grinding monotony grips its social housing, small detached houses and pachinko halls with their glaring neon lights and wall-to-wall sounds. But by rights it should be celebrating the election last November of one its offspring, Toru Hashimoto, 42, as head of the city council. He has launched an attack on political parties, civil servants \u2013 &quot;the termites of public finance&quot; \u2013 and central government. He promises tax cuts (but value-added tax is due to go up) and wants to turn his Osaka Restoration Association into a political party. Hashimoto&apos;s gift of the gab has won wide support. He seems in tune with the discontent of Japan&apos;s third city towards mainstream politicians of whatever stripe. Osaka is a long way from the disastrous tsunami and nuclear accident of last March. The mood of the city, some 600km south of Fukushima, is very different, but it is bogged down in the recession and resentful of the concentration of business in Tokyo. When the Democrats won the general election in 2009, it ended half a century of almost uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democrats, raising people&apos;s hopes for change. But disillusion soon set in, opening a breach for such as Hashimoto. His victory is not so much a matter of content, more a symptom of the failure by national politicians to take account of voters&apos; expectations, according to political commentator Jiro Yamaguchi. In the evening the crowds in the brightly lit Namba and Umeda neighbourhoods of central Osaka hardly give the impression of a city in crisis. But everyone is : restaurateurs, cab drivers, shopkeepers and such. grumbling. &quot;Hashimoto or whoever else, we need someone to put this city back on its feet and get rid of all these civil servants who waste our money,&quot; says the landlord of a bar. &quot;The previous mayor lost his seat, but he&apos;s sitting pretty. He pocketed a golden handshake worth 40m yen [$520,000].&quot; Osaka used to be a major trading centre, its focus firmly on prosperity and pleasure. By the beginning of the 20th century it had become the Manchester of the Orient, a pragmatic, materialist place,celebrated for its nonconformist stance. To prove the point it elected a comedian to lead the council at the end of the 1990s, but two years later allegations of sexual harassment forced him to resign. This time, Osaka is not looking for comic relief. Poverty is on the rise, with one resident in 18 receiving welfare, the highest number of homeless in the country, and official unemployment figures (6.9%) higher than the national average. Bankruptcy is rising too. In the past the campaign in the gutter press mountedby Hashimoto&apos;s opponents might have checked his success. A lawyer, he resigned halfway through his term of officeas governor of Osaka prefecture to run for mayor. His father was a small-time gangster who committed suicide, but his family&apos;s shady background did not discourage voters. The main parties lost the city council and a one of Hashimoto&apos;s team won the governorship too. He now plans to merge the two jurisdictions to give Osaka a statute similar to the capital, a flattering initiative for a city which fancies itself as the opposite to Tokyo, a cold and haughty city of bureaucrats. It could make sense to merge the city (population 2.6 million) and its hinterland (20 million), but Hashimoto above all enjoys the support of a growing share of the community, particularly youthwhich can find no political outlet for its expectations. Social mobility, once the driving force in Japan&apos;s economic success, has ground to a halt and there is a rising sense of insecurity. The stagnation is not just economic, but also social. The populism Hashimoto preys on the widening poverty gap and a sense of abandonment, but here it has a more sinister side. &quot;Strong, almost dictatorial power is needed to change politics,&quot; he warned during the campaign. Commentators have labelled such extreme electioneering as Hashism, a pun on his name and on fascism. Democracy in Japan has certainly suffered from the recession, and the present government&apos;s incompetence and dithering before and after Fukushima, but it remains to be seen whether other Japanese cities may take the same course.

When it is opened, a video clip starts to play. The image is of computer screen containing the homework that the student had submitted earlier as a text document. A cursor appears, highlighting a section of text, followed by the teacher&apos;s voice explaining a language error. The teacher&apos;s disembodied voice and ghost-like manipulation of the text continue through the document, highlighting, explaining and suggesting strategies for correction, until the clip ends. Moving images of computer text with a personal commentary are unlikely to become the next YouTube sensation, but the use of screen-capture software, which allows this kind of voice-annotated manipulation, could become a major asset for English language teachers and students. Screen-capture software allows you to record the screen of your computer as if you had a camera pointed at it and also record your voice. An attachable or built-in microphone is the only hardware requirement. Teachers can &quot;capture&quot; the contents of their screen as they correct and comment on students&apos; work. All the notes, highlights and spoken comments recorded and the resulting video can be forwarded to the students. I first started experimenting with video feedback using screen capture six years ago. My students liked the fact the feedback included visuals and sound. They also felt they were getting more input from their teacher. They said that it was clearer as they could see the cursor and exactly what the teacher was correcting. Many students said they clips were &quot;authentic listening materials&quot; and they watched the videos several times. We are also beginning to discover that the application of this technology can change the nature of feedback. It is common to see comments such as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;well done&quot; on written scripts but when teachers use video feedback they tend to elaborate and develop points rather than leaving them as empty comments. Students feel it is more &quot;human&quot; too as they can hear the teacher&apos;s voice. However, in its early days video feedback had a flaw: the videos had to be compressed before they could be sent to the students, requiring technical knowledge on the part of the teacher. Cloud computing changed this. Screen-capture websites now provide free server space where the videos can be uploaded at the click of a button and the resulting &quot;link&quot; shared with students. Video feedback is now a practical tool for teachers. The Open University (OU), the UK&apos;s distance learning higher education institution, is experimenting with feedback on some courses. Felicity Harper and Hannelore Green from the OU&apos;s faculty of education have introduced the feedback idea to language tutors who are trailing it with their students and the response has been very positive. &quot;It has worked well with students who have dyslexia too, who sometimes feel overwhelmed with textual feedback,&quot; said Green. My own experiments at the University of Warwick show that video feedback goes beyond simple language correction. In fact, it works best when you want to elaborate and expand on your feedback and not simply correct grammar or spelling, for example when you want to offer comments on an essay&apos;s structure, content or ideas. In the language classroom, it is also useful for work on vocabulary. A teacher can take notes on pronunciation mistakes that are made in the lesson, and after class write the list into a text document, turn on the screen capture and read through the words and highlight where the stress falls. The resulting video can then be sent to the whole class. Teachers could send a weekly video of pronunciation mistakes or vocabulary they want students to learn. We know from research that students value face-to-face feedback, but with large classes this is not always possible. So could screen capture offer an alternative? Students seem to think so. &quot;It&apos;s as if my tutor is sitting next to me,&quot; is a common comment the OU are hearing. Students find it engaging and many point out they play the feedback several times. At the heart of this idea is a simple technology that can provide busy teachers with an effective way of providing better-quality feedback in a motivating way. With the current obsession with final marks and grades, any system that gets students to engage with the feedback and act upon it has got to be worth investigating. Russell Stannard is a principal lecturer at the University of Warwick and a recent winner of the British Council&apos;s ELTons award. Free video capture programs include TechSmith&apos;s Jing and Camstudio Creative use of crowd-sourcing English language learners in Japan are getting the benefit of feedback on their written work from over 6,000 internet users. A class project, co-lead by James York with 18 to 20-year-olds at Tsukuba and Tokyo Denki universities, uses the internet news site reddit.com as a platform to publish the students&apos; digital comic strips. Students were first introduced to ragefaces.com, a growing repository of weird and witty cartoon faces, sparking group discussions about the emotions they represent. York says his digital native students had no difficulty creating and uploading short comic strips mixing images, text and jokes, all in English. As he explains in his blog, he needed to resolve some technical issues to allow group access to sites designed for individual use. The real value of the project came when the comic strips were published on a specially created reddit.com/r/EFLcomics page, eliciting comments and feedback from native-speaker readers. &quot;Students get a rare chance to express themselves creatively in English and it is a great for intercultural communication,&quot; said York. &quot;For teachers the project can be seen as crowd-sourcing native English-speakers to voluntarily correct students&apos; mistakes, praise them and communicate with them.&quot; Max de Lotbini\u00e8re "}, {"sentences": ["The British team were forced to go through the all-or-nothing process owing to a disappointing performance at the world championships in Tokyo in November last year that left them 10th and outside the top eight automatic qualification places.", "A nerveless start on the high bar, the apparatus on which the British team made\u00a0a series of disastrous mistakes in Tokyo from which they failed to recover, set the tone for a confident display without any falls.", "If we do, who knows what will happen.&quot; Keatings, who fell from the bar in Tokyo, made a confident start and dismounted to loud cheers, while Thomas also impressed with a score of 15.133 at the 20,000 capacity arena that will host artistic gymnastics and the basketball finals during the Games.", "Keatings paid tribute to the crowd: &quot;They were amazing, they created an amazing atmosphere and gave us an extra boost going on to each piece.&quot; Eddie Van Hoof, the British Gymnastics technical director, said: &quot;It was a difficult start on the high bar, which was our disaster piece in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Gymnastics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-10T23:46:24Z", "title": "Male gymnasts' victory means full quota for team at London 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/10/gymnasts-victory-full-quota-london-2012", "article": "Britain&apos;s male gymnasts qualified\u00a0in style for the London 2012 Olympics in the arena in which they will compete this summer, confirming a full quota of places at the Games. The British team were forced to go through the all-or-nothing process owing to a disappointing performance at the world championships in Tokyo in November last year that left them 10th and outside the top eight automatic qualification places. Needing to finish in the top four, the British team laid to rest those demons and delivered with few mistakes to top the leaderboard by more than seven points from France, Spain and Italy. In doing so, they secured a full complement of men&apos;s places for the first time in 20 years and raised hopes of a possible medal opportunity in the team event. Qualification, ultimately secured with ease, was seen as vital to continuing the progress made by British Gymnastics over the past five years. Liverpudlian Daniel Purvis, the all-rounder who came fourth at the world championships, led the way including a 16.266 routine \u2013 the highest score of the night \u2013 on the vault and a score of 15.4 on the floor. He also finished top of the individual rankings and said that the failure in Japan &quot;may have been a blessing in disguise&quot; given that the confidence boost that Tuesday night&apos;s performance would bring. His team-mates Kristian Thomas and Daniel Keatings came second and third in the individual rankings. A nerveless start on the high bar, the apparatus on which the British team made\u00a0a series of disastrous mistakes in Tokyo from which they failed to recover, set the tone for a confident display without any falls. Their score of 358.227 would have put them third at the world championships, but Keatings refused to be drawn on their medal chances: &quot;I don&apos;t want to jinx anything but it was a great performance today and hopefully we&apos;ll put in a performance like that [at the Games]. If we do, who knows what will happen.&quot; Keatings, who fell from the bar in Tokyo, made a confident start and dismounted to loud cheers, while Thomas also impressed with a score of 15.133 at the 20,000 capacity arena that will host artistic gymnastics and the basketball finals during the Games. &quot;It was amazing. It was a big relief, this was such an important competition. We&apos;ve worked hard over the festive period, we didn&apos;t have a day off and it&apos;s really paid off today,&quot; said Keatings. &quot;We really had to come together as a team, they&apos;re like family now.&quot; The men&apos;s artistic team was comprised of Keatings, Louis Smith, Purvis, Thomas, Ruslan Panteleymonov, Max Whitlock and the reserve Sam Hunter. On each set of apparatus, five of the six members of the team competed and the top four of those five scores are added together. Smith, the former X-Factor hopeful who won a surprise bronze on the pommel in Beijing and competed only on that apparatus for the team, played to the crowd and scored 15.133. He wobbled slightly but steadied himself and finished with a flourish, the relative difficulty of the routine ensuring a high score. Keatings and Whitlock also scored over 15. Smith and Keatings had spoken before the event of the likely pressure but that will be nothing compared to that they will face at the same venue this summer. &quot;The boys were all switched on, they all did the job and what we have to do now is not get complacent. You have to be switched on 100% of the time, you have to do the right training and you have to respect the competition,&quot; said Smith, the team captain. Keatings paid tribute to the crowd: &quot;They were amazing, they created an amazing atmosphere and gave us an extra boost going on to each piece.&quot; Eddie Van Hoof, the British Gymnastics technical director, said: &quot;It was a difficult start on the high bar, which was our disaster piece in Tokyo. We rehearsed it every day, the team handled it very well and from then on everything was going to build.&quot; The difficulty level on each piece of apparatus had been toned down to ensure that unnecessary risks were not taken. If Britain had failed to qualify, they would have been able to select just one male gymnast for the Games; now they will take a full team of five. The British women have already qualified and will not be in action at the test event but two of the younger team members, Jocelyn Hunt and Rebecca Tunney, will compete as part of a mixed group to gain experience. Next Wednesday, the women&apos;s rhythmic gymnastics group will attempt to attain a baseline score required by the British Olympic Association in order to take up a host nation place.

The O2, here renamed the North Greenwich Arena to comply with the International Olympic Committee&apos;s &quot;clean venues&quot; policy, handles large crowds every night of the week and had already hosted the 2009 Gymnastics World Championships so the focus of this test event was on London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games&apos;s scoring and technology. &quot;It is our biggest one to date,&quot; said Paul Deighton, Locog&apos;s chief executive, ahead of the event. &quot;The focus for this event is on the field of play. Making sure that our timing and results technology works is really important and, of course, to test our workforce.&quot; In common with Locog&apos;s attempts to jazz up the presentation of other sports, which saw loud chart hits between games at the table tennis test event and the introduction of bright blue hockey pitches, the platforms surrounding the apparatus were shocking pink rather than the usual navy blue."}, {"sentences": ["The British men were forced to qualify at the event having finished 10th at the world championships in Tokyo, therefore missing out on one of the eight qualification spots available."], "tags": ["Gymnastics", "Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-11T18:33:33Z", "title": "British gymnasts in race against time to be in final frame for 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/11/british-gymnasts-2012-olympics", "article": "The British gymnasts who on Tuesday night helped qualify a full team for the Olympics for the first time in 20 years will be given until June to stake a claim for one of the five places on offer at the London Games.

The British men were forced to qualify at the event having finished 10th at the world championships in Tokyo, therefore missing out on one of the eight qualification spots available. The team comprised Keatings, Louis Smith, Dan Purvis, Kristian Thomas, Ruslan Panteleymonov, Max Whitlock and the reserve Sam Hunter. In the Olympics, four out of the five team members will have to compete on each piece of apparatus with the top three scores counting to the final total. In the team final, for which eight nations will qualify, three team members compete and all their scores count, making any falls more costly. Eddie van Hoof, the British Gymnastics technical director, said there was &quot;a good chance&quot; that the pommel specialist Louis Smith, who won a bronze medal at the Beijing Games, would have to cover other apparatus in the team competition. On Tuesday, he competed only in the pommel. &quot;We will look at structure and look at Louis to cover other apparatus but also at our best medal chances. Louis is also good at parallel bars and, suprisingly, the rings as well,&quot; said Van Hoof. Smith said part of his role was also to bring the team together: &quot;It was nice to be a mascot for the team and help the guys through it. [As captain] I can be a bit more persuasive, I&apos;ve got a bit more of a voice. The guys listen to me, we&apos;re all good friends.&quot; With the women&apos;s team having already qualified at the world championships, Beth Tweddle said she was ready to take risks in her bid to win a medal at what will be her last Olympic Games. The 26-year-old had a disappointing world championships as she failed to qualify for the uneven bars final and only finished seventh in the floor competition. &quot;After the world championships, I was able to go home and sort out the problems I&apos;d had in qualification,&quot; said Tweddle. &quot;I had a three-month period of just training which I haven&apos;t had for a long time so it was a big relief.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve been doing 10 routines every day and the problem is because I&apos;m going for that medal you&apos;ve got to take risks that come with problems as well. Hopefully in London it will all be sorted but I&apos;ve got to take those risks to try and walk away with a medal,&quot; said Tweddle, who came fourth on the uneven bars in Beijing. &quot;I&apos;d love any medal but at the end of the day if I walk away from the Olympics having done a routine cleanly and came away with a medal, fantastic. If it doesn&apos;t at least I know I&apos;ve done my best as the worst thing would be to walk away knowing had I gone clean I could have got a medal.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["She also spent \u00a36,450 on a single trip taking in Tokyo, Korea and Singapore."], "tags": ["BBC", "BBC Salford move", "Media", "Media business", "Television industry", "Radio industry", "Mark Thompson", "Zai Bennett"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-12T16:28:30Z", "title": "BBC expenses grew 20% year on year during Salford move", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/12/bbc-expenses", "article": "The expenses bill racked up by the BBC&apos;s top executives grew 20% year-on-year in the quarter to the end of June 2011, with the corporation blaming the \u00a3200m mass migration of staff and services to Salford for driving up travel and accommodation claims. The combined expenses bill of the BBC&apos;s top 102 senior managers \u2013 defined as executives earning more than \u00a3150,000 or who sit on the board of one of the corporation&apos;s directorates \u2013 hit \u00a3183,276 in the three months to the end of June 2011. This represents a 20% increase on the \u00a3152,257 notched up in the same period in 2010, according to a BBC filing made public on Thursday. It is almost 12% more than the \u00a3164,335 that was spent in the previous quarter. While senior BBC executives have become increasingly careful about what they claim since the corporation started publicly publishing expenses in 2009, there are still some interesting filings. Jessica Cecil, the \u00a3130,000-a-year head of the director general&apos;s office, spent almost \u00a31,000 on a series of dinners with senior executives to discuss how to implement director general Mark Thompson&apos;s Delivering Quality First proposals to cut spending by 20%. The series of meetings about the cuts, which include the loss of thousands of jobs, ran to \u00a3832 in &quot;business entertainment&quot; claims in the expenses report. Thompson is likely to have attended all three of the dinner meetings \u2013 one with TV controllers cost \u00a3172 and one with radio controllers cost \u00a3282.90 \u2013 although he is only specifically named in the third claim for a &quot;leads dinner&quot; costing \u00a3377.10. One of the most sizeable single claims was from Zai Bennett, the controller of BBC3, who spent \u00a31,300 on seven nights in the Mosaic Hotel in Beverly Hills during the LA Screenings. BBC chiefs showed their appreciation for key staff delivering on big stories in Libya and covering the Japanese tsunami. Francesca Unsworth, head of newsgathering at the BBC, spent a total of \u00a3365.92 on three &quot;de-briefs&quot; and &quot;thanks&quot;. The BBC said they involved four people excluding Unsworth. She also spent \u00a36,450 on a single trip taking in Tokyo, Korea and Singapore. In Japan as part of a &quot;bureaux visit&quot; she spent \u00a3320 to thank staff for &quot;coverage of the Japanese tsunami&quot;. Arguably the best free hospitality during the period went to Dominic Coles, chief operating officer for the BBC News group, who accepted an invite to last year&apos;s Uefa Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona. He also accepted two days at last summer&apos;s Wimbledon \u2013 once in the &quot;Royal Box&quot; and the other time in a &quot;marquee and centre court&quot;. Roger Wright, controller of BBC Radio 3, claimed \u00a3567.30 for a &quot;leaving party&quot;. Other hospitality and gifts declared today included a digital photo frame from US pay-TV giant HBO, given to the BBC&apos;s head of comedy, Mark Freeland. A spokesman for the BBC said that increase in expenses was a short-term consequence of the move to Salford, and was expected to come down in the long run. &quot;These expenses cover the period when the BBC&apos;s new HQ at MediaCityUK opened and executives needed to split their time between London and Salford,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;With BBC North now fully operational we expect travel and accommodation costs will come down.&quot; BBC North, now home to previously London-based services including BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sport and BBC Children, will employ a total of 2,300 staff. About 750 will be relocations from London. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

When I retired, this realisation prompted me to pedal \u2013 with no previous cycling experience \u2013 from Rotterdam to Vienna, following the rivers Rhine, Main, Tauber, Altm\u00fchl and Danube. Nearly all of the route was on dedicated cycle tracks or quiet country lanes. Wayside B&amp;Bs and hotels were plentiful. Highlights were the view from Passau castle of the confluence of the Danube, the Ilz and the Inn rivers; and the baroque monastery at Melk. Above all though, I came to enjoy the simple pleasure of passing through fairytale landscapes under my own steam. Life-changing?

Chancing upon a Cretan means, at the least, a friendly &quot;kalimera&quot; (good morning) and a wave, sometimes an invitation to come in and drink tea. Bars and Cretans really move the welcoming spirit another notch; if the owner is not around, then customers are trusted to simply help themselves and pay their bill later that day \u2026 or even the next. The most seductive Cretan music just helps to confirm what you have always wanted to believe \u2013 that life and people are beautiful. samj11 Bosnia-Herzegovina Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo Visiting this museum is a deeply moving, eye-opening and inspiring experience.

Its vastness and grandeur envelops you from the moment you leave the canopy of the long, straight road from Siem Reap, and you can&apos;t help but feel you&apos;ve stepped far back into a magical time. I decided to hire a bicycle and set off at 4am from Siem Reap to reach the temple while it was dark.

Around 50,000 people from all over the world come together in the harsh Nevada desert to create a temporary city for a week. Burning Man describes itself as &quot;an annual art event and temporary community based on radical self-expression and self-reliance&quot;. And radical it is! It&apos;s also crazy, beautiful, safe, generous and buzzing with life, love and laughter. Dress up like Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, or ride around under the stars on a giant neon spider.

Views from every vantage point are magnificent, with forest-clad mountains seeming to stretch infinitely towards Guatemala and beyond. The feeling of eternity among the ruins with the stunning Sierra Madre backdrop made me feel insignificant, overwhelmed by the vastness of nature. However, I was surprised at how comforting this was.

It was made unique by a huge influx of American draft-dodgers during the Vietnam War, and has been kept unspoiled by constant overshadowing, courtesy of the Rockies and their ski towns. Its many intellectual inputs (Russian pacifists settled there, sponsored by Tolstoy himself) and its beautiful setting, on the shores of Lake Kootenay by the underrated Selkirk Mountains, combine the majestic Canadian wilderness with the best minds and values our species has created.

Hosting two volcanoes (one live and one dormant), it&apos;s full not only of idyllic beaches but also of fairytale craggy peaks and deep valleys. Piton des Neiges, the dormant volcano, is surrounded by three craters (called cirques) that are all big enough to house several villages, and each is breathtaking. Being surrounded by the walls of the crater induces a realisation of the transitory nature of human existence that is calming and refreshing.

The voyages have taken me to the now serene shipyards in Gdansk, to the top of Mount Vesuvius, and onward to the Mekong Delta and the wonders of south-east Asia. Our ship, the MV Explorer, accommodate up to 600 students, staff \u2013 like my professor wife \u2013 and people like me, a life-long learner. You can study courses such as the political science of south-east Asia or the history of the second world war. It&apos;s not the cheapest holiday compared with other cruises. I have been fortunate enough to be a bag-carrier on these voyages for my wife who teaches aboard. Our ultimate goal is to pay the full fare so neither of us has to work and we can both sit in on as many classes as possible while exploring the delights of our planet.

He is now the organisation&apos;s senior vice-president. I was going through my closet in Virginia before I got on the plane when I saw the priest&apos;s outfit I&apos;d dressed up in at Halloween. I\u00a0thought, Italy is a Catholic country, I speak fluent Italian \u2013 this is it. There had been protesters outside the Milan shows before, but nobody had actually got inside. A few of us were trying different ruses. Kayla, a\u00a0transsexual from North Carolina who looks like Dolly Parton, was pretending to be one of the hair and make-up people. We all separated so we could hit more shows. At the Gianfranco Ferre show, I\u00a0told the lady with the clipboard I was at the church Mr Ferre attended and he had invited me for good luck. She just looked at her colleague and laughed. Inside there were hundreds of photographers and TV cameras. I\u00a0was incredibly nervous. People kept looking at me but I tried not to make eye contact. I\u00a0was worried I might see a fashion editor who&apos;d know me from previous protests.           Just as the show started, I moved forward. I had a limp because I had the banner up my trouser leg, but actually it played in well with my disguise. I crept up to the security guard on one side of the runway and saw he was not someone I should try to rush past. But when I got to the guard on the other side, he turned and gave me a big smile. He didn&apos;t do anything as I got on the catwalk because he believed I was a priest. I unfurled the banner, making sure it was the right way up. I have had them upside down before, which is really embarrassing. The music was stopped as the models were clogged up behind me and security were yelling at each other, wondering what to do. Then suddenly they got their orders to take me down. As soon as they knocked me over, an Italian woman started hitting them with her programme, yelling in Italian, &quot;Leave the priest alone, leave the priest alone.&quot; I had to fight not to laugh at that point. Eventually, four guards carried me down three flights of stairs and dumped me in the street. It was instantly all over the news. One of the organisers was screaming abuse at me: they&apos;d spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the show. But I didn&apos;t feel bad. I&apos;m glad we&apos;re able to penalise these cruel designers. He threw a punch at me and it was at that moment that Kayla burst through the crowd and said, &quot;Dan, it&apos;s time to go.&quot; The last frame of the scene is what looks like a transsexual prostitute running off with a priest. Peta doesn&apos;t have a lot of money to organise protests in far-flung places like Milan. I felt very happy that for the cost of a $600 plane ticket we could become the talk of the country. Violence is not the answer. Our tactics are designed to bruise egos, not bodies. I&apos;ve been with Peta for 26 years. Raiding Calvin Klein&apos;s office in 1992 was probably our most successful campaign \u2013 he stopped using fur after 19 years. My most nerve-racking was in Tokyo that same year: there was a big convention to promote fur and my friend Julia and I wondered what we could do to get the whole country talking. We decided we&apos;d take off our clothes and cover ourselves with a banner saying Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur. We got some help to send out a\u00a0press release in Japanese but didn&apos;t know who would turn up. Every media outlet in Japan came, plus the police. It was pandemonium. And that became our brand.

No wonder he reaches for the clich\u00e9. His Japanese companion confirms that\u00a0this experience of coincidence is universal by proffering the Japanese idiom \u2013 &quot;We say, &apos;It&apos;s a narrow world.&apos;&quot; The title of David Lodge&apos;s Small World is a phrase that we use so often because we so often unexpectedly encounter people we know. Every meeting is a coincidence, but in novels coincidence seems to signify some hidden design. In the stories of the first great English novelist, Daniel Defoe, coincidences are taken as signs of God&apos;s providential involvement in human affairs. The point of coincidences is that characters notice them. Robinson Crusoe notices coincidences and sees a\u00a0pattern of divine purpose. Lodge&apos;s characters have other responses. When Persse, on his way to visit his aunt, meets Morris Zapp, who is visiting his former landlord, on the suburban streets of Rummidge, they find they are headed for the same road. &quot;That&apos;s a remarkable coincidence,&quot; exclaims Zapp. Of course, they are actually headed for the same house, a discovery that inspires Zapp to do &quot;a little jig of excitement&quot;. He is delighted to find that his old drinking partner, Dr\u00a0O&apos;Shea, is also Persse&apos;s uncle; it confirms his convivial confidence that he knows everyone worth knowing. Yet the reader can see, as the characters cannot, that the coincidence is a matter of plotting: it is a way of letting us know the fate of Persse&apos;s cousin Bernadette, who lived with the O&apos;Sheas when Zapp was their lodger. Pregnant by an unknown lover, she has\u00a0disappeared, but will return to play\u00a0an important part in the story. Travelling the world looking for the woman he loves, Persse keeps meeting Zapp. &quot;He hadn&apos;t been in Amsterdam three hours before he met Morris Zapp.&quot; Zapp takes every coincidental encounter as a natural consequence of\u00a0his own importance. Persse, the ing\u00e9nu, is always surprised. He also meets Miss Sybil Maiden (note the name), the retired Girtonian expert on\u00a0fertility rites, almost everywhere. &quot;Fancy seeing you&apos;re here.&quot; It must be because she is always going to conferences, but no: when they meet on a beach in Hawaii she tells him she is just taking a holiday. She is like a walking narrative principle. &quot;The surprise is mutual,&quot; she will say, never sounding in the least surprised. Whenever they meet, she provides some explanation of his misadventures according to the narrative theory of her mentor, Jessie Weston, pioneering analyst of romance\u00a0stories. Miss Maiden keeps turning up as a commentator, and because she holds the key to the story of the beautiful identical twins, Angelica and Lily, for whom Persse is searching. Coincidence is a function of the romance plot of the\u00a0novel, in which the hero quests for,\u00a0but keeps failing to claim, his beloved, while all the subsidiary characters bump into their former lovers and lost children. It is almost impossible for the critic to write a &quot;spoiler&quot; for this novel, because the reader knows that anyone who goes missing in one place will reappear in another. Philip Swallow has had a blissful one-night encounter with Joy, who has later been declared dead in a plane crash. But of course he will meet her again on one of those apparently pointless academic jaunts to a distant land. Reunited, the lovers will be enjoying a trip to Jerusalem when they will bump into his son, who just happens to be working on a kibbutz during his gap year. Satirical novelists often relish coincidence. When, near the end of David Copperfield, the protagonist is given a\u00a0tour of a new model prison by his former schoolmaster Creakle (now transmogrified into a Middlesex magistrate), he is presented with the two most exemplary prisoners, in adjacent cells. The authorities are peculiarly proud of Number Twenty-Seven and Number Twenty-Eight \u2013 who turn out\u00a0to be, respectively, Uriah Heep (&quot;I see my follies now, sir&quot;) and Steerforth&apos;s sinister valet Littimer (&quot;I am conscious of my own past follies&quot;). David feels &quot;resigned wonder&quot; at this most unlikely yet logical coincidence. Probability is not the point here; a different kind of plausibility reigns. These two consummate hypocrites belong together and, by an irrefutable satirical logic, they come together where they can practise their sinister habits of servility. So coincidence can be a special pleasure of fiction. At the heart of Lodge&apos;s novel is Cheryl Summerbee who, working at the departure desk at Heathrow airport, is the impresario of coincidences. As Cheryl directs him, Persse notices in her bag the deerstalker hat that Zapp meant to give him. He tells her that he is &quot;the very man&quot; to whom Zapp asked her to post it. &quot;Well,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s a coincidence.&quot; She is hardly surprised. She meets everyone and she entertains herself by manufacturing meetings: she has the job of allocating seats, and indulges her pleasure in pairing people off. So what individuals experience as chance is in fact contrivance. She is the novel&apos;s own novelist. \u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London."}, {"sentences": ["The style &quot;gothic and Lolita&quot; comes from the Harajuku district in Tokyo and is inspired by Victorian and Rococo fashion \u2013\u00a0this particular look is known as Sweet Lolita.", "My sister bought me a book two years ago called Japanese Schoolgirl Inferno with all the Tokyo styles in it."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-13T22:59:14Z", "title": "Weekender: Jessica Yskpetaja, 16, student", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jan/13/weekender-jessica-yskpetaja-student", "article": "I&apos;ve been wearing Lolita fashion for almost three years now.

Then, in the 90s things changed dramatically. Increased competition saw retailers incentivising customers to visit their stores more frequently. To do this they expanded their product ranges. The latest fashions seen on runways and celebrities began to rapidly populate high-street retailers&apos; ranges. Designers and trend seekers would turn a garment around from drawing to shop floor in just two weeks. The era of &quot;super cheap and super fast&quot; took off. Ever since, collections have become increasingly fragmented with three to five mid-season flashes in addition to the two main collections, and, in some extreme cases, there can be as many as eighteen collections a year. &apos;Here today, gone tomorrow&apos; has become the norm. Fashion retailers have changed how and where they buy This new &quot;fast fashion&quot; model has considerably changed the role of fashion retailers in their supply-chains, specifically how and where they buy. In the past, lead times typically used to be between 90 and 120 days. These have come down to between 45 and 30 days, or even less. As a management briefing from Just Style in 2006 pointed out, instead of 40,000 garments being manufactured across four styles for 20 weeks at a rate of 500 per styles per week, now only the first five weeks are contractually confirmed (usually at four styles at 500 per style per week). This is equivalent to a total commitment of 10,000 garments. What happens to the remaining estimated 30,000 that will be needed? Their fate remains undecided until the first batch is already on sale in store. The end of the 1974 Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) in 2005, triggered a shift in market shares of garments from developing countries. Today, almost three quarters of world clothing exports are produced in developing countries with the top three exporters being Asia (54%), South America (14%) and Africa (6%). More than a quarter of the world&apos;s production of clothing and textiles now happens in China, nearly double its pre-2005 market share. How has the role of fashion retailers changed? Over the course of decades, large fashion retailers have acquired significant power as they are in direct contact with the end customer and can therefore influence preference. Retailers are also at the root of globalisation of consumers&apos; tastes. Wherever one goes, people dress very similarly. Global retailers only minimally adapt what they sell in Moscow and London, Tokyo or Buenos Aires. The growing complexity of the supply chains and functions of large fashion retail chains has also meant that a company&apos;s activity is not restricted to the core business of retail distribution. As a result supply chains have become largely opague and nearly impossibly to track. Higher pressure on suppliers to the fashion industry Buyers today are substantially larger in size than the suppliers they source from, and hence clearly hold the bargaining as well as the market power. And with shorter lead and process times, the pressure on suppliers to cut costs, if not corners, has increased. In Bangladesh, where 80% of the economy depends on the fashion industry, the minimum wage in 2006 was \u00a37.16 a month. Taking into consideration inflation and subsequent real wage levels, that is two and a half times less than the \u00a318 it was worth in 1994 when it was legislated. Meanwhile the price of essential commodities like rice, sugar, cooking oil and water have risen by 200%, making it virtually impossible for workers to support their families. Further, it is estimated that in cases where production is out sourced to a developing world country, workers&apos; wages only account for between 0.5- 4% of the final retail cost of a garment. Higher quantities and lower retail prices Clothing is now cheaper than at any time in history. In the US, prices fell by 8.5% in the 1997-2010 period but prices of all other products rose by 57.3% in the same period. Expenditure on clothing increased (+300%) but the share of disposable income decreased dramatically. In 2009 Americans bought $326 billion worth of clothing using as little as 2.98% of their income, down from 4.78% in 1988 and 9% in 1950. In the UK, between 2003 and 2007 garment prices fell by an average of 10% and, in 2006, people bought a third more clothes than in 2002. As a direct consequence, textile production has doubled over the last thirty years. In 1977 the total demand amounted to thirty one million tonnes of fibre. In 2007, this figure had risen to nearly eight million tonnes. Prices are lower and quality has decreased too Cheap fashion uses cheap fibres, such as polyester and cotton. While polyester is an oil-based commodity, cotton on the other hand is not exactly the &quot;good&quot; crop it is usually perceived as. Cotton alone uses an estimated 22.5% of the world&apos;s insecticides and 10% of all pesticides many of which cause collateral damage in humans.Unsurprisingly, quicker production lowers product quality, and bad quality garments are easier to discard. It is estimated that more than 1 million tonnes of textiles are thrown away every year in the UK alone. Is sustainability in today&apos;s fashion industry possible? Twenty years ago sustainability was not on the agenda of the fashion industry&apos;s players. Today, sustainability forms part of their agenda, even though the degree of commitment of the different players varies considerably. Many bright initiatives are led by independent fashion entrepreneurs that are seriously driven by their ethical objectives and are trying to find solutions to integrate sustainability into their business. Interesting initiatives from bigger brands are harder to come by, but they do exist: Marks &amp; Spencer, Patagonia, Levi and Nike are examples. Most initiatives that involve global brands have launched in the last 10 years. For example, The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) was launched in 1998 but really only gained momentum from 2000, and Made BY and the Ethical Fashion Forum were both launched in 2004. Today there are more than one hundred different labels addressing consumers&apos; health and environmental and social sustainability. But the key question is \u2013 will all of these efforts taken together really make a difference? Ultimately, the drive has to come from the industry itself. While fashion companies still don&apos;t see sustainability as an integral part of their core business, change will be slow and difficult. For Rio 2012, there is really only one topic on the agenda for the fashion industry; how can they make their supply chains measurably more transparent? Once full-scale transparency is in place the resulting evidence will be too compelling to ignore.

The book says that Kim Jong-nam \u2013 who has never met the new leader, his half-brother Kim Jong-un \u2013 described the dynastic succession as &quot;a joke to the outside world&quot;, and said even his father had originally opposed the hereditary transfer of power. &quot;The Kim Jong-un regime will not last long,&quot; Kim Jong-nam is said to have written, forecasting a power struggle. &quot;Without reforms, North Korea will collapse, and when such changes take place, the regime will collapse.&quot; He added: &quot;I think we will see valuable time lost as the regime sits idle fretting over whether it should pursue reforms or stick to the present political structure.&quot; The claims emerge in a book by Yoji Gomi, a journalist with Tokyo Shimbun, who said he exchanged emails with Kim Jong-nam over seven years. The date of the remarks on the regime is unclear. Gomi, who lived for years in Seoul and Beijing, said he met Kim three times in total, once in 2004 and twice in 2011. &quot;He gave me a very good impression. He&apos;s very gentle and friendly,&quot; Gomi said. An English version of Japanese journalist&apos;s remarks, and the quotes from Kim Jong-nam, appeared in the English-language linline edition of a South Korean newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo [see footnote]. &quot;We exchanged emails over some time and when I suggested compiling our exchanges as a book, he agreed. At first he wanted publication to be delayed, but when I said we ought to go ahead because of everything that is happening in North Korea right now, he said that was OK. I don&apos;t feel that he has any ambition to become leader of North Korea, but he wants to contribute to improving the situation in the country. He travels a great deal, but his base is in Macau.&quot; A publicist for the Bungei Shunju publishing company said the book would be published shortly. Kim Jong-nam has previously offered relatively outspoken if brief remarks on the North to journalists who have tracked him down, but these reported messages go much further. Experts on North Korea cautioned that it was impossible to verify the details unless or until Kim Jong-nam confirmed he had written the emails. In one message, Kim Jong-nam remarked: &quot;I&apos;m concerned how Jong-un, who merely resembles my grandfather [former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung], will be able to satisfy the needs of North Koreans. &quot;Kim Jong-un is still just a nominal figure and the members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power.&quot; He said his father had not wanted to pass power to a third generation, but decided the bloodline was needed to maintain the regime&apos;s stability. He also said his father felt lonely after sending him to study abroad, growing close to his siblings instead, and displeased his father by calling for reform and market-opening and &quot;was eventually viewed with suspicion&quot;. His views meant that the overseas education of his brothers and sister was shortened. He also claimed to have told Kim Jong-il how concerned the international community was about the nuclear tests and missile launches. He noted the North&apos;s hardline stance was based on the political system&apos;s determination to survive. Of the deadly shelling of Yeonpyeong island in 2010, he added: &quot;It was a provocation by North Korea&apos;s military to justify their status and existence and the possession of nuclear weapons.&quot; Asked about the new leader, he reportedly replied: &quot;I&apos;m his half brother, but I&apos;ve never met him so I don&apos;t know.&quot; But he said he had seen their middle brother Jong-chol a few times and was also on good terms with their aunt and uncle. Kim Kyong-hui and Jang Song-taek have become increasingly prominent in North Korean media and appear to be guiding the new leader as he assumes power, although some suggest Jang could become a potential rival. Kim Jong-nam, who is believed to divide his time between Beijing and Macau, said of his arrangements: &quot;The Chinese government is protecting me, but it is also monitoring me too. It&apos;s my inevitable fate. If you can&apos;t avoid it, it&apos;s better to enjoy it.&quot; Reports have previously suggested Kim fell from favour with his father when Japanese authorities caught him trying to enter the country with a forged passport from the Dominican Republic, hoping to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Kim said it was common for the North&apos;s elite to travel with forged documents, claiming Kim Jong-un also went to Japan with a fake Brazilian passport. \u2022 This footnote was added on 18 January 2012.

What or who was on your moodboard?A: Antonio Lopez and Paris in the 70s. It was a really exciting time to be in Paris, with lots of Japanese designers like Kenzo arriving and changing the look of the epoch. Also Paris in the 70s was really developing in terms of architecture, with the Pompidou Centre and the first development of La Defense etc. Q: How did these inspirations and references develop throughout the collection. A: It&apos;s all about the luxury and decadence of the set of friends around Antonio Lopez in the 70s \u2013 the party scene. For example, Le Palace was very important and you really see this in the way evening wear looks \u2013 handmade kimono silk, handcut velvet, silk seersucker shirts, etc. There&apos;s also a large &quot;countryside&quot; idea in the show, the group of friends would often travel to Karl Lagerfeld&apos;s house in the country for weekends and there are tough-looking hunting jackets and coats (with croc details of course!), chunky shearling pieces and heavy military-looking knitwear pieces that reflect this. Luxury of course is the biggest thing about this collection and you can really see this in the fabrics and materials - the 70s was a time when Paris was &quot;on the up&quot; and we have croc, lizard, astrakhan, camel, cashmere and shearling to reflect this. It was a time of innovation, and the &quot;Tokyo&quot; part of the show shows this, with shiny, reflective and technical pieces really bringing us into the luxe of the eveningwear. Q: What is the overall mood of menswear coming through for autumn/winter 2012 at Vuitton. A: Luxury! That&apos;s it, pure luxury. Q: Were there things in the LV archive that you&apos;ve updated this season? And if so, what and how have you given them a new-season twist?A: We have brought back the steamer bag this season in different sizes and materials, such as a more supple version of the famous Epi leather, and crocodile. The biggest general influence from the archive is the travel aspect. All of these clothes are for the man who travels the world, be it on a private jet or a yacht! Vuitton is really well set up for super-technical, super-luxury outerwear, and this is something we&apos;ve really played to this season. Q: What are the key pieces in this collection and why? A: A double-breasted overcoat. It gives an idea of the 70s, is super-luxurious but super-modern with its clear form. The waxed cotton hunting pieces are also key, in dark blue, dark brown and dark khaki. The croc details and wool removable blanket linings are perfect for a winter in the country. The croc blouson with shearling collar is also a key, luxury piece. Q: If you were going to buy one new thing for autumn/winter 2012 what would it be and why?A: If it were an accessory it would be the astrakhan Sirius suitcase. It&apos;s perfect for a weekend away. I couldn&apos;t take just one piece though, it&apos;s all too good. I&apos;d have the waxed cotton blouson with crocodile details.

Megu,\u00a0a cutting-edge &quot;Modern Japanese&quot; chain will start serving Delhi&apos;s richest from a brand new venue in the luxury Leela hotel in the city&apos;s diplomatic quarter. Diners will eat off specially created ceramics in rooms lined with antique kimonos and hundreds of folded paper decorations, and pay about \u00a380 per head before sake. Welcome to the brash new world of elite Indian international gastronomy. &quot;We are aiming at the affluent traveller or the ultra-rich local,&quot; said Aishwarya Nair, a senior executive at the Leela. &quot;The idea is to give people a taste of globalisation. In our restaurant you don&apos;t know you are in India. You could be in New York, Japan, anywhere.&quot; The Leela, which opened 15 months ago as Delhi&apos;s most luxurious hotel, already hosts the first Asian outlet of Le\u00a0Cirque, the notably expensive Las Vegas and New York gastronomic French-Italian restaurant. On a cold midweek evening this month, it was almost full. Waiters served lobster risotto, Wagyu beef, tournedos rossini and black cod \u2013 with a sommelier offering fine 25-year-old bordeaux wines. Gastronomic boom There have been fine dining establishments in India for years, but the gastronomic scene is undergoing something of a boom. Scores of chefs have returned from London, Tokyo, New York and elsewhere bringing new expertise and invention. Popular interest in cooking \u2013 once seen as a function that the middle class would delegate to a servant if possible \u2013 has boomed, with 24-hour TV channels devoted to food and a local version of Masterchef that has an avid following. Most significant, says restaurant critic Vir Sanghvi, is the arrival of the major international brands. Hakkasan, the contemporary Chinese restaurant, opened in Mumbai, the Indian commercial capital, recently and will come to Delhi shortly. Masaharu Morimoto, the international Japanese chef, already has an outlet in both cities. The Leela Hotels chain plans at least one more Megu soon. India is not the only emerging market to interest big international fine dining brands. A Hakkasan restaurant recently began trading in Dubai and Abu Dhabi has a new Megu \u2013 as Moscow soon will. But India is seen as having particular potential. &quot;The food [at somewhere like Megu] doesn&apos;t matter so much as the experience and the glamour,&quot; said Sanghvi. &quot;There is a lot of money outside the traditional elite now and these people are looking for ways to spend it on only something that seems sophisticated.&quot; The price of the food is as important to some clients as the quality, according to Nair \u2013 and the high cost can be an attraction. Nair has created a pizza with a caviar topping costing \u00a3120 \u2013 named The High Life \u2013 specifically to appeal to customers more interested in conspicuous consumption than gastronomy. It has, she said, sold very well. The Leela bar serves a spirit known as &quot;the black pearl&quot;, which is priced at 125,000 rupees (\u00a31,600) a shot. The hotel has so far sold seven, of which four were drunk by the entourage of &quot;an African king&quot;. Cristal champagne is more popular. The publicity for one New Delhi restaurant scheduled to open this year promises a fresh interpretation of traditional Indian ingredients by half a dozen three-Michelin-starred chefs. A meal for two will cost about \u00a31,000 including wine, heavy local taxes and a limousine to take diners home \u2013 making it the most expensive Indian restaurant in the world. With Indian diners having only recently developed a taste for cuisines from around the world, some customisation of menus is often necessary. &quot;At Megu in Delhi we have created new vegetarian dishes and have also used ingredients like foie gras,&quot; said Akiko Kitajima, Megu&apos;s managing director. &quot;It is an introduction to Japanese culture but you can&apos;t ignore the local context.&quot; Chefs in Delhi, seen as a rough and uncouth city in comparison with the cosmopolitan Mumbai, tell of wealthy Indians asking for more spices with their risotto or &quot;pink sauce&quot; with their pasta. However, Indian tastes seem to be evolving rapidly, as more people travel overseas. &quot;You now get customers sending back a dish saying it doesn&apos;t taste like it did when they were recently on holiday in Italy or France \u2013 that didn&apos;t happen before,&quot; said one executive chef at a luxury Delhi hotel. Middle class The Indian economy has experienced solid growth, at up to 9% a year, for nearly two decades and the country&apos;s middle class is expected to number more than 250 million by 2016. The new interest in gastronomy has provoked criticism from some who point out that malnutrition remains a major problem for hundreds of millions of India&apos;s poor. Despite a recent slowdown, so-called aspirational eating is likely to be a major trend for those with new disposable income in coming years, market analysts say. &quot;India is growing very fast, whether in terms of art and culture, economic strength, technology, luxury or food,&quot; said Siddharth Mathur, manager of the independent Smoke House Room restaurant. &quot;With bigger and better restaurants and international food brands coming in to the country, it&apos;s only a matter of time before fine dining finds its place among a growing cosmopolitan population.&quot; Mathur&apos;s restaurant offers &quot;adventurous epicureans&quot; a &quot;molecular, multisensory&quot; cuisine and is typical of smaller restaurants being opened in Delhi. But no one doubts that the globally known prestigious gastronomic brands are here to stay. &quot;Fine dining in India has become part of the international label culture,&quot; said Sanghvi."}, {"sentences": ["Starting out as an ordinary cashier in a Glasgow branch of NatWest, he had risen rapidly to become a senior vice-president for strategy, working from Tokyo and New York, before being put in charge of\u00a0Greenwich NatWest, a small, London-based investment banking subsidiary of the high street\u00a0bank."], "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "Extradition", "UK criminal justice", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-20T22:59:59Z", "title": "I was one of the NatWest Three", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/20/natwest-three-gary-mulgrew-book", "article": "Gary Mulgrew&apos;s mother had always taught him, when he was grappling with a particularly knotty dilemma, to scribble down his concerns, so he decided to approach being sent to a notoriously violent, gang-dominated jail in a Texas desert in the same way. Sitting at a bare table in his rented Houston flat, Mulgrew laid out a sheet of white paper and some coloured pens. &quot;PRISON&quot; he wrote in the centre in capitals. Then, in red, &quot;rape&quot;, then &quot;buggery&quot;. &quot;Shagged&quot;. &quot;Buggery&quot; again. Then &quot;violence&quot;, &quot;darkness&quot;, &quot;murder&quot;, &quot;extortion&quot;, &quot;blackmail&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;knives&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;gangs&quot;, &quot;gang rape&quot;. Using different colours, he scribbled down other fears \u2013 notably the dark, a paralysing phobia since he was a very young child. Finally, on another sheet, he divided the scribbled words between two columns: &quot;BAD&quot; and &quot;FUCKING CATASTROPHIC&quot;. At least the bad ones didn&apos;t look so bad. It was a technique Mulgrew had used many times in his career as an investment banker, and\u00a0to no little success. Starting out as an ordinary cashier in a Glasgow branch of NatWest, he had risen rapidly to become a senior vice-president for strategy, working from Tokyo and New York, before being put in charge of\u00a0Greenwich NatWest, a small, London-based investment banking subsidiary of the high street\u00a0bank. He had acquired, along the way, all the trappings of the boom-times banker:\u00a0big\u00a0house, big salary, big bonus, big ego. But Mulgrew&apos;s management techniques \u2013 and his judgment \u2013 had failed him, and with one very bad deal his life had collapsed spectacularly; once charmed, now unquestionably catastrophic. Mulgrew&apos;s name may not be immediately familiar, but there was a time, six or so years ago, when he acquired a sudden and very strange kind of celebrity. Some years earlier, in 2000, Mulgrew and two colleagues at GNW had made seven-figure personal windfalls by quietly investing their own money in a $20m offshore deal that, it turned out, was part of an elaborate fraud against the US energy giant Enron, brokered by the company&apos;s then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The multibillion-dollar corporation, with which GNW had worked closely, would collapse the following year in one of the biggest corruption scandals in US history. As Enron tumbled, the three men \u2013 Mulgrew, David Bermingham and Giles Darby \u2013 approached the Financial Services Authority in London, they say, to report their dealings with the firm and to draw the regulator&apos;s attention to what they now realised might be a questionable deal. No action was taken by the FSA. But as US prosecutors gathered evidence against senior Enron executives, including Fastow, their attention turned to the dodgy-looking Cayman Islands deal he had cooked up involving the three British bankers. In 2002, the US sought the Britons&apos; extradition on seven counts of fraud. It was not the facts of the case that catapulted the three to attention, but the circumstances of\u00a0their extradition, under the terms\u00a0of a\u00a0supposedly bilateral treaty that allowed the US to seize British suspects without presenting a\u00a0substantial case against them, and that Congress\u00a0itself had not ratified. Newspapers wrote angry editorials; hundreds of businesspeople marched indignantly through Westminster. The Commons held an 11th-hour emergency debate during which the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, condemned the &quot;unfair, unequal treaty&quot;. The\u00a0press, with the enthusiastic encouragement of a canny PR campaign, dubbed the men the NatWest Three, in the manner of an\u00a0egregious miscarriage of justice.     Mulgrew with Giles Darby (left) and David Bermingham (centre).  Photograph: Rex      It&apos;s almost laughable, Mulgrew notes drily, to imagine three millionaire bankers mustering that level of support today. &quot;If it happened now,\u00a0people would probably get a bus and drive us over [to America].&quot; They lost the extradition battle in July 2006 and, after agreeing a plea bargain with US prosecutors in which they admitted one charge, were each sentenced to 37\u00a0months in prison. The funny thing is, Mulgrew says, &quot;People get\u00a0much more bent out of shape about me being\u00a0an ex-banker than they do about me being a\u00a0convicted fraudster. &apos;You were a\u00a0banker, oh my God!&apos; Convicted fraudster was the first step of my rehabilitation.&quot; Mulgrew is 50 now, greyer and a little thinner than before he was extradited, and living in Brighton, where we meet in a quiet pub of which he owns a share. (Of his partners, he says, &quot;I&apos;ve been amazingly lucky with how faithful, loyal and decent they were.&quot;) He speaks quickly, in a strong Glasgow accent, but surprisingly softly, and with a vulnerability that is at times quite unsettling. He has now written a book, Gang Of One, about his time in Big Spring Federal Correctional Institution, one of a number of US prisons he passed through before seeing out the rest of his sentence, of which he served just over half, in Britain. It&apos;s an entertaining read, focusing on his menacing, sometimes comical dealings with his fellow inmates and the assorted gangs that competed over the prison&apos;s corridors. There is an element, perhaps inevitably, of setting the record straight, as he sees it \u2013 throughout the book, Mulgrew refers to the offence that landed him in prison as\u00a0no more than\u00a0a breach of his employment contract. But\u00a0while he\u00a0says his legal fight has virtually wiped him out financially, the book was not written for money \u2013 most of any income will go to\u00a0charity. He has a much more compelling reason\u00a0for telling his story. A week after Mulgrew was extradited, his ex-wife, Laura, rang to let him speak to their five-year-old daughter, Cara Katrina. The couple had separated two years earlier, in the fallout of\u00a0the extradition drama, and while their son Calum, then eight, had opted to live with his father, Cara Katrina divided her time between both parents. Mulgrew&apos;s new partner had taken over Calum&apos;s care when he was extradited; he says Laura, at that time, was increasingly &quot;vague&quot; about her whereabouts. When he tried to call Cara Katrina again, the mobile number went unanswered \u2013 and he has had minimal contact with her since. Laura fled the country with her shortly after Mulgrew&apos;s extradition, later marrying a Tunisian man called Abdul. Mulgrew doesn&apos;t know where they are now. Calum has had very occasional letters from\u00a0his mother via his school, but there is never a\u00a0return address. &quot;It&apos;s about my daughter,&quot; Mulgrew says of the book. &quot;I think this is the mechanism that will probably help me find her. I&apos;m hoping somebody will read this and will have maybe seen her. That&apos;s what I hope.&quot; He also wants to create a\u00a0record for Cara Katrina while she&apos;s gone, to prove to her &quot;that I was always trying, that she was always loved and it wasn&apos;t her fault. &quot;Your love for your children doesn&apos;t diminish,&quot; he says. &quot;It just doesn&apos;t. And it&apos;s very, very difficult to, um\u2026 it&apos;s difficult to see\u2026 to function normally, right? Unless you feel\u2026 I have to feel every day that I&apos;ve done just a little bit. It just helps me.&quot; Whatever his history, Mulgrew does not now fit the archetype of the bumptious banker bestriding the financial markets with unshakable self-assurance. He talks, I suggest quite early in our meeting, with the sometimes lacerating self-awareness of someone who has spent time in therapy. &quot;Er\u2026 A little bit. &quot; It&apos;s more the case, he volunteers later, that he\u00a0has always carried with him a\u00a0powerful sense of self-doubt and a\u00a0&quot;terrible&quot; need to be liked, even when he found himself at the very top of the money tree. Mulgrew was born in 1962, the youngest of three sons, to a young Glasgow couple whose ill-starred marriage was over when he was a baby and his mother only 21. Unable to cope, she temporarily placed the boys in foster care and then, when Mulgrew was four, in an orphanage. It was here, thanks to repeatedly being locked in a garage as a punishment, that Mulgrew acquired his crippling fear of the dark. (Happily, he was to find that in his 80-man &quot;cell&quot; \u2013 more like a warehouse \u2013 in the Texas prison, the lights were never switched off.) They returned after two years to live with their mother in a Glasgow tenement; he heard nothing from his father until he was 11. His brother went back to the home once, he says, and found a report that had been written\u00a0of their time there. &quot;It was heartbreaking. It was terrible. I had once given somebody something, a cross or something, to &apos;be my best friend&apos;. They\u00a0said I\u2026 They describe me as a\u00a0&apos;needy child&apos;.\u00a0I&apos;m kind of pissed off about that, because why wouldn&apos;t you be, for fuck&apos;s sake. Of\u00a0course I\u00a0was needy. &quot;And when I read that, it was terrible, I thought, fuck, that&apos;s me, I&apos;ve lived my whole life like that. That was\u2026 that was bad. Er\u2026&quot; He\u00a0coughs. &quot;That was when I was four, I think. And then, that&apos;s it. That&apos;s me, end of story.&quot; He carried that eagerness to please through his childhood, he says, and through Strathclyde University, where he studied business. Before he graduated, he&apos;d already secured a\u00a0job interview at\u00a0NatWest. He found he was good at it, he says, and was fast-tracked by supportive bosses. &quot;And I&apos;m appalled to say I had read Kane And Abel and really liked that kind of banker thing. I was quite proud of it.&quot; His people-pleasing tendencies may\u00a0even be part of what made him so successful, he thinks. He now says he was not the only one desperate to make an impression. &quot;You sit in meetings and everyone is talking about mathematical stuff and &apos;the probability of default is zero point such-and-such based on this and this&apos; and you&apos;re sitting looking at everyone else and thinking, do you understand this? &quot;Now to say, &apos;Hold on a minute, I&apos;m really sorry, I don&apos;t understand this. Can you explain this to me?&apos; That is just incredibly difficult to do. People just sat there and everybody was too frightened to ask.&quot; How much did he earn? He gets up and puts a\u00a0log on the fire. &quot;Do you really want to know that? Well, I got paid more in a year than I made in that deal [the one that landed him in prison]. I got paid a phenomenal amount of money. And I&apos;ll tell you something, I never asked for it. I was amazed when I got it, and what it meant for me was\u2026 Me! Me. Look at\u00a0me. I&apos;ve made it in this business, I\u00a0can&apos;t bloody believe it.&quot; He&apos;s been described by former colleagues as arrogant, I say. &quot;I think I had moments of extreme arrogance.&quot; GNW&apos;s most important relationship was with Enron, whose team hosted the wildest and most lavish business trips, and had millions at their fingertips to invest through their bankers. The company, Mulgrew now says, &quot;was the epitome of the capitalist model. When you went into their buildings in London or Houston, they had the share price everywhere, even in the elevators. And everybody, from the secretaries and janitors up to the big guy, got paid in shares\u2026 So almost all of them are sitting there with their own mental calculation, all the time, of how much wealthier they had got.&quot; He admits he was &quot;dazzled&quot; by it, and particularly by Fastow. &quot;He&apos;s the CFO of America&apos;s hotshot company, he&apos;s 36 years of age, an Ivy League guy. He has all those nice things in life: nice teeth, nice hair, shakes your hand properly. So when he offered me the investment, if he&apos;d asked me to invest in a pizza parlour with him, I\u00a0would have done it.&quot; &quot;The investment&quot;, needless to say, is the most tangled part of Mulgrew&apos;s story. &quot;Are you going to ask me about innocence and guilt, all that?&quot; he asks abruptly early in our interview. The three men had insisted on their innocence of the fraud while fighting extradition; their\u00a0later plea bargain was taken by some as proof of their venality. So, is\u00a0he guilty? He answers with a question. &quot;Do\u00a0you like football? Well, Kenny Dalglish, first time he was a\u00a0manager, was asked after a game that ended 1-1 and he got a dubious penalty, and the guy said to him, &apos;Was it a penalty?&apos; and he said, &apos;Of\u00a0course it was. The ref gave it, so\u00a0it was a penalty.&apos; In law, it&apos;s a fact that I&apos;m guilty. I am guilty. Definitely, I\u00a0have to be. I went to jail.&quot; It was the turn of the millennium, and NatWest was fighting two hostile takeover bids that put in doubt the future of its hotshot investment banking division. Mulgrew, as GNW&apos;s leader, was talking secretly with a number of other banks about taking over his team wholesale. In the midst of this turmoil, he says, &quot;Fastow said to me, &apos;If you do leave, do you want to do this deal?&apos;&quot; The deal involved the three men recommending to NatWest that it sell a stake it owned in an offshore investment vehicle called Swap Sub for $1m, without informing their employers who was buying it \u2013 in fact, a company controlled by Giles Darby. The three had put up $250,000 of their own money for the purchase. Fastow, meanwhile, had persuaded Enron to buy the stake for $20m. When the deal went through, he and a colleague pocketed $12.3m between them, while the three Britons shared $7.35m. (In 2002, Fastow was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to repay $23.8m in stolen money, after turning informant against his former Enron colleagues.) The US indictment on which the men were extradited stated that the men knew NatWest&apos;s Swap Sub stake was worth vastly more than they sold it for, and had conspired with Fastow to defraud Enron, at one point flying to Houston to present a seminar on how it should be conducted. &quot;The concept of saying, &apos;Right, we&apos;re going to do a presentation on how do to a fraud,&apos; it&apos;s fucking ridiculous,&quot; Mulgrew says. He also disputes vigorously that he undersold the Swap Sub stake. The US quickly dropped the conspiracy line of inquiry after Fastow insisted he had acted alone. But the three accepted, as laid out in a\u00a0&quot;statement of facts&quot; negotiated tortuously between prosecutors and the men&apos;s lawyers, that they were guilty of breaching NatWest&apos;s internal compliance rules that required they inform their employers of the deal \u2013 the basis of Mulgrew&apos;s assertion that he just breached his contract \u2013 and a &quot;theft of opportunity&quot; against NatWest, depriving the bank of the opportunity to make the money that they had pocketed. &quot;My lawyer took me out for coffee the day we were doing the statement of facts, to explain why I\u00a0was signing it. And he assures me that that is known as a theft of opportunity. Did I deliberately defraud NatWest? Absolutely not.&quot; They took the plea bargain rather than fighting the case, he says, because every (London-based) witness they wanted to call to back up their story, now represented by NatWest&apos;s lawyers, refused to travel to testify, and losing held out a prospect of at least 20 years in prison. Guilt, though, is a mischievous thing. In the book, Mulgrew describes facing his first shift cleaning the prison toilets and experiencing &quot;an overpowering sense that I&apos;d been found out, and placed where I really belonged. Maybe I deserved this prison after all. Maybe I deserved a\u00a0lot worse. I&apos;d climbed the ladder of success only to realise I&apos;d perched my ladder against the wrong wall.&quot; Does he mean he took a wrong moral turn? &quot;There&apos;s a lot of that. Should we have seen Fastow for what he was becoming? Should we have known better? You look at some transactions\u2026 and you think, hmm, maybe we should have blown the whistle there and we didn&apos;t. I\u00a0have a lot regrets about that. I have a\u00a0lot\u00a0of regrets about not\u2026 being strong enough as a person.&quot; Two months after they had done the deal with Fastow, Mugrew says, he saw him in Miami. &quot;Of course, I\u00a0was fascinated about how he had made so much money [on the Swap Sub deal]. And, of course, I never asked him. I thought about asking him, but instead I decided to act like I did that every Tuesday, that I was cool. And when I look at that now I just\u2026 I think I was a horse&apos;s arse. Those are\u00a0the kind of bits where I think I\u00a0must have been polluted by it. All I\u00a0did was thank him. &apos;Thanks very much, that was great. Maybe we&apos;ll do some more in the future.&apos; I just stood there like a big diddy. And that&apos;s dreadful, I think.&quot; The consolation to his critics, he notes wryly, is that he has &quot;lost it all&quot;. He spent millions on legal fees, he says, and still has debts to settle. As well as the share in the bar and &quot;some other ones&quot;, all he owns is a small building company in Lewes. His priorities, though, are rebuilding his relationship with Calum, now 16,\u00a0and finding Cara Katrina, the imagined horrors of whose absence, for someone who was abandoned by\u00a0his own father and still lives with the legacy of childhood terrors, is, he says, a &quot;designer nightmare&quot;. After Calum was born, he didn&apos;t speak to his own father for three years, he volunteers at one point (the pair had forged a relationship of sorts as he grew into adulthood), unable to deal with the enormity of what that abandonment meant. Eventually his father, who has since died, wrote Mulgrew a letter, having seen an article about him in the City press, that read: &quot;Congratulations. Looks like you&apos;ve finally beaten me.&quot; &quot;So I phoned him, went for a drink, and eventually I said to him, &apos;What did you mean by that letter?&apos; He said, &apos;Well, you&apos;ve always been driven by me. You&apos;ve always wanted to beat me.&apos;&quot; That&apos;s an extraordinary thing to say to the son you abandoned until he was 11, I say. &quot;I think so,&quot; Mulgrew says. &quot;But that was him. I\u00a0said, &apos;I didn&apos;t speak to you because I had a son, and I\u00a0couldn&apos;t believe that you had fucked off and not been there. I can&apos;t understand that. I would never leave my kids.&apos;&quot; He stops suddenly. &quot;That would be a good ending to a movie, wouldn&apos;t it? As I left them to\u00a0go to prison. And everything that has gone wrong since.&quot;  "}, {"sentences": ["In 2010 Unesco designated Chengdu the first City of Gastronomy in Asia, ahead of Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore."], "tags": ["China holidays", "Food and drink", "Travel", "Asia", "Food & drink", "Chinese food and drink", "Chinese new year"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-22T00:04:00Z", "title": "Sizzling Sichuan: China's food hotspot", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/22/china-chinese-food-sichuan-province", "article": "With its lines of brightly coloured washing and gaggles of old ladies knitting at the gates, the compound didn&apos;t look promising, but rumour had it that a retired chef from one of Chengdu&apos;s famous old restaurants was running a secret snack shop in one of the apartments. We snooped around until, sure enough, we spotted a handwritten menu hanging on the wall of one of the blocks. Inside, two scruffy rooms were crammed with people guzzling boiled dumplings with sides of boiled cabbage and spicy rice jelly, while the chef worked in the steamy kitchen and members of his family handed out food and barked orders at the guests. Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, is a city obsessed with eating. According to Wang Xudong, editor of Sichuan Cuisine magazine, it has the highest density of restaurants and teahouses of any city in the world \u2013 some 40,000 at the latest estimate. Food crazes tear across the culinary landscape like prairie fires; local radio hosts recite news of the latest restaurant openings in drooling tones. In 2010 Unesco designated Chengdu the first City of Gastronomy in Asia, ahead of Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. To win this accolade, local officials and food historians had to demonstrate the city&apos;s distinctive culinary culture, including special ingredients, dishes and cooking methods; its vibrant restaurant scene and traditional food industry; and its commitment to environmental sustainability and gastronomic education. &quot;Apart from the panda,&quot; says Professor Du Li of the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, &quot;nothing is more important to the Sichuanese than food. People here love to search out small restaurants in out-of-the-way places that may just specialise in a couple of dishes.&quot; The Sichuanese is undoubtedly one of China&apos;s great cuisines, thrilling in its flavours, diverse in its ingredients and encompassing everything from refined banquet dishes to the most scrumptious street snacks. Though often known by outsiders simply as &quot;hot and spicy&quot;, it is better characterised by its startling range of flavours, from the infamous &quot;numbing and hot&quot; combination of chillies and Sichuan pepper through to understated dishes in which the essential tastes of prime ingredients shine through. The past decade has seen the disappearance of most of the city&apos;s old lanes, with their street vendors, markets and artisanal food producers; a kitchen invasion by Cantonese bottled sauces and chicken-stock powder, and the arrival of a plethora of new influences, including Japanese-style sashimi and western fast food. So where, in this city of dizzying gastronomic choice, should a visitor eat?     A street stall, Chengdu Photograph: Peter Adams/Getty Images    It would be a shame not to sample the street food that gave the world such delights as dan dan noodles and man-and-wife offal slices (a\u00a0potent appetiser of tripe and other titbits tossed with chilli oil, Sichuan pepper and crushed nuts and seeds). Real street traders are increasingly hard to find, but look out for those offering custardy &quot;flower&quot; bean curd (dou hua) scattered with fragrant oils and crunchy pickles. The vendors can be recognised by their red-and-black wooden barrels. Many old-fashioned snacks have migrated indoors into little restaurants, such as Granny Wang&apos;s, which serves buckwheat noodles made on the spot with a\u00a0huge press. Ideally one would buy each snack from a specialist vendor, but for an overview it&apos;s worth visiting the opulent Shunxing Teahouse in Hong Kong-style Century City, where you can order a set menu of a dozen or more &quot;small eats&quot; while watching a show of face-changing and other local performing arts. One of Sichuan&apos;s most notorious delicacies is the &quot;ox-tripe hotpot&quot;, originally a speciality of the great Yangtze metropolis of Chongqing but now popular across the region. It&apos;s an eating ritual best enjoyed at night, when you have hours to fritter away over a seething cauldron of chillies and Sichuan pepper, cooking your own choice of ingredients in the fiery broth and dipping them in sesame oil and crushed garlic to eat. The squeamish should be warned that the most prized hotpot ingredients include not only tripe but other rubbery and slithery ingredients, such as goose intestines and cartilage; there are also fresh mushrooms and vegetables, however, as well as sliced meats and seafood, and a divided hotpot containing a mild stock alongside the traditional brew can be provided for those who&apos;d prefer a\u00a0choice of hot or not. Feverish competition in the catering industry means restaurants are under constant pressure to innovate. Fashions come and go, and businesses often try to sell themselves with a particular gimmick or an unusual regional slant, such as the Wuling Mountain Delicacies chain, which specialises in the mushroom cookery of the Tujia ethnic group (dinner here might include a mushroom hotpot and smoky bacon stir-fried with preserved chillies). &quot;A\u00a0Chinese restaurant in the west might be able to get away with serving gong bao chicken for its whole life, but here they have to change their menus all the time,&quot; says Wang Xudong. Older Sichuan food aficionados often hanker after the flavours of their childhoods and the old mom-and-pop restaurants that have been swept away by the redevelopment of the city. One restaurateur who satisfies the craving for nostalgic flavours is Liu Shaokun, whose establishment in the suburb of Shuangliu is well worth the tedious drive from the city centre. Liu makes his own pickles and cures his own winter meats. House specialities include stewed turtle with potatoes, cold spicy noodles with shredded chicken and peasant soups made with seasonal vegetables. For banquet cookery Yu&apos;s Cuisine, run by maverick chef Yu Bo and his wife Dai Shuang, remains extraordinary. The restaurant has only six private rooms and no \u00e0 la carte menu. A typical feast for a\u00a0group here consists of dozens of dishes, including dazzling vegetarian starters, slow-cooked meats, little buns in the shape of hedgehogs and the odd modernist surprise, such as spherified jasmine tea inspired by a visit to El Bulli. Another original talent is chef Zhang Yuanfu of the Wu Yuan, who offers grand banquets in surroundings inspired by the Qing dynasty. Like Yu Bo&apos;s, his food has an intimacy that is missing amid the rampant commercialisation of the mainstream catering scene. Aside from the food, one of the great pleasures of Chengdu life is the teahouse. A couple of decades ago, there was a teahouse on every back street where people gathered to play cards or mah jong, parade their pet birds or listen to Sichuan opera. Small teahouses can still be found tucked away beside the waterways in quiet corners of the city; easier to find are the larger but equally charming teahouses in the parks. One favourite is the sprawling riverside teahouse in Wangjiang Park, where you can have your ears cleaned with goose feathers as you nibble watermelon seeds and sip your jasmine-blossom tea. If by any chance you overeat and feel a little delicate, a medicinal meal might be in order. The Qin Shan Zhai, close to the Temple of Marquis Wu and the city&apos;s Tibetan quarter, specialises in tonic soups. Every dish on the menu is accompanied by a description of its curative properties: tea-smoked goose, for example &quot;eliminates wind-damp and strengthens the bones&quot;, while chicken soup &quot;enriches the blood and body&quot;. Order according to your ailments, or if you prefer, make up a\u00a0few as an excuse for eating the dishes you fancy.

The earthquake research institute at Tokyo University said that in the worst case, a quake of magnitude 7 would hit the southern part of metropolitan Tokyo by 2016, while the chances of a similar disaster occurring within 30 years are as high as 98%. The government, by contrast, estimates the possibility of an earthquake that size striking the capital at 70% in the next three decades. The warning comes less than a year after a magnitude-9 earthquake off the country&apos;s north-east coast triggered a tsunami that left about 23,000 people dead or missing. The 11 March earthquake \u2013 the biggest in recorded history in Japan \u2013 and the tsunami that followed also triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents. Although newer buildings in Tokyo are built to withstand powerful earthquakes, a large quake in the city has the potential to cause widespread damage. According to the government, a magnitude-7.3 earthquake would kill about 5,600 people, injure 159,000 and destroy 850,000 buildings. Shinichi Sakai, an associate professor at the earthquake research institute, said that chances of a magnitude-7 earthquake striking Tokyo had increased since 11 March. &quot;The government, individuals and corporations should make preparations for that now,&quot; he said. Using data from Japan&apos;s meteorological agency, the institute said earthquakes of up to magnitude 6 had occurred five times more frequently than in normal years since the March disaster. The increased frequency has made it more likely that &quot;the big one&quot; could strike far sooner, it said. The government said the researchers had reached their more worrying conclusion because they had used a different computer model to calculate the risks. Days before the report was released, Tatsuo Hirano, the minister in charge of the recovery from the March disaster, said he was confident Tokyo could withstand a powerful quake. &quot;Please rest assured and don&apos;t flee Tokyo,&quot; he said. Hirano cited the lack of serious damage to Tokyo&apos;s buildings and transport infrastructure on 11 March as proof the city would be able to resist a large earthquake striking directly beneath or nearby. But he added that data from multiple sources suggested there was a &quot;high probability&quot; that the city and the wider Kanto region were due for a powerful earthquake. Last year&apos;s disaster caused widespread disruption to public transport in Tokyo, leaving tens of thousands of commuters stranded and unable to contact family and friends on overloaded mobile phone networks. Japan accounts for about a fifth of the world&apos;s quakes of magnitude 6 or higher.

That is where Murray is at in the 2012 Australian Open on Wednesday, against the emerging Japanese talent, Kei Nishikori, who is playing way above his 24th seeding, and showed heart and class in dispatching Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five gruelling sets over three and a half hours in the afternoon heaton Monday. Murray took a shorter route: just 49 minutes of blazing strokeplay before the 92nd-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin surrendered to a seized-up left hip and retired without holding service once \u2013 although he broke the world No4 once in each of the two completed sets. The interest in Murray, who was 6-1, 6-1, 1-0 up, is intensified here, naturally, by the presence of Lendl, who has returned from years of anonymity and is being hounded for interviews all over Melbourne. When he sat down with the British media after the Kukushkin and Nishikori matches, he was relaxed and funny \u2013 and not a little upset with his old rival, Jim Courier. First, he expounded on where he and Murray have got to in their still fresh partnership. &quot;I wasn&apos;t hired to get Andy to the quarters,&quot; he said. &quot;We all know that. He doesn&apos;t need me to get to the quarters or semis, he&apos;s done that without me and he could do that without me again. That&apos;s not to say he&apos;s going to win.

Courier plainly has an edgy relationship with Lendl, having said on air on Monday that his reason for hooking up with Murray was &quot;a little bit more mercenary&quot; than it might appear. &quot;He hasn&apos;t been allowed to make any money from tennis for the past 15 years because he cashed in disability insurance [because of his back trouble],&quot; Courier said. &quot;That is the reason Ivan is back playing again. There are all sorts of complexities there.&quot; He tried to leaven the broadside, when he added: &quot;I think it is great that Ivan is back in our sport. I don&apos;t like it when our champions disappear and lose contact with the sport. Now he will be 20-25 weeks on the road. It is great to have him back.&quot; Well, he might be advised to steer clear of Old Stoneface for a while. &quot;That&apos;s ridiculous,&quot; was his response. &quot;Jim shouldn&apos;t be saying stuff like that. First of all it&apos;s wrong and he doesn&apos;t have the proper information. End of story.&quot; His more immediate concern is his new day job. And he will not be tinkering much with Murray&apos;s game, although there have been signs the player is keener in this tournament to attack when opportunities present themselves. &quot;Some players learn quicker than others,&quot; Lendl said. &quot;When the door is open, you have to be ready to step through it.&quot; But, he added: &quot;Obviously I have an idea how the game should be played. You asked me if that was the way I would ask Andy to play, and I said absolutely not. You have a player of this calibre, you don&apos;t do anything radical, that would be suicidal, crazy, the biggest mistake we could make. You do a little thing here, a little thing there.&quot; What he has done is take Murray away from the hubbub of Melbourne Park to the serenity of nearby Kooyong to practise. &quot;I used to do it this way at the French, over here and at Flushing [Meadows]. On any day you don&apos;t have to come here, it takes less out of you mentally and physically because nobody is tugging away at you. It&apos;s just the four or five of us [in Murray&apos;s team] there, nobody around. You can make any kind of joke with anyone you want. &quot;We just have a good time and they treat us nicely. Andy can get his physio done there, you get a really nice lunch, it&apos;s very quiet instead of being in the rushed atmosphere over here.&quot; Off the court, they recognise each other&apos;s space as well. Do they dine together? &quot;It&apos;s Andy&apos;s call. I don&apos;t want to make too many changes. Kim [Sears, his girlfriend] is here, they do their own thing for dinner. I just say to him, &apos;Let me know whenever you need me, I&apos;m here.&apos; I just go down to the food court, get something to eat and go to bed. If he doesn&apos;t need me on a day off I go off and play golf; if he needs me and wants to talk over dinner then we talk over\u00a0dinner.&quot; There could be many pleasant dinners to come if their relationship continues to prosper. Lendl is taking nothing for granted, though. If Murray beats Nishikori, the prize is a replay of last year&apos;s final against Novak Djokovic in the semis on Friday. It is a recurring nightmare he is desperate to erase. Do that, and there will be plenty of time later for laughs. Who is Kei Nishikori? The yoke upon which a developing tennis nation&apos;s hopes are carried, in the men&apos;s game at least. The 22-year-old has long since moved on from Project 45 \u2013 his plan to eclipse the career-best ranking of Shuzo Matsuoka, the Wimbledon quarter-finalist who retired in 1996 \u2013 rising to 24th in the world in November. In Melbourne this year he became the first Japanese male to be seeded at a slam, and moved into uncharted territory by reaching the last eight. Is he used to playing under pressure? Japan identifies its icons at a young age and few nations generate hype in quite the same way. Like Murray, Nishikori had celebrity bestowed upon him as a gauche teenager and the corporate world took notice. For Murray&apos;s representation, XIX Entertainment company read IMG for Nishikori \u2013 the publicity behemoths who look after Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Li Na, the only Asian slam winner. In IMG&apos;s eyes Nishikori is a commercial sure-thing. Where did he come from? Born in Shimane, one of Japan&apos;s sleepier prefectures, he began playing tennis at five. Seven years later he went through a selection process in Tokyo to win a place at Nick Bollettieri&apos;s academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he still lives. An assiduous worker, he struggled for self-belief among the tennis brats, but eventually made the transition through the Challenger Tour and on to make his World Tour debut in 2007. He won his only career title \u2013 at Delray Beach \u2013 the following year, also qualifying for Wimbledon and winning ATP newcomer of the year for 2008. Injury has hindered his progress but was a losing finalist in two Tour events last year. How well does he know Murray? Brad Gilbert, Murray&apos;s coach between 2006 and 2007, now coaches Nishikori. They have played only once \u2013 at the Shanghai Masters last October. Murray, the eventual winner, won in straight sets. Even so, Nishikori can swot up on the Scot&apos;s game with his coach Brad Gilbert, the father of a former room-mate and more significantly, Murray&apos;s coach for 16 months between 2006 and 2007. Gilbert and Murray did not get on, so this meeting could be interesting. How does he play? Tommy Haas, the veteran German player and a friend of Nishikori, describes him as &quot;a very dangerous player. He&apos;s got that &apos;Bollettieri style&apos;, with the big forehand and quick feet. He&apos;s very eager to improve and he has.&quot; Bollettieri himself goes a little further: &quot;He&apos;s a great shot-maker and a fantastic mover. What we&apos;ve worked on is getting a little more zip on his second serve so it&apos;s not attackable. I feel if he doesn&apos;t get injured, he has a darn good chance of getting into the single digits in the rankings.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He would like to see the Mexican capital exploring new technologies that are already in use elsewhere, such as incineration techniques that reduce contamination in Tokyo, and Italian methods of turning rubbish into construction materials."], "tags": ["Waste", "Mexico", "Americas", "World news", "Recycling", "Environment", "Pollution", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-24T18:12:50Z", "title": "Mexico City holds its breath as leaders look for solutions to rubbish crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/24/mexico-city-rubbish-crisis", "article": "Filem\u00f3n Olivera pays no attention to the flies buzzing around a large bag full of rotting tortillas hanging off the side of the rubbish truck he is driving. What he finds hard to stomach is the queueing that has become a central part of his job since Mexico City&apos;s rubbish crisis began about a month ago. &quot;Queues, queues and more queues,&quot; he scoffs, glancing at the long queue of trucks waiting to empty their loads into larger trailers before heading back to the barrios to clean up the illegal dumps that spring back up on street corners almost as soon as they have been removed. &quot;How are we supposed to provide a proper collection service if we spend all day queueing?&quot; The crisis was triggered by the closure of the Bordo Poniente, the huge landfill on the edge of the city that used to receive almost all the rubbish collected in the city centre. This left the local authority struggling to find new places to take 12,000 tonnes of waste a day. The demise of the Bordo Poniente exposed how acutely the Mexican capital is struggling with the challenge of moving from a chaotic refuse collection system to more modern waste management. While Buenos Aires and Bogot\u00e1 receive regular praise for their efforts to generate less rubbish and recycle more, Mexico City is held up as an example of what not to do. &quot;They are just improvising solutions in an emergency,&quot; said a leading Mexican activist, Gustavo Alanis, of the Mexican environmental law centre. &quot;They could have prepared for this but they didn&apos;t.&quot; Situated on a dried-out lake bed, the Bordo Poniente was opened to receive rubble from the earthquake that devastated the capital in 1985. By the turn of the century it was nearing bursting point with experts warning that the accumulated weight of the refuse (currently estimated at 76m tonnes) carried with it the risk of collapse and serious contamination of the underground aquifer that provides most of the capital&apos;s water. The federal government, which administers the site, ordered its closure in 2005 but the city government managed to postpone this until the end of 2011. It was shut down on 19 December. Since then hurriedly negotiated deals have allowed the city to send the waste to four smaller privately run sites in the neighbouring state, but the fact that these are several hours&apos; drive away has caused major disruption of collection in the city, where mounds of waste are left beside lamp-posts. One of these alternative dumps was closed down for nearly two weeks after protests by residents who objected to convoys of lorries trundling through their neighbourhoods, often leaking unidentifiable liquids as they went. The situation has since begun to settle down, but the underlying problems remain. &quot;The new sites are small and will soon fill up and we will be back to where we started from with fewer options,&quot; said V\u00edctor Lichtinger, a former environment minister. He would like to see the Mexican capital exploring new technologies that are already in use elsewhere, such as incineration techniques that reduce contamination in Tokyo, and Italian methods of turning rubbish into construction materials. So far the innovation in Mexico City boils down to a relatively successful effort started last year to encourage residents to separate organic and inorganic rubbish, and a plan to set up a biogas plant at the Bordo Poniente. While some activists blame a lack of drive to push through environmental improvements, others point to the state&apos;s limited control in a sector where most refuse workers are more dependent on tips from residents than their miserable salaries. The little recycling that takes place is rather basic but much of it is controlled by mafia-style bosses. Sitting in an old car seat surrounded by mountains of plastic bags full of sorted-out refuse, Guadalupe Apaseo, who is employed by one of those bosses, cannot imagine a time when this might change. &quot;Rubbish,&quot; he muses, after getting some cash out of his sock to pay a young man for 150kg of old files. &quot;The authorities would like to control it, but they can&apos;t.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Will children in a local primary school whose classes have been renamed such as &quot;Helsinki&quot; &quot;Tokyo&quot; and &quot;Beijing&quot; really find fulfilling work in or around that future creative hub rather than drifting into the jobless void that will otherwise await too many of them?"], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2012-01-24T18:40:00Z", "title": "Olympics: jobs for the locals?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jan/24/olympic-park-press-broadcast-centres-unemployment", "article": "Among the several Olympic boosterism buzzwords &quot;convergence&quot; and &quot;opportunity&quot; resonate louder than most. The first refers to the grand aspiration of elevating the economic condition of down-at-heel east London to the level of the fancy pants west. The second urges Londoners that both the games themselves and their long legacy of urban renewal offer chances to do things that would otherwise not have been possible. Are these words of the weasel type or do their promises ring true? Last week&apos;s announcement of a shortlist of bids to occupy the Olympic Park&apos;s neighbouring press and broadcast centres has done much to allay fears that those two large buildings, constructed with the needs of journalists in mind, would fail to be converted into the promised pulsing hotbeds of innovative economic activity after the hacks have returned to their various homes.  Crudely put, the three contenders respectively offer sporty stuff, techy stuff and Ab Fab-by stuff, each meeting the requirement that they be &quot;focused on the creation of thousands of jobs and training opportunities,&quot; according to Olympic Park Legacy Company chief executive Andrew Altman. The bids have also inspired the following from Hackney&apos;s executive mayor Jules Pipe:   Hackney Council looks forward to working closely with the Legacy Company and the three shortlisted bidders to establish which bid best aligns with the Council&apos;s long-held aspirations for this location. The tenancy of these buildings represents the greatest chance for a sustainable employment legacy from the Games and we want to make sure that the successful bidder fulfills that promise by providing a full range of high quality jobs, from entry level to highly-skilled specialist roles.  Not long ago, Pipe was among those gnawing the negotiating table with frustration over the BBC&apos;s decision not to relocate the EastEnders production operation to within walking distance of Walford itself. No wonder he&apos;s cheered up. But will his long-term aspirations end up truly aligned or will they somehow slither out of place? Will &quot;convergence&quot; happen? Will &quot;opportunity&quot; be created and seized?  The Council is urging residents to seize the short-term moment by applying for jobs in and around the Olympic park during games time. There are vacancies in catering, hospitality, cleaning, retail and security all paying at least the London Living Wage of \u00a38.30 an hour and employment advisers have been supplied to help. But the longer term will be a fuller test of the regeneration goals of the whole Olympics adventure. I live in east Hackney, not far from the park. From an upstairs window I can see the Orbit&apos;s tip. I can run there and back in less than an hour. Yet the psychological distance often seems greater than the geographical one.  Although I detect a bit more affluence in my part of the borough compared with when I moved in 20 years ago, it&apos;s still an area of high unemployment. Will children in a local primary school whose classes have been renamed such as &quot;Helsinki&quot; &quot;Tokyo&quot; and &quot;Beijing&quot; really find fulfilling work in or around that future creative hub rather than drifting into the jobless void that will otherwise await too many of them? My scepticism and my optimism fight it out.

Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought \u2013 and several thousand gave their lives. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made theUnited States safer and more respected around the world. For thefirst time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat tothis country. Most of al Qaeda&apos;s top lieutenants have been defeated.The Taliban&apos;s momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, andteamwork of America&apos;s Armed Forces. At a time when too many of ourinstitutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They&apos;renot consumed with personal ambition. They don&apos;t obsess over theirdifferences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Thinkabout the America within our reach: A country that leads the world ineducating its people. An America that attracts a new generation ofhigh-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we&apos;re incontrol of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren&apos;t sotied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, wherehard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. We can do this. I know we can, because we&apos;ve done it before. At theend of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned homefrom combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class theworld has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton&apos;s Army, gotthe chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, whoworked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turnedout the best products on Earth. The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphedover a depression and fascism. They understood they were part ofsomething larger; that they were contributing to a story of successthat every American had a chance to share \u2013 the basic American promisethat if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family,own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away forretirement. The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. Nochallenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can eithersettle for a country where a shrinking number of people do reallywell, while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we canrestore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone doestheir fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What&apos;sat stake are not Democratic values or Republican values, but Americanvalues. We have to reclaim them. Let&apos;s remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs andmanufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businessesmore efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the topsaw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworkingAmericans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks thatweren&apos;t, and personal debt that kept piling up. In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages hadbeen sold to people who couldn&apos;t afford or understand them. Banks hadmade huge bets and bonuses with other people&apos;s money. Regulators hadlooked the other way, or didn&apos;t have the authority to stop the badbehavior. It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy intoa crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, andleft innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the sixmonths before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And welost another four million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months,businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, theycreated the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiringagain, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s.Together, we&apos;ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion.And we&apos;ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so acrisis like that never happens again. The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we&apos;ve come too far toturn back now. As long as I&apos;m President, I will work with anyone inthis chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fightobstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to thevery same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the firstplace. No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, baddebt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about howwe move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that&apos;s builtto last \u2013 an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy,skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. This blueprint begins with American manufacturing. On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge ofcollapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobsat stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, wedemanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settletheir differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure.Today, General Motors is back on top as the world&apos;s number oneautomaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major carcompany. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories.And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. Andtonight, the American auto industry is back. What&apos;s happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It canhappen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can&apos;t bring backevery job that&apos;s left our shores. But right now, it&apos;s getting moreexpensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America ismore productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me thatit now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today,for the first time in fifteen years, Master Lock&apos;s unionized plant inMilwaukee is running at full capacity. So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturingback. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to businessleaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs backto your country, and your country will do everything we can to helpyou succeed. We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get taxbreaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companiesthat choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest taxrates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So let&apos;s change it. First, if you&apos;re a business that wants tooutsource jobs, you shouldn&apos;t get a tax deduction for doing it. Thatmoney should be used to cover moving expenses for companies likeMaster Lock that decide to bring jobs home. Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fairshare of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on,every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax.And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies thatchoose to stay here and hire here. Third, if you&apos;re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger taxcut. If you&apos;re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the taxdeduction you get for making products here. And if you want torelocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town,you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training fornew workers. My message is simple. It&apos;s time to stop rewarding businesses thatship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobsright here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I&apos;ll sign themright away. We&apos;re also making it easier for American businesses to sell productsall over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S.exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements Isigned into law, we are on track to meet that goal \u2013 ahead ofschedule. Soon, there will be millions of new customers for Americangoods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be newcars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, andChicago. I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for Americanproducts. And I will not stand by when our competitors don&apos;t play bythe rules. We&apos;ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twicethe rate as the last administration \u2013 and it&apos;s made a difference.Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surgein Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It&apos;s not right whenanother country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It&apos;snot fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only becausethey&apos;re heavily subsidized. Tonight, I&apos;m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit thatwill be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countrieslike China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit orunsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should makesure that no foreign company has an advantage over Americanmanufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets likeRussia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if theplaying field is level, I promise you \u2013 America will always win. I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the UnitedStates but can&apos;t find workers with the right skills. Growingindustries in science and technology have twice as many openings as wehave workers who can do the job. Think about that \u2013 openings at atime when millions of Americans are looking for work. That&apos;s inexcusable. And we know how to fix it. Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off fromher job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory inCharlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont CommunityCollege. The company helped the college design courses in laser androbotics training. It paid Jackie&apos;s tuition, then hired her to helpoperate their plant. I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity asJackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two millionAmericans with skills that will lead directly to a job. MyAdministration has already lined up more companies that want to help.Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and communitycolleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando, and Louisville are up andrunning. Now you need to give more community colleges the resourcesthey need to become community career centers \u2013 places that teachpeople skills that local businesses are looking for right now, fromdata management to high-tech manufacturing. And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, sothat from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website,and one place to go for all the information and help they need. It&apos;stime to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system thatputs people to work. These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But toprepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills andeducation has to start earlier. For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education eachyear, we&apos;ve convinced nearly every State in the country to raise theirstandards for teaching and learning \u2013 the first time that&apos;s happenedin a generation. But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them. At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tightbudgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We knowa good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over$250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to thechild who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in thischamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of theirlives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimesdigging into their own pocket for school supplies \u2013 just to make adifference. Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the statusquo, let&apos;s offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep goodteachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grantschools flexibility: To teach with creativity and passion; to stopteaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren&apos;t helpingkids learn. We also know that when students aren&apos;t allowed to walk away from theireducation, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. Sotonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay inhigh school until they graduate or turn eighteen. When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost ofcollege. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt thancredit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates onstudent loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit westarted that saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. Andgive more young people the chance to earn their way through college bydoubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years. Of course, it&apos;s not enough for us to increase student aid. We can&apos;tjust keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we&apos;ll run out of money.States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higherpriority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to dotheir part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with agroup of college presidents who&apos;ve done just that. Some schoolsre-design courses to help students finish more quickly. Some usebetter technology. The point is, it&apos;s possible. So let me putcolleges and universities on notice: If you can&apos;t stop tuition fromgoing up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Highereducation can&apos;t be a luxury \u2013 it&apos;s an economic imperative that everyfamily in America should be able to afford. Let&apos;s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented,hardworking students in this country face another challenge: The factthat they aren&apos;t yet American citizens. Many were brought here assmall children, are American through and through, yet they live everyday with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, tostudy business and science and engineering, but as soon as they gettheir degree, we send them home to invent new products and create newjobs somewhere else. That doesn&apos;t make sense. I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegalimmigration. That&apos;s why my Administration has put more boots on theborder than ever before. That&apos;s why there are fewer illegal crossingsthan when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working oncomprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-yearpolitics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let&apos;s atleast agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want tostaff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Sendme a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I willsign it right away. You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talentand ingenuity of every person in this country. That means womenshould earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should supporteveryone who&apos;s willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneurwho aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most newjobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let&apos;s pass anagenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that preventaspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand taxrelief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating goodjobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, andget it on my desk this year. Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries takingplace in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead tonew treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy onesuntouched. New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stopany bullet. Don&apos;t gut these investments in our budget. Don&apos;t letother countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind ofresearch and innovation that led to the computer chip and theInternet; to new American jobs and new American industries. Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-madeenergy. Over the last three years, we&apos;ve opened millions of new acresfor oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I&apos;m directing myAdministration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshoreoil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is thehighest that it&apos;s been in eight years. That&apos;s right \u2013 eight years.Not only that \u2013 last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in anyof the past sixteen years. But with only 2 percent of the world&apos;s oil reserves, oil isn&apos;t enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy thatdevelops every available source of American energy \u2013 a strategy that&apos;scleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly onehundred years, and my Administration will take every possible actionto safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support morethan 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I&apos;m requiring allcompanies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicalsthey use. America will develop this resource without putting thehealth and safety of our citizens at risk. The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks andfactories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don&apos;t have tochoose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, itwas public research dollars, over the course of thirty years, thathelped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out ofshale rock \u2013 reminding us that Government support is critical inhelping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. What&apos;s true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years,our partnership with the private sector has already positioned Americato be the world&apos;s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearlydoubled. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, hesaid he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer inMichigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.Today, it&apos;s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, &quot;I&apos;m proud to beworking in the industry of the future.&quot; Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on thesepublic investments don&apos;t always come right away. Some technologiesdon&apos;t pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from thepromise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers likeBryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to Chinaor Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. Wehave subsidized oil companies for a century. That&apos;s long enough.It&apos;s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that&apos;s rarelybeen more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industrythat&apos;s never been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits andcreate these jobs. We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. Thedifferences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass acomprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there&apos;s no reason whyCongress shouldn&apos;t at least set a clean energy standard that creates amarket for innovation. So far, you haven&apos;t acted. Well tonight, Iwill. I&apos;m directing my Administration to allow the development ofclean energy on enough public land to power three million homes. AndI&apos;m proud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world&apos;slargest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitmentsto clean energy in history \u2013 with the Navy purchasing enough capacityto power a quarter of a million homes a year. Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. Sohere&apos;s another proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste intheir factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade theirbuildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over thenext decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing,and more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a billthat creates these jobs. Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broaderagenda to repair America&apos;s infrastructure. So much of America needsto be rebuilt. We&apos;ve got crumbling roads and bridges. A power gridthat wastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadbandnetwork that prevents a small business owner in rural America fromselling her products all over the world. During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and theGolden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States witha system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrationsinvested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workerswho built them to the businesses that still use them today. In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing awaythe red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But youneed to fund these projects. Take the money we&apos;re no longer spendingat war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to dosome nation-building right here at home. There&apos;s never been a better time to build, especially since theconstruction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housingbubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren&apos;t the only oneshurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who&apos;ve seen their homevalues decline. And while Government can&apos;t fix the problem on itsown, responsible homeowners shouldn&apos;t have to sit and wait for thehousing market to hit bottom to get some relief. That&apos;s why I&apos;m sending this Congress a plan that gives everyresponsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on theirmortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No morered tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on thelargest financial institutions will ensure that it won&apos;t add to thedeficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chanceto repay a deficit of trust. Let&apos;s never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play bythe rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system thatdo the same. It&apos;s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom:No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to lastinsists on responsibility from everybody. We&apos;ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people whocouldn&apos;t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn&apos;t afford them.That&apos;s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsiblebehavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, orfaulty medical devices, don&apos;t destroy the free market. They make thefree market work better. There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary,or too costly. In fact, I&apos;ve approved fewer regulations in the firstthree years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did inhis. I&apos;ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don&apos;tmake sense. We&apos;ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just afraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billionover the next five years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years agothat could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a yearproving that they could contain a spill \u2013 because milk was somehowclassified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worthcrying over spilled milk. I&apos;m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federalagency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down frommaking sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw inthe Gulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kidsfrom mercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and ourwater is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurancecompanies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny youcoverage, or charge women differently from men. And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed toplay by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore whatshould be any financial system&apos;s core purpose: Getting funding toentrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsiblefamilies who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid tocollege. So if you&apos;re a big bank or financial institution, you are no longerallowed to make risky bets with your customers&apos; deposits. You&apos;rerequired to write out a &quot;living will&quot; that details exactly how you&apos;llpay the bills if you fail \u2013 because the rest of us aren&apos;t bailing youout ever again. And if you&apos;re a mortgage lender or a payday lender ora credit card company, the days of signing people up for products theycan&apos;t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over.Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordraywith one job: To look out for them. We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trainedinvestigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people&apos;sinvestments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud lawsbecause there&apos;s no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That&apos;sbad for consumers, and it&apos;s bad for the vast majority of bankers andfinancial service professionals who do the right thing. So passlegislation that makes the penalties for fraud count. And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unitof federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expandour investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of riskymortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will holdaccountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners,and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so manyAmericans. A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibilitywill help us protect our people and our economy. But it should alsoguide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. Peoplecannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There areplenty of ways to get this done. So let&apos;s agree right here, rightnow: No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut withoutdelay. When it comes to the deficit, we&apos;ve already agreed to more than $2trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that meansmaking choices. Right now, we&apos;re poised to spend nearly $1 trillionmore on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for thewealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholesand shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lowertax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, WarrenBuffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or dowe want to keep our investments in everything else \u2013 like educationand medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans?Because if we&apos;re serious about paying down our debt, we can&apos;t do both. The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As Itold the Speaker this summer, I&apos;m prepared to make more reforms thatrein in the long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthenSocial Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee ofsecurity for seniors. But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me,and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. Andmy Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stopsubsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you&apos;re earning a milliondollars a year, you shouldn&apos;t get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percentof American families, your taxes shouldn&apos;t go up. You&apos;re the onesstruggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You&apos;re the ones whoneed relief. Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking abillionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? MostAmericans would call that common sense. We don&apos;t begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it.When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes,it&apos;s not because they envy the rich. It&apos;s because they understandthat when I get tax breaks I don&apos;t need and the country can&apos;t afford,it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up thedifference \u2013 like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying toget through school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That&apos;s notright. Americans know it&apos;s not right. They know that thisgeneration&apos;s success is only possible because past generations felt aresponsibility to each other, and to their country&apos;s future, and theyknow our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense ofshared responsibility. That&apos;s how we&apos;ll reduce our deficit. That&apos;san America built to last. I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views abouttaxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party theybelong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: Nothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the yearafter that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical? The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn&apos;t comefrom events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washingtonover whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Whobenefited from that fiasco? I&apos;ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street andWall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of thecountry is at least as bad \u2013 and it seems to get worse every year. Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money inpolitics. So together, let&apos;s take some steps to fix that. Send me abill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will signit tomorrow. Let&apos;s limit any elected official from owning stocks inindustries they impact. Let&apos;s make sure people who bundle campaigncontributions for Congress can&apos;t lobby Congress, and vice versa \u2013 anidea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. Some of what&apos;s broken has to do with the way Congress does itsbusiness these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to getanything \u2013 even routine business \u2013 passed through the Senate. Neitherparty has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties shouldput an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule thatall judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up ordown vote within 90 days. The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it&apos;sinefficient, outdated and remote. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve asked this Congressto grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy sothat our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to theneeds of the American people. Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower thetemperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the twoparties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction;that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead ofbuilding consensus around common sense ideas. I&apos;m a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincolnbelieved: That Government should do for people only what they cannotdo better by themselves, and no more. That&apos;s why my education reformoffers more competition, and more control for schools and States.That&apos;s why we&apos;re getting rid of regulations that don&apos;t work. That&apos;swhy our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not aGovernment program. On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the mostabout Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, andclean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home. The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophicaldifferences this year, we can make real progress. With or withoutthis Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow.But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we acttogether, there is nothing the United States of America can&apos;t achieve. That is the lesson we&apos;ve learned from our actions abroad over the lastfew years. Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows againstour enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives whoremain are scrambling, knowing that they can&apos;t escape the reach of theUnited States of America. From this position of strength, we&apos;ve begun to wind down the war inAfghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-threethousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition toAfghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnershipwith Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacksagainst America. As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across theMiddle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana&apos;a toTripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world&apos;s longest-servingdictators \u2013 a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he isgone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soondiscover that the forces of change can&apos;t be reversed, and that humandignity can&apos;t be denied. How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But wehave a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up tothe people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate forthose values that have served our own country so well. We will standagainst violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights anddignity of all human beings \u2013 men and women; Christians, Muslims, andJews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stabledemocracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty. And we will safeguard America&apos;s own security against those whothreaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran.Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once dividedabout how to deal with Iran&apos;s nuclear program now stands as one. Theregime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced withcrippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities,this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America isdetermined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I willtake no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peacefulresolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and ifIran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin thecommunity of nations. The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Ouroldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our tiesto the Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel&apos;ssecurity has meant the closest military cooperation between our twocountries in history. We&apos;ve made it clear that America is a Pacificpower, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From thecoalitions we&apos;ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missionswe&apos;ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we&apos;ve dealt toour enemies; to the enduring power of our moral example, America isback. Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America isin decline or that our influence has waned, doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;retalking about. That&apos;s not the message we get from leaders around theworld, all of whom are eager to work with us. That&apos;s not how peoplefeel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions ofAmerica are higher than they&apos;ve been in years. Yes, the world ischanging; no, we can&apos;t control every event. But America remains theone indispensable nation in world affairs \u2013 and as long as I&apos;mPresident, I intend to keep it that way. That&apos;s why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a newdefense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in theworld, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. Tostay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent thisCongress legislation that will secure our country from the growingdanger of cyber-threats. Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniformwho defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as theyserved us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they haveearned \u2013 which is why we&apos;ve increased annual VA spending every yearI&apos;ve been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the workof rebuilding our Nation. With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new taxcredits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden haveworked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs forveterans and their families. And tonight, I&apos;m proposing a VeteransJob Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops andfirefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her. Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who&apos;ve been senthere to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you puton that uniform, it doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re black or white; Asian orLatino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. Whenyou&apos;re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you,or the mission fails. When you&apos;re in the thick of the fight, you riseor fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind. One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team tookwith them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of theirnames. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But thatdoesn&apos;t matter. Just like it didn&apos;t matter that day in the SituationRoom, when I sat next to Bob Gates \u2013 a man who was George Bush&apos;sdefense secretary; and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me forpresident. All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought aboutpolitics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young meninvolved in the raid later told me that he didn&apos;t deserve credit forthe mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single memberof that unit did their job \u2013 the pilot who landed the helicopter thatspun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering thecompound; the troops who separated the women and children from thefight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, themission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted eachother \u2013 because you can&apos;t charge up those stairs, into darkness anddanger, unless you know that there&apos;s someone behind you, watching yourback. So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I&apos;m remindedthat our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and thosethirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. ThisNation is great because we built it together. This Nation is greatbecause we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get eachother&apos;s backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment oftrial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As longas we&apos;re joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our commonresolve, our journey moves forward, our future is hopeful, and thestate of our Union will always be strong. Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Their time of growth [from consoles] is over, and, while I don&apos;t think the company will cease to exist, if they don&apos;t move into new categories, they will no doubt lose the great scale they&apos;ve amassed,&quot; said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Nintendo", "Wii", "3DS", "Games", "Smartphones", "Technology sector", "Quarterly results", "Technology", "Business", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-26T17:12:49Z", "title": "Nintendo profits fall sharply as smartphones eat into console market", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/26/nintendo-profits-fall", "article": "Nintendo posted a sharp drop in quarterly profit and forecast a bigger-than-expected full-year loss as its dedicated games consoles lost ground to smart devices such as Apple&apos;s iPhone. The creator of the Super Mario and Pokemon franchises dominated the videogames industry for years with its DS handheld devices and Wii home consoles, but is now struggling to keep up as sales of more versatile smartphones and tablets boom. &quot;To say that [the days of consoles] are over is likely an overstatement, but social-network and internet-delivered games are growing and structurally changing the future of the industry, which is a strong wind against Nintendo,&quot; said Shigeo Sugawara, senior investment manager at asset managers Sompo Japan Nipponkoa. Nintendo, whose exports have also been hit by the strong yen, now expects an annual operating loss \u2013 its first ever \u2013 of \u00a545bn (\u00a3370m), dwarfing analysts&apos; expectations of a \u00a54.2bn loss. &quot;Their time of growth [from consoles] is over, and, while I don&apos;t think the company will cease to exist, if they don&apos;t move into new categories, they will no doubt lose the great scale they&apos;ve amassed,&quot; said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo. Nintendo cut its forecast for annual sales of its ageing Wii console to 10m devices from 12m, and for the 3DS handheld device to 14m from 16m. Some of the company&apos;s own-brand games for the 3DS, such as Super Mario 3D Land, have become million sellers, but games from other publishers did not fare as well, Nintendo reported. &quot;We had higher expectations for the year-end season, but failed to meet them,&quot; the company&apos;s president, Satoru Iwata, said. Poor sales forced Nintendo to slash the price of the much-anticipated 3DS in August, just six months after its launch. The move ended its record of making profits on its hardware as well as its software, a business model that had taken operating profit to a high of \u00a5555bn in 2008-09. The motion-controlled Wii console now also faces tougher competition in its market from rival motion-sensing systems such as Sony&apos;s Move and Microsoft&apos;s Kinect, and Iwata said consumers were more eager than ever to seek out bargains in the harsh economic environment. The company plans to launch the Wii&apos;s successor, the Wii U, in Japan, the US, Europe and Australia at the end of the year, Iwata told reporters. But with other threats emerging, Nintendo may have trouble generating excitement about its new product, some analysts say. Google is taking steps into gaming with Google TV, while Apple is thought to be preparing a new iPad and possibly a smart TV that could transform the industry. &quot;We think we need to consider the possibility that home consoles could become a thing of the past,&quot; Citigroup analyst Soichiro Fukuda wrote in a recent report. &quot;We think the direction taken by marketing trendsetter Apple will be very important and we will be watching the company&apos;s announcements at future events with interest.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Poland&apos;s ambassador to Japan, Jadwiga Rodowicz-Czechowska, signed the agreement in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Acta", "Internet", "Technology", "Sopa", "US news", "US politics", "Intellectual property", "Anonymous", "Hacking", "Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-27T09:43:20Z", "title": "Acta protests break out as EU states sign up to treaty", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/27/acta-protests-eu-states-sign-treaty", "article": "The UK and 21 other European Union member states on Thursday signed an international copyright agreement treaty called Acta (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement), sparking more demonstrations by internet users who have protested for days both virtually and physically over fear it will lead to online censorship. Following the signing, protesters rallied in the Polish cities of Poznan and Lublin to express their anger over the treaty. Lawmakers for the left-wing Palikot&apos;s Movement wore masks in parliament to show their dissatisfaction, while the largest opposition party the right-wing Law and Justice party called for a referendum on the matter. The signing has yet to be ratified by the European Union parliament, and is scheduled to be debated in June. MEPs are already coming under intense pressure from activists on both sides over the forthcoming vote. Poland&apos;s ambassador to Japan, Jadwiga Rodowicz-Czechowska, signed the agreement in Tokyo. Speaking on Polish television, she said that Poland was one of several EU countries to sign Acta on Thursday, including Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Greece. Several other industrialised countries \u2013 including the US, Canada and South Korea \u2013 signed the agreement last year. Poland&apos;s support for Acta has sparked attacks on Polish government websites by the hacking collective Anonymous that left several of them unreachable off and on for days. Street protests of hundreds, and in some cases thousands of people, have broken out across Poland for the past three days. Germany, the Netherlands, Estonia, Cyprus and Slovakia did not sign on Thursday, and one French MEP quit the scrutinising process for Acta complaining that the European Parliament was participating in a &quot;charade&quot;. Acta has been significantly changed from earlier versions, removing an earlier demand that internet users found of repeatedly infringing copyright should be cut off from the web \u2013 a suggestion the EU rejected. Although the EU maintains Acta will not require any legislative changes in member countries \u2013 and instead will bring other countries up to European standards \u2013 controversy has been deepening in Poland over the proposals. While many other industrialised countries have signed it, popular outrage appears to be greater in Poland than anywhere else. Acta is a far-reaching agreement that aims to harmonise international standards on protecting the rights of those who produce music, movies, pharmaceuticals, fashion, and a range of other products that often fall victim to intellectual property theft. Acta also takes aim at the online piracy of movies and music; those opposed to it fear that it will also lead authorities to block content on the internet. A prominent Polish rock act, Zbigniew Holdys, has come out in support of Acta, accusing the internet activists \u2013 mostly young people \u2013 of profiting from pirated material online and trying to hold onto that practice. Acta shares some similarities with the hotly debated Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa) in the US, which was shelved by lawmakers last week after Wikipedia and Google blacked out or partially obscured their websites for a day in protest. In reaction to the widespread opposition, Polish leaders have been struggling to allay fears over it. Poland&apos;s Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski defended his government&apos;s position in a TV interview on Wednesday evening, arguing that Acta is not as threatening as young people fear. But he said the internet should not be allowed to become a space of &quot;legal anarchy&quot;. &quot;We believe that theft on a massive scale of intellectual property is not a good thing,&quot; Sikorski said. In the Czech Republic, a local group aligning itself with Anonymous attacked the website of a group that supports Acta. The group collects money for music production and distributes it to artists. \u2022 The UK&apos;s Intellectual Property Office has a guide to the aims of Acta"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;They do not take into account the various malfunctions that can result in a disaster, including human error and equipment failure.&quot; Hiromitsu Ino, an emeritus professor at Tokyo University and a fellow member of the nuclear safety agency advisory panel, said the tests were flawed because they had been introduced before the full facts of the Fukushima disaster were known.", "Goto and Ino said it would be impossible to appraise the causes and consequences of the Fukushima disaster unless the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, released all the relevant data that could then be used to perform a simulation."], "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Japan", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fukushima", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-27T12:36:45Z", "title": "Experts cast doubt on Japan nuclear plant tests", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/27/experts-japan-nuclear-plant-tests", "article": "Advisers to Japan&apos;s nuclear safety agency have said power plant stress tests do not prove that a nuclear plant is safe, as the country faces the prospect of a summer without a single nuclear reactor in operation. Last year, the Japanese government ordered the nuclear authorities to conduct tests on all Japan&apos;s reactors after the 11 March meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi raised questions about the safety of nuclear power, particularly in a country prone to earthquakes and tsunami. Earlier this week, a team of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began a review of the safety tests but said it was up to the Japanese government whether or not to approve the restart of idle reactors. Currently only three of Japan&apos;s 54 reactors \u2013 just over 6% of its total nuclear capacity \u2013 are in operation after the Fukushima accident forced the closure of active reactors for safety checks. The latest closure came on Friday when a reactor at a plant near the Japan Sea was shut down for inspection. Without approval for restarts, all Japan&apos;s reactors could all be shut by the end of April, boosting the use of fossil fuels and adding more than $30bn (\u00a319bn) a year to energy costs, according to a government estimate. The government is pushing for the early restart of idled reactors, fearing a power crunch in several parts of the country during the long, humid summer. Although the trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said he believed Japan would be able to cope without imposing power cuts, even if all reactors were offline by the summer. Attention is now focused on a plant in the town of Ohi, western Japan, which could be the first to resume operations since 11 March. Its operator, Kansai Electric Power, has said two of the facility&apos;s reactors are able to withstand quakes and tsunami much stronger than those predicted for the area \u2013 a view reportedly endorsed by the country&apos;s nuclear and industrial safety agency. But Masashi Goto, a former nuclear power plant designer, said the stress tests at Ohi and elsewhere were next to useless. &quot;It is a misunderstanding to believe these tests prove that a nuclear plant is safe,&quot; he said. &quot;The reality is that the inspectors only look at the reactors&apos; design and then factor in possible problems, such as earthquakes and tsunami of a certain size. &quot;They do not take into account the various malfunctions that can result in a disaster, including human error and equipment failure.&quot; Hiromitsu Ino, an emeritus professor at Tokyo University and a fellow member of the nuclear safety agency advisory panel, said the tests were flawed because they had been introduced before the full facts of the Fukushima disaster were known. &quot;The stress tests are being presented as a comprehensive survey of the safety of Japan&apos;s nuclear power plants, but the reality is very different,&quot; Ino said. &quot;They only look at potential problems in isolation, and the process of testing is exactly the same as it was before the March earthquake.&quot; No one had presented definitive evidence that the fuel meltdowns in three of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s six reactors were caused by the magnitude nine earthquake that struck north-east Japan or the 14-metre tsunami that followed it. Goto and Ino said it would be impossible to appraise the causes and consequences of the Fukushima disaster unless the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, released all the relevant data that could then be used to perform a simulation. Ino said he had little confidence in the IAEA team, which is due to present its latest report at the end of the month. &quot;I don&apos;t view their evaluation as something that is trustworthy or carries any weight,&quot; he said. &quot;The last time the IAEA inspectors came to Japan, they simply inspected sites and documents and left saying everything was fine. They submitted a flimsy report, and I fear the same will be the case this time.&quot; Japan has already abandoned plans to generate more than half its electricity supply through nuclear energy by 2030, but the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has said it needs to retain some nuclear plants until alternative sources of energy are developed."}, {"sentences": ["Among the key personnel we spoke to in Tokyo were Takashi Sogabe, the PS Vita&apos;s designer, and Shuhei Yoshida who, as worldwide studios president at Sony Computer Entertainment, is in ultimate charge of Sony&apos;s in-house game development.", "Up until a couple of days before the Tokyo Games Show, I was working on the draft of my presentation, and talking about six or seven PS Vita titles."], "tags": ["PS Vita", "Games", "PlayStation", "Technology", "Sony", "Handheld", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-27T14:42:00Z", "title": "PS Vita: the inside story", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jan/27/ps-vita-inside-story", "article": "With the PlayStation Vita&apos;s 22 February launch rapidly approaching, and review machines running many of the launch games already in the hands of journalists, Sony&apos;s next-generation handheld is now very much a known quantity \u2013 and first impressions are very good indeed. But we were lucky enough to get an unprecedented insight into how the PS Vita came into being, what shaped it and what Sony expects from it when we attended its Japanese launch in late December 2011. Among the key personnel we spoke to in Tokyo were Takashi Sogabe, the PS Vita&apos;s designer, and Shuhei Yoshida who, as worldwide studios president at Sony Computer Entertainment, is in ultimate charge of Sony&apos;s in-house game development. PS Vita design secrets Sogabe proved to be a fascinating character. A 27-year veteran at Sony, it turns out he was the man who designed an object that was the most iconic gadget of its time: the Walkman. &quot;Originally, I was given a piece of wood, and asked to create the Walkman at that size,&quot; he said. More recently, he has worked on Vaio laptops and the PSP 3000. He candidly admitted that, as with any gadget, design compromises had to be made with the PS Vita. &quot;Speaking not only about the PS Vita, we always have a battle between engineers and designers,&quot; Sogabe said. &quot;The original design of the PS Vita, for example, was very much thinner than the current retail product. From a designer&apos;s point of view, thinner is better-looking, but the engineers wanted to put all the features in. Maybe it will become thinner in the future, but the engineers would have to come up with a means to do that.&quot; Surprisingly, he singled out the seemingly prosaic dual analogue sticks as the biggest challenge when designing the PS Vita. &quot;We had been developing the idea of dual analogue sticks for a long time \u2013 the PSP used slide pads,&quot; he said. &quot;Making analogue sticks this small required very much effort on the engineering side, so we are very proud of this technology \u2013 it was very difficult to design.&quot; Regarding the Vita&apos;s similarity in appearance to the PSP, he said: &quot;We like that you think it looks similar, because we wanted to keep the identity of the PSP, but to evolve the design and brush it up. We came up with various patterns, including a clamshell one. Then we discussed it with a lot of publishers and settled on this shape.&quot; Finally, Sogabe raised the tantalising prospect that one of the PS Vita&apos;s most highly praised aspects, its 5in AMOLED touch-screen, could have been even bigger. &quot;The PSP had a 4.3in screen, but we knew the PS Vita would have a higher resolution,&quot; he said. &quot;So a 4.3in screen would have less impact than if the screen was bigger. There was a lot of discussion, and we came up with five inches as being best. We also had an idea to make a 5.5in screen, but we had to think about operability, as it is a portable device.&quot; Yoshida: keeping the Vita games flowing Shuhei Yoshida is Sony Computer Entertainment&apos;s man in charge when it comes to first-party games the company publishes on all platforms. He is refreshingly willing to admit past mistakes and detail attempts not to repeat them, rather than retreating under the comfort blanket of the party line. He admitted, for instance, that the PSP suffered through launching just a year before the PS3. &quot;The jump from the PS2 to the PS3 was a huge challenge, so we had to increase the resources of all the teams moving from PS2 to PS3. There was a lot of staffing going on for the PS3, and unfortunately, that happened just after the launch of the PSP. &quot;But that&apos;s not happening this time around. PS3 is selling very well, so we have a stable platform there, and now we are adding the PS Vita, we are, of course, shifting some resources around from PSP development. So compared to the rampup challenge that we had working with the PSP and PS3, we are in much better shape. And of course, we have increased the overall resources from five or six years ago.&quot; He was heartened that third-party publishers seem to have embraced the PS Vita, professing surprise that there will be as many as 33 games available at the UK launch: &quot;I had no idea there were so many games targeted by third parties. Up until a couple of days before the Tokyo Games Show, I was working on the draft of my presentation, and talking about six or seven PS Vita titles. &quot;Then I looked and said: &apos;What? Are you sure that&apos;s for the launch, rather than the launch window?&apos; As far as first-party games are concerned, we have many in the pipeline. So we are strategically spreading them out so that there will be a constant supply, because we don&apos;t have control over when third-party titles are released \u2013 sometimes we have to fill in the gaps with our titles.&quot; AR comes of age Yoshida also hinted that, in some respects, Sony is keeping the PS Vita&apos;s powder dry. He showed a demo of so-called Markerless Augmented Reality in which, by merely pointing the PS Vita at the packaging of Everybody&apos;s Golf, one of the game&apos;s cartoon-style characters magically appeared. He reckons the PS Vita will be the first machine to bring some credibility to AR: &quot;We&apos;ve been doing AR with PSP, with things like Invizimals, which uses one card,&quot; he said. &quot;That was very cute and nice, especially for kids, but when you actually play it, it&apos;s very easy to lose sight of the card, then the character disappears. But using multiple cards, it&apos;s very difficult to lose all the cards. &quot;If the PS Vita only sees two or three out of six, for example, it remembers where the other cards are in relation to those ones. So you get a very consistent, robust games experience. As far as we are concerned, the AR in PSP was a good start but the AR in the PS Vita has way, way more potential. We have some very cool ideas about how to get our AR cards in the hands of consumers.&quot; Cross-play rivals the Wii U     PlayStation Vita ... Sony has an impressive lineup of launch titles    Plus, Yoshida said, there are other technological aspects of the PS Vita that Sony has so far been keeping a lid on, or at least not showing in their full glory, such as cross-play, the ability to link up for online gaming with the PS3. &quot;There are many different styles of connectivity,&quot; he said. &quot;With Wipeout 2048, for example, you have real-time network play: that&apos;s one example of cross-play. With LittleBigPlanet, there is a slightly more involved style of connectivity. It hasn&apos;t necessarily been publicised, but what we are talking about is that any character or item that you have on PS3, you can download and use on the PS Vita version. &quot;There&apos;s more in development, but you&apos;ll have to wait a bit before we show it. One of the tech-demos that we showed at TGS was using PS Vita as a controller for PS3, and we used LittleBigPlanet as an example. So that kind of thing is very exciting.&quot; And it also sounds very similar to what Nintendo is doing with the Wii U: &quot;When Nintendo announced Wii U, we were kind of surprised, because we&apos;ve been doing that sort of similar tech using PS3 and PSP. We can render PS3 images through a network to PSP. I understand that Wii U works similarly \u2013 the console renders images to the portable. &quot;So it was very natural for us to extend it and enhance it for PS Vita, because PS Vita has a much better screen, is more powerful and the connectivity speed is much better than PSP. This is something we&apos;d like to maintain for the future. There are so many things that PS Vita can do, but let&apos;s not try to cram everything into the launch period.&quot; Changing practices Finally, Yoshida went into some detail about how Sony has worked hard to get the all-important third-party developer community onside to a much greater extent than it was in the early days of the PS and PS3. &quot;The company has changed. When Kaz Hirai took over, he demanded that the hardware team integrate with our studio teams, specifically for the process of developing the hardware,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually, we have many of our tech groups in our studio working on the software SDK for the PS Vita. And some of the SDKs were developed by our internal studio teams, because they know games better. We talked about how difficult it was to get hold of PS3 devkits early \u2013 part of the problem was that they were gigantic machines, very intimidating, noisy and hot. &quot;But because we were involved with designing the hardware for Vita, our teams managed to make the devkit very small, like the actual Vita. That was a challenge for the hardware team, and they did a great job. Vita has many unique UIs and, if you remember the PSP devkit had a very thick cable.&quot; So, is that new philosophy one that Sony is carrying forwards for the PlayStation 4? &quot;I don&apos;t know what you are talking about. We are still very excited by the PlayStation 3.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["And Shanghai will vie with Tokyo and S\u00e3o Paulo for trophies such as the Olympics, the headquarters of international institutions and other wonders, just as its ancient counterparts did."], "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-27T22:55:00Z", "title": "Cities of the Classical World by Colin McEvedy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/27/cities-classical-world-colin-mcevedy-review", "article": "What makes a city? A simple mass of people, a great temple, a hub of learning, trade or transport? Colin McEvedy&apos;s idiosyncratic book, a survey of 120 &quot;centres of ancient civilisation&quot;, doesn&apos;t ask the question, but unwittingly suggests some answers. In doing so, it tells us almost as much about contemporary urban life as it does about the distant past. An incomplete catalogue of every city of significance in the Roman and Mesopotamian worlds, it takes in backwaters and glittering capitals from Lincoln to Lyons to Alexandria. The author was an intriguing character who, as well as being a psychiatrist at Ealing hospital, was a historian, demographer and armchair archaeologist, and had yet to finish his magnum opus when he died in 2005. This book represents the efforts of his family and editors to collect what had already been written \u2013 and sketched out, for the mapmaking was an important part of the project \u2013 and present it in something like the form he intended. The result is a genially written encyclopedia, with each entry telling us something of the history, topography and size of the city concerned. McEvedy&apos;s particular obsessions are threaded through the book \u2013 he jousts with other scholars over population estimates \u2013 but he has a light enough touch that the prose is always readable. The maps that accompany the entries are all done to the same scale, making it possible to compare, say, the vastness of Alexandria, whose walls enclosed an area of more than 1,000 hectares, to puny, 65-hectare Pompeii. Though well-executed, they&apos;re a bit too reminiscent of diagrams in geography textbooks, passing up the opportunity for something more gorgeous. The stories of the rise and fall of each city are dealt with matter-of-factly. Some clung on to rise again in modern times, others disappeared practically without a trace. You can almost hear the sands sweeping over deserted forums as McEvedy points to a lack of adequate defences or silted-up harbours before moving on to the next. The main reason most of these settlements failed was the decline in prosperity and effective political organisation as the Romans retreated. This did for most of the northern towns they created or made flourish. In the east, dynastic squabbles and changes in patronage were as often the agents of urban decay. Memphis gave way to Alexandria as the Greeks stamped their rule on Egypt; Babylon to Seleucia on the Tigris under similar circumstances. Seleucia in turn was abandoned by the Parthians in favour of Ctesiphon. At the time, Paris and London, even Jerusalem, were poor and ramshackle. Carthage, Ephesus and Antioch were the jewels of the age, drawing to them peoples from across the Mediterranean, enriching themselves and building great public works. They didn&apos;t, of course, make it through the sieve of history (though modern Antioch, Antakya, is a medium-sized Turkish city). Those that did survive have a very different face today: most of McEvedy&apos;s cities had a population of around 10,000. Ancient Rome and Alexandria may have reached 250,000, but that is only the size of modern Wolverhampton. In the 21st century, London&apos;s population laps up against the eight million mark, which is still ten million less than Shanghai. Is there any meaningful sense in which these seas of people are &quot;cities&quot;? What is the relationship between Seleucia and Los Angeles? Ironically, given his fixation with it, what McEvedy shows us is that it&apos;s a mistake to get too hung up on population. The places he deals with were tiny by modern standards, but loom large in the imagination, suggesting that the idea of a city may be more important than its physical properties. And beyond a certain minimum level of civic pride expressed in stone or steel or glass, the essence of a city lies in its relationship to a hinterland and to other cities. Shanghai could well be to a Chinese villager what Rome was to an Etruscan farmer: a centre of wealth, power and spectacle. And Shanghai will vie with Tokyo and S\u00e3o Paulo for trophies such as the Olympics, the headquarters of international institutions and other wonders, just as its ancient counterparts did. There&apos;s another lesson, of course, in McEvedy&apos;s work: cities have a lifespan. Only a lucky few pass through that historical sieve. In the ancient world, they thrived for perhaps 1,000 years before falling into ruin.

The film, telling the romantic story of a Havana piano player and a beautiful singer separated by time and circumstance, has all the ingredients for a stage show, including a successful soundtrack by the late-flowering Cuban musician Bebo Vald\u00e9s. The film also features music from Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Tito Puente and Thelonious Monk, and is set in the late-1940s period when the New York jazz scene began to absorb immigrant percussionists from Havana&apos;s nightclub scene such as Chano Pozo. The film, produced on the Isle of Man by CinemaNX and directed by Fernando Trueba and Javier Mariscal, has already won a European film award for best animation and the producers believe it has just as big a chance of success in the world&apos;s theatres. &quot;It was the music that attracted us in the first place,&quot; says Steve Christian of CinemaNX. &quot;It&apos;s full of colour and soul, set against an infectious backdrop, and the story is so timeless and romantic that we always spotted potential for a theatre play.

Following last year&apos;s nod for Waste Land, about Brazilian landfill site Jardim Gramacho, Walker has been nominated once more for her film The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom, this time in the documentary short category. She is credited and nominated with Kira Carstensen for the 38-minute film, a work that Walker has referred to as a &quot;visual haiku&quot;. Walker travelled to Japan shortly after last year&apos;s Oscars, after the tsunami hit on 11 March. She conducted interviews with survivors just as the cherry trees were coming into blossom, providing a beautiful metaphor for survival and the ephemeral life cycle.

Eiko Ishioka in 2010. She combined wild imagination and rigorous discipline. Photograph: John Lamparski/WireImage    Her father, a graphic designer, encouraged her childhood art work, but discouraged her ambition at Tokyo University to follow him into the business: Japanese graphic art was a male world, women did not have the ruthlessness. Ishioka did, and she knew it. She had to slip in via a female route, working in the 60s in the ad division of the cosmetics company Shiseido, which had led graphic imagery in Japan since it had promoted the &quot;moga&quot; (short for &quot;modern girl&quot;) in the 1920s. Shiseido girls were not ever that modern; they were brought up, as Ishioka said, &quot;to listen rather than speak&quot;, and for preference were doll-tiny. Ishioka radically proposed big, strong and even bad women, and got away with it. She opened her own agency in the early 70s, personally acting as creative advertising director for major clients, notably the sophisticated boutique chain Parco, which, Biba-like, sold lifestyle as much as products, a novel idea in Japan, and a liberating brief for Ishioka, who stressed sex to communicate with the targeted young consumers. &quot;Eroticism,&quot; she once said, &quot;is very important in attracting people&apos;s souls.&quot; Surreal sexuality with attendant nudity moved from art to advertising in international imagery in the 70s, and Ishioka pasted her take on it all over Japan in striking print and poster campaigns. Her favourite &quot;big, big, big&quot; woman \u2013 in temperament not hip measurement \u2013 was Faye Dunaway, whom she cast as an occidental dragon lady. For a Parco television commercial, Dunaway slowly peeled and ate a hardboiled egg, as little action as you&apos;d see in a noh play, and just as absorbing to watch. Later Ishioka found another muse, Bj\u00f6rk, whose early self-presentation was influenced by Ishioka&apos;s ad campaigns, and for whom Ishioka designed the 2002 video Cocoon, in which red threads extrude from the singer&apos;s nipples. After importing imagery into Japan, including photographs of very different definitions of female beauty from Morocco and India that she used in ad campaigns, Ishioka exported herself and her creativity in the 1980s. She had often designed what was worn in her campaigns (when, that is, anything was worn at all other than baby oil, red eyeshadow and attitude), and the extreme results attracted commissions from media respectful of Japan&apos;s then high status in design. The film director Paul Schrader asked her to be the production designer for his 1985 film Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters, and she produced scenic landscapes as stylised as a folding screen, winning an award at Cannes for artistic contribution. She was nominated for two Tony awards for her sets and costumes for M Butterfly on Broadway in 1988, and was Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s only choice to robe Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula, his 1992 movie &quot;opera with sex and violence&quot;, in which, he told her, &quot;the costumes are gonna be the sets&quot;. The clothes \u2013 a wedding headdress like an amphibian mating display, scarlet armour striated with sinews \u2013 were certainly more dramatic than the actors, and won Ishioka an Oscar. Whatever she was asked to do, she excelled at. She won a Grammy in 1986 for her design for Miles Davis&apos;s Tutu album, with its harsh Irving Penn portrait. She staged an Issey Miyake couture collection as an actual theatre show, selling out its pricey tickets, and her handsome books, especially Eiko by Eiko (1983), are standards in art-college libraries. If Ishioka had a problem, it was that her commissioners sometimes couldn&apos;t match her combination of wild imagination and rigorous discipline. Tarsem Singh&apos;s fantasy films The Cell (2000), The Fall (2006) and Immortals (2011) lagged behind her unique imagery, based on no known mythology. She had too much of a sense of humour for Cirque du Soleil \u2013 the funniest thing ever seen in its ring was the shocking pink octopus outfit she did for its Varekai season in 2002 \u2013 but was perfectly suited to creating visuals for David Copperfield prestidigitating on Broadway in 1996, and for Grace Jones touring in 2009. Ishioka could always misdirect the eye to further an illusion, or fill a stadium, hence the Beijing Olympics gig. Whatever was wrong on the night, any night, with the 2011 Spider-Man musical on Broadway, it wasn&apos;t Ishioka&apos;s costumes, projecting superheroes as soft sculptures, very kabuki. Ishioka lived in Manhattan for decades, and her work is in its Museum of Modern Art, but she retained a base in Japan. Last year she married Nicholas Soultanakis. He survives her, along with her mother, two brothers and a sister. \u2022 Eiko Ishioka, graphic designer and art director, born 12 July 1938; died 21 January 2012"}, {"sentences": ["David Karp, the founder of the blogging platform Tumblr, was 17 when he decided to cut the apron strings and move to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Tumblr", "Digital media", "Blogging", "Media", "Technology", "Newspapers & magazines", "Internet", "YouTube", "Google", "David Karp"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-29T18:47:00Z", "title": "David Karp, founder of Tumblr, on realising his dream", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/29/tumblr-david-karp-interview", "article": "David Karp, the founder of the blogging platform Tumblr, was 17 when he decided to cut the apron strings and move to Tokyo. With a smattering of Japanese and a sharp eye for computer code, the impatient Manhattan teenager embarked on a period of self-discovery. &quot;I was holed up in the middle of this world where it was just me on the internet,&quot; Karp recalls. Within weeks, he had fine-tuned his computer skills and cooled on the idea of building robots. He wanted to be an entrepreneur. But there was one small problem: his voice. &quot;I was so silly \u2013 I tried to be very formal and put on a deep voice to clients over the phone so I didn&apos;t have to meet them and give away how young I was,&quot; he says. &quot;I lied about my age. I lied about the size of my team. I lied about my experience. I was so terribly embarassed about it for so long. I should have just owned up.&quot; Karp returned to the US with a fistful of contracts (drawn up by his father) and a list of executives&apos; ears to bend. Keeping up appearances, he set up a consultancy company \u2013 dubbed Davidville \u2013 and managed to convince Viacom and others to hire him. Now 25, Karp is at the helm of one of the internet&apos;s fastest growing startups. He founded Tumblr in 2007, aged 21, from the bedroom of his mother&apos;s apartment in New York. Often described as Twitter meets YouTube and WordPress, Tumblr lets its users curate pictures, videos and text in one place online. The site gained 75,000 users in the first fortnight, and now hosts more than 42m blogs, ranging from politics to music and pictures of &quot;Accidental Chinese hipsters&quot;. Wearing a red check shirt under a grey zip-up hoodie, the shaggy-haired Karp has all the attributes of a web wunderkind. And now his $800m-valued startup boasts investors including Virgin group chairman Sir Richard Branson. But the early days of Tumblr were not all plain sailing. &quot;I thought I could totally beat the system and have this cool product that I would never need to raise money for, I would never need to sell out, because [Tumblr] would bring all the attention to this [consultancy] business where people would ask us to build them a website,&quot; he says. And it worked \u2013 for a few months. Karp kept up his consultancy gig until Tumblr began doubling its number of users every few weeks. &quot;Our clients eventually got more and more pissed off because I wasn&apos;t returning their calls and at that point I was just totally fucking it up. Clearly they could see Tumblr was my one and only and they were getting shafted.&quot; It was time for Karp and Tumblr to grow up. Investors were circling, but Karp&apos;s youthful defiance prevented the internet firm being shipped across to the startup factory of Silicon Valley. Karp did sell 25% of his one-year-old company as part of a $4.5m funding round from Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital in late 2008. But he repeatedly turned down offers to move the company to the &quot;hyper-competitive&quot; West Coast, where he says entrepreneurs spend their time worrying whether Apple, Google or Facebook are going to steal their most talented engineers. New York is a more supportive city for startups, Karp argues, even if it does not have the obvious allure of Silicon Valley. Tumblr is worth a fraction of Facebook&apos;s $100bn price tag, but Karp is relaxed about its growth. Only last year, he says, he could see the computer screen of every Tumblr employee in its New York office. Now the company operates on two floors and is nearing 100 staff. &quot;The real threshold was last year,&quot; he says. &quot;For a long time I did not want to be [employing] more than a dozen people.&quot; The key driver of Tumblr is its meritocratic network of bloggers. Big names such as Lady Gaga and Barack Obama give the site some celebrity lustre, but the creativity is found in its most dedicated users. Photographers, designers and musicians can be followed, liked and &quot;reblogged&quot; \u2013 and 85% of Tumblr users post more than 20 times a month on average. In conversation, Karp could evangelise on the force of creativity for hours. At times he will suddenly pause, before retracing his steps and continuing with animated zeal. Karp says he loves Twitter, is lukewarm on Google+ (&quot;I don&apos;t see any tools for creativity in there&quot;) and is not the biggest fan of Facebook &quot;as a product&quot;. And YouTube? &quot;The only real tools for expression these days are YouTube, which turns my stomach,&quot; he says. &quot;They take your creative works \u2013 your film that you poured hours and hours of energy into \u2013 and they put ads on top of it. They make it as gross an experience to watch your film as possible. I&apos;m sure it will contribute to Google&apos;s bottom line; I&apos;m not sure it will inspire any creators.&quot; No doubt Google would disagree, arguing that a significant chunk of the 60 hours of video uploaded to the site each minute \u2013 an increase of 30% in the last three months \u2013 contains or inspires some form of originality. But Karp is unconvinced. YouTube, he says, &quot;was the opportunity to tell every aspiring filmmaker that if they worked really hard and really went for quality they could create great stuff. The stuff YouTube is incentivising is: build a huge subscriber base, put out a lot of videos, do the math and get as big a cheque as possible.&quot; Google recently did the math and found that YouTube pulls in about 4bn views a day \u2013 and has now boosted promotion of its &quot;Partner&quot; programme in a bid to increase the quality of videos. &quot;YouTube offers the opportunity but they sacrifice the tools in such a major way now,&quot; Karp continues. &quot;YouTube is one of the most amazing creative tools in the world and I think it&apos;s gotten a lot worse for creators.&quot; No doubt the point is that Tumblr can close the gap. Like many of the hottest internet firms, Tumblr has no proven business model. The company&apos;s &quot;lack of revenue&quot; prevented some major Silicon Valley venture capital firms from participating in its latest $85m funding round in September last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. John Maloney, the president of Tumblr, who is the business foil to Karp&apos;s user-led brain, indicated in a recent interview that the company needs to attract &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; more subscribers on its route to profitability. For his part, Karp describes technology journalism&apos;s obsession with funding as &quot;turpitudal&quot; and insists his company is not in a financial arms race with Facebook, Twitter or other internet sites. Nor is Tumblr about to be acquired by a multinational media firm, he says. In 2008, when Karp became $750,000 richer by virtue of selling a 25% stake in the firm, the fresh-faced founder laid his intentions bare. &quot;We would really rather not be gobbled up by a big media company,&quot; he spat, in an interview with the New York Observer. Unlike most other hot internet companies, Tumblr has not been plagued by buyout rumours \u2013 but that does not mean there have been no offers. Four years on, is Karp still adamant? &quot;We were constantly tested along the way,&quot; he admits. &quot;Particularly in the first three years, there were a lot of [mergers and acquisitions] people who would pull you aside and you&apos;d think &apos;Well, shit, I could be a pretty rich 23-year-old with very little effort&apos;&quot;. But he held firm. &quot;We stuck it out. I won&apos;t say I really knew why.&quot; Sat in the half-lit bar of a hotel in London&apos;s West End, Karp becomes introspective. &quot;There are a lot of rich people in the world. There are very few people who have the privilege of getting to invent things that billions of people use,&quot; he says, adding: &quot;The joke now is what&apos;s the first tech company that we acquire. I hear AOL&apos;s going pretty cheap.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,&quot; Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement."], "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fukushima", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-01-31T08:15:07Z", "title": "IAEA approves stress tests on Japan reactors", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/31/iaea-approves-tests-japan-reactors", "article": "Japan&apos;s attempts to restart nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident were boosted after UN inspectors gave their backing to stress tests designed to confirm the reactors&apos; safety. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said the reactor assessments were &quot;generally consistent&quot; with the body&apos;s own safety standards, despite concern among some experts that the tests are flawed. The IAEA&apos;s upbeat appraisal was expected, and does not guarantee that Japan&apos;s nuclear authorities will be able to put reactors back into service amid growing opposition from host communities in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The team arrived in Japan nine days ago at the invitation of the Japanese government to review stress tests being conducted by the country&apos;s industrial and nuclear safety agency (Nisa). The tests, in which computer simulations are used to gauge the reactors&apos; ability to withstand severe events such as earthquakes and tsunami, were ordered after a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March unleashed large amounts of radiation into the environment. The accident, the worst involving nuclear power since Chernobyl 25 years ago, forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the plant. Almost a year on from the disaster, none of the residents has been allowed to return home; some have been warned their old neighbourhoods may remain uninhabitable for years. James Lyons, the leader of the 10-member IAEA team, said: &quot;We concluded that Nisa&apos;s instructions to power plants and its review process for the comprehensive safety assessments are generally consistent with IAEA safety standards.&quot; Nisa officials said their first evaluation showed that two idle reactors at a plant in Oi, western Japan, were able to withstanding a disaster similar to the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi. But two experts who sit on a panel advising Nisa on the safety appraisal said the stress tests were too limited in scope and did not prove that nuclear reactors were safe, adding that the IAEA visit was simply a public relations exercise. &quot;It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,&quot; Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement. Quake damage and scheduled safety checks prompted by the Fukushima accident mean that all but three of Japan&apos;s 54 reactors are out of service. Without approval for restarts, Japan will be without a single operating nuclear reactor by the end of April. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030. Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support. In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency&apos;s organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry. The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities. The bill would also limit a reactor&apos;s operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests. One of the six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi went into service 41 years ago."}, {"sentences": ["R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Nuclear power is a danger  The Japanese government has finally admitted what was clear to many during the earliest days of the Fukushima nuclear crisis: that the disaster could have irradiated huge tracts of land including the greater Tokyo area, and required the evacuation of tens of millions of people."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2012-01-31T13:00:01Z", "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 3 February 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/jan/31/guardian-weekly-letters-3-february", "article": "Tali Sharot&apos;s article, Instinctively upbeat, assumes that the brain is &quot;wired&quot; or &quot;hard-wired&quot; to be optimistic (20 January). Sharot softens the &quot;wire&quot; metaphor to &quot;flow&quot; and &quot;connectivity&quot;, but the idea that the brain is programmed persists. She is, however, in breach of her own argument when she states that &quot;people with mild depression ... see the world as it is&quot;. How is this so if the brain is hard-wired to produce a distorting effect? The basic problem may lie in taking the wire metaphor too literally. Nobody believes they have wires in their head, but the metaphor may be responsible for a picture of the brain as made up of independently functioning centres that have to be connected. Another more complex model would be of the brain as a vast network of interacting cells that somehow \u2013 we don&apos;t yet know how \u2013 produces intelligence and consciousness. If this were so, the almost unlimited capacity of the human brain to innovate and solve problems should not surprise us. Gero Miesenb\u00f6ck, professor of physiology at Oxford, has said, &quot;We have no idea how the brain works&quot;; and although he sees the brain as &quot;nerve cells ... wired together&quot;, he goes on to say &quot;we don&apos;t know where the switches are, and information processing, routing and storage all appear inseparably intertwined&quot;. Until these sorts of issues are clarified, Sharot&apos;s hard-wire talk is a lot shakier than it appears. Raymond Pelly Wellington, New Zealand \u2022 The last paragraph of your article Instinctively upbeat brought to mind an old camel drivers&apos; saying: &quot;Trust in Allah and tether your camel&quot;. We definitely can take steps to determine our destiny and should. Brynn Mathews Cairns, Queensland, Australia US teachers under siege It doesn&apos;t seem like news to me that US schools have their own liaised police officers; in the eight schools over 27 years where I have sojourned, every one had a least one security officer (Don&apos;t talk back to teacher, 27 January). In inner cities especially it has always been and continues to be a blackboard jungle. For example, at my first school our four principals would themselves deal solely with classroom problems that involved potential crimes; otherwise, teachers were on their own with classroom discipline (this was in one of the very districts in Texas mentioned by the article). More recently (2004) I found myself blessed with a particular class of 15-year-olds, four of whom \u2013 all girls \u2013 had prior convictions for assault, one that of a teacher. I know this only because through the course of the year each made a point of confiding or boasting of her crimes in detail (teachers are not allowed access to criminal records of minors in their classes). And this was at a fairly good public school in Connecticut. At my last position we had CCTV for the halls and perimeter of the building, which the principal \u2013 a frail sexagenarian \u2013 monitored assiduously from her inner sanctum. Here, among other things, we suffered from a raft of prank fire alarms, especially during finals week \u2013 four in one day alone. Chris McGreal&apos;s cases in point are a reductio ad absurdum: I&apos;d warrant that, if each were delved into more closely, we might find that it was the culmination of frustrated months of patient and positive corrective measures by the teacher. The dramatic increase in surveillance and adolescent criminalisation is the ultimate result of heightened civil litigation and financial awards in favour of parents, often over dubious grievances. Circumspection has been pushed to a siege-mentality: school districts now document every jot and tittle to cover their own asses and preserve their already imperilled budgets. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Nuclear power is a danger  The Japanese government has finally admitted what was clear to many during the earliest days of the Fukushima nuclear crisis: that the disaster could have irradiated huge tracts of land including the greater Tokyo area, and required the evacuation of tens of millions of people. This worst-case scenario was only averted by good fortune and by the heroic sacrifice of Fukushima workers. It could still happen if further earthquakes destroy the temporary cooling systems at the plant or topple one of the spent fuel pools. One does not need to be an economist or sociologist to understand that such a development would cripple the country and cause unimaginable social upheaval. Indeed, former prime minister Naoto Kan admitted during an interview that as the crisis unfolded he &quot;was not sure whether Japan could continue to function as a state&quot;. In view of these stark facts, do Guardian writers such as George Monbiot still see Fukushima as reason to stop worrying and love nuclear power? Martin Hawes Abels Bay, Tasmania, Australia Iran and the bomb Amid all the hype about Iran it must be noted that unlike several other countries in the region, Iran is signatory to the nuclear no-proliferation treaty and is in compliance with it (Leader, 20 January). The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons on the same grounds as the new Roman Catholic catechism: it is impossible to discriminate between military and civilian targets. Noam Chomsky writes in Hopes and Prospects: &quot;Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian observes that Iran seems to be the only case &apos;in international politics where a country has actually discussed the pros and cons of building a bomb&apos; in public. He cites &apos;fairly conservative people from the military arguing against having the nuclear option&apos;, including a minister of defence.&quot; A number of western observers and commentators appear to adhere to a double standard. They condemn the &quot;hard line&quot; taken by the clerical dictatorship but choose to ignore the hardline position against nuclear weapons. Iran has also shown itself open to creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East. Iran is not a country that I should choose to live in. But it should also be noted that a war against Iran would have Iran&apos;s internal opposition solidly in support of the nation, against western aggression. Jordan Bishop Ottawa, Canada Lithium isn&apos;t the solution Regarding Dan Collyns&apos;s Grounded in the green energy race (13 January): regardless of agreeing or not with Bolivia&apos;s approach to exploiting its lithium, I was wondering if you understand that lithium is not an energy source or fuel, green or otherwise, and therefore cannot ever be the &quot;energy fuel of the future powering iPods, mobile phones, laptops and electric cars&quot;. The claim makes me think back to Tony Blair talking about the hydrogen economy as if it would solve all our energy needs. Like hydrogen, lithium is only a carrier of energy. It might be a good one, allowing all sorts of new uses, but the energy itself will always have to be produced in some other way. Therefore, do not expect it to fulfil the world&apos;s energy addiction any more than hydrogen did. S\u00e9rgio Nogueira Brussels, Belgium A royal yacht? Capital! Shame on the government for not agreeing to finance a new royal yacht as a gift to the Queen (20 January). Surely a gift of this significance would delight the unemployed Liverpudlians you referred to on the facing page. If they are disgusted by these crude inequalities, they can do what I reluctantly had to do and abandon the country of my birth: emigrate to a land with more equalities built into the system and leave the UK to its House of Lords and privileged establishment. On the other hand the yacht fiasco could rouse enough indignation to force the abdication of the monarchy and bring about a more egalitarian society \u2013 long overdue \u2013 and royal withdrawal would avoid the alternative French solution to ridding the country of its parasitic royals. Ronald Craig Smith Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada Briefly \u2022 I&apos;m not sure what exactly the statement that our species&apos; end is &quot;statistically likely to happen in the next 800,000 years&quot; means (20 January). But the fact that our species has so far survived for about 200,000 years actually reduces the likelihood of extinction occurring before the mammalian average of around a million years and increases the chances of it occurring after that.

There were the former pros in their tailored suits, gliding through the crowds and greeting the players on familiar terms. There too were the model-presenters in their slinky dinner gowns, flirting shamelessly with their interviewees. And there, of course, were the self-publicists in fancy dress. &quot;I think next year they&apos;re going to incorporate my name into it,&quot; announced Nickelodeon&apos;s Pick Boy \u2013 a regular at this event in his bright orange superhero get-up: &quot;The Super Pick Boy Bowl.&quot; All of the above are par for the course at Super Bowl Media Day, an event which began as an opportunity for the press to speak to the protagonists ahead of the NFL&apos;s championship game but somewhere along the line developed a life of its own \u2013 growing into a televised circus that has lately seemed to be as much about the people asking the questions as the ones answering them. There was one new element this year, however. Or to be precise, roughly 7,500 of them. That was the number of supporters that the NFL allowed into Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, for this, the first ever Media Day played out in front of a live audience. At a price of $25 the cynic might have wondered if they could truly attract such a crowd for what is, at root, a glorified press conference yet the demand was sufficient that the scalpers were out hawking tickets at above face value. The first punters were already in their seats a good hour before the scheduled 10am start, some already tucking into their first snacks from the concession stands. Most seemed content with their return on investment \u2013 rather too content, in fact, with the crowd acceding to an appeal made over the public address that fans &quot;please be respectful&quot; towards the two teams. With more than half the audience sporting Colts jerseys one might have expected at least a smattering of boos for New England, their great rival of the past decade. Instead, even Tom Brady was cheered. &quot;He&apos;s still a good guy, you have to respect him,&quot; offered one Colts&apos; season ticket holder. &quot;There&apos;s sense making Indianapolis look bad by booing.&quot; In return for such good behaviour they were rewarded with a slightly disappointing spectacle, a Media Day light on both bravado and whimsy. Pick Boy aside, the &apos;characters&apos; seemed less colourful than usual \u2013 a TV crew with a glitter ball here, a man in a hat testing the Patriots on their patriotism there, but certainly nothing compared with the scene when these two teams met in Miami back in 2008 \u2013 when Tom Brady was one of a number of players who had to fend off persistent marriage proposals from TV Azteca&apos;s Ines Gomez Mont \u2013 dressed in full bridal gown. (Incidentally, while Brady&apos;s response to Gomez Mont \u2013 a whip-quick &quot;I&apos;ve got a few Miss Bradys in my life&quot; \u2013 is the line that will always be remembered from that day, it still isn&apos;t a patch on Bill Belichick&apos;s savage &quot;I wouldn&apos;t go that far&quot; when the same reporter asked the head coach if he thought she was &quot;better than Gisele&quot;.) There had been bold pronouncements as well as in 2008, with Plaxico Burress stoking the flames when he repeated a previous prediction that his team would defeat the previously unbeaten Patriots 23-17. There were occasional hints of such posturing this time around, Antrel Rolle backing his team to &quot;bring it home&quot; and Mario Manningham refusing to back down from his suggestion last week that the Giants could expose Julian Edelman \u2013 a receiver converted to defensive back by the Pats this season \u2013 but Ray Buchanan v Shannon Sharpe it emphatically wasn&apos;t. Even Chad Ochocinco \u2013 the Patriots receiver who criticised his fellow pros for not giving more interesting answers after trying his arm as a journalist at the 2010 Media Day was subdued. Mobbed by reporters hungry for a soundbite, he refused to rise to the bait when asked if he was upset not to get his own podium (hardly surprising, in reality, given his status as a back-up), saying: &quot;Why do I need a podium? I&apos;ve got 3 million followers on Twitter&quot;. Mostly, though, he just seemed a little sad. The day&apos;s greatest drama, then, came right at the beginning, when the Patriots emerged and the press corps immediately noted that Gronkowski was no longer wearing the walking boot that he has been using to protect his injured ankle. The tight end was walking without a discernible limp, but resisted the pressure to make a pronouncement on his status for Sunday, echoing Belichick&apos;s previous suggestion that they would take things &quot;day-by-day&quot;. But if there was grumbling among journalists on the short ride back to the Media Center, then such ennui did not seem to extend to the fans, whose regular bursts of cheering and laughter provided a novel and welcome (if occasionally disorienting, for anyone not attending the relevant podium) backdrop to the event. They got to hear first-hand Wes Welker&apos;s excitement at the quality of the jacuzz in the Colts&apos; facility, Osi Umenyiora failing, when challenged, to spell Bill Belichick&apos;s name correctly and Tom Brady urging Gronkowski to write a message to his mother on his ankle on game-day. &quot;It&apos;s an event, it&apos;s in our city, it&apos;s fun to see,&quot; continued our Colts season ticket holder. It is a safe bet that next season there will be even more fans on hand to do so. A question of support As requested by @ElFern on Twitter, I took the opportunity to ask London-born Giant Osi Umenyiora whether he supported a soccer team back in the city where he was born. His answer suggested a man who didn&apos;t like being pinned down to a single allegiance. &quot;Man, I have so many of them,&quot; said Umenyiora. &quot;My favourite used to be Chelsea, but I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on with them right now. Man U has always been my team. Rooney, I love Rooney, Nani all my guys \u2026 Right now my favourite team is actually Real Madrid, I don&apos;t know how happy they [United fans] will be with me about that, but it&apos;s a different league, it&apos;s not like it&apos;s the EPL. But as far as English football teams Man City \u2026 no, sorry, United!&quot; Advised that the latter was not a mistake that would go down well with some fans, Umenyiora suggested it might have been more than a slip of the tongue. &quot;I know, I know, I know. But I like Man City now though, I think they&apos;re playing very good football. I like the acquisition of Kun Aguero \u2026 Man U, Man City, is that really a really big rivalry? &quot;I mean it is, but it&apos;s not like it&apos;s \u2026 Man U v Chelsea is a bigger rivalry right now than Man U v Man City. I know they&apos;re in the same city, Man U and Man City or whatever, but I think Man U v Chelsea in the last five years has been a bigger rivalry.&quot; To be fair to Umenyiora, he does genuinely seem to follow the game - subsequently referencing City&apos;s 6-1 win over United this season. As one fellow journalist subsequently pointed out \u2013 there aren&apos;t many Premier League footballers who could offer any opinion on relations between the Giants and the Jets. And frankly, if he does want to support all those teams, it would take a brave man to argue with him."}, {"sentences": ["     Today we&apos;ve launched our Tokyo city guide - coralling a wide selection of locals&apos; tips, from hikes up sacred mountains to late-night arcade meeting spots for Tokyo&apos;s otaku - the youthful counterculture within a counterculture of anime, gaming and manga obsessives.", "We&apos;ve been working with Condition One over the last few months as part of a trial, and multimedia producer David Levene visited Tokyo to record some immersive-ready video.", "Tokyo games arcade     Street Fighter II    Brian Ashcraft is a senior contributing editor of Kotaku, the video-game-obsessed wing of Gawker&apos;s vast blog network.", "He&apos;s written three pieces for the Tokyo city guide - a selection of the best places to play games in the Japanese capital; a round-up of the best places to buy them; and a brief potted history of the cult arcade games that changed Japanese gaming culture through the ages.", "Vimeo gallery      Vimeo gallery    In our research for the Tokyo city guide, we stumbled upon a handful of beautiful timelapse videos.", "Extended images gallery     Photograph: Adrian Storey/Ujichin    We also stumbled upon an incredible range of Tokyo-based image bloggers and photographers."], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "title": "Beta adventures in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/info/2012/feb/01/tokyo-japan-city-guide-beta", "article": "     Today we&apos;ve launched our Tokyo city guide - coralling a wide selection of locals&apos; tips, from hikes up sacred mountains to late-night arcade meeting spots for Tokyo&apos;s otaku - the youthful counterculture within a counterculture of anime, gaming and manga obsessives.

In the decades following the second world war, gamers played electro-magnetic games in bowling alleys and on department store rooftops. Families would take shopping breaks, playing carnival-style shooting games or riding rinky-dink kiddy trains. Gradually, early analogue arcade games began popping up \u2013 driving games in which the road was on a rotating belt, and players had to steer a small car through obstacles. Companies like Namco and Sega started joining in, releasing magnet-powered cabinets that were the forerunners of the modern arcade game. In 1978, everything changed as Space Invaders enthralled the country \u2013 and the rest of the western world \u2013 spawning a slew of arcades and players dedicated solely to the new game. The game&apos;s release came just as Star Wars was hitting Japanese cinemas \u2013 and the timing could not have been better. Thanks to Space Invaders, for more than a decade Japanese arcades were dominated by shooting games, something that would not change until the release of Street Fighter II in 1991. Like Space Invaders, Street Fighter II, with its colourful characters and engaging gameplay, set the theme for the decade: if the 80s was about shooting, the 90s were for fighting. In the second half of the 90s, and for the bulk of the noughties, arcades opened up to an even wider audience thanks to female-aimed sticker picture machines, and rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution. The rhythm games unleashed a new type of spectacle in Japanese arcades \u2013 this wasn&apos;t about gameplay any more, but the act of playing. Complex dance performances were performed on DDR machines, and arcades started to feel more like dance clubs. In Shibuya, Tokyo&apos;s teens line up for blocks just to squeeze into clusters of photobooths with their friends \u2013 the images can be digitally customised after they&apos;re taken, like a touch-screen Photoshop. Japanese arcades are constantly evolving as the games change. As part of the Guardian&apos;s Tokyo City Guide, we&apos;ve highlighed some of the best places in the city to play games and where to buy them. Here are the most influential games in the history of Japanese arcades \u2013 click on the links below to play them. Space Invaders (1978)     Photograph: Alamy    The game that started it all. Space Invaders wasn&apos;t the first ever arcade game, but it was the first to capture Japan&apos;s imagination, as dedicated arcades, called &quot;Invader House&quot;, sprang up all over the country. It was so successful that it triggered a national shortage of \u00a5100 coins as kids queued up to slot money into the new machines. Space Invaders inspired games like Galaxian and Galaga. \u2022 Play Space Invaders Pac-Man (1980)     Pac-man    The 1980s were dominated by shooting games, mostly set in space, the exception to the rule being Pac-Man, which became the biggest grossing arcade game ever. The circular character became a global icon that shifted millions of bits of yellow merchandise, inspired an animated television series and even cheesy top-ten single. The pellet popping character, famously inspired by a pizza, was originally named Puckman after &quot;paku paku&quot;, the Japanese onomatopoeic phrase for eating. But it was changed because of the English word that puck unfortunately rhymes with, and the ease of vandalising a P into an F. \u2022 Play Pac-Man Donkey Kong (1981)     Donkey Kong    The game that made Nintendo a gaming giant, featuring, among other innovations, the first appearance of Mario, then dubbed Jumpman. While other game companies were feverishly trying to emulate Space Invaders or clone Pac-Man, Nintendo released something totally different \u2013 even if Universal Studios unsuccessfully tried to sue for ripping off King Kong! This is the first video game to feature a story, movie-style cut scenes, and the subsequently much-imitated &quot;rescue the girl&quot; motif. \u2022 Play Donkey Kong Contra (1987)     Contra    Sure, this classic run-and-gun game (you run, you shoot) aimed to capitalise on Hollywood action flicks like Commando, but it did it so well. Notoriously difficult, the game allowed two players to play co-op together, ushering in a wave of multi-player shooting games that currently dominate computer consoles. The Nintendo home console version had the infamous Konami Code, a secret code that could be entered to give players much-needed extra lives. \u2022 Play Contra Street Fighter II (1991)     Street Fighter II    What Space Invaders was to shooting games, Street Fighter II was to fighting games. Taking inspiration from Hong Kong kung-fu flicks, Street Fighter II featured colourful characters and cool, complicated moves that made it a game of skill, speed and strategy. The game&apos;s success meant that arcades were dominated by fighting games throughout the 1990s, and rival studios made exciting brawlers of their own (such as SNK&apos;s The King of Fighters). Street Fighter II was so popular that Nintendo designed the Super Nintendo Controller with enough buttons to play the game&apos;s home version. \u2022 Play Street Fighter II \u2022 Brian Ashcraft is a senior contributing editor of the Kotaku gaming blog"}, {"sentences": ["Head out to Tokyo&apos;s leafy suburb of Mitaka and see their rainbow-coloured Reversible Destiny Lofts.", "\u2022 2-2-8 Osawa, Mitaka-shi, +81 4 2226 4966, reversibledestiny.org St Mary&apos;s Cathedral     Photograph: vlayusuke on Flickr/some rights reserved     Kenzo Tange has built many impressive buildings in Tokyo, but St Mary&apos;s Cathedral is arguably his finest work.", "\u2022 3-15-16 Sekiguchi, Bunkyo-ku, +81 3 3943 2301 Prada flagship store     Photograph: Iain Masterson, Alamy     Tokyo&apos;s Omotesando boulevard is a stunning catwalk for high-end contemporary fashion and dramatic architecture.", "\u2022 16-10, Ginza 8-chome, Chuo-ku Fumiko Hayashi Memorial Hall     Photograph: yururu* on Flickr/all rights reserved    With the widespread firebombing of Tokyo in 1945 and the postwar reconstruction, there&apos;s not a lot of traditional architecture left to see in the city \u2013 with one great exception.", "\u2022 2-20-1 Nakai, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 5996 9207 21_21 Design Sight     Photograph: Capone~ on Flickr/some rights reserved    In the park behind the high-end Tokyo Midtown shopping centre, two sleek, triangular shards of concrete and glass rise from the ground.", "\u2022 Tokyo Midtown, 9-7-6 Akasaka, Minato-ku, +81 3 3475 2121, 2121designsight.jp.", "Open daily 11am-8pm except Tues Reiyukai Shakaden Temple     Photograph: Ian Hameroff on Flickr/all rights reserved    Nothing looms more ominously on the Tokyo skyline than this dark, oblique pyramid clad in black granite and crowned by two rings of gold.", "The temple also houses a reservoir with 400 tonnes of drinking water for use in the event that Tokyo is struck by a major disaster.", "The chaotic street scenes in Ridley Scott&apos;s Bladerunner were apparently inspired by this dingy Tokyo district.", "His studio, nestled in a small park in Mejiro, is a very rare find in Tokyo.", "\u2022 3-53-16 Izumi, Suginami-ku, +81 3 6768 3000, sonorium.jp For more information go to the Japan National Tourism Organisation&apos;s website: jnto.go.jp/eng \u2022 Ashley Rawlings is the editor of Art Space Tokyo, a guide to the city&apos;s most architecturally distinctive museums and galleries "], "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Architecture", "Cultural trips", "Asia", "Travel", "City breaks", "Top 10s", "Art and design", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T12:12:00Z", "title": "10 of Tokyo's best works of architecture", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/01/top-10-buildings-architecture-tokyo", "article": "Reversible Destiny Lofts &quot;We have decided not to die,&quot; declared architects Shusaku Arakawa and Madeleine Gins in the title of the book they published in 1997, arguing that lopsided, physically challenging spaces would awaken residents&apos; instincts and allow them to live better, longer \u2013 even forever.

Just when you think the setting can&apos;t get any more impressive, the Prada flagship store manages to make its neighbours look like they&apos;re trying too hard. Built in 2003 by Herzog and DeMeuron (renowned for the the bird&apos;s nest Olympic Stadium in Beijing; their extension to London&apos;s Tate Modern art gallery will open in time for this year&apos;s Olympics), the Prada store is an irregular construction of green, diamond-shaped glass panels. While many flagship stores intimidate with their austere interiors, Prada&apos;s aims to seduce with plush white carpets and rounded plastic walls. It&apos;s the epitome of refined but unpretentious allure. \u2022 5-2-6 Minami-Aoyama, Minato-ku Nakagin Capsule Tower     Photograph: pictureTYO on Flickr/some rights reserved    Completed in 1972 by Kisho Kurokawa, this eccentric residential/office building \u2013 which looks like a stack of washing machines \u2013 is an icon of the postwar Metabolist movement. The cramped capsules were originally designed for single businessmen, and each unit contains a built-in shower, bed, TV and phone. These were supposed to be replaced every 25 years, but never were, so the building is now in a sorry state of disrepair. Bought up by an unsentimental hedge fund, it is due for demolition and redevelopment. Get there in the next few months for a last chance to see this hallmark of flawed but visionary idealism. \u2022 16-10, Ginza 8-chome, Chuo-ku Fumiko Hayashi Memorial Hall     Photograph: yururu* on Flickr/all rights reserved    With the widespread firebombing of Tokyo in 1945 and the postwar reconstruction, there&apos;s not a lot of traditional architecture left to see in the city \u2013 with one great exception. In 1941, novelist Fumiko Hayashi (1903\u20131951) built her home here in Edo-era architectural style. Now a museum, this elegant house displays artefacts relating to her life and work, and the tranquil, walled garden where Hayashi wrote her acclaimed novels Ukigumo and Meshi. Spend an hour here and let the clock wind back. \u2022 2-20-1 Nakai, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 5996 9207 21_21 Design Sight     Photograph: Capone~ on Flickr/some rights reserved    In the park behind the high-end Tokyo Midtown shopping centre, two sleek, triangular shards of concrete and glass rise from the ground. 21_21 Design Sight is a signature work by Tadao Ando, and Japan&apos;s first design museum. Once you venture beyond the trapezoid lobby, you discover that 70% of the building is underground, but the exhibits still look great thanks to a large light-well and clever spotlighting. Directed by three of Japan&apos;s most famous designers \u2013 Issey Miyake, Taku Satoh, and Naoto Fukusawa \u2013 21_21 Design Sight&apos;s exhibitions present the most artistic examples of international design, from Shiro Kuramata&apos;s classic resin &quot;Miss Blanche&quot; chairs to images of Christo&apos;s wrapped public monuments. \u2022 Tokyo Midtown, 9-7-6 Akasaka, Minato-ku, +81 3 3475 2121, 2121designsight.jp.

Inside, the gloomy, red-felt-lined elevators seem better suited to a David Lynch movie than a temple. Reiyukai Shakaden was built in 1925 for a Buddhist lay sect and houses a large meditation room with a giant Buddha statue. But visitors are welcome, and free Japanese lessons are on offer. The temple also houses a reservoir with 400 tonnes of drinking water for use in the event that Tokyo is struck by a major disaster. \u2022 1-7-8 Azabudai, Minato-ku, reiyukai.org Golden Gai Bar District     Photograph: sinkdd on Flickr/some rights reserved     This compact cluster of more than 200 tiny, ramshackle bars in Shinjuku is the antithesis of planned, efficient architecture. In the 1950s it was a den of black-market trade and vice, but later became a hangout for artists and intellectuals. The chaotic street scenes in Ridley Scott&apos;s Bladerunner were apparently inspired by this dingy Tokyo district. Each bar has its own theme, ranging from photography to horse racing. While many of them only serve locals, a few will let you in if you ask nicely. Beware, drinks and accompanying snacks are expensive.  \u2022 Kabukicho 1-chome, Shinjuku-ku Yuzo Saeki&apos;s Studio     Photograph: K.Suzuki on Flickr/some rights reserved    Yuzo Saeki (1898-1928)\u00a0was one of Japan&apos;s early adopters of western-style oil painting. Late in life, he spent several years in Paris, where he painted self-portraits and landscapes in the Fauvist style. His studio, nestled in a small park in Mejiro, is a very rare find in Tokyo. This intimate, wooden building \u2013 reminiscent of an American parish chapel \u2013 is flooded with natural light that pours in through a large set of windows at one end, while at the other there&apos;s a quirky, irregular row of three doors. Since 2010, the studio has become a museum of Saeki&apos;s work. \u2022 2-4-21 Nakaochiai, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 5988 0091, free admission.

English menu Tsunahachi Rin Tempura \u2013 batter-fried morsels of seafood and vegetables \u2013 is one of the supreme delicacies of Japanese cuisine and, like sushi, at the upper end it can cost a prince&apos;s ransom. Hidden away on the upper restaurant floor of a mall close to Shinjuku JR Station, Tsunahachi Rin proves it doesn&apos;t have to. Drawing a youngish demographic, it brings some innovative nuances to the tradition, such as serving a choice of four different kinds of salt with the tempura instead of just the standard soya-based dipping sauce. Drop in for a quick, affordable lunch of tendon (shrimp and a few cuts of vegetables served on rice), or settle in for a leisurely dinner, picking from the considerable side menu of sashimi and other Japanese delicacies. \u2022 Lumine 7F, 3-38-1 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 3352 1012, tunahachi.co.jp, lunch from \u00a51,260 (\u00a310.50), dinner from \u00a52,625 (\u00a322), English menu. Open daily 11am-11pm Sushi-Bun Tokyo&apos;s central fish market is an essential part of most visitors&apos; itineraries, and so is breakfast at one of its legendary hole-in-the-wall sushi counters. The seafood could hardly be fresher, and the sushi is as good as you&apos;d expect at places charging four times as much. Sushi-Bun is one of the best in the market \u2013 it&apos;s just as tiny (10 seats at the counter at a pinch) and as tasty as the others, but it&apos;s left out of most guidebooks so the queues are usually shorter. Most people go for the set sushi menu (from \u00a322 for eight servings of whatever seafood is in season, plus soup), which includes their succulent house-special, anago sea eel. The rough sake they serve with it, though, is far from premium.\u2022 8 Chuo Shijo Building, 5-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, +81 3 3541 3860, tsukijinet.com, sushi chef&apos;s menu (omakase) from \u00a322, English menu. Open Mon-Sat 6am-2.30pm, closed Sun and holidays Kushiwakamaru     Photograph: Robbie Swinnerton    Yakitori \u2013 bite-sized cuts of chicken (and some vegetables) skewered, grilled and then seasoned with salt or slathered with thick soy sauce \u2013 is classic blue-collar fare: cheerful, affordable and best washed down with flagons of lager, sake or shochu. The cheapest places tend to be raucous and smoky, and often specialise in offal, but Kushiwakamaru hits just the right note. The feel is casual and accessible, while the charcoal-grilled chicken is well above average. There are always a few specials, such as duck or quail. And don&apos;t miss the negima (chicken and leek), the tsukune (balls of minced chicken) or the tebasaki chicken wings (forget chopsticks \u2013 these you pick up and gnaw with your hands). \u2022 1-19-2 Kami-Meguro, Meguro-ku, +81 3 3715 9292, r.tabelog.com/tokyo/A1317/A131701/13003193, yakitori from \u00a31.60/stick, English menu. Open Mon-Fri 5.30pm-midnight, Sat-Sun 5pm-midnight Nogizaka Uoshin     Photograph: Robbie Swinnerton    Five minutes&apos; walk from the opulent Roppongi midtown complex, the Nogizaka branch of the Uoshin group sets the template for the genre that&apos;s come to be known as fish shack dining. Fresh seafood served any which way you like, at prices that reflect the rudimentary decor: bright lights, colourful fishermen&apos;s banners and no-frills seating. Uoshin&apos;s parent company is a seafood wholesaler, guaranteeing freshness and a great variety of seasonal seafood. You can&apos;t go wrong here: generous sashimi platters; whole squid or other fish grilled to order; warming winter fish stews; and humongous portions of sushi. \u2022 9-6-32 Akasaka, Minato-ku, +81 3 3405 0411, uoshins.com, full meals from around \u00a330, including two hours of all you can drink. Open Lunch 12-2pm on weekdays; dinner 5pm-12am; Sunday and holidays 4pm-11pm Maruni Maruni does barbecue in a style all its own. The building is an old converted rice merchant&apos;s store that somehow got left behind among the modern office buildings close to Shinbashi Station. The decor is all gaudy black and red. Instead of tables and chairs, there are half a dozen oil drums, each with a charcoal grill set into the top. You just order a plate or two of meat, then grill it yourself. The beef is all from the famously pampered Japanese wagyu cattle. Maruni doesn&apos;t serve the super-premium steak grades so it&apos;s all highly affordable.  \u2022 1-11-1 Shinbashi, Minato-ku, +81 3 3572 1129, r.gnavi.co.jp, grilled beef from around \u00a5550 (\u00a34.60 a plate. Open Mon-Thurs, Sat 5pm-midnight, Fri 5pm-4am. English menu Ippudo Ramen is Chinese in origin, but it&apos;s unquestionably Japan&apos;s de facto favourite late-night fast food. You find ramen counters on virtually every street corner, serving up nourishing, steaming hot bowls of wheat noodles in rich, meaty broth, invariably topped with slices of chashu pork, half a boiled egg and chewy strips of menma bamboo. Within the genre, though, numerous regional variations have evolved: all are available in Tokyo. Where to start? You can&apos;t go wrong with Ippudo, a chain (now with a New York outlet) that flies the flag for Fukuoka ramen. The noodles are light and the tonkotsu soup (made from long-simmered pork bones) rich and satisfying. \u2022 1-3-13 Hiroo, Shibuya-ku, +81 3 5420 2225, ippudo.com/store/tokyo/ebisu.html. Open Mon-Sat 11am-4am, Sun 11am-2am. English menu Shin-Hinomoto There&apos;s nothing in the West quite the equivalent of an izakaya: neither pub nor restaurant, it&apos;s a place for eating \u2014 often well and always cheaply \u2014 as much as for drinking; and, just as importantly, for de-stressing after work. Shin-Hinomoto is a classic example. It looks unpromising, a cramped room full of noise and cigarette smoke shoehorned in under the railway tracks in Yurakucho. It&apos;s a typical izakaya in all but one respect: the master of the house is British. Known to one and all simply as Andy, he married into the business and now runs it. Seafood is his speciality, which he sources each day from Tsukiji market. But you&apos;ll also find chicken, cooked vegetables and simple salads alongside the tempura and sashimi. \u2022 2-4-4 Yurakucho, Chiyoda-ku, +81 3 3214 8021, andysfish.com/Shin-Hinomoto. Open Mon-Sat 5pm-midnight, English spoken Little Okinawa     Photograph: Robbie Swinnerton    The food and drink of Japan&apos;s southernmost prefecture are so distinctive they could be a totally different cuisine. The Okinawa archipelago is far closer to China than to Tokyo and the influences are marked. Little Okinawa is a welcoming, long-time (yes, and very compact) bastion of this subtropical culture, and it serves all the island exotica. Start with umi-budo, seaweed resembling miniature grapes, and jimami-dofu, a tofu-like custard made from peanuts. Continue with goat sashimi and pig&apos;s ear (crunchy, but served with a nice vinegar-sharp sauce). And don&apos;t miss the goya-champur (scrambled egg, tofu and bitter gourd) and rafutei, pork belly soft-simmered till you can cut it with a chopstick. Wash it all down with shots of awamori, a fiery liquor that can pack a wallop. \u2022 8-7-10 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3 3572 2930, little-okinawa.co.jp, starters from \u00a34.50; stir-fries from \u00a37; noodles from \u00a36.50. English menu. Open noon-1.30pm, 5pm-3am Mon-Fri, noon-1.30pm, 4pm-midnight Sat and Sun  Tonki  The first thing you notice about Tonki is how bright it is: it&apos;s as spick and span as an operating theatre. The chefs wear spotless white uniforms, the kitchen gleams and the wooden counter and tables are scrubbed smooth. Quite remarkable for a place where the only form of cooking is deep-frying. Tonki&apos;s speciality (in fact the only thing it serves) is tonkatsu: cutlets of pork that are dipped in breadcrumbs, then fried till the outside is a crispy golden-brown and the meat inside perfectly tender and juicy. You have two basic choices: rosu (blubbery-rich belly meat) or hire (lean loin &quot;fillet&quot;), though the latter is also offered as kushi, bite-sized cuts cooked on skewers. Most people order the set meal, with rice and miso soup on the side, leaving as soon as they finish. \u2022 1-1-2 Shimo-Meguro, Meguro-ku, +81 3 3491 9928, tonkatsu from \u00a37, set meals from \u00a314.

Photograph: detsugu on Flickr/some rights reserved    Tetsuya Saotome produces flawless tempura, succulent morsels of premium seafood and vegetables served straight from his deep-frying wok to your plate. He follows the classic Edomae style, using only ingredients that (with a couple of exceptions) would have been available 150 years ago. He works solo, which is why he can only seat nine at his counter. The cuisine and configuration may be traditional, but the eclectic decor \u2013 from European antiques to traditional lacquer-work and an extractor hood in the shape of a fedora \u2013 certainly isn&apos;t. There are many contenders for the crown of Tokyo&apos;s finest tempura, but none take it to quite the same level of idiosyncratic artistry.

This is one of Tokyo&apos;s unsung plebeian pleasures, but here served with refinement and a grand setting \u2013 a transplanted timber mountain farmhouse. The fifth-generation owner-chef uses eel caught in the wild rather than from fish farms and the flavour is incomparable. The cosy ground-floor dining room is fine for a simple (but rich and satisfying) lunch of unaju (juicy eel fillets broiled golden-brown, on a bed of white rice). Up the stately staircase, the private rooms are best for a full banquet. The highlight: shirayaki, eel that&apos;s lightly steamed and grilled, then topped with caviar. Perfect with a bottle of crisp local koshu wine. \u2022 1-5-4 Higashi-Azabu, Minato-ku, +81 3 3583 7852, nodaiwa.com, set menu \u00a360, a la carte from \u00a317. Open 11am-1.30pm and 5am-8pm. Some English spoken Nihon Ryori Ryugin     Nihon Ryori Ryugin     Ryugin sprang to prominence on the back of chef Seiji Yamamoto&apos;s imaginative application of modern cooking techniques to classic Japanese cuisine. These days, he has no need for any molecular magic: his vibrant contemporary kaiseki speaks for itself. Yamamoto is now at the top of his game (as recognised by his third Michelin star), drawing massive depths of flavour from his premium ingredients \u2013 such as sakuradai snapper, from the Naruto Strait close to his hometown, creamy an-kimo (monkfish liver, known as the foie gras of the ocean), or hand-reared Iwate wagyu beef. Yamamoto&apos;s candy pear dessert nitro-chilled to -196C and served with a sauce of the same fruit heated to a scalding 99C, is the stuff of legend.  \u2022 Side Roppongi Building 1F, 7-17-24 Roppongi, Minato-ku, +81 3 3423 8006, nihonryori-ryugin.com, dinner \u00a3200.

English spoken Aronia de Takazawa     Aronia de Takazawa    Chef Yoshiaki Takazawa&apos;s bijou restaurant has long been one of Tokyo&apos;s most intriguing secrets, more talked about than actually visited. Hardly surprising, since Aronia only sits two tables (maximum eight people) each evening. His French-Japanese signature dishes include: a ratatouille terrine, with vegetables layered into multicoloured cubes; carpenter&apos;s salade ni\u00e7oise, with sashimi tuna and tapenade sauce solidified in the shape of spanners and screws; and his hot balloon of seafood slow-cooked with bamboo shoot and seaweed. Takazawa stands centre-stage in this hushed, windowless chamber, with its sleek wood panelling and dramatic spot lighting, preparing or finishing each course himself, while his wife Akiko serves and explains in faultless English. \u2022 Sanyo Akasaka Bldg 2F, 3-5-2 Akasaka, Minato-ku, +81 3 3505 5052, aroniadetakazawa.com, from \u00a3140.

English spoken Narisawa     Diners can watch the chefs through viewing windows     Creativity lies at the heart of the eclectic modern cuisine dreamed up by Yoshihiro Narisawa at his impeccably polished Aoyama restaurant, with its swish, modern dining room and gleaming kitchen revealed through massive picture windows like a balletic silent movie. The fundamentals may be French but Narisawa&apos;s ideas and execution are his own: from the foraged herbs and edible soil to the damper-style bread cooked at the table. At times, it all feels overly cerebral, but his delectable char-cooked vegetables and wagyu beef bring a sensual satisfaction, and the desserts seem to never stop arriving. Narisawa also boasts a cellar especially strong in Burgundies, as well as a groaning cheese trolley. \u2022 2-6-15 Minami-Aoyama, Minato-ku, +81 3 5785 0799, narisawa-yoshihiro.com, lunch from \u00a365, dinner from \u00a3185.

There is virtually no decoration on the plain ochre walls of the small 9th-floor room where Hachiro Mizutani holds court. Nor are there tables, just one long counter; a single massive timber of smooth-scrubbed cedar and 10 plain chairs. The air is crisp with the faint aroma of rice vinegar and the atmosphere is hushed. Sushi veteran Mizutani is taciturn in his own language and speaks no English, but there&apos;s little that needs saying, except to specify beer or sake (there&apos;s only one brand of each). The sushi arrives in a set order, determined according to whatever is in peak season. A succession of flawless morsels of seafood on lightly vinegared rice kept at exactly skin temperature, it will include several cuts of the finest bluefin you have ever tasted, and the best abalone too. A couple of caveats: perfume is frowned upon, as are cameras and mobile phones. Nothing is allowed to disturb the serenity. \u2022 Juno Ginza Seiwa Building 9F, 8-7-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3 3573 5258, lunch from \u00a3130, dinner from \u00a3180.

English not spoken  Tofuya Ukai     Photograph: *YUKO_M on Flickr/some rights reserved    In a city of contrasts and surprises, few are greater than discovering the traditional garden, carp ponds and sprawling low-rise wooden architecture at Tofuya Ukai. There is no central dining room, just a warren of private chambers (most with tatami mats and low tables, but some with chairs) with garden views built around the timber buildings of a former sake brewery. The multi-course kaiseki meals focus on tofu, produced freshly at Ukai&apos;s own small workshop in the hills west of Tokyo. In winter, the house-special tosui-tofu delivers a triple whammy of bean goodness: cubes of tofu cooked down at your table in a creamy, savoury casserole of soya milk blended with chicken broth, topped with layers of yuba tofu skin \u2022 4-4-13 Shiba-Koen, Minato-ku, +81 3 3436 1028, ukai.co.jp, lunch from \u00a350, dinner from \u00a375.

He uses only top-quality free-range shamo gamecock, cooking the morsels of meat and offal over premium Bincho charcoal. Open the meal with his trademark liver pate, continue with wasabi-coated rare sasami white meat, and don&apos;t miss the sansho-yaki, succulent breast meat dusted with piquant Japanese pepper. In another break from the tradition of smoky neighbourhood grills, Wada stocks a small cellar of Burgundies and New World wines \u2013 perfect with grilled fare of this caliber. \u2022 Tsukamoto Building B1F, 4-2-15 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3 5250 1081, ginza-birdland.sakura.ne.jp, dinner from \u00a355.

A large game centre crammed with young people; wild electronic sounds; a group of college students spilling out from a bar; teenage girls with brilliant bleached hair, healthy legs thrusting out from micro mini-skirts; dark-suited men racing across diagonal crossings for the last trains to the suburbs.&quot; \u2022 Shinjuku Jonathan Lee, Who Is Mr Satoshi?, 2010     Jonathan Lee, Who is Mr Satoshi?    A funny and moving journey into the urban maelstrom of Tokyo by a major new voice in British fiction. &quot;The wastes of the airport were behind us and the taxi was pulling through roads flanked by buzzing neon shapes. Glittering skyscrapers were randomly marshalled across the skyline, sheets of sunlight shattering across their glass walls. These crystal buildings looked so delicate set against the fuming road, freighted as it was with the rattling metal of cars and buses and lorries, that it was difficult to believe that they belonged in the same world.&quot;No book or film had prepared me for the million-coloured veinwork of Shibuya. Its lights blazed incredibly brightly, dimming only when the taxi was sucked down into a tunnel. When we resurfaced seconds later, I felt like a disgorged newborn unable to take in the world outside the womb. Fluorescence poured down from street signs bearing strange lettering, filling the porches of shops and seeping under the arches of alleyways.&quot; \u2022 Shibuya Yasunari Kawabata, The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa, 1930     Yasunari Kawabata, The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa    A tour de force from a Nobel-Prize winner, set in what was Tokyo&apos;s traditional entertainment district before the war. &quot;Let&apos;s now suppose it&apos;s past three in the morning and even the bums are sound asleep, and I am here walking through the grounds of the Senso Temple with Yumiko. Dead ginko leaves flutter down, and we listen to the crowing of the cocks \u2026 Just at the neck of the gourd-shaped pond there is this little island, wisteria-trellised bridges extending from either bank. There, next to the fatsa bush under the weeping willow in front of the Tachibana fish stew shop, a large man is standing eating the wheat crackers that have been thrown to the carp in the pond.&quot; \u2022 Asakusa The Donald Richie Reader: 50 Years of Writing on Japan, 2001     The Donald Richie Reader    From culture and travel to people and style, this Tokyo-based author has been writing about Japan for half a century. &quot;What I find as I walk and walk and walk is a whole city with its very own bus station, its stories, its monuments and buildings. Though right in the middle of Tokyo, it is suburban and there are trees everywhere, even a park within this park, a glen with a lke. Sanshiro&apos;s Lake, I read. This must refer to Ozu&apos;s Natsome Soseki hero who came up from the country to go to what was then Tokyo Imperial University \u2026 The style is late Thirties \u2013 art deco.

She had changed into a kimono of light crepe and with a fine stripe. The effect was quite refined, but perhaps fearing it would seem too old for her, she had added a colour with elaborate embroidery. Her obi was made of crepe in the old-fashioned kaga style, lined with black satin, and it was held together with a sash of light blue crepe dyed in a bold pattern.&quot; \u2022 Shimbashi Angela Carter, Flesh and the Mirror from Fireworks, 1974     Angela Carter, Flesh and the Mirror from Fireworks    An Englishwoman wanders the streets of Tokyo searching for her lost lover in one of Angela Carter&apos;s brilliant short stories set in Japan. &quot;I walked under the artificial cherry blossoms with which they decorate the lamp standards from April to September. They do that so the pleasure quarters will have the look of a continuous carnival, no matter what ripples of agitation disturb the never-ceasing, endlessly circulating, quiet, gentle, melancholy crowds who throng the wet web of alleys under a false ceiling of umbrellas \u2026 The city, the largest city in the world, the city designed to suit not one of my European expectations, this city presents the foreigner with a mode of life that seems to him to have the enigmatic transparency, the indecipherable clarity of a dream.&quot; \u2022 Yoshiwara Edmund de Waal, The Hare With Amber Eyes: A Hidden Inheritance, 2010     Hare with the Amber Eyes    Edmund de Waal first encountered his family&apos;s netsuke carvings in his uncle&apos;s Tokyo apartment.

I&apos;d walk up the hill from the subway station, past the glowing beer-dispensing machines, past Senkaku-ji temple where the forty-seven samurai are buried, past the strange baroque meeting hall for a Shinto sect, past the sushi bar run by the bluff Mr X, turning right at the high wall of Prince Takamatsu&apos;s garden with the pines \u2026 His desk held an empty blotter, a sheaf of his headed paper, and pens ready, though he no longer wrote.

The tenants are constantly improving on the building, and the latest addition is a gallery space that has exhibits by avant garde international artists.

One of the gallery&apos;s leading Japanese artists, Shizuka Yokomizo, made her name by posting letters through strangers&apos; doors in the UK, asking them to pose for a photograph in their front window at a specific hour after dark, in return for a print. The sometimes vulnerable, sometimes defiant postures Yokomizo&apos;s subjects adopt makes for an unsettling but poignant exploration of voyeurism, exhibitionism and anonymity in portraiture. \u2022 Piramide Building 3F, 6-6-9 Roppongi Minato-ku, +81 3 6447 1820, wako-art.jp.

Akira Yamaguchi envisions 19th-century battle scenes in which soldiers ride horses with motorcycles for bodies, while Manabu Ikeda depicts a floating, rocky city of waterfalls and winding rail tracks. The gallery is also the force behind Makoto Aida, the enfant terrible of the Japanese art world, whose provocative paintings tackle social issues such as the sexual objectification of schoolgirls and violent nationalism. \u2022 Kagura Building 2F, 3-13 Ichigayatamachi, Shinjuku-ku, mizuma-art.co.jp.

One of a group of seven influential Tokyo galleries established since 2004 (known as the New Tokyo Contemporaries), Arataniurano has cemented its reputation for showing quirky, offbeat work, such as Izumi Kato&apos;s colourful, African-cum-extraterrestrial wood carvings and Tadasu Takamine&apos;s luxury product-like works, with which he campaigns for sustainable energy consumption using super-capacitors. \u2022 2-2-5 3A Shintomi, Chuo-ku, +81 3 3555 0696, arataniurano.com. Open Tues-Sat noon-7pm Take Ninagawa     Misaki Kawai's Homeland 2020    Take Ninagawa&apos;s exhibitions are typically an irreverent, scrappy, Pop affair, yet they are rooted in important historical and subcultural movements. One of Japan&apos;s most influential artists, Shinro Ohtake is renowned for his mixed-media scrapbooks \u2013 riotous, densely layered collages of vintage fashion magazine imagery, leaves and icons of soft-core porno, all encrusted with paint. Misaki Kawai&apos;s cartoon-like paintings and installations are influenced by the Japanese manga style known as heta-uma, which employs awkward, &quot;bad&quot; technique to achieve &quot;good&quot;, unpretentious results. If you venture to this gallery, hidden in the narrow backstreets of Higashi-Azabu, in the shadow of the Mori Art Museum, you&apos;ll always encounter a memorable exhibition.  \u2022 2-12-4 1F, Higashi-Azabu, Minato-ku, +81 3 5571 5844, takeninagawa.com. Tues-Sat, 11am-7pm Misako &amp; Rosen     FireEyes by Maya Hewitt      In contrast to other cookie-cutter white cube galleries, Misako &amp; Rosen is staggered over a small concrete staircase at its centre, which partitions the viewing experience into several different perspectives. The gallery&apos;s artists prove that painting is by no means dead. Maya Hewitt&apos;s oil-on-canvases depict bizarre, nightmarish scenes, such as a young man performing surgery on a women while tea is being served nearby, and Shimon Minamikawa&apos;s ethereal acrylic paintings juxtapose pastel-coloured geometric abstractions with washed-out portraits.  \u2022 3-27-6 Kita-Otsuka, Toshima-ku, +81 3 6276 1452, misakoandrosen.com.

It&apos;s a bit off the map, but with that comes a taste of Tokyo&apos;s quieter, more livable side. Opened in 2003 in what was then an ageing business hotel (the facade remains), the Claska has stunning Japanese modern rooms with crisp lines and a cool palette; some have private terraces, tatami floors or glass-cased bathrooms. There&apos;s a rooftop terrace and a hip lounge in the lobby that serves an excellent traditional Japanese breakfast; both are popular with locals, too.\u2022 1-3-18 Chuo-cho, Meguro-ku, +81 3 3719 8121, claska.com.

There are also two steaming hot baths, one made of cedar that looks out over the garden and the other ceramic, shaped like a bowl \u2013 a long soak is a Japanese experience not to be missed. The neighbourhood, Yanaka, is like an extension of the inn, with pre-war wooden buildings housing artisan studios, craft shops and cafes. The ryokan rents bicycles too, for only around \u00a34.50 a week, which are perfect for exploring.\u2022 2-3-11 Yanaka, Taito-ku, +81 3 3822 2251, sawanoya.com.

There&apos;s even a 24-hour butler service, should you need someone to pack your bags or fetch you a whisky from the members&apos; only bar. The Seiyo is pure Tokyo establishment: former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi has been known to visit the kaiseki restaurant here, where traditional multi-course dinners are served; and kabuki star Ichikawa Ebizo worked on the design of the sushi restaurant.\u2022 1-11-2 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3 3535 1111, seiyo-ginza.com.

For five years it staged an exclusive art fair in its rooms (including special installations in the loos). Otherwise, the Agnes is so wonderfully off the radar that many taxi drivers don&apos;t know it. The rooms are comfortable, though not luxurious, awash in creams and beige, with cushy armchairs and spa baths. They&apos;re perfectly situated for exploring the cobblestone lanes of one of the city&apos;s hidden gems, a beguiling old neighbourhood once famous for its geishas and now for its cafes, art galleries and excellent restaurants. \u2022 2-20-1 Kagurazaka, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 3267 5505, agneshotel.com.

The hotel starts on the 41st floor (in a tower designed by Kenzo Tange, no less), so there&apos;s not a bad view in the house; often you can see all the way to Mount Fuji.

Appropriately for its location, the rooms are done in contemporary fashion, with plenty of angular lines, dark wood accents and, in the better ones, bright manga-esque curtains. All have comfy beds.

Here you&apos;ll find stone lanterns and even a pagoda, all hundreds of years old; visit in the summer to catch the only fireflies in Tokyo. The rooms are fittingly princely, decorated in a lavish, almost over-the-top European rococo style with well-placed Asian accents (an antique Chinese vase here, a traditional Japanese cabinet there).

The inn is also an excellent case study in space maximisation: rooms are tiny \u2013 just big enough to fit two futons \u2013 but there are shelves built into the window wells and TVs hidden in an alcove. The owner collects antiques, and 100-year-old crockery has been known to show up at the breakfast table. The Andon&apos;s location is off the beaten track, north of the touristy area of Asakusa and near the gates of what was once the Yoshiwara, the infamous Edo-era red-light district. \u2022 2-34-10 Nihonzutsumi, Taito-ku, +81 3 3873 8611, andon.co.jp.

And a teahouse for tea ceremonies. And a Zen rock garden. Its neighbours are embassies, which makes it the go-to hotel for visiting diplomats.

It retains a historic air, with most rooms fitted with antique furniture, and writing desks add to the atmosphere. Two rooms also have small gardens. In a city known for demolishing and rebuilding once a generation, the Hilltop has managed to maintain charm and offers guests a true escape from the ultra-modern city.\u2022 1-1 Surugadai, Chiyoda-ku, +81 3 3293 2311, yamanoue-hotel.co.jp/eng.

While staff are generally friendly and hands-off, what are notable are the tiny touches the hotel makes to stay ahead of the pack. As well as six types of pillow to choose from, mattresses are flipped after 30 sleeps, air is purified, and the pyjamas and slippers provided are scientifically manipulated to increase comfort and relieve stress. The feel is one of surreal sterility, but perhaps this is the hotel of the future: a place where tiny innovations give guests a better night&apos;s sleep than they would get at home.\u2022 2-62-14 Ikebukuro, Toshima-ku, +81 3 3984 9000, superhoteljapan.com.

An interest in history or architecture, perhaps. A desire to walk in the footsteps of their favourite author or artist. Or maybe they want to make a musical pilgrimage to the spiritual birthplace of jazz. Bully for them, but that&apos;s not me. I wanted to visit Japan because of a video game in which you had to jump over animated turds. The game was called Kato-chan &amp; Ken-chan \u2013 a cheerful platform game in the vein of Super Mario Land, except the lead characters urinated, farted and defecated throughout each level. Kato-chan &amp; Ken-chan was one of many imported, inexplicable Japanese titles I encountered while working in a games shop in the early 90s. Mario and Sonic made sense to western players, but lurking just beyond these palatable mascots was a world of entertainment too strange to ever secure an official European release: fascinating, crazy games full of talking octopuses and jaunty tunes. American games were fun but bland. Japanese games oozed a demented spirit. Unfathomable, futuristic madness: that&apos;s what made me want to visit Japan.     A manga store in Tokyo. Photograph: David Levene/guardian.co.uk    Of course, it helps that Japan has, for years, been presented as a kind of Nerd Mecca. Not only is it the undisputed gadget capital of the world, it&apos;s a place where being a geek (or otaku) is comfortably mainstream. Former Prime Minister Taro Aso is an enthusiastic manga-collecting otaku, the TV ad breaks heave with glossy commercials for collectible card games, and multi-storey games arcades are commonplace. There&apos;s a gadget in every hand. Outside rush hour, the subway is eerily silent: thanks to a strong underground signal, everyone&apos;s staring at their smartphones, texting, playing games, or reading. Only after a fortnight did it strike me: not once did I hear a single person actually speaking into their phone on the Tokyo subway. Everyone \u2013 and I mean everyone \u2013 seemed to be perpetually tapping and swiping in silence. Unnerving to many: to a geek like me, it felt strangely comforting. It&apos;s easy to find grand-scale geek spectacle in Tokyo: just hop on the monorail to Odaiba, a man-made island in the middle of Tokyo bay. There, nestled amongst a collection of Bizarro skyscrapers straight out of Starship Troopers, is Miraikan, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. Here you can watch celebrity robot Asimo go through his paces, or simply gawp in astonishment at the gigantic &quot;geo-cosmos globe&quot;: an LCD-clad model of the Earth capable of depicting metrological data in real time. This is what Logan&apos;s Run would&apos;ve looked like if they&apos;d had more money and time. There are also a series of frankly baffling exhibits, including one which, apparently impossibly, projects a gigantic microbe-style creature around your feet as you enter. This virtual floor-dwelling entity then follows you around the room as you shuffle about, interacting with monitors with giant eyes on them, some of which offer to &quot;turn you into a song&quot;. It&apos;s like a cheese dream on a mothership. For a more down-to-earth nerd-out, Tokyo&apos;s Akihabara district is to geeks what San Francisco&apos;s Castro Street is to the LGBT community. It&apos;s an otaku paradise, an overwhelming whirl of shops selling electronics, games and comics. Any object you can conceive of having a USB attachment poking out of it is for sale, along with several hundred thousand that you can&apos;t.     Shopping in Akihabara. Photograph: Niko Kitsakis    I&apos;d been looking forward to browsing the shelves for zany gadgets, but the reality was slightly disappointing. Smartphone apps have replaced many of the charmingly pointless Japanese gizmos that used to be pop up on late-90s travel shows. More significantly, the west has become overtly tech-obsessed too. At home, we&apos;re routinely battered over the head with so many miraculous widgets, a sort of amazement fatigue has set in. So while in Japan you can easily stumble across a remote-control tissue box or a battery-operated planetarium for your bathroom (by which I mean a waterproof Saturn-shaped orb that floats in the bath and projects the entire visible universe onto the ceiling), the sense of surrounding novelty has diminished. It&apos;s less &quot;WTF&quot;, more &quot;yeah, that figures&quot;. Touring the electronic shops is still an entertainment in itself: I was merely surprised to discover I didn&apos;t actually want to buy anything. One of the few places I did want to spend money was in the arcades. In Britain, arcades have largely died out: we play at home, on Xboxes and PlayStations. Consoles are even more widespread in Japan, of course, but for many, finding the time and space to play in comfort is tricky. Home is often a cramped flat for all the family. Hence the evolving use of manga cafes (or mangakissa) for the nerd seeking a bit of peace and quiet. Originally these were internet cafes where otaku could gather to drink coffee and read comics: they&apos;ve subsequently morphed into surrogate bedroom services. For an hourly fee you can hire a private cubicle containing a TV, a BluRay player, a computer, a games console, a stereo \u2026 everything you&apos;d find in a techno-savvy twentysomething&apos;s home den, right down to the bed (increasing numbers of people sleep in these bedrooms-for-hire overnight: they&apos;re open 24 hours and are considerably cheaper than a capsule hotel).     A gaming arcade in Tokyo. Photograph: Rob Sheridan on Flickr/some rights reserved    Given this environment \u2013 herds of itinerant otaku wandering the streets \u2013 the continued survival of games arcades in Japan makes sense. But these are a far cry from the traditional British seaside arcade packed with flickery old Track and Field cabinets. These are bleeping, whirring, multistorey citadels filled with people doing things that scarcely make sense to an outsider. Let&apos;s run through a typical example, level-by-level \u2026 On the ground floor: endless rows of what the Japanese call &quot;UFO grabbers&quot; \u2013 those familiar fairground games in which you make a doomed attempt to grab an underwhelming prize using a mechanised claw. They seem to love these things, despite the fact that to the best of my knowledge no human being has ever successfully extracted a prize from one. Failure booths, I call them. Go up a floor and the crazy video-gaming begins. Given the competition from home consoles, arcade machines have to offer something different. Case in point: Cho Chabudai Gaeshi (&quot;Flipping the Tea Table Game&quot;) which consists of an arcade cabinet with a small table attached to it. It&apos;s actually more of a stress reliever than a game: the aim is to vent your frustration by hammering furiously on the tabletop before tipping the whole thing over in a rage. Time it properly and you&apos;ll cause maximum on-screen chaos. My favourite level was set in an office, with the table doubling as a desk: upend your workstation at just the right moment and you&apos;ll send co-workers plummeting out of the window to their deaths. Above that: a floor filled with super-advanced photo booths known as purikura \u2013 essentially digital dressing-up boxes. There are two main uses of a purikura: either jostle in with a bunch of friends to commemorate a night out, or, if you&apos;re a teenage girl and/or a psychopath, spend hours perfecting your costume before having your image digitally altered until you resemble a creepily infantilised manga cover girl. Top floor: a roomful of sombre youths vying for individual supremacy using some form of networked arcade strategy game that uses collectible cards. Imagine witnessing a game of bridge being played in the Cabinet War Rooms in the year 2072 AD. Some of the games are based around recognisable sports (like football), others around ancient samurai conflicts \u2013 but whatever the theme, the nature of the action is absolutely impenetrable to the casual onlooker. The players may as well be communicating psychically. I had no idea what I was looking at: the one thing I did know was that this unfathomable futuristic madness was precisely the sort of thing I&apos;d come to Japan to see. Somehow, I was home. \u2022 Virgin Atlantic (0844 2092 770, virginatlantic.com) flies from London Heathrow to Tokyo from \u00a3846pp return.

Most salarymen can only dream of going to Kyo Aji. The average price of a meal per person is listed as around \u00a3250, excluding booze, and then of course there&apos;s the have-to-know-a-regular-to-actually-go-there factor.

These pinball-like games are supposedly based on skill, but it doesn&apos;t take long vainly attempting to &quot;shoot&quot; the tiny silver balls through a cascading maze of pegs to sink them into holes at the bottom before you realise they&apos;re essentially slot machines by another name. The salaryman&apos;s trick? Put a pachinko ball in each ear. It won&apos;t help you win, but it will block out the insane music, which is like techno made by six-year-old girls who&apos;ve spent the whole day drinking Coke.

There are also a score of laid-back little Korean bars that blast K-pop videos until the sun rises. Korean Bar i is a particularly tiny, garish and friendly representative of these.

The police appear inept and largely indifferent to the fate of his family, and the media insensitive and intrusive, so Ido discovers that he has &quot;no aptitude for playing the victim&quot;. Used to negotiating good deals in business, he decides to take matters into his own hands. He pops round to Ogoro&apos;s family home, disarms a doltish policeman, and takes the convict&apos;s wife and child hostage in a tit-for-tat strategy. Soon, to the delight of the media, there is a stand-off between Ido and Ogoro, who send a series of increasingly grisly messages to each other in an escalating scenario of violence and macho one-upmanship. For Ido, what began as an attempt to save his wife and son becomes a bizarre and twisted exercise in winning at any cost: even if that involves the rape, torture and possible deaths of those you claim to love. The bee may protect itself with its sting, but it pays a heavy price for doing so. Adapted by Hideki Noda and Colin Teevan from a short story by Yasutaka Tsutsui, The Bee is a modern morality tale dressed up as a weird and wild theatrical manga comic strip that takes a satirical swipe at what happens when people lose faith in society&apos;s mechanisms to protect them and deliver justice. In Miriam Buether&apos;s glossy design, the floor is lacquered the colour of blood and a two-way mirror turns everything inside out, while Noda&apos;s production plays cunningly with perception and gender: he casts himself as Ogoro&apos;s wife. But the chief glory in an evening that is simultaneously weirdly watchable and curiously alienating is the performance of Kathryn Hunter as Ido, a little man against the world who initially wins your sympathy but who is eventually revealed in his full ruthlessness. Hunter is small and fragile and yet exudes the mesmerising, pent-up energy of a championship boxer. She is fabulous at the slapstick, but also adept at revealing the emptiness that consumes Ido as he is infected with violence like a fever. The\u00a0entire tone of the piece is feverish, too, and even if the production fails to make the shift from high comedy to grim tragedy, it&apos;s still a visually arresting and unsettling 75 minutes."}, {"sentences": ["People wanting to volunteer should email onemillionyears@avfestival.co.uk Kawara was born near Tokyo in 1933, but measures his age in days rather than years, so he&apos;s now not far from his 29,000th day."], "tags": ["Gateshead", "Newcastle", "Art", "Art and design", "Museums", "Exhibitions", "Antony Gormley"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-02T11:00:00Z", "title": "Six hundred people needed to be part of a Tyneside work of art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/feb/02/gateshead-newcastle-baltic-anthony-gormley-on-kowara", "article": "For the third time in its ten-year history, the Baltic in Gateshead is appealing for members of the public to take part in one of its projects.

He is a Japanese man with friendly yet alert eyes, in his late 30s with excellent English. He speaks softly and laughs easily. For lunch he orders a curry with a coffee. &quot;There is no real anger at bankers in Japan these days. I don&apos;t hide from people that I work in a bank. The gaps in income here are not as big as in the west, and when they are, they are not as widely known. Typical bankers in Japanese banks make slightly more compared with other sectors in Japan. In the middle of the last decade things in Japan got a little bit crazy, as in the west. Now it&apos;s normal again. &quot;I sometimes feel that some of the criticism of the financial sector is misguided. The sub-prime-related instruments that caused the crisis in 2008 were just one product of investment banking among many. Nearly all of the people working in finance were involved in something other than these products. &quot;We don&apos;t have Occupy tents in Tokyo. When there are demonstrations they are anti-nuclear, not anti-finance, at least for now. If people here are angry it is about the disaster at Fukushima, and the government&apos;s response. Also, the Japanese financial sector has proven quite sound compared with elsewhere in the world. &quot;Japanese banks were hit by what we call &apos;the Lehman Shock&apos;, but the damage was relatively limited compared to western banks. As for the current sovereign debt crisis in Europe, Japanese banks have limited exposure. I work in a foreign bank so I follow both crises closely. For ordinary Japanese the impact of the Lehman shock was quite large, especially for the manufacturing sectors. The European debt crisis seems a bit far from their minds \u2013 though they may read articles on the theme. &quot;As I said, the global financial crisis is very interesting for us. Many western banks have lots of non-performing loans [loans gone bad] on their books. We have a lot of experience with those in Japan. It&apos;s the world in reverse these days. In the 90s it was Japanese banks that had to sell many of those non-performing assets to western banks \u2013often at great profit for those western banks. These days, Japanese banks can make good money by buying bad loans at big discounts from distressed western banks. &quot;We work even longer hours than bankers in London do. Tokyo is a very competitive market because you have all the banks you have in London or New York, but also the Japanese giants for whom this is their home turf. Then there&apos;s the investment bank mentality of working long hours. Add to that the Japanese work mentality and you begin to understand why we sometimes joke that our job is 9 to 5; 9am to 5am. &quot;After our Christmas party the Japanese among us went back to the office, to do some more work. At some point an American colleague came in because he had to pick something up. He was totally surprised to see us: &apos;What are you all doing here?&apos; he asked. A female colleague of mine snapped: &apos;Wake up. Get back to reality.&apos; &quot;A bad thing about Americans is that they seem to think New York is the centre of the world. When we need to have a conference call with American colleagues they always set it to fit their time zone, without even thinking. It&apos;s very different with, say, people in Brazil, a country my bank does a lot of cross-border transactions with. They will go out of their way to schedule conference calls and timetables for joint projects in such a way that it doesn&apos;t interfere with our respective sleeping hours. &quot;Western banks are usually called &apos;foreign&apos; here. They are quite different from Japanese banks. In foreign banks people switch frequently between jobs and banks. That&apos;s very unusual in Japanese banks. In foreign banks you make more money but you also lose your job more easily. You might say that Japanese have much better fringe benefits, there&apos;s a safety net for employees. &quot;Generally speaking, Japanese and western banks operate differently, too. In western banks you get much, much more responsibility and you work with fewer people. Decisions are taken much quicker, and there&apos;s more frequent and direct communication with senior management. Japanese banks tend to be more hierarchical, and sometimes less flexible. &quot;In my experience Japanese banks have really good business management. In particular operation and risk management is really good \u2013 staffed with dedicated veteran bankers who learnt a lot during the crisis Japan went through in the 90s. &quot;As a Japanese banker you may have two to three people to back you up and there tend to be very good manual books for daily operations from which you can learn a lot and which you must follow. Since they have so much fewer layoffs and resignations Japanese banks have much more consistency and continuity. &quot;At the same time Japanese banks can be terribly inefficient and slow. Then again, this can work out very well as people don&apos;t get rushed into taking a risk. Don&apos;t underestimate the hidden strength of Japanese banks. &quot;On a typical working day I get in at 9am and work till midnight or 1am. When I was younger it was much worse, when I had a 9am to 5am job. Even senior bankers and executive directors sometimes stay in the office till 2 or 3 am. In Japan it&apos;s not customary to leave the office before your boss. &quot;My job consists of two parts: proposing [pitching] to clients, and executing the deals we have won. So who are the clients and what do I propose to them? Our clients are corporations, very big, very sophisticated Japanese companies with global operations. These corporations need money, for instance to buy a company, to invest or because an earlier loan needs to be paid back. Another possibility is that the credit rating of the company is downgraded, making it harder for them to borrow money. We go to them and offer solutions on how to raise the necessary money. In my case that might mean the corporation issues new shares on the stock market. &quot;How do we know that a corporation might need our product? We do research ourselves. Most corporations finance themselves with a mix of selling shares [equity] and borrowing money [bonds]. This is called the debt to equity ratio. My team might collect the debt to equity ratios, for example, for all companies in a particular corner of the sector we cover, to determine which of them might be most susceptible to a pitch on our part. This work involves incredible amounts of details and the competitors pitch very aggressively too, so there&apos;s always this pressure. &quot;To know the market we can also turn to our so-called &apos;coverage people&apos; in the bank. They follow corporations for us and will know a lot about future plans. We can speak with them about non-public deals. Those we cannot speak to are our colleagues working in the so-called secondary markets; traders, sales people ... That would be illegal, in fact, I&apos;d go to jail and lose my license, never to work in finance again. &quot;How it works: we work in the primary market and our clients are corporations who issue shares on the stock market. Now the secondary market is where these shares are traded. So my colleagues in the secondary market try to make money on the stock market, either for our bank or for their clients \u2013 pension funds etcetera. &quot;Of course these traders and investors would love to know what the corporations they invest in are up to. Since I work with these corporations I may know things that could make the people in the secondary markets very rich. That secret knowledge is called insider-information. &quot;There are very strict rules. If I want to trade on the stock market in a private capacity, I have to submit my plan first to the compliance committee at the bank. They determine whether there&apos;s any conflict or risk. All of this is called &apos;Chinese walls&apos;. It&apos;s a big thing within the bank. &quot;You are right, there must be people who know each other from school or their neighbourhood or university and who now work in the same bank on either side of a Chinese wall. How to stop them from exchanging information during a private party, a school reunion, a chance encounter in the street? All I can say is that this would be totally illegal and very serious. &quot;There is a case currently under investigation here in Japan. A corporation was going to issue new shares, which always means that the share price will go down. The suspicion is that some investors knew in advance, sold their shares before and bought them back later at a much lower price. &quot;Japanese companies are so spoilt. When we win a deal, we need to go on a so-called &apos;road show&apos;. This means we travel with representatives from the client corporation to investors and try to persuade them to buy the shares. We put together a prospectus and material for that road show, often including 150-page-long English circulars. And the client treats us as the Japanese Travel Bureau! We are expected to book flights for the client, restaurants, hotels\u2026 And at very low prices! This can be very annoying sometimes. The thing is, these corporations know how much we want their deals. &quot;4pm is a very bad time for us, every day. This is when the market closes and corporations announce their deals in equity finance. In other words, this is when we hear that a competitor of ours has won a deal and we haven&apos;t. Sometimes in the course of the day there are rumours and leaks of a deal and we sit and hope they are not true. They usually are. Then the senior people start calling: &apos;Why didn&apos;t we get this deal?&apos;. In some banks at the end of the year they put together a list of all the deals you missed and for each you have to explain why. &quot;Corporate banking is a bit like farming; you do what you have to do and you have a predictable harvest. Equity finance is maybe more like hunting. You have many misses, but when you hit, you hit big. We have fewer successes but wider margins. &quot;I&apos;d say that many UK bankers are seen as a little bit overpaid. Especially in the mid-2000s. Back then young bankers like me were paid crazy amounts. At some point the housing costs were even higher than in Tokyo! I know so many UK bankers working in London who bought property at very high prices. When the crisis came they lost their jobs while the housing market crashed. Many of them ended up deep in debt.&quot; \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["\u2022 To get to Takayama from Tokyo station, take the Nozomi Shinkansen to Nagoya and change for the limited express Wide View Hida train to Takayama.", "\u2022 Rebecca Milner is a writer based in Tokyo"], "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Food and drink", "Tokyo holidays", "Restaurants", "Japanese food and drink", "Cultural trips", "Asia", "Restaurants", "Food & drink"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-03T10:00:00Z", "title": "A taste of old Japan in a mountain ryokan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/03/maruhaci-ryokan-takayama-maze-japan", "article": "The Japanese clearly value tradition, yet for one reason or another \u2013 fire, natural disaster, the second world war, an enthusiasm for progress \u2013 there aren&apos;t many towns left that truly encapsulate the way things were. Kyoto has its temples, but in between them is a thoroughly modern city. Takayama is different \u2013 an old castle town in the mountains of central Japan. You can still see the ruins of the 17th-century castle in the town&apos;s Shiroyama Park, but Takayama is much better known for its townscape of narrow lanes and low wooden buildings stained the colour of espresso. With its steep hills the town couldn&apos;t produce much rice, so it produced artisans instead. Many were carpenters, who would go on to work on the palaces and temples in Kyoto, then return to construct their signature lattice-front buildings for local merchants. Takayama has a few beautifully preserved streets, now filled with perpetually crowded tourist shops, and there is also a slow encroachment of Disneyland-esque additions on the edges \u2013 new &quot;old&quot; buildings are sprouting up. To really get away from it all, you need to head deeper into the hills, to a tiny village like Maze. Consider it a pilgrimage: Maze happens to shelter one of Japan&apos;s best hidden culinary destinations. Maze is 40km south of Takayama, enveloped by a bucolic nothingness of rice paddies and hills. A slick two-lane highway makes easy work of those hills, though considering there&apos;s hardly another car in sight one has to wonder if its construction was really necessary. Its star, the Maruhachi Ryokan, doesn&apos;t advertise; and has almost zero online presence. The inn gets by entirely on repeat customers and word-of-mouth, and this is the way that the owner Chikako Hora prefers it. I get the sense that she agreed to let me write about her inn only because she believes that nobody would bother to travel from a foreign country to Maze (yes, that&apos;s a dare).\u00a0 It looks like a classic Japanese country villa, with a low, horizontal frame capped by slate-coloured tiles. But it isn&apos;t a time capsule. The walls are crisp white planes, the tatami mats are silky and fresh and the futons are wonderfully fluffy. Along one highly polished wooden corridor, glass cutouts in the floor look down over the carp swimming in the pond below. Most of Maruhachi&apos;s customers are anglers \u2013 when the wisteria starts to bloom in summer the fishing season begins in earnest. The fishermen arrive armed with long rods to fish for ayu (sweetfish), a river fish native to east Asia with delicate white meat that Japanese people will tell you tastes like watermelon. It doesn&apos;t; but it is light and sweet and perfect in the summer when skewered and barbecued over hot coals, seasoned with sea salt and eaten head to tail off the stick like an ice lolly. But the spring months, before the anglers arrive, are the region&apos;s most spectacular \u2013 clumps of purple wisteria hang over fast-moving mountain streams teeming with amago (red-spotted trout) and iwana (white-spotted char). Unruly tufts of bright yellow-green foliage are run through with rivulets of dark evergreen.     A Maze villager picks sansai. Photograph: Daniel Galhardo    Spring is also the season for sansai, mountain vegetables. These are the ferns and shoots that nose up through the ground when it thaws and sprout from the tips of branches. There are half-a-dozen or so more common ones, like kogomi (ostrich fern) and taranome (Angelica tree shoots). It&apos;s a foragers&apos; paradise. In Maze, housewives with baskets pillage the mountainside for edible greens to sell at roadside stands. With only 1,500 people in the village, there aren&apos;t enough to do too much damage. Dinner at Maruhachi is a feast of all of this. The 11-course meal is served in a private dining room on a low black lacquered table with mother-of-pearl inlays of dragons and flowers. Guests sit on floor cushions. With each course, the waitresses go through the ritual of opening the sliding paper doors, kneeling on the tatami and explaining the details of each dish.     Iwana sashimi at the Maruhachi ryokan. Photograph: Daniel Galhardo    The iwana is served as sashimi (raw and thinly sliced), rare for a river fish. It has a cool, clear flesh traced with silver that looks like the river in the sun, and just enough fat to give it a richness of flavour and texture. The leaner amago is skewered and grilled at the table. Sansai appear lightly swaddled in tempura, seasoned with matcha (green tea) salt. There is also homemade tofu spiked with yomogi (mugwort) and new potatoes dusted with egoma (wild sesame seeds). By the time the top-quality hida-gyu steak arrives, at around course number six, we&apos;re in heaven.     Chikako Hora entertains guests at the ryokan. Photograph: Daniel Galhardo    Midway through the meal, we are greeted at the table by Chikako herself. As the okami, the mistress of the inn, this is her role. It was a role that she was born into \u2013 her mother was the okami before her. There are inns that can trace their lineage back 10 generations; Maruhachi is comparatively a child \u2013 only two generations old. She&apos;s graceful and charming, wearing a formal silk kimono; you&apos;d never suspect that she&apos;s spent all afternoon in the kitchen. We invite her to stay and chat with us, to tell us about growing up in Maze. While making sure our sake cups stay full, she talks about her beloved river and the effects of the new road that make it easier to get in and out of the village (Chikako could do without it). &quot;There&apos;s nothing here!&quot; she says, laughing. &quot;Unless you get that, and in your heart really want that, you certainly wouldn&apos;t want to come all the way out here.&quot; She has no idea how wrong she is. \u2022 To get to Takayama from Tokyo station, take the Nozomi Shinkansen to Nagoya and change for the limited express Wide View Hida train to Takayama. The journey takes four hours and costs \u00a514,200 (around \u00a3118) return.

Satoshi Yamamoto runs Amazake-chaya (395-1 Futago-yama, Hataju-ku, open 7am-5pm), a teahouse along what was once the Tokkaido Highway. His family has been serving travellers there for more than 350 years. &quot;Travellers coming from Kyoto who&apos;d just passed would be relieved, celebratory. Those going the other direction would be anxious. Anyone could be suspected of being a spy,&quot; he explains. Over the past 150 years most of the old Tokkaido has been turned into paved multi-lane highways and railway lines, but a 9km stretch through the woods here in Hakone \u2013 between the villages of Hakone Yumoto and Moto Hakone \u2013 has been preserved as a hiking trail. It&apos;s a fairly lonely passageway, with moss hanging from the trees, and stones worn smooth from the foot traffic of days past. While there were once many teahouses along this stretch, now there is only Amazake-chaya. (If you don&apos;t want to walk, a bus running along the road parallel to the trail also stops at Amazake-chaya.) &quot;I know what you&apos;re going to ask me,&quot; says Yamamoto. &quot;Because I ask myself the same question all the time: why are we the only ones still here?&quot;     The interior of Amazake-Chay, the last teahouse on the Tokkaido Highway. Photograph: Rebecca Milner    The building is no longer made of wood; it has burned down too many times. When customers complain, Yamamoto reminds them that he could have put up a convenience store instead. Besides, the roof is still thatched and the floor packed earth, except for a platform of woven straw mats around the hearth. Customers sit at tables that are polished cross-sections of thick cedars. The glowing embers are the brightest things in the room. The recipes haven&apos;t changed much either. Hot, gooey mochi (pounded rice) cakes are grilled over coals and dusted with soy powder or crushed black sesame. Naturally sweet amazake, a non-alcoholic fermented rice drink that is the house speciality, is served hot, with pickles on the side. A 19th-century hill station The village of Miyanoshita was Japan&apos;s first cosmopolitan resort. Its golden age spanned the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, when the country began to open up to the west. The Americans and Europeans who settled in Yokohama flocked here from the city to escape the summer heat. The main street, nicknamed Sepia Street, still has an old-time hill station feel \u2013 the narrow road now has to accommodate buses in both directions, so there&apos;s hardly room for a pavement. Among the traditional sliding doors is Shima Photo Studio (372 Miyanoshita, Hakone-machi, open 9am-7pm), nearly a 100 years old and with old black-and-white images of Miyanoshita and its famous visitors in the window. Another, Edo &amp; Co (363 Miyanoshita, Hakone-machi, open 9am-6pm Fri-Wed), sells antique porcelain of the kind that would have been snapped up by the first wave of Japanophiles \u2013 large platters decorated with landscape patterns in classic blue, tiny sake cups embellished with enamel the colour of rust and jade. But Miyanoshita&apos;s grandest, if not oldest, relic is the Fujiya Hotel, one of Japan&apos;s first western-style hotels, built in 1878. It&apos;s big and creaky and not, in fact, very western. The eaves curl up on the edges like a mustache, the roof is tile, the accents are vermillion.     A signal to Miyanoshita's future \u2026 the Naraya Cafe. Photograph: Rebecca Milner    Nearby, a signal to Miyanoshita&apos;s future. The Naraya Ryokanwas once the Fujiya&apos;s proud rival, but it was torn down in 2000 when its owners were unable to pay the steep inheritance tax. All that was left to Yoshikazu Ando, the 14th in line, was scrap wood and a legacy. This he turned into Naraya Cafe \u2013 Miyanoshita&apos;s hip new hangout. Using the framework of an existing shop on family land up the road, Ando and some friends \u2013 an architect and a carpenter among them \u2013 set to work building an airy cafe. It&apos;s redevelopment done right: raw beams crisscross overhead and a loft on the second floor doubles as a gallery for local artists. The best innovation, however, is the hot spring footbath on the terrace. Here you can take off your shoes, roll up your jeans and soak your feet in steaming mineral water while sipping espresso or a glass of wine. Hidden baths     Photograph: Rebecca Milner    Bath hopping is one of Hakone&apos;s most-publicised pleasures, but you could easily walk right past the Rakuyu-jurin day spa, also in Miyanoshita. Only a few paper lanterns on aluminum poles mark the start of a winding series of stone stairs that seem to go off the side of the cliff. They go on and on, before finally ending at a simple wooden gate with flapping red curtains that is the entrance. Made of unpolished cedar on stilts, the whole complex looks like a tree house. Foliage hangs over a series of rotemburo (open-air baths) arranged like terraced rice paddies perched on the side of a ravine. Bamboo leaves, like long pointed tongues, lap at the edges. Only 100 people are allowed in per day, split between the men and women&apos;s baths. For those lucky enough to get through on the phone when they open at 10am, there are two private baths that can be reserved by the hour. If you can&apos;t get in, another of Hakone&apos;s hidden gems is well and truly hidden - in the back of an art museum in the nearby village of Hakone Yumoto. The Key Hiraga Art Museum is dedicated to the works of the Pigalle-inspired Japanese painter and is run by the late artist&apos;s wife in their 100-year-old villa. It&apos;s a rambling structure with long corridors of polished wood and a garden that looks half wild. She lets out the villa&apos;s bathhouse for an extra admission fee. It&apos;s pure hot spring water in a marble tub under a vaulted canopy of wood \u2013 and you can have it all to yourself. Getting there To get to Hakone from Tokyo, take the Odakyu Line limited express Romance Car from Shinjuku Station to Hakone Yumoto. It takes 90 minutes and costs \u00a52020 (\u00a318). A tourist information outside the station has maps in English. Transfer to the Hakone Tozan Line for Miyanoshita. Rooms at the Fujiya Hotel start at \u00a3135pp; (weekday offers available). The Prince Hakone Hotel has rooms overlooking Lake Ashi starting at \u00a3160. Both have hot spring baths. \u2022 Rebecca Milner is a writer based in Tokyo"}, {"sentences": ["Putting an oppressive traditionalist upbringing in Japan behind her, Kusama became a media sensation dubbed the &quot;princess of polka dots&quot;, only to voluntarily retire to a Tokyo psychiatric institute in the 1970s, where she continues to work to this day."], "tags": ["Art", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture", "Installation", "Sculpture", "Painting", "Lucian Freud", "Photography", "Yayoi Kusama"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-04T00:06:00Z", "title": "This week's new exhibitions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/04/yayoi-kusama-lucian-freud-exhibitions", "article": "Yayoi Kusama, London Kusama is the artist who sees dots \u2013 everywhere.

Tate Modern, SE1, Thu to 5 Jun Skye Sherwin Jennifer West, Sheffield S1 Artspace continues to establish itself on the contemporary art-world map with this unashamedly spaced-out show of Jennifer West film installations. West dissolves the recognisable narrative orientations of documentary and movie film with techniques of almost desperate disruption. Film stock from Hollywood blockbusters is subjected to physical attack from the application of chemicals, whisky, urine, smoke, nail varnish and \u2013 oh yes \u2013 LSD. Film strips are burned, scratched and even bitten, then projected. Titles include Heavy Metal Sharks Calming Jaws Reversal Film and Dawn Surf Jellybowl Film. In an age of digital media, West reminds us of the sensuous physicality of genuine celluloid film by distressing its surface gloss. S1 Artspace, to 10 Mar Robert Clark The Starry Rubric, Cambridge This cosmos-themed show is full of art that offers its own version of stargazing. Things kick off tonight with a performance by Mark Aerial Waller, interpreting conceptual artist and science boffin John Latham&apos;s Government Of The First And Thirteenth Chair, an attempt to reconcile the infinite expanse of time with the fleeting moment. Further meditations on time include Karin Kihlberg &amp; Reuben Henry&apos;s This Story Is About A Little Boy, a film riddled with black holes due to its narrator&apos;s halting attempts to remember the where, who and when. Wysing Arts Centre, Sun to 18 Mar Skye Sherwin Lucian Freud, London Freud&apos;s portraits are hard, disquieting things, attuned to the tough reality of bare, veiny sprawling bodies and the jaundiced walls, gummy sheets and cruel furniture around them. Alongside Francis Bacon he was Britain&apos;s greatest postwar artist, tirelessly working in his Holland Park studio, up until his death last year. This show spans Freud&apos;s entire career, from the early stylistic experiments of the 1940s to his legendary, hit-you-in-the-guts realism. It features some of his most iconic paintings, like his nude portrait of Leigh Bowery, slumped in a chair with legs nonchalantly akimbo, and the one of Bowery&apos;s friend Sue \u2013 the Benefits Supervisor Sleeping \u2013 which made Freud a record breaker in 2008 when it reached a cool $33,641,000 at auction National Portrait Gallery, WC2, Thu to 27 May Skye Sherwin The Indiscipline Of Painting, Coventry By the 1970s, the modernist tradition of abstract painting was presumed dead as its assumed historical progression reached a minimalist full stop. Yet the raw matter of paint refused to disappear from studios, and painting as a discipline outlasted the clear-cut predictions of its own demise. So this exhibition&apos;s title cleverly encapsulates the survival of a tradition within a field of almost anti-academic indiscipline. Taking the geometric abstraction of Frank Stella and Bridget Riley as its guiding aesthetic, it reveals a host of maverick abstractionists working away through an era of postmodernist multimedia. Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre, to 10 Mar Robert Clark The Family In British Art, Sheffield As usual the Millennium Gallery follows its populist agenda with a wide-ranging thematic show that nevertheless includes some works which \u2013 though all too familiar to most of us \u2013 are of genuine historic significance. So this exhibition covers the days of Gainsborough to the incisively critical art-world obligations of our own time. Richard Billingham&apos;s shockingly frank photographic portraits of his own parents&apos; domestic lot are redeemed from satire by a touching empathy. But, of the contemporary work, it is Sarah Jones who introduces a less familiar perspective with her photographic reveries of almost painterly compositional subtlety. Millennium Gallery, to 29 Apr Robert Clark Michael Shaw, Oldham The considerable physical presence of Shaw&apos;s sculptures, their ability to animate the atmosphere of a gallery space, lies in the presence of seemingly contradictory characteristics. They are rigorously abstract, yet suggest some kind of cellular or amoebic organisms that indicate the almost primal origins of living things. Their often translucent surfaces suggest the more evanescent of natural phenomena and their compositional rhythms seem more derived from improvised and, well, doodled drawing than the building up or carving out of sculptural space. At their best here, they glow and mutate like eerie things unearthed from some creepy dream of a sci-fi future. Gallery Oldham, to 10 Jun Robert Clark The Near And The Elsewhere, London The shrinking world conveyed here by 15 artists has nothing to do with technology-fuelled interconnectedness. Its gloomy theme is economic decline and squeezed space in our overcrowded cities. Captured in photography, film and installation, abandoned buildings from the USA to Asia create an unnerving vision of society on the edge. Rachel Whiteread&apos;s print of a doll&apos;s house rubs up against Edgar Martins&apos;s chilling photography of American homes left as half-finished piles of rubble in the wake of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. In Noel Jabbour&apos;s photos squat brick Middle Eastern buildings look like ancient ruins; while the eerie urban models Thomas Demand builds and photographs are neat, boxy and empty. Lastly, in Francis Al\u00ffs&apos;s slides of people living on the street, we see the human impact of all these failed business schemes and collapsing financial institutions.

It stands proudly alongside the other titans of Japan Inc such as Panasonic in the Shinagawa district \u2013 but in reality these are crumbling empires, their very foundations chipped away by the aggression of Samsung and the design brilliance of Apple. Last week, Sony&apos;s Welsh-born boss, Sir Howard Stringer, the first foreigner to hold the top job, paid the price for his failure to turn the company around. Company veteran Kazuo Hirai, who has a record as a hard-nosed cost-cutter, will take over from him in April \u2013 but with a near \u00a32bn annual loss on the horizon there will be no cheerleading from the new leader: he said he felt &quot;an acute sense of crisis&quot; and identified a need to push through urgent change. The heavy losses at Sony were mirrored at Panasonic and Sharp, and the bleak scene was completed when Japan itself reported its first annual trade deficit since 1980, blamed on the impact of the tsunami and the strong yen. Within the business community there are whispers of a sense of paralysis or &quot;hopelessness&quot;, and the fear that if decisive action is not taken, some of the companies that were the engine for Japan&apos;s postwar growth could fall into irreversible decline. &quot;Japanese companies cannot keep doing what they have been doing,&quot; says Hiroshi Mikitani, the founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten. His company, which is worth more than \u00a37.6bn, is not a household name in the UK yet, although many Britons are now indirect customers of Mikitani&apos;s following Rakuten&apos;s acquisition of UK e-retailer Play.com for \u00a325m last year and Kobo, the Canadian ebook maker, for \u00a3200m. At home it is best known for Rakuten Ichiba, the country&apos;s biggest online marketplace \u2013 ahead of Amazon \u2013 with more than 37,000 merchants selling almost everything from noodles and sushi to Japanese ceremonial armour. With annual sales of \u00a32.6bn in 2010, its operations also span banking, travel ticketing and even a mediocre professional baseball team \u2013 the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, which finished fifth in a league of six teams last season. Mikitani is confident Rakuten can take on Amazon around the world. Its Ichiba website has been likened to a &quot;blog with a shopping cart attached&quot;: merchants are encouraged to talk to customers and give internet shopping a &quot;human face&quot; \u2013 unlike Amazon, which, he says, is just a &quot;gigantic vending machine&quot;. Rakuten&apos;s strategy is to build alliances and it hopes the Kobo will be a more &quot;open source&quot; option than Amazon&apos;s Kindle for retailers and publishers. &quot;There are lots of companies that don&apos;t like Amazon because they want to control and dominate everything,&quot; says Mikitani. &quot;We are more alliance-oriented \u2026 We want to establish relationships with retailers.&quot; The self-made billionaire, whose early career was in banking, claims Japanese executives lack a global perspective \u2013 a syndrome that has been called &quot;Galapagos-isation&quot;, referring to the tendency among Japanese companies to focus on the tastes and demands of an isolated and shrinking home market rather than take risks abroad. The country&apos;s electronics sector has been hit by the success of South Korea&apos;s Samsung and LG, which assemble products in lower-cost countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand. There have also been spectacular own goals: Japan had web-surfing handsets nearly a decade before the iPhone, yet local producers failed to tap overseas markets. Management writer Simon Caulkin says there is still much to admire about Japanese manufacturers, not least their &quot;miraculous&quot; recovery after the Fukushima disaster, and the Toyota production system, which is still is one of the &quot;wonders of the industrial world&quot;. One criticism, says Caulkin, is that in areas such as consumer electronics and cameras, Japanese companies are so focused on competing with their immediate peers that they miss the big picture. The classic case is Sony, ironically the most &quot;western-facing&quot; of the big Japanese firms, which had all the ingredients to create an iTunes-style online music store but was completely outflanked by Apple. &quot;Even when Sony knew what Jobs was up to, it couldn&apos;t get it together because it was undermined by squabbling divisions, each struggling to protect its empire,&quot; explains Caulkin. &quot;Apple, on the other hand, had a completely integrated view. It [was] one company, no divisions, one profit and loss account, under an utterly focused Steve Jobs.&quot; Stringer&apos;s turnaround was said to be hampered by a resistance to change, and he recently quipped to one interviewer: &quot;Love affairs with the status quo continue even after the quo has lost its status.&quot; One western executive based in Tokyo says that decision-making in a typical Japanese company is by consensus: &quot;It can take six months and nothing will happen. They tried to build a consensus on everything. But once the strategy is decided everybody goes for it \u2013 for better or worse.&quot; Last year, in an unusual step even for large Japanese multinationals such as Sony or Toyota, Mikitani switched Rakuten&apos;s official language to English. &quot;We need to change the mindset of every single Japanese person,&quot; says Mikitani, who is likened to some of the country&apos;s other successful entrepreneurs such as Tadashi Yanai, founder of the clothier Uniqlo, and Masayoshi Son, chief executive of mobile phone network Softbank. &quot;We don&apos;t push out a Japanese model to our subsidiaries. The lack of global vision is partly coming from the language [barrier].&quot; To highlight Rakuten&apos;s swift decision-making process, he adds: &quot;We did the Kobo deal in a week.&quot; Rakuten occupies a former Sony building in Shinagawa: the stunning panorama from the top floor belies a dingy interior, as strict energy controls in the wake of Fukushima see lights dimmed and heating switched off in some areas. With a nod to Wal-Mart, Mikitani preaches the Rakuten shugi or &quot;way&quot;, starting the day with the asakai morning meeting in a cavernous auditorium where the latest sales figures are discussed. The Monday meeting has been switched to Tuesday so that managers from other countries can be patched in. Rakuten&apos;s egalitarian code is spelt out in a handbook, telling staff that they must all clean their offices together (including desks, whiteboards and &quot;even chair legs&quot;); that their work ID badge should be pinned with pride on the &quot;left side of your chest&quot;; and that they should &quot;greet each other enthusiastically&quot;. Whether Rakuten&apos;s model will be embraced by its peers remains to be seen but Mikitani is undaunted: &quot;We are going to be very aggressive. You need to be agile and have vision.&quot; Other Japanese companies are closely watching its progress in the west. &quot;If we succeed,&quot; he adds cautiously, &quot;then they will follow us.&quot; And will they succeed? He points to Carlos Ghosn&apos;s success in reviving Nissan: &quot;I think the Sony brand can be revived. I think [electronics companies] will come back. They will wake up.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;People have had this problem of not being able to get items they really want \u2013 maybe some limited-edition Nikes from Tokyo or a backpack that&apos;s only available in Berlin \u2013 in their own country."], "tags": ["Technology startups", "Entrepreneurs", "Technology", "Small business", "Business", "Technology sector"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-05T00:06:00Z", "title": "Seedcamp London: the other Dragons' Den", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/05/seedcamp-tech-startups-entrepreneurs-investment", "article": "In a former retail space, just yards from Soho&apos;s sex shops and market stalls, Britain&apos;s next wave of technology entrepreneurs are checking in for one of the biggest days of their lives. Clutching coffees and smartphones or iPads, the mostly young men in shirts, sweaters and jeans mingle awkwardly with the 120 investors and industry experts, who have come to hear them pitch their business ideas, offering advice in intensive mentoring sessions afterwards. A lucky few might also walk away with the prospect of financial backing. Seedcamp London \u2013 to give this nerve-jangling day its formal title \u2013 has become a landmark occasion in the tech scene&apos;s calendar. At least 250 hopeful startups, from as far afield as Portugal and Finland, applied to this year&apos;s event, with just 22 (albeit a record number) invited to take part. Launched in 2007, Seedcamp is arguably Europe&apos;s leading early-stage mentoring and investment programme for tech startups and has backed a total of 60 companies. While that number is modest (compared with its Silicon Valley equivalent Y Combinator, which invests in around 60 every year), the fund&apos;s investment is viewed as a golden ticket. Not only do &quot;Seedcamp companies&quot; receive an investment of \u20ac50,000 but, more importantly, they gain access to a network of more than 1,200 mentors, including many of the industry&apos;s leading players, and are taken on a meet-and-greet tour of investors and founders in every US tech hub from Boston to San Diego. No wonder, then, that the smiles and\u00a0hushed small talk at the event mask an atmosphere that at times resembles a shark pool. &quot;The competition really is tough,&quot; says Seedcamp partner Reshma Sohoni. &quot;Not only is it really hard to get in, but of the 22 teams here today, Seedcamp may potentially invest in two or three \u2013 or none of them.&quot; By the time the pitches (a strict three minutes) are under way, the space is packed with startup teams and mentors. Some are tapping notes into keyboards, some are filming the proceedings, more are live tweeting. It&apos;s hard to miss the glaring lack of women both in the audience and among those addressing it. Only three pitches are led by women and just one (out of 22) is delivered by someone over the age of 50. What&apos;s more, there are just two black men in the room; one of them is a security guard. Although it&apos;s changing slowly, the event is a reminder that the tech world\u00a0is predominantly peopled by young, white, male geeks. &quot;That&apos;s because a lot of the guys starting out in the business are coders; they come from a technology background,&quot; explains Sohoni. While it&apos;s easy to see why the entrepreneurs apply to Seedcamp in their droves, the reason that investors prowl the room, scouting for talent and dispensing advice in huddled, urgent mentoring sessions, is harder to explain. Most of these businesses are not so much young, or even pre-pre-revenue, as nonexistent. Some are little\u00a0more than a bright idea, a fast-talking founder and a holding homepage. But that doesn&apos;t put off venture-capital fund Eden Ventures, which now has investments in six Seedcamp-backed startups. Partner Ben Tompkins says he met three more teams at Seedcamp London 2012, which he is &quot;taking seriously and following up on&quot;. Eden makes very early stage investments of between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a31m, with further stakes to follow as and when the business grows. &quot;The key thing we&apos;re looking for is a really good group of people behind the business,&quot; says Tompkins. &quot;Not just one individual, but a team who have come together to work on an idea. Second, have they got a good understanding of the market opportunities? Do they understand who&apos;s going to use their product or service? Third, do you think there&apos;s something they can create that&apos;s intrinsically valuable?&quot; Revealingly, Tompkins says that venture-capital funds have to develop diverse portfolios of companies to spread their risks. &quot;The industry numbers for VCs in the US and Europe\u00a0are that in 60% of companies in\u00a0which you invest, you will lose money,&quot; he says. &quot;In 30%, you will either break even or return some money to the fund. So you&apos;re down to\u00a010% that&apos;s going to make a difference\u00a0and effectively put the fund\u00a0into a profit-making position.&quot; Which makes for grim odds for the startups. Fewer than 10% of applicants to Seedcamp London were selected to take part in the day. Of those, on average, around 10% will receive funding. And just 10% of that 10% will be a breakout hit. But funding \u2013 which is available in other accelerator programmes, from &quot;angel&quot; investors, seed funds and other sources such as friends and family (or &quot;fools and family&quot;, as one investor quipped) \u2013 is not the primary reason that many startups apply. The true value of being backed by a fund such as Seedcamp is the stamp of approval it confers. &quot;When you come out the other end and say I was a Seedcamp 2011 company, that says something,&quot; says Tine Thygesen, CEO of digital travel site Everplaces, co-founder of start-up hotbed Founders House in Copenhagen and a mentor at Seedcamp. &quot;If you&apos;re a good entrepreneur, you&apos;ll be able to figure out the business stuff yourself. What you can&apos;t do yourself is that borrowed credibility, which means that when you&apos;re calling up an investor, he&apos;ll probably call you back.&quot; Seedcamp&apos;s credibility has been hard-earned. Of the first 22 companies they&apos;ve had meaningful data from, just three have failed. Three more have been acquired, including Mobclix, which was bought by mobile marketing\u00a0company Velti for around\u00a0$50m. By 2012, the programme\u00a0predicts that 11 out of the first 16 Seedcamp-backed companies still trading will generate at least $1m in revenue, creating hundreds of jobs in the process. &quot; &quot;Some of our companies have 50 plus people working for them just three or four years after starting up,&quot; says Sohoni. &quot;If we didn&apos;t exist, all that would either not have happened or taken these companies a heck of a lot longer. That&apos;s where we can really measure our impact.&quot; Bertie &amp; Bean     James Tabor and Stephen Trott. Photograph: Katherine Rose for the Observer    Who?

Casually dressed for the weekend, he is a slender man in his early 30s with a fashionable haircut. He orders pasta. &quot;When I travel to New York, I am always struck by the percentage of Caucasians in the banks there. Here in Tokyo it&apos;s overwhelmingly Japanese. But in London you have the whole world population represented. I may go to a desk in a major bank and not find a single English person on the team. They may be from India, from Lebanon, from anywhere. That&apos;s London. &quot;My job is in corporate banking. I am the liaison between my bank and one major global Japanese company. Let&apos;s call that company XYZ. Now XYZ has operations around the globe. It buys materials and half-products from lots of countries. It assembles and manufactures in lots of countries. It sells its own products across the globe. &quot;Imagine the money flows: across currencies, across time zones, across jurisdictions. Say XYZ wants to buy a factory in China. For tax reasons XYZ may have its &apos;paper headquarters&apos; in a tax-haven like London, Amsterdam or Switzerland. This means that the payment has to go through there. So it starts in yen in Japan, is converted into sterling or Swiss francs or euros to originate in the country of the paper headquarters. Then it must be converted into dollars because Chinese renminbi must be paid for in this way. So the payment alone moves through four currencies, but at what conversion rate? You have different currency markets operating in different time zones. The yen market closes before the London market opens. On what day should the transaction be credited? How does the transaction look to different regulatory systems in the countries concerned? &quot;You need to agree on a fee for all this, provide certification \u2026 In a transaction like this there may be at least three other banks involved. And don&apos;t forget the need for &apos;local information&apos;. In some countries official regulation can be quite different from how things are done in practice. I need to be aware of that and pass on relevant information to XYZ. &quot;This is just one example and you understand how global financial transactions get very complicated very quickly. And how a bank with global operations is at a huge advantage. When Japanese corporations expand overseas they cannot do so using Japanese banks as these lack such global networks. This is not good for Japan and we must work harder to change it. Japanese corporations could do more, too. I know of Japanese executives who take an English course but quit very soon; they decide they are just going to take an interpreter to wherever they are going. &quot;My day starts before 7am when I wake up and check my BlackBerry. It doesn&apos;t really matter where I am to do work. My office phone is routed to my BlackBerry so it looks as if I am speaking from the office. On the commute I read stuff and work from the BlackBerry. I need to know what has happened while I was asleep, both in the world and with XYZ. Say there has been a flood in Thailand. Has that affected operations for the local XYZ activities? &quot;On a normal morning there are between 50 and 100 emails to go through. I usually get into the office around 9am and work till midnight, till just before the last train. Working hours often shift. When the XYZ office with which I am doing business is in a completely different time zone, you need to adapt your hours. &quot;For example, European banks are currently withdrawing from Latin America, because the crisis forces them to retrench. So I may get a call from the XYZ office in Brazil that they can no longer get a credit-line from their European bank. Can we support them? I get on the phone with the XYZ office in Brazil and in Tokyo, and with our local office in Brazil as well as with the people in our bank here in Tokyo who are responsible for Latin America. &quot;What it comes down to is client maintenance. Any request from XYZ headquarters here in Tokyo or a local subsidiary goes to me. I speak to my counterparts every day about activities, needs, demands, strategy \u2026 Co-ordination is key. &quot;There are interesting parallels between Japan and the UK. Both are islands with a limited and stable population. They have their own currency and they are a former power with lots of history. Their banks and corporations now make most of their profits overseas, which they repatriate for tax reasons. &quot;London is still the financial centre for the Europe and Mediterranean region. It helps how countries like India and other former British colonies have adopted many of the British laws, rules and regulations. That is of great benefit to London. &quot;Yet it&apos;s unclear where London is going, what the regulatory climate is going to be. Also, I don&apos;t see much innovation coming out of the UK these days. The bankers&apos; population may be very diverse. The products they come up with are rather old-fashioned.&quot; \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["For reasons unconnected to this blog I was in Japan recently, where I had the chance to speak to three people working in finance in Tokyo.", "I don&apos;t hide from people that I work in a bank,&quot; adding: &quot;We don&apos;t have Occupy tents in Tokyo.", "Tokyo is a very competitive market because you have all the banks you have in London or New York, but there are also the Japanese giants for whom this is their home turf.", "Here in Tokyo it&apos;s overwhelmingly Japanese."], "tags": ["Japan", "Financial sector", "UK news", "Banking", "Business", "Work & careers"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-07T08:00:01Z", "title": "Japanese banking, a culture shock | Joris Luyendijk", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/feb/07/japanese-banking-tokyo-finance", "article": "For reasons unconnected to this blog I was in Japan recently, where I had the chance to speak to three people working in finance in Tokyo. They had such interesting things to say that I thought it would be a shame not to share them here. Please consider this a snapshot \u2013 no more, no less \u2013 of some of the differences and similarities between finance in Japan and in the west. It would be wonderful if readers, Japanese or not, with relevant knowledge used the comment thread to jump in and elaborate. The big story in Japan these days still seems to be the tsunami and the nuclear disaster that followed at Fukushima, sometimes referred to as 3/11. It is hard to miss the parallels between the nuclear crisis in Japan and the banking crisis in the west. Not only are they often described with the same term, &quot;meltdown&quot;, the context is strikingly similar. In both cases you have a crucial part of the country&apos;s infrastructure that is very complex and nearly incomprehensible to outsiders. It was consistently portrayed as safe by experts and the authorities. Then it blew up. I met a number of Japanese journalists who were very distrustful of their government&apos;s statements and promises about nuclear safety. Pervading their words was a sense that the political class was not on the side of the people, but in cahoots with the sector. Again a clear parallel with the west. One Japanese banker, who sat for an interview similar to others posted on this blog, works in equity finance for a major western bank. He said: &quot;There is no real anger at bankers in Japan these days. I don&apos;t hide from people that I work in a bank,&quot; adding: &quot;We don&apos;t have Occupy tents in Tokyo. When there are demonstrations they are anti-nuclear, not anti-finance, at least for now. The financial crisis had affected Japanese banks in a markedly different way, he continued. &quot;It&apos;s the world in reverse these days. In the 90s it was Japanese banks that had to sell many of those non-performing loans [bad sub-prime loans] to western banks \u2013 often at great profit for those western banks. These days, Japanese banks can make good money by buying bad loans at big discounts from distressed western banks.&quot; It was very interesting to see how the mores of the financial sector intersect with local customs in Japan, upending some while amplifying others. An investment banker explained how she ended up in finance, at least for a while. She had gone to study abroad, thinking this would improve her CV only to discover on her return that she had missed several rounds in the incredibly rigid recruiting system in Japan. &quot;Recruitment in Japan is like a train,&quot; she said. &quot;You fail to get on and you&apos;re lost.&quot; There was one sector left in which such rules did not apply; finance. The equity finance banker said: &quot;We work even longer hours than bankers in London do. Tokyo is a very competitive market because you have all the banks you have in London or New York, but there are also the Japanese giants for whom this is their home turf. Then there&apos;s the investment bank mentality of working long hours. Add to that the Japanese work mentality and you begin to understand why we sometimes joke that our job is 9 to 5; 9am to 5am.&quot; The full interview with the equity finance banker is here, and especially worth a read if you do not know what equity finance is, or &quot;Chinese walls&quot;. The other person to sit for a formal interview was in corporate banking; he worked for a major western bank in charge of liaison with one of the biggest Japanese corporations. I had not yet spoken to a corporate banker for this blog, and was struck by just how complex the daily operations of major corporations have become in today&apos;s global economy. Let&apos;s call&quot;&apos;my&quot; corporation XYZ, the corporate banker said: &quot;Now XYZ has operations around the globe. It buys materials and half-products from lots of countries. It assembles and manufactures in lots of countries. It sells its own products across the globe. &quot;Imagine the money flows: across currencies, across time zones, across jurisdictions. Say XYZ wants to buy a factory in China. For tax reasons XYZ may have its &apos;paper headquarters&apos; [registered office] in a haven like London, Amsterdam or Switzerland. This means that the payment has to go through there. So it starts in yen in Japan, is converted into sterling, Swiss franks or euros to originate in the country of the paper headquarters. Then it must be converted into dollars because Chinese renminbi must be paid for in dollars. So the payment alone moves through four currencies, but at what conversion rate? You have different currency markets operating in different time zones. The yen market closes before the London market opens. On what day should the transaction be credited? How does the transaction look to different regulatory systems in the countries concerned? &quot;You need to agree on a fee for all this, provide certification \u2026 In a transaction like this there may be at least three other banks involved. And don&apos;t forget the need for &apos;local information&apos;. In some countries, official regulation can be quite different from how things are done in practice. I need to be aware of that and pass on relevant information to XYZ. This must be one of the reasons that today&apos;s financial sector is not a free market but an oligopoly of a handful of banks; scale is everything and the barriers to entry for newcomers are huge. The corporate banker elaborated: &quot;A bank with global operations is at a huge advantage. When Japanese corporations expand overseas, they cannot do so using Japanese banks as these lack such global networks.&quot; This was actually a joint interview. There we were, a Dutchman and two Japanese men speaking in English about the global world of finance. One was eating pasta and the other a curry, while I was digging into my Japanese dish. It occurred to me that in many ways I had more in common with them than I had with many of the Dutch people who are supposed to form &quot;my culture&quot;. The corporate banker said: &quot;When I travel to New York, I am always struck by the percentage of white Caucasians in the banks there. Here in Tokyo it&apos;s overwhelmingly Japanese. But in London you have the whole world population represented. I may go to a desk in a major bank and not find a single English person on the team. They may be from India, from Lebanon, from anywhere \u2026 That&apos;s London.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["She admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital when she returned to Tokyo from the US in the early 1970s and from 1977 has lived voluntarily on an open ward, building a studio across the street and commuting back and forth on a daily basis."], "tags": ["Yayoi Kusama", "Art", "UK news", "Art and design", "Damien Hirst", "London", "Painting", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-07T18:12:21Z", "title": "Yayoi Kusama arrives at Tate Modern with a polka at Damien Hirst", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/07/yayoi-kusama-tate-modern-damien-hirst", "article": "Aged 82 and after more than 60 years as one of the world&apos;s &quot;most interesting, arresting and intriguing&quot; artists, Yayoi Kusama may finally be about to break into the wider public consciousness with the first big retrospective of her work in the west. Kusama left her native Japan \u2013 and the mental health hospital where she resides \u2013 for the first time in 12 years, arriving in London on Tuesday for an exhibition of her work at Tate Modern which takes in her entire career as a painter, sculptor, film-maker, novelist and more. It includes work featuring her signature dots, her liberal use of phalluses, her naked interventions and a spectacular new mirrored room installation conceived specially for the show. The artist \u2013 red wig, vibrant lipstick, polka-dot dress \u2013 has proved a tricky interviewee in the past. She curtailed one interview with the New York Times after just one question (&quot;Why do you smile so seldom?&quot;). On Tuesday she was more than happy to answer questions about her art, her mental health and her attitudes to men. On the latter, Kusama, speaking through a translator, admitted: &quot;I don&apos;t have many positive feelings about men. I haven&apos;t had sex with a man for decades. My father was the type who would play around and womanise a lot and I saw this all the time through my wretched childhood. That probably affected me a lot.&quot; Is she afraid of men, Kusama was asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; came the reply. Or perhaps that should be straight men, as Kusama also fondly recalled her years in New York, when many of her friends were gay men she employed as assistants and helpers. She also staged a gay wedding as a &quot;summer happening&quot; and later wrote a gay-themed novel, The Hustler&apos;s Grotto of Christopher Street. Kusama&apos;s work cannot be disentangled from the mental health problems she has experienced. She admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital when she returned to Tokyo from the US in the early 1970s and from 1977 has lived voluntarily on an open ward, building a studio across the street and commuting back and forth on a daily basis. Kusama said she had been able to channel her illness into her art. &quot;The doctors have said that it is because I have been able to channel it in this way, it has kept it in check and that is also precisely what many people love about my art.&quot; She has been using dots in her art since before Damien Hirst was born. Asked how she felt about Hirst and his spot paintings, Kusama said she had been using polka dots since she was a child: &quot;I have made it into a symbol of love and peace.&quot; She added: &quot;I love Damien Hirst, I respect his work a great deal and I am very happy that the polka dots that I started using [as a young girl] have become a symbol of love and peace around the world with everyone joining hands to use them together in this way.&quot; Having said that, Kusama also made what could be seen as a dig at Hirst. &quot;People ask about art and commercialism,&quot; she said. &quot;I think that if someone tries to sell their work at a high price that is the wrong way of doing it. You should create a work that is so valuable it might eventually sell at a high price but you&apos;ve got to concentrate on how you create that artwork.&quot; She added: &quot;I have done all the work myself, not assistants. That&apos;s why I&apos;m in a wheelchair, I&apos;ve been doing it physically \u2013 it&apos;s hard labour \u2013 throughout my life.&quot; The Tate Modern show&apos;s curator, Frances Morris, said Kusama was &quot;one of the most interesting, arresting and intriguing artists alive today,&quot; and should be better-known. At the forefront of zeitgeist moments in the last 50 years of art history, &quot;Kusama has been ahead of the game almost continuously in different ways&quot;, Morris said. But one reason she&apos;s not a superstar in the west is that she &quot;never hung around at those moments, she doesn&apos;t embed herself as the key player. She never stayed in one place long enough for that accrual of status and connectivity.&quot; That may all change as a result of the Tate Modern show, just as the standing of Louise Bourgeois only rose late in her life. After London the show travels to the Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid and the Whitney in New York. Yayoi Kusama is at Tate Modern from 9 February to 5 June. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 February 2012. The original said the Kusama show will travel to the Pompidou in Paris after London, when in fact the show has already been at the Pompidou. This has been corrected.

There have been dots on canvases, on walls, on naked bodies and on giant sculpted fruit. At her Tate Modern retrospective, bloated, ketchup-coloured inflatable balls decorated with white spots hang from the ceiling and lurk about the entrance. They attract infants, but repel adults like me. Kusama is difficult. Her dots spatter the walls and furnishings of a living room with UV-lit Day-Glo stickers. You want to bat them away like flies, but you can&apos;t. An artist of extreme and extremely variable works, Kusama is a phenomenon. She has been a maker of happenings, orgies and performances, and a political and sexual activist; she performed a theatrical gay wedding in New York in 1968, designing a conjoined polka-dotted outfit for the happy couple. She has been an installation artist, dress designer, art dealer, sculptor, pianist, poet and novelist (at least 18 novels, as well as an autobiography). Phew. Ranging from the exquisite to the eye-wrenchingly brutal, Kusama&apos;s art is hard to take en masse. There is nothing halfway about what she does, nor has there ever been. Now in her 80s, she still works every day in her large Tokyo studio, across the street from the mental institution where she has lived quietly since 1977. Art has been a way of coping, and of delivering herself from both her inner problems and from those around her. She was ambitious from the first, for her art as much as herself. Championed by Georgia O&apos;Keeffe and Lucio Fontana, Kusama also had close\u00a0relationships with artists Donald Judd and Joseph Cornell. She seems to have had multiple lives. Her inflatables do nothing to prepare you for her early watercolours, oil paintings and other works made in response to her formative training in the traditional Japanese Nihonga style. (This was promoted by the dictatorship during the second world war, and became associated with Japanese nationalism.) Born in 1929, Kusama grew up wanting to be an artist, but was forced to work during the war, like many school-age children, in deplorable conditions in a factory. She also suffered from hallucinations from an early age. Family life was difficult, even as her reputation in Japan grew. Her early works have a disturbing intensity and concentration. She painted barren landscapes, knotty things like tree roots or guts, decaying and rotting sunflowers in a field, vertiginous webs of lines, globular cells that might be distant planets. Moving to the US in 1957, Kusama ended up in New York. There, she developed a singular body of works: her Infinity Net paintings, which fill a room here. You almost need to rub your nose as well as your eyes in them. These are paintings of great delicacy, and of almost unbearably laborious execution; the grand white and off-white surfaces sing with tiny circles and arcs of pigment, the skeins of white playing off yet another veiled colour beneath. Sometimes the paint thickens in gnarly excrescences, then fades back again into the rhythm of repeated marks \u2013 which cover canvases much bigger than the artist herself. The largest Kusama ever painted was 10m wide. Imagine her covering all that ground, day after day, in her small, repeated notations. The effort must have been as daunting as it was\u00a0therapeutic. Judd, at the beginning of his career as an artist, lived in the same building as Kusama. They became lovers, and encouraged one another&apos;s art. Her white Infinity Net paintings are almost minimalist, although her rigour had another purpose: staying sane. Later, Judd was to help her fabricate works which, instead of being obliterations, she called Accumulations. Shoes, cupboards and chairs, even a rowing boat which she and Judd found somewhere on the New York streets, began to sprout white, stuffed fabric phalluses. Cocks grew everywhere, like funghi in the dark. Later, they grew plant-like, resembling some writhing, undersea life. Kusama&apos;s boat now sits spotlit in a room whose floors, walls and ceiling are papered with repeated photographic images of the boat itself, printed on black paper. Peer into the boat and among the white, lumpy penises are a pair of high heels. Kusama has said she has a fear of the penis. By the time Kusama left New York in the early 1970s, she was arguably more famous than Andy Warhol. Returning to Japan, she was quickly forgotten by the art world she had left behind, though her work undoubtedly influenced, in small ways, both Warhol and Louise Bourgeois. But still Kusama went on working, and in 1993 was the first woman to represent Japan at the Venice Biennale. In 1998 she was interviewed by Damien Hirst, who himself has been covering the world in dots, doubtless influenced by Kusama. One difference between Kusama and most so-called outsider artists is that she has been a consummate insider; her work, rather than being stuck in a singular track, has developed and changed through her entire career. There is always a sense of variation, of shifts in medium, scale and substance. The same intensity pulses through them all. Kusama&apos;s installations have become ever more grandiose. At Tate Modern, an entire furnished living room \u2013 dining table, crockery and glasses, chairs, the floor, walls, mirrors and paintings \u2013 is submerged in purplish light, where coloured dots fluoresce under the UV lamps. Kusama is singing something on the TV in the corner: I&apos;m Here, But Nothing is the title of the work. The dots are far from joyful. A blizzard of sensation, they make the room unhomely and threatening; they make me wonder what the experience of psychosis might be like. In 1965, Kusama made a room covered entirely in mirrors, turning the space into a chamber of infinite reflections. She has returned to this form many times, becoming more baroque as technology and money have allowed. In a disorientating mirrored space towards the end of this retrospective, little LED lights multiply into forests of glowing light, shifting in colour and intensity. Infinity Mirror Room \u2013 Filled with the Brilliance of Life is captivating, but feels like a sort of trick, as you disappear among your own reflections. Kusama&apos;s best trick has been to stay alive, but more than that, her art has a palpable energy and a sometimes malevolent intensity \u2013 however playful it seems. It has a kind of truth."}, {"sentences": ["The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] was forced to increase the amount of cooling water being injected into the No 2 reactor after its temperature soared to 73.3C earlier this week."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "World news", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-08T04:52:00Z", "title": "Rising temperatures at Fukushima raise questions over stability of nuclear plant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/08/fukushima-rising-temperatures-stability-nuclear-reactor", "article": "Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant say they are regaining control of a reactor after its temperature rose dramatically this week, casting doubt on government claims that the facility has been stabilised. The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] was forced to increase the amount of cooling water being injected into the No 2 reactor after its temperature soared to 73.3C earlier this week. By Tuesday night, the temperature had dropped to 68.5C at the bottom of the reactor&apos;s containment vessel, where molten fuel is believed to have accumulated after three of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s six reactors suffered meltdown after last year&apos;s tsunami disaster. The temperature at the bottom of the No 2 reactor vessel had risen by more than 20C in the space of several days, although it remained below the 93C limit the US nuclear regulatory commission sets for a safe state known as cold shutdown. Tepco said it had also injected water containing boric acid to prevent a nuclear chain reaction known as re-criticality.  The operator said the sudden rise in temperature did not call in to question the government&apos;s declaration in December that all three damaged reactors had achieved cold shutdown. &quot;The temperature of the reactor pressure vessel seems to be close to peaking out,&quot; Junichi Matsumoto, a Tepco spokesman, told reporters. Late last year, however, the minister in charge of the response to the Fukushima disaster, Goshi Hosono, conceded that officials had no idea about the exact location of molten uranium fuel but assumed that it had come to rest at the bottom of its containment vessels. Hosono said the temperature rise may have been triggered by work to replace a cooling pipe after freezing weather in north-eastern Japan caused a number of water leaks at the site. The use of bigger volumes of water to cool the No 2 reactor presents Tepco with the additional problem of a build-up of radioactive water. The utility said recently it had processed more than 220,000 cubic metres of contaminated water using treatment facilities, but added that as much as 95,000 cubic metres \u2013 enough to fill 38 Olympic-sized swimming pools \u2013 may have accumulated in the reactors&apos; basements. Tepco workers started injecting water into overheating reactors after the 11 March tsunami crippled the backup power supply to cooling systems. The Fukushima Daiichi accident has led to the closure of all but three of Japan&apos;s 54 reactors, to undergo regular maintenance and new stress tests designed to gauge their ability to withstand powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. The Yomiuri Shimbun said this week that the government planned to restart two reactors in Ohi, western Japan, before the last reactor is due to go offline at the end of April. If the restarts do not take place by then, Japan will be without a single working nuclear reactor. But the trade minister, Yukio Edano, said that no deadline had been set to restart any reactors, a move some experts say should wait until the official investigation into the Fukushima accident has been completed. Edano acknowledged that an early restart would be difficult, given lingering public concern over the safety of nuclear power. &quot;The only standard is whether we can gain a certain level of understanding from the local people and the public,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Best of all is Ayuma the chimpanzee in Tokyo who easily outperforms Liz in committing numbers to memory, then recalling them in the right order after they&apos;re been covered up."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Animal behaviour", "Science", "Primatology"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-08T22:30:00Z", "title": "TV review: Super Smart Animals; Roger & Val Have Just Got In", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/feb/08/super-smart-animals-tv-review", "article": "Ah yes, Tillman the skateboarding bulldog from Venice Beach, Los Angeles.

This, too, is something he&apos;s never been taught or had to do before; it doesn&apos;t come through thousands of years of evolution, it&apos;s a flash of inspiration, an epiphany, a Eureka moment. Amazingly, human visitors to the same zoo are unable to figure it out. Dur, stupid humans. A Hawaiian heron called Hank demonstrates he can plan ahead; British homing pigeons show they can remember; Honduran dolphins display creativity; Californian sealions can be taught the difference between numbers and letters. And still on education, and still in California (it&apos;s where all the brainiest animals come from), a parrot called Alex knows numbers and letters, can identify objects and materials, and can understand concepts like same and different. Well, knew, could, and understood, actually, because at the height of his powers, aged 25, Alex the parrot sadly died (someone should do a sketch about it). But he did change the way the world thinks about animals and learning. And that&apos;s a piece of luck, because I&apos;m not sure Alex&apos;s protege, another African Grey called Griffin, is going to do much to further Alex&apos;s work. He just seems a bit, well, thick. At times Super Smart Animals does feel a bit like a trawl around YouTube (they forgot the surfing sheep!); that or a children&apos;s science programme \u2013 it&apos;s presented by Bang Goes the Theory&apos;s Liz Bonnin, who&apos;s very bouncy and very bubbly. She could have done more to show off her (genuine) science credentials as well as her lovely smile; but then it is a nice change to have a science programme that isn&apos;t some Scottish bloke banging on about rocks. And come on, it&apos;s animals doing amazing (and amusing things); you can&apos;t go wrong with that. Best of all is Ayuma the chimpanzee in Tokyo who easily outperforms Liz in committing numbers to memory, then recalling them in the right order after they&apos;re been covered up. Amazing! I&apos;m thinking if he can do that with numbers, surely he could do it with cards too. You could take him to Vegas, clean up. Rain Animal. Roger &amp; Val Have Just Got In (BBC2) is back for another series. I&apos;m surprised, I have to say. I simply don&apos;t get it, though I know it has its admirers. It&apos;s a beautifully observed portrait of everyday life and a relationship, they say, poignant and touching. I could switch off the telly and look in the living room mirror for that, I say; I want a bit more from a drama; it&apos;s boring. It&apos;s well acted by Dawn French and Alfred Molina, they say. OK, they can have that. It&apos;s Mike Leigh, they say. It&apos;s not, it&apos;s Mike Leigh-Lite, Mike Leigh Zero. This has neither the grit nor the humour of Mike Leigh. Perhaps I&apos;m being old-fashioned, but the dearth of jokes is a slight problem for me \u2013 if this is a comedy, as\u00a0I&apos;m led to believe. It&apos;s a sitcom, without the com. It&apos;s a sit. Or a sit-through, because rarely has half an\u00a0hour felt so long."}, {"sentences": ["Now 82, and resident by choice for the past 35 years in a psychiatric care home in her native Tokyo, Kusama is currently seeing all her wishes come true."], "tags": ["Yayoi Kusama", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-12T00:05:58Z", "title": "Yayoi Kusama \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/12/yayoi-kusama-tate-modern-review", "article": "All art is attention-seeking, but few artists have ever taken their demands to be noticed to the extremes of Yayoi Kusama. Now 82, and resident by choice for the past 35 years in a psychiatric care home in her native Tokyo, Kusama is currently seeing all her wishes come true. Not only has she been granted this obsessive-compulsive 14-room retrospective by the Tate, one of her career-defining Infinity Net paintings sold for $5.1m in 2008, a\u00a0record for a living female artist. Success did not come easily. Born in patriarchal and deeply conservative Japan of the late 1920s, even the idea of becoming an artist, as a woman, must have taken a supreme effort of will. To become an artist quite as liberated from convention as Kusama must have felt a lot like the insanity she has always feared \u2013 and to some extent nurtured \u2013 in herself. Her autobiography, Infinity Net, translated for this show, traces, with suitably dreamlike intensity, the web of influences that shaped her and her art. As a child, she claims to have experienced hallucinations, and nightmarish out of body experiences, which she subsequently attempted to describe in paranoid, vivid paintings alive with eyes and threatening organic forms, some of which, from the 1950s, make an alarming and expressive opening to the exhibition. She seems to have been drawn to surrealism, but given it a less playful, more psychologically unbalanced field, an edge perhaps explained by the fact that\u00a0at the same age as she was seeing her visions, she was forced by her mother to spy on her father in bed with\u00a0his string of mistresses and geishas. She developed a loathing of phallic images, and an overwhelming fascination with voyeurism. Her response to these disturbing, formative forces seems twofold: she sought a kind of self-obliteration, covering herself and everything around her with her trademark polka dots \u2013 there is, among many other spotted surfaces, a fabulously spacey suburban living room here in which the edges of objects, sofas and tables are blurred by primary-coloured circular stickers, picked out in a psychedelic light. Elsewhere, mirrored &quot;infinity rooms&quot; take these points of colour into more dimensions than the eye can easily cope with. Almost nothing has been immune from Kusama&apos;s dottiness: horses and cats, buses and houses, trees and fields and rivers, she has camouflaged them all. Damien Hirst&apos;s outsourced efforts look decidedly spotty by comparison.     Yayoi Kusama at Tate Modern. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Alongside these identity-denying projects she also sought to overcome her phallic anxieties with a workaholic kind of aversion therapy. For a long period in middle age, she painstakingly stitched together apparently infinite numbers of &quot;soft-sculpted&quot; penises, which, her autobiography suggests, she found perverse solace in lying down among. These forms, made from stuffed surgical-looking cloth, grow out of chairs and lamps, shoes and bookshelves. In one celebrated instance, Kusama covered an entire rowing boat with them, oars and all; the boat is given a room of its own here, complete with the 999 reproductions of the image which paper walls, floor and ceiling. Elsewhere, the teeming, faceless sock puppets create cacti-like forests, run wild, and coming at you from all angles \u2013 again, the psycho-dramatists of contemporary British art, Tracey Emin and Sarah Lucas, are made to seem somewhat lightweight in their neuroses. Kusama arrived in America, having corresponded with Georgia O&apos;Keeffe, in 1957. By the early 60s, she was exhibiting alongside Claes Oldenburg and Andy Warhol, both of whom she seems to have influenced, with her manic exhibitionism as much as anything. The 60s in New York, the mix of underground promiscuity and hallucinogens, were waiting for her, in a way. She became a self-styled shaman, organising orgies and happenings in which hippies lost and found themselves by painting one another&apos;s nakedness with Kusama&apos;s polka dots until the NYPD arrived, to clear up the mess. The human dot-to-dot events were captured on films, which gained an arthouse following, and which are oddly compulsive viewing now as ethnographic documents \u2013 like those early films of the lost tribes of Papua New Guinea \u2013 evidence of another, hairier, time and place altogether. Kusama was a curator of these events, never a participant, except with a pot of poster paint; still, she returned to Japan in the early 70s carrying some of their generally good-natured lunacy with her, and checked herself into an asylum, where she has lived as an ostentatious recluse ever since. In recent years she has returned to painting canvases; large, vibrantly coloured pictures which play with her recurring vocabulary of eyes and roots and wriggling spermatazoa-like forms, and which taken together have a borrowed aboriginal quality. She came over for the opening of this show, a rare public sighting, and sat in her polka-dotted wheelchair, in her polka-dotted dress in the midst of all this colour, looking like a child in the internal landscape of her own making, half magic roundabout, half Freudian case study. You wouldn&apos;t, you guess, want to live in this landscape full-time, but as a tourist destination, it certainly makes for a lively hour or so."}, {"sentences": ["The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said the temperature inside No 2 reactor \u2013 one of three that suffered meltdown after last year&apos;s earthquake and tsunami \u2013 may have reached 82C on Sunday."], "tags": ["Japan", "Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-12T11:40:50Z", "title": "Fukushima reactor readings raise reheating concern", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/12/fukushima-reactor-reheating-concern", "article": "Concern is growing that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan is no longer stable after temperature readings suggested one of its damaged reactors was reheating. The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said the temperature inside No 2 reactor \u2013 one of three that suffered meltdown after last year&apos;s earthquake and tsunami \u2013 may have reached 82C on Sunday. Tepco said there was no evidence that the melted fuel inside had reached criticality. The utility reportedly increased the amount of cooling water being injected into the reactor along with a boric acid solution, which is used to prevent the fuel from undergoing sustained nuclear reactions. Confirmation that the temperature has risen above 80C could force the government to reverse its declaration two months ago that the crippled plant was in a safe state known as cold shutdown. Cold shutdown is achieved when the temperature inside the reactors remains below 100C and there is a significant reduction in radiation leaks. Given that Tepco assumes a margin of error of 20C, the actual temperature could have risen to 102C. Plant workers are unable to take accurate readings of the temperature inside the damaged reactor because radiation levels are still too high for them to enter and examine the state of the melted fuel, which is thought to be resting at the bottom of the reactor&apos;s pressure vessel. The result has been a series of wildly different readings: two other thermometers positioned at the bottom of No 2 reactor showed the temperature at 35C, local media reported. Tepco said it did not know the cause of the apparent temperature rise, but speculated that it might be due to problems with the supply of coolant or a faulty thermometer. &quot;We believe the state of cold shutdown is being maintained,&quot; said Junichi Matsumoto, a company spokesman. &quot;Rather than the actual temperature rising, we believe there is high possibility that the thermometer concerned is displaying erroneous data.&quot; Tepco was forced to inject additional cooling water into the same reactor last week after the temperature started rising at the beginning of the month."}, {"sentences": ["The company, which reported third-quarter results to the Tokyo stock exchange on Monday morning, said the losses were not linked to the fraud.", "Last month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange allowed Olympus to keep its stock market listing by fining it \u00a380,000 and telling it to submit reports on efforts to improve management."], "tags": ["Olympus", "Technology sector", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-13T12:30:37Z", "title": "Olympus warns of \u00a3260m annual losses", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/13/olympus-warns-annual-losses", "article": "The consumer and medical camera maker Olympus, which is embroiled in an accounting fraud case, has warned that its annual losses will be even worse than analyst estimates, totalling \u00a532bn (\u00a3260m).

The now defunct graphic design studio established the tone not only of this futuristic racer series, but also of PlayStation itself, the futuristic fonts, stylish menus and pantone patch colour schemes lending an edge of cultural consciousness that no video game system had enjoyed before.  And once again, the launch of Sony&apos;s brave new handheld the Vita \u2013 designed by the man behind the Japanese tech behemoth&apos;s Walkman \u2013 is lent an edge of much needed Helvetica-through-a-Tokyo-lens elegance by the studio&apos;s graphical legacy. The classic racing team logos and liveries of Feisar, AG Systems, Quirex, Auricom and Pir-hana remain just as sharp and iconic as when they debuted all those years ago, while the unlock structure and menus enjoy purity, clarity and class. On the track, however, SCE Studio Liverpool&apos;s latest fizzes with particle explosion, light trails and graphical details that are wholly contemporary. As a showcase for what the handheld is capable of, WipeOut 2048 is unrivalled in the launch line-up, ably handling eight vehicle scrambles through a variety of richly detailed futuristic New York vistas. Clasping such a volatile kinetic display in your hands feels new and unusual, a feat of technology that nobody would have dared dream of when first dreaming up the original WipeOut&apos;s vision of the future. That original vision \u2013 at least in terms of the world \u2013 has been revisited and amended for WipeOut 2048, a prequel of sorts that chooses a new New York half-imagined, half-recreated for its clutch of tracks. The result is a racing game world that dials up the detail with suspension bridges, skyscrapers, and cat&apos;s cradles of overhead electrical wires, introducing a strain of realism that is at odds with the spotlessness of WipeOut games past. In practical racing terms the shift has two consequences: it becomes harder to distinguish what&apos;s happening in the squall of detail on screen while screaming around bends and down straights, and loading times multiply. For all the understated cool of WipeOut 2048&apos;s menus \u2013 and make no mistake: the clean, honeycomb stage selection screen enjoys wonderful form and function \u2013 in play, the game is more fussy than previous entries.  While trailing the pack it can be hard to pick out rivals, intelligibility a victim of the studio&apos;s creative flair in detailing the world. Meanwhile, protracted load times can take upwards of 40 seconds to load each race, a pause at least 20 seconds too long in the era of insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms. The additional track detail ramps up the difficulty in ways the developer perhaps didn&apos;t intend, and likewise the reduced travel-distance of the Vita&apos;s analogue stick slightly reduces the sense of taut control by comparison to the PS3&apos;s WipeOut HD. Beyond these technical impediments, the game has been designed with something of a steep learning curve (although you&apos;ll be asked if you want to skip an event if you fail at it too many times) and once you make it through the first season&apos;s worth of races, you&apos;ll need to switch off the pilot assist and knuckle down to properly learn the intricacies and short cuts of each track. Structurally, the game draws you in with interspersed event types that favour ships according to their defensive capabilities, weaponry or raw speed and acceleration depending on the race criteria. As well as straight eight-man races there are combat-focused events, which even allow you to drive the wrong way around the track as you seek to score hits on your rivals.  Arguably the best of the set is Zone, a neon-trail dream-like endless race in which your ship auto-accelerates, your only task to steer it from the sides that chip away at your health till it&apos;s depleted. The range of events feels a little lean in the latter stages of the game, but the increased demands on your skills as a driver ensure interest derives from the on-going mounting challenge. The multiplayer directly mirrors the unlock structure of the single player campaign, layering overarching objectives over the main races themselves. Each race presents you with a particular objective \u2013 not necessarily finishing in pole position \u2013 and as you earn gold stars for completing these tasks so you make progress across the main map. Switching between the single and multiplayer campaigns is done at the tap of a persistent icon on the map screen, and the structure threads both halves into a cohesive whole. Despite its visual consistency with the previous titles that share the family name WipeOut 2048 represents a concerted attempt to evolve the series in interesting ways, while making shrewd, restrained use of the new handheld&apos;s features. In this aim it finds mixed success, often sacrificing finesse in exchange for novelty, but in that creativity a new energy and revived sense of character can be found.Simon Parkin Uncharted: The Golden Abyss \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605     Uncharted: The Golden Abyss    PS Vita; \u00a339.99; cert 16+; SCE Bend Studio/Sony It&apos;s fair to say that Sony has a lot riding on Uncharted: The Golden Abyss. This game, after all, is an example of the sort of deeper and richer experience Sony is hoping will attract mobile phone gamers to their new portable console. To be frank, its success or failure is probably the best litmus test one could have for the fortunes of the PS Vita. So it helps Sony&apos;s cause immensely that, like all the other entries in the Uncharted series, The Golden Abyss is a well-written, deeply immersive and visually gorgeous game. Set before the first entry in the Uncharted series, it sees cocksure adventurer Nathan Drake on the trail of some Spanish gold in the jungles of Central America. Before the first half-an-hour is up, he&apos;s been betrayed, shot at, and partnered up with a sassy female archaeologist (is there any other type in these games?). The pair of them set out to find her lost grandfather and hilarity inevitably ensues. The folks at Sony&apos;s Bend Studio have made sure The Golden Abyss remains true to the series&apos; fantastic production values. They&apos;ve also not deviated much from the overall gameplay, which is still a mix of platforming, puzzle solving, combat and the odd instance of stealth. Players use the game&apos;s dual-sticks to move Drake and the camera view and the buttons cover his range of movements. For the most part, the controls feel comfortable and intuitive.  However, players will experience the odd instance where they&apos;ll have to use the game&apos;s touch-surface interfaces and while some of these added extras are quite fun \u2013 such as using the front and back touch-surfaces to clean off a newly discovered clue, others are incredibly irritating, such as the QTE swipes required to beat enemies in hand-to-hand combat. One can&apos;t help but feel that a lot of these functions could have \u2013 and should have \u2013 been mapped to the console&apos;s more traditional controls. It seems the only reason they haven&apos;t is because Sony has spent an awful lot of money ensuring that the PSVita has a ton of extra features, so it&apos;s determined that you, the player, are going to jolly well use them. These new controls, however, aren&apos;t exactly deal-breakers, and they don&apos;t detract from the key strength of The Golden Abyss; it&apos;s a solidly entertaining romp.  It doesn&apos;t stray too far from the series&apos; basic blueprint, either in terms of its mechanics or its story, but then, that&apos;s half of Uncharted&apos;s charm. Players don&apos;t sign up to these games for innovative new features as much as they do to see what trouble Nathan&apos;s managed to land in this week, and how he&apos;ll get himself out of it. The Golden Abyss is a solid entry in the Uncharted canon, and if the world&apos;s a smarter place than it looks, it should be enough to win over the Angry Birds crowd.

Minigame collections with cutesy cartoon looks, they share the piled-high feeling of developers having a mess around with everything Vita&apos;s got to offer: they have you frantically switching between waving the handheld, swiping the touchscreen, stroking the back and sometimes yelling at it. Here&apos;s the difference: only one of them turns all that clever stuff into something fun, and it&apos;s the really stupid one that wins out. So which game is triumphantly dumb? It&apos;s Frobisher Says \u2013 a quickfire compendium of daftness, in the style of Wario Ware and the sacred Bishi Bashi. Kevin Eldon puts in the vocals, commanding you to &quot;open my clams&quot; or &quot;rain on this parade&quot;, at which you&apos;re slung into a game with no warning at all of what it wants you to do. There&apos;s a different gesture system or control scheme in every game, leading to plenty of insta-fails.  This isn&apos;t ruinously annoying, because the payoff for flunking is nearly as good as the one for winning: either way, you get a funny animation and a delightful bit of Eldon-sneer, and then you&apos;re on to the next thing before you can say &quot;Frobisher&quot;. Everything gets a laugh at least first time, followed by the satisfaction of figuring out how to do whatever you&apos;ve been tasked with. The really stupid thing? This brilliant piece of idiocy is a freebie, available as a launch title for the pre-order crowd and then to everyone (for nothing) come May.  Everything Frobisher does well, Deviants does too \u2013 just a bit worse. For one thing, it goes for a loose story (aliens vs zombies and robots) that just slows the whole thing down. Then it sticks a pass/fail structure on all the minigames, which range from racers to shooters to something that&apos;s basically a very expensive version of those plastic pinball mazes that come in party bags and make you want to chew your hand off. (You can move on to something else without defeating the current game, but you&apos;ll be stuck shaking that alien in the maze for long minutes till you die, and you need wins to open up new challenges.) That&apos;s fine when the games are entertaining, but too often, they&apos;re not. A clever little shooter that uses the camera to put attacking robots in your own surroundings is neat; but a game that has you launching a hot air balloon by tickling the back screen while jabbing the front screen to pop enemies while swiping holes in your balloon to patch it up while swerving the Vita around to steer ... well, that&apos;s exactly as enjoyable as you&apos;d expect doing four puny manual tasks at once for no particular reason to be. Trying to do more isn&apos;t always rewarding. Frobisher says: keep it stupid, stupid.Sarah Ditum Gravity Rush \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605     Gravity Rush    PS Vita; \u00a334.99; Sony Gravity Rush instantly stands out among the roster of launch games for the PS Vita: more because of what it isn&apos;t than what it is. The practicalities of readying games for new consoles invariably lead to over-familiarity, as it&apos;s much simpler for publishers to port existing games to the new platform. But Gravity Rush is one of the few completely original games for the Vita. That&apos;s because it was originally planned to be a PS3 game, but its design team at Sony&apos;s Japan Studio had a handy inside line to the Vita, and took the executive decision to bring it out on the handheld console instead. That would all count for much less if Gravity Rush bore any sort of close resemblance to any existing games but, happily, it feels quite unlike anything that has gone before. In terms of general feel, it adheres to the school of bonkersness which often gives Japanese games much of their appeal. Graphically, it takes an anime, comic-book-influenced approach, with outlined, stylised characters. But unlike the average Japanese game, it has been endowed with thoroughly original gameplay, too, to accompany its seductive visuals. It&apos;s best described as a third-person action-adventure game. You control Kat, a kick-ass blonde who starts the game suffering from amnesia. The game world is a large town which has recently become beset with anomalous shifts in gravity, which bring ugly, apparently alien monsters with them. Kat hooks up with a black cat, which turns out to have the ability to shift the way in which gravity affects her. Thus, you can point somewhere (either using the right stick or the Vita&apos;s motion-sensor) and float to it, even if it is on the side of a building; the direction in which gravity affects you will adjust itself accordingly so that, for example, you can then run up or down that building. Kat can also initiate a plummet to the ground, by reverting gravity to its normal state, then arrest it by gravity-shifting once more. And she has a neat set of kicks and punches, that improve as you progress through the game. Plus, importantly, a gravity-kick, the power of which is proportionate to the distance from which it is being executed. The gameplay mixes gravity-shifting pursuits (other gravity-shifting characters with less scrupulous intentions enter the equation early in the game), monster and boss-bashing and spatial awareness puzzles. Semi-interactive inter-chapter interludes, presented in the style of a comic strip, add an extra level of interest.  Gravity Rush is pleasantly distinctive and great fun to play, making decent use of the Vita&apos;s attributes without ever giving you the impression that they have been shoehorned in. If you&apos;re a devotee of Japanese anime, or just enjoy third-person action-adventure games with unusual gameplay and bags of character, you should find it pretty satisfying. The PS Vita needs more games like it.Steve Boxer"}, {"sentences": ["It\u00a0tells the story of Nadya Vall, a 13-year-old model from Siberia, who is scouted and sent to Tokyo to look for work \u2013 plucked from one wasteland, set down in another."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Children", "Life and style", "Society", "World news", "Slavery", "Film", "Culture", "Gender"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-13T19:30:01Z", "title": "Fashion's real victims | Tanya Gold", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/13/fashion-victims-child-models", "article": "Model abuse \u2013 it sounds like a joke.

It is about sick people and it exemplifies the industry. It\u00a0tells the story of Nadya Vall, a 13-year-old model from Siberia, who is scouted and sent to Tokyo to look for work \u2013 plucked from one wasteland, set down in another. Nadya is so young she wears a Teletubbies T-shirt and, like a child in a fairytale, falls into the hands of monsters. One is Tigran, the owner of the agency that scouted her. He used to be a soldier \u2013 &quot;I killed many people&quot; \u2013 but now he is in fashion. This he tells to the scout that found Nadya, his employee Ashley. She keeps naked dolls in her glassy house and takes secret pictures of models&apos; hands and feet under tables, then tries to match them together \u2013 Dr Frankenstein Wears Prada. Even I didn&apos;t think fashion people were this weird, and yet Ashley was a model. &quot;I was the person who hated this business more than anyone,&quot; she says. &quot;Anyone who does it must be an idiot.&quot; But it is Ashley who scouts the girls and lies to them. Nadya is told she will earn $4,000 on her trip, but ends up $2,000 in debt, with no way to pay it off. &quot;It&apos;s normal to be a prostitute \u2013 for them,&quot; says Ashley, as Nadya slowly realises her predicament. Girl Model is a horror film about the worship and eventual mutilation of innocence. They only had to turn on the camera.

Fashion will offer a half-answer \u2013 &quot;fresh&quot;, &quot;luminous&quot;, &quot;cute&quot; and so on \u2013 but then it isn&apos;t really a business of words. Nor does it love self-examination. I think it believes it must offer an ever-receding fantasy or no one will buy. Few consumers are very thin; even fewer are very young. As for the drawn, deathly faces of the children \u2013 well, fashion likes death too, because it makes us feel impermanent. To see models as they are \u2013 starved, exploited, exposed \u2013 we would have to accept fashion isn&apos;t really so joyous, more an expanding sweatshop covered in lip-gloss, dedicated to the punishment of the lovely. And so we ignore the reality that models are not the fortunate ones but paradigms of what fashion in its present state does to every woman. Empowerment through mainstream fashion is long gone, if it ever really existed. I\u00a0watch the identical faces and know Ashley is right when she takes photos from her custom-made box and matches feet to hands, and hands to feet. These women are body parts, placed in competition with other body parts. So hurrah for the birth of Model Alliance, an American movement founded by the ancient model Sara Ziff. She is 29, so in model years, is older than Bruce Forsyth. Model Alliance seeks to end financial exploitation, abuse of child labour and sexual molestation. &quot;Most models start their adult careers as minors and they labour in an unregulated business knowing that they are highly replaceable,&quot; says Ziff. Model Alliance has a fat brief because fashion is the swiftest of buck passers. When a model cracks or dies \u2013 the former model and anti-anorexia campaigner Isabelle Caro died in November 2010 \u2013 the blame passes from agency to designer to editor, to retailer, to you. Hey, thin children sell clothes! What to do? Well, health initiatives are in place at New York fashion week but they are elective, so probably not worth the satin they are sewn on. Otherwise unionisation is a start, even if the AGMs may look initially bizarre, a convention of beautiful giraffes, asking for the protection the less beautiful take for granted. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["JuergenTeller replies: He was sort of more influential when i met him in 1991 in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Photography", "Culture", "Art", "Fashion"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T16:39:00Z", "title": "Live webchat: post your questions for Juergen Teller", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/14/live-webchat-questions-juergen-teller", "article": "&quot;Sick&quot;, &quot;degenerate&quot; and &quot;execrable&quot; were just a few of the words readers of Germany&apos;s Die Zeit used to describe Juergen Teller&apos;s recent weekly column in the magazine, which paired the photographer&apos;s images with his own pithy commentaries. Teller is a controversial figure. Straddling fashion photography, art, portraiture and autobiography, his work is as inclusive as it is surprising, tender as it is shocking. Whether photographing the famous or his friends, artist Roni Horn swimming or David Hockney in his late mother&apos;s sitting room, Vivienne Westwood naked on a couch or his son getting a haircut, Teller brings an unmistakable candour to his work. He also regularly includes himself in his photographs \u2013 cavorting with Charlotte Rampling in a Paris hotel room or playing dressing-up games with Cindy Sherman for a Marc Jacobs ad campaign. He works with extremes of theatricality and intimacy, humour and abjection. Teller is no more kindly to himself, and he&apos;s happy to play the buffoon, the lover, the beast and the man shitting in the woods. Regarded as much as an artist as a fashion photographer, he also makes no distinctions between his very different projects. Put simply, he photographs his life. Teller, who has lived in London since 1986, having completed a very formal technical photography education in Munich, still insists on working with 35mm film rather than digital photography. Sometimes he uses the camera as though it were a machine gun. Being photographed by Teller is an unnerving experience, and I have the scars \u2013 or rather the pictures \u2013 to prove it. \u2022 Juergen Teller will be here to answer your questions between 1pm and 2pm (GMT) on Thursday 16 February. Post your questions below, then come here to join him in conversation on Thursday. We have posted the conversation here to make it easier to follow. jimmyshashin asks:  How influential was the work of Araki Nobuyoshi on your photographic thinking? JuergenTeller replies: He was sort of more influential when i met him in 1991 in Tokyo. I was very young at the time and I couldnt believe his immense power and enthusiasm in which he put his universe into photographs. I was so impressed with how free his mind was. I have just bought a book, last week in New York, of his Cat, like the sentimental journey of his wife, at the end the Cat gets cancer and dies. It is such a beautiful, moving work. I was seriously moved. He is brilliant. Definatelynotashark asks:  Hi Juergan, What did you think of Arsenal&apos;s performance last night? JuergenTeller replies:  Sad. SamSesemann asks:  How do you feel about the rise of digital photography as an artistic medium and why are you sticking with 35mm? Juergen replies:  I havent learned anything else. I am a creature of habit. carlseltz asks:  Dear JuergenCould you take Rankin in a fight? Juergen replies: What would be the point? TheBigBadWolf asks: When you&apos;re making your own, non-commissioned work you obviously have 100% control of the whole process, whereas in fashion photography I imagine you have to give the client what they want and maybe sometimes compromise ideas and put up with airbrushing of the models and so on. Is this ever a cause of frustration? Are you ever unhappy with the final images due to changes which you didn&apos;t authorise or want? Juergen replies: It is obviously a different thing, but I have never had any problems with clients wanting to airbrush the models. They will go somewhere else for that. I try my best to make it as interesting for myself as possible and therefore, good for the client too. Nothing is an easy ride, and of course sometimes I get frustrated, but I do try and maintain as much control as I can in the presentation, layout combinations etc. And of course I do respect the client. I have such a small client base, we know eachother very well and it is a great pleasure and satisfying. skinnyfinger asks:  Hello Jurgen, I am wondering how you defend your work in public as I&apos;m sure you have been scrutinized numerous times. How do you defend your views and the decision to crate what you have done? Specifically talking about nudes here. The reason for the question is because I&apos;m working on a project where I&apos;m sort of doing exactly that, but in a part of the world where this is extremely controversial. I kind of want to hear what you say if faced with difficult questions to answer? Secondly, can I assist you? :) Juergen replies:  I dont feel I have to defend myself to the public. Adrian Searle asks:  Juergen - a few years ago I and a number of other people asked you some questions for Self Service magazine, all of which you managed to duck out of. I&apos;ll asked one of them again: Being photographed by you is both a scary and pleasurable sort of collaboration. Actually it feels a bit like being fucked. How is it for you? Thanks!Adrian Juergen replies:  Im totally fucked afterwards but very happy, And it feels good.. At the beginning... nervous, excited, scared, flirtacious, annoyed, frustrated, helpless. When I come to the high point, confidant. Rachaelworld asks: What was the best mistake you learned from, and what did it teach you? Juergen replies: Mistakes are always good. violetadoprado asks:  I like keys to the house (was it all on contax g2?) - the contrast between the safety of the known, the familiar, the intimate (even if chaotic) and the outside, wild but still and silent nature. makes a void clear, very present. feels very different from your other work, though...did I missed the link or the point, or did something indeed change? Juergen replies:  Yes, it is all Contax G2.No, I dont think it is such a shift, have a look at Ed In Japan, or my Nurnberg book for example. We got the keys to the house in the country, two days after my friend and agent Katy Baggott died. We worked together for 17 years. We drove to the country the day after the funeral, opened the door, and I walked the countryside, taking photographs. hihoyotogo asks: Hello Juergen,I&apos;d like to know who you&apos;ve had the most fun working with and why ...you can pick 2 or 3 people if you&apos;re finding it difficult to decide(!) + I don&apos;t think you should include Sadie in this cos that&apos;s just favouritism ;-)Also, if you dare, who have you had the least fun working with and why?! Juergen replies: Just a few that come to mind.... Kristen McmenamyCerith Wynn EvansCharlotte Rampling I could go on and on... Hijinks asks: Hi Juergen - I&apos;m a Brit living in Germany and avidly followed your column in Zeit Magazin - I either liked or really liked most of the images (and texts) and some were just plain excellent. What did the average German make of them? And are you highly regarded in Germany as a photographer and/or artist? Anyhow - the Zeit photos were a good opportunity for me to rediscover your work. I was familiar with it in the late 90&apos;s when I lived in HH and knew your cousin Helmut. Lost contact, sadly, when I moved. Best, PK Juergen replies:  very sorry you lost contact with Helmut. I wanted to write down his number but my PA said I was mad. Thank you very much for your comments. Im publishing a book with Steidl very soon. Two volumes. One is Bilder und Texte (English and German editions) Its my column from Die Zeit, with a lot of unpublished work. The second volume, is called Literature, and it is a compilation of reader letters I received. And you can read there, what the average germans made of them! They are pretty devastating. It is a brilliant read. KateAbbott asks:  What was Vivienne Westwood like to work with? Juergen replies: Wonderful! RafaelaPandolfini asks: The images in your new show at Lehmann Maupin Gallery aren&apos;t immediately pleasing. Rather it takes a couple of moments and even a return to the pictures in order to fully appreciate them. In this way they challenge me for much longer than your work before (which I have always followed and truly admired). To me this is the sign of really interesting work would you agree?Over the past 20 years I feel as though your photography style has rather dramatically altered the accepted way flash is used and also the way that movement is used in a composition. Is there an inspirational artist/photographer for you that did/does the same thing? Juergen replies: I dont know. I dont try to think of it. I am just doing what I believe in. hihoyotogo asks: why are they so good to work with? what makes these people speacial to you? DaleBerning asks:  Are there images you&apos;ve come back to again and again throughout your career \u2013 and do you remember when you saw them first and what made them stick with you? Juergen replies:  Frozen Dead Dog, 1991 After my dads suicide, I wanted to visit Czechoslovakia, Christmas 1991, with my mother and my uncle. In this village, Schoenbach (which translates as pretty stream) where my dad was born. I didnt find a pretty stream, all I found was a frozen dead dog dumped in a dustbin. seachild asks:  Hi Juergen. How would you define an angle? Juergen replies: Never thought of it... I feel it, and it just makes sense to me. dany11 asks: Hi, mi name is dany.can I pose for you? Juergen replies: I cant really see enough of you to judge that one. Whats up with the hat? holzapfel asks: Dear Mr. Teller, you take pictures because it really helps you to come close to other people, right? Because it helps to keep away solitude and loneliness? Juergen replies: Interesting question. I will need to think about that a little more. Its a good question, thank you very much.Ive never thought of this before, you may be right. Or partly right for sure. MaudieMaudie asks:  Hello Jurgen! Do you ever become disillusioned by the art world or by your own ideas? If so what is your technique to tackle this. Best wishes,Maudie Juergen replies:  Of course I do. But one has to keep going. tujuh7 asks:  dear Juergen, what&apos;s your secret to make comfortable a model? you always get the best naturelness in your shots. Juergen replies:  Its just the way I am. I am myself, and I talk to them. JohnSee asks:  How do you deal with self doubt re your work? (Assuming you have any). Juergen replies:  It is always there. Its a good thing when one is insecure and doubts ones project. Its part of it all. Confidence and insecurity goes hand in hand. Juergen says: Dear Guardian ReadersThank you very much!Goodbye,Juergen Teller"}, {"sentences": ["She agreed, and Waste Not was first exhibited at the Tokyo gallery in Beijing in 2005."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "China", "London", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Barbican"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T17:05:16Z", "title": "Chinese artist brings five decades' worth of clutter to London exhibition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/14/chinese-artist-clutter-london-exhibition", "article": "Ten umbrellas, 16 chairs, three ancient radiators, innumerable medicine bottles and old boxes of tea \u2013 and that&apos;s just scratching the surface. On Tuesday, the Barbican in London opened its doors to reveal five decades&apos; worth of possessions accumulated by Zhao Xiangyuan, the mother of the Chinese conceptual artist Song Dong, 46. The 10,000 items, transported to London in two shipping containers, took a fortnight for Song and his family to arrange on the floor of the Barbican&apos;s corridor-like Curve gallery, creating a work called Waste Not. The slogan was drummed into the Chinese population during the cultural revolution: nothing was thrown away in case it could be used later. After Song&apos;s father died in 2002, depression turned his mother&apos;s thrift into hoarding and her house in Beijing was stuffed with clutter. &quot;I asked her why she wanted to fill the room with what to me is rubbish, and she said: &apos;If I fill the room, the things remind me of your father.&apos;&quot; He suggested his mother should collaborate with him by arranging the possessions into an artwork. She agreed, and Waste Not was first exhibited at the Tokyo gallery in Beijing in 2005. &quot;So many people came who had a similar life during the cultural revolution and talked to my mother for half a day at a time,&quot; said Song. &quot;They told her: &apos;It&apos;s not your home, it&apos;s my home.&apos; It got my mother out of her sadness \u2013 she said she had a second life.&quot; The work was also shown at Moma in New York in 2009, the year Song&apos;s mother died. &quot;For me, the most emotional items are the soap,&quot; he said, referring to a pile of what look like bricks. &quot;When I got married my mother gave me it and I said: &apos;Why? I use a washing machine.&apos; She was ashamed and said: &apos;I&apos;ll keep it for you.&apos; When I started to do this work I learned that it&apos;s not soap, it&apos;s her love.&apos;&quot; Born in 1966, Song&apos;s work has often tackled the cultural revolution&apos;s impact on his family, as well as China&apos;s changing political and cultural landscape. From 2003 to 2006, he made a series of sculptures out of biscuits called Eating the City, which were displayed, and consumed, in places including Selfridge&apos;s department store in London. His 1996 work Breathing saw him lying face down in two locations in Beijing: Tiananmen Square and the frozen Houhai Lake.

But gains are limited, with a good dose of scepticism that Greece can avoid a default at this stage.  Markets have also taken comfort from Chinese comments about helping the euro, although they were short on detail. Louise Cooper, markets analyst at BGC Partners, said:  Markets have shrugged off the news out last night that today&apos;s eurozone finance ministers meeting has been cancelled and replaced by a conference call. The sticking point seems to be the Troika&apos;s desire for the Greek political class to sign a &quot;statement of support&quot; promising that any newly elected government will stick to its programme. Given that the current most popular party leader, Samaras, has repeatedly said - most recently on Sunday - that he would renegotiate the terms of the bailout if he got to power, this is probably a wise move by the paymasters. But from the Greek perspective is it not best to promise anything just to get the money? Isn&apos;t it better to default once you have the cash rather than before? And once the money is in the bank, win an election by promising the Greek electorate that less will be paid back (in one way or another). That is bound to be a popular and winning political strategy.

Patrick Yau at Peel Hunt said:  Following a strong run, ITV shares are now trading close to our 83p price target. We therefore bring our recommendation on the stock down from Buy to Hold, as we approach the company&apos;s preliminary results release at the end of February.  With much of the upswing in 2012 TV revenues now factored into our numbers for the year, given a boost by the euro 2012 tournament in the summer, we believe the upside now looks limited in the absence of upgrades. The wild card remains an EPS-enhancing acquisition (now the company has eliminated its net debt) but we have not incorporated this into our investment thesis.

Back in 1924 Britain\u2019s Harry Mallin, the defending middleweight champion, lost a split decision at the Paris Games to France\u2019s Roger Brousse in the quarter-finals. Mallin complained, showing the referee bite marks on his chest and shoulder (the British press later suggested that Brousse had been \u201csampling the unroasted beef of Old England\u201d), and after an appeal the home fighter was disqualified (it emerged that Brousse\u2019s first-round opponent had also complained of being bitten). Brousse\u2019s fans had to be restrained by the police. Then the Frenchman emerged for the final and it took another intervention from the massed gendarmes to allow Mallin to take his rightful place against John Elliott.   Related: British boxing ridicules plan to let professionals fight at Rio Olympics    Four years later in Amsterdam there were further violent ringside ructions after home-team decisions, at the Rome Games in 1960 judges were sacked after a series of incompetent decisions, in 1968 Choh Dong-kih staged an hour-long sit-down protest in the ring in Tokyo after a disqualification, while Spain\u2019s Valent\u00edn Loren chinned the referee after his DQ. It\u2019s a long and murky history. Or perhaps not that murky given the brazenness of some judging decisions. And the most brazenly bad decision of modern times came in Seoul in 1988 when Roy Jones Jr took on South Korea\u2019s Park Si-hun in the light middleweight gold medal match. The boxing in Seoul had been tumultuous from the off and reached an early nadir in the ugly clinch-strewn bantamweight battle between Bulgaria\u2019s Alexander Hristov and South Korea\u2019s Byun Jong-il. Byun was twice docked points by the referee, New Zealand\u2019s Keith Walker. The deductions cost him the fight and led to Korean officals piling into the ring, aiming kicks and punches at Walker. The referee fled the arena and, almost immediately, the country. While he made his escape, Byun sat in the ring for 67 minutes in protest. The 19-year-old Jones had blazed his way to the final in a flurry of bionic left hooks and twinkling toes. It took him two minutes to dispose of M\u2019tendere Makalamba in his opening match, a brief and brutal affair. Czechoslovakia\u2019s Michal Franek survived a pummelling in the second round, but lost by unanimous 5-0 decision. Jones skipped around the ring pinging punches into Yevgeni Zaytsev\u2019s face in the quarter-finals on his way to another 5-0 win, and was tested by Britain\u2019s Richie Woodhall in the semi-final but largely untroubled and was given another unanimous decision by the judges. Park, meanwhile, had been far less impressive. Some observers felt he could, possibly should, have lost all four of his fights on the way to the final. Certainly Vincenzo Nardiello felt he deserved the nod from the judges in their quarter-final \u2013 when the 3-2 split decision went to the South Korean, the three-times Italian champion went to remonstrate furiously with the officials and had to be dragged away from the ring. The final, on the last day of boxing at the Games, was a rout, Jones, barely bothering to raise his guard, landed 86 punches to Park\u2019s 32. The Korean took two standing eight counts and was twice warned by the referee. NBC\u2019s Count-A-Punch recorder scored the rounds 20-3, 30-15 and 36-14 in Jones\u2019s favour. Watch the footage \u2013 it\u2019s an utterly one-sided affair. The three judges didn\u2019t think so. Bob Kasule of Uganda, Uruguay\u2019s Alberto Dur\u00e1n and Hiouad Larbi of Morocco gave Park the fight, two others giving it to Jones. As the referee, Aldo Leoni, raises Park\u2019s hand, the Korean fighter looks entirely embarrassed. Leoni himself looks disgusted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing this to you,\u201d he whispered to the distraught American. The medal ceremony is equally cringeworthy. Jones received huge cheers, Park, standing on the top of the podium, couldn\u2019t have looked more sheepish had he been bleating and swathed in wool. He held the American\u2019s fist aloft. Jones still looks shell-shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe didn\u2019t score the fight. That\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever been dealt in my life. They put the silver medal around my neck, and I took it right off. I won\u2019t put it around my neck ever again.\u201d What happened next? In the aftermath an angry American press pack confronted Larbi. \u201cIt was a terrible thing,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Sports Illustrated. \u201cThe American won easily; so easily, in fact, that I was positive my four fellow judges would score the fight for the American by a wide margin. So I voted for the Korean to make the score only 4-1 for the American and not embarrass the host country.\u201d Larbi, Kasule and Dur\u00e1n were suspended for six months pending an investigation but eventually cleared by the International Boxing Association (AIBA). Several years later, evidence emerged. Karl-Heinz Wuhr, the general secretary of AIBA, was mixing his boxing duties with work as a Stasi agent. When the Stasi\u2019s secret files were released following the collapse of the Soviet Union the investigative journalist and author Andrew Jennings found allegations of outright bribery. \u201cThey did not miss a chance to try to corrupt or influence me,\u201d Wuhr wrote. \u201cThey [the host nation] repeatedly attempted to persuade me to take back my decisions punishing judges they seemed to have an interest in. There were always judges prepared to declare a South Korean boxer victor, even if this was completely ludicrous.\u201d He alleged bribes had been paid to several unnamed judges, including three from Africa and one from South America and felt the \u201cmanipulation\u201d went high up into the executive of AIBA. The referee Leoni supported the claims, saying an Argentinian colleague had been offered an envelope stuffed with cash by the Korean boxing authorities. Jones, though, has never received the gold medal that is rightfully his. In 1997 an IOC investigation concluded that although the offending judges had been wined and dined by Korean organisers, \u201cthere is no evidence of corruption in the boxing events in Seoul\u201d. The chief upshot of one of the worst moments in Olympic history was the introduction of a new electronic scoring system (although that failed to prevent new accusations of bias at the Atlanta Games eight years later). Jones went on to be arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter of the 1990s. \u201cWhen I had that problem in South Korea. I went with an interpreter to face the guy I fought,\u201d he said in 2004. \u201cI asked him \u2018Did you win that fight?\u2019 He shook his head and said \u2018No\u2019. And then I was cool with it. If you tell me the truth, I\u2019m cool.\u201d How the Guardian covered the story:   Related: Professional boxers will be allowed to compete at Rio Olympics    Rumours of bribery and cheating followed the crowning yesterday of the South Korean light-middleweight Park Si-hun as Olympic champion. Park was awarded a 3-2 points decision over Roy Jones of the United States in a fight most observers thought the Korean had clearly lost. Jones was later awarded the Val Barker trophy for the outstanding boxer of the Games. The British judge, Rod Robertson, one of the most respected officials in amateur boxing, who was a spectator, said: \u201cI can only use one word for the decision \u2026 disgraceful.\u201d Even Anwar Chowdhry, the president of the sport\u2019s world governing body, Association International de Boxe Amateur, called the decision \u201cunfair.\u201d Judges from the Soviet Union and Hungary voted Jones the overwhelming winner by four points, those from Uganda, Uruguay and Morocco had the Korean just in front. The latter three judges were also involved when another South Korean, flyweight Kim Kwang-Sun, won his country\u2019s only other boxing final in a 4-1 decision over East Germany\u2019s Andrew Tews."}, {"sentences": ["Nobumasa Yokoo, who was also named in the report, Taku Hada and Hiroshi Ono, were arrested by the Tokyo police, according to the statement."], "tags": ["Olympus", "Technology sector", "Business", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-16T11:47:41Z", "title": "Former Olympus chairman arrested as scandal deepens", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/16/former-olympus-chairman-arrested", "article": "The former chairman of Olympus, Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, was one of seven men arrested on Thursday in a dramatic escalation of the $1.3bn (\u00a3829m) fraud scandal at the Japanese camera manufacturer.

Although they all give detailed descriptions of how you back up, none of them describes how to restore. If you lose your hard drive suddenly, but are backed up in a cloud application, can you restore the whole hard disk, applications and data in one operation?RL SymondsIf you are using cloud storage, then a server keeps copies of your hard drive somewhere on the internet, probably encrypted for security reasons. You can&apos;t access those files unless you have an internet connection and perhaps a copy of the cloud service&apos;s client (PC) software as well. I don&apos;t see how all that can be done in one restore operation. It&apos;s certainly not as simple as restoring a disk image from a local drive, as discussed here in January. If you suddenly lost your hard drive, you would normally use a restore partition, if available, or a drive image, after booting Windows from a recovery CD, DVD or thumb drive. Third-party boot-and-restore utilities are often based on a small version of Linux, but you could also use any Live Linux CD to get online. So, if you have a recovery CD or a Live Linux CD, plus any software that your online backup service requires, then you can indeed restore your PC from the cloud. With Carbonite and probably some other services, you can restore a complete backup if you can get to the site in a web browser. This is useful, but I would not recommend it as your primary backup strategy. Things are different with mobile phones and other devices where the operating system is stored on a Rom chip, and where &quot;restore from cloud&quot; may be a simple menu option. Phones have built-in connectivity, and there is relatively little data to back up. PCs are not designed to work like that, and it&apos;s not unusual for people to have 500GB or even a terabyte (1TB) of data. Size matters, for two reasons. First, it can take a long time to upload and then download 500GB or 1TB of data. It&apos;s much quicker to restore from an external hard drive (EHD), as mentioned, or from a local fileserver such as a Windows Home Server or Apple Time Machine. Second, it costs a lot of money to keep data in the cloud. Cloud services typically offer 2GB to 5GB of free storage to get you going, but after that, they charge a monthly fee. If you want to back up a whole PC, you could end up paying \u00a310-\u00a320 per month for storage, which is \u00a3120-\u00a3240 per year, or \u00a3600-\u00a31,200 over five years. You can buy several terabytes of fast, local storage for that sort of money. Memopal, which was founded in Italy, is a cheap option, and offers good discounts for signing multi-year deals. Storing 300GB (the highest amount offered to personal users) costs \u20ac69 for one year and \u20ac213.90 (rather than \u20ac345) for five years. You could buy a 500GB or larger hard drive for the first year&apos;s cost (\u00a357) and several terabytes for the five-year cost (\u00a3178). Cloud storage does have some advantages. You get an off-site backup that will still be there if your house is burgled or burns to the ground, and you can access your files from different PCs or even from smartphones and tablets. This also makes it simpler to share files with other people. Against that, cloud storage brings some significant risks. You can lose access to your account, your data can become corrupted, or the cloud service provider can delete it either by accident or deliberately because you haven&apos;t paid your bills. Worse, web-based companies frequently go bust. I experienced these problems after uploading some files to Streamload, an award-winning service launched in 1998. The company lost a lot of data transitioning to new software, got taken over, and then closed down. It didn&apos;t matter because I had everything backed up locally, but Streamload had 20,000 paying customers (as well as countless freeloaders), and I don&apos;t think everyone did.  I&apos;m not suggesting that you should never use cloud services. I use Dropbox and Microsoft&apos;s SkyDrive (25GB free) to back up and share photos and Office documents from smartphones: it&apos;s very handy to have photos automatically uploaded and/or automatically copied to a PC. It means I&apos;m less likely to lose valuable files. Nonetheless, I still back them up to one or more EHDs, and sometimes to CD-R discs. The cloud isn&apos;t my primary backup, and only a small proportion of my files are in the cloud, but it&apos;s still useful. Not all cloud services are the same, but there are two basic approaches. Some provide a sort of &quot;magic folder&quot; or virtual online drive where you can put files that you want to back up. This is the idea behind Dropbox. With other services, you select one or more existing folders and have them backed up on a continuous basis. For example, you could have the service monitor directories of My Documents and My Photos, knowing that whenever you changed files in those folders, the changes would be backed up online. Mozy and SugarSync are popular examples of this kind of service, and Memopal works in the same way. (This partly answers a separate query from Andrew White.) Which you prefer is, of course, a matter of taste. However, the continuous backup approach tends to consume more resources, so you should use the service&apos;s trial period to make sure the cloud&apos;s constant monitoring software doesn&apos;t slow your PC. Cloud services should be smart enough to back up the changes to a file without uploading the whole file again. The &quot;diff&quot; approach makes it easy to keep backups of many different versions of a file. Services should also be smart enough not to back up files they have already uploaded from someone else. Even Streamload did that. There are plenty of files \u2013 such as operating system files and iTunes and Amazon downloads \u2013 that are identical on millions of different hard drives. Indeed, charging thousands of users for the same small bit of storage is where cloud services should be able to make money. In his query, Andrew White also asked for a cloud storage service that was &quot;preferably based in the UK&quot;. There may be some but, sorry, I can&apos;t think of one.  Large cloud services providers, such as Microsoft, typically have large data centres on different continents. The best Microsoft will do with its Office 365 service is keep your data in Europe, in Dublin and/or Amsterdam, rather than (say) Chicago, San Antonio, Singapore or Hong Kong. Smaller cloud service providers, including Dropbox, often use Amazon&apos;s very reasonably priced Simple Storage Service (S3) , so data is probably held in the US: Amazon has data centres in northern California (us-west-1), North Virginia (us-east-1), Ireland (eu-west-1) and Singapore (ap-southeast-1). However, Amazon caches data in many other places, including London and Tokyo. I&apos;m not sure it makes any practical difference where data is stored. The US government can get it under the terms of the Patriot Act if it&apos;s kept by an American company or one that does business in the US, even if it&apos;s a European company. You might find cloud storage in a country that won&apos;t give your data to US or European government agents on request, such as Russia or China, but would that be a satisfactory solution? With cloud services, you really don&apos;t have much protection unless you pay business prices and sign an SLA (Service Level Agreement). Even then, it would be wise to read the fine print very carefully."}, {"sentences": ["That leaves Istanbul, Tokyo, Baku, Doha and Madrid competing to host the Games."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic torch", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-17T09:00:00Z", "title": "London 2012: best of the web | Andrew Magee", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/17/london-2012-best-of-web", "article": "Heptathlete who&apos;s out of this world Injured sportsmen and women will do anything to get better.

Bulgarian stand-off One of Bulgaria&apos;s top shooters is threatening to boycott the Games. Maria Grozdeva, a double Olympic champion who won the 25 metres pistol in 2000 and 2004, made the threat after her club were expelled from the Bulgarian shooting federation for failing to take part in domestic competitions. &quot;Yes, it&apos;s an ultimatum,&quot; said Grozdeva. &quot;Let&apos;s see who is more important.&quot; Weightlifters facing London omission In another Bulgarian controversy the country&apos;s weightlifting federation is threatening to block two Bulgarian-born athletes from competing in London. Boyanka Kostova and Valentin Hristov started competing for Azerbaijan after Bulgaria received \u20ac400,000 in compensation but their native country is now demanding more money if they want to compete at the Olympics. Summer Loving A sunny summer&apos;s day is many couples&apos; dream for the perfect wedding but one newly engaged pair won&apos;t be setting a date this summer. After winning the 100m Missouri Grand Prix the American swimmer Matt Grevers was presented with his medal by his long-term girlfriend and national team-mate, Annie Chandler. The 26-year-old took his chance and popped the question from the top of the podium but, with both hopeful of competing in London, it looks as if wedding planning is on hold. One couple who do have a date in the diary are the South African pair LJ van Zyl and Irvette van Blerk. Van Zyl is the world 400m hurdles bronze medallist and plans to marry the distance runner Van Blerk after the Games but is hoping that his wife-to-be will be able to compete alongside him as she tries to qualify for the women&apos;s marathon. Long shot For some athletes the Olympics offer a chance to make themselves a household name but for many others just getting there is a struggle. The shooter Sergy Rikhter was the first Israeli to qualify for London 2012 but now he just needs to afford it. He has taken to online fundraising to raise the 50,000 shekels needed to fuel his dream. If you want to donate, 50 shekels (about \u00a38.50) will get you a thank-you card and 1,200 shekels (\u00a3200) will get you a private shooting lesson with Rikhter himself. Italian PM cancels Rome bid Rome will not be hosting the 2020 Olympics after the prime minister, Mario Monti, refused to support a bid from the city. Following a cabinet meeting on Tuesday the bid was abandoned as projected costs of $12.5bn (\u00a37.9bn) proved too high for Italy&apos;s precarious economy. That leaves Istanbul, Tokyo, Baku, Doha and Madrid competing to host the Games. Female boxer wants to wear skirts The American boxer Tyrieshia Douglas says she would love to box in a short skirt at the first ever women&apos;s Olympic boxing programme. The International Amateur Boxing Association caused controversy when it encouraged female boxers to wear skirts but the 23-year-old wants them to be allowed to help identify women in the ring more easily.

Good week After winning the 60m at the UK Indoor Trials &amp; Championships Dwain Chambers can now look forward to defending his title at next month&apos;s World Indoor Championships in Istanbul. The 33-year-old received a further Olympic boost when the BOA said it would back him &quot;100%&quot; if he were a part of Team GB, despite his previous doping violations. Bad week The USA basketball team suffered a setback this week after the New Orleans Hornet guard Eric Gordon underwent surgery on Tuesday to repair an injured knee. Gordon is part of the 20-man roster for selection for London and he joins the New York Knicks guard Chauncey Billups on the injury list; Billups tore an achilles tendon on Monday. Both face a race to be fit for the Games, while LaMarcus Aldridge also limped off the court on Tuesday with a sprained ankle, though the Portland Trail Blazers forward should make a full return by the summer.

And I&apos;m sure more people associate the term with him than have read &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, the story in which it first appeared in 1981. It&apos;s a great word, so it&apos;s hardly surprising it was taken up to describe the virtual space of computer networks outside science fiction, a space now so real that the Pentagon recognises it as a fifth military domain (the other four being land, sea, air and outer space). In many ways, cyberspace as we know it isn&apos;t much like cyberspace as Gibson imagined it 30 years ago, but the resemblance is close enough for him to have acquired a reputation as a prophet of the information age. As the pieces gathered in Distrust That Particular Flavor make clear, it&apos;s not a reputation he&apos;s entirely comfortable with. In a talk he gave at Book Expo in New York in 2010, published here for the first time, he joked that Neuromancer has &quot;a complete absence of cellphones, which I&apos;m sure young readers assume must be a key plot point&quot; and pointed out that &quot;imaginary futures are always, regardless of what the author might think, about the day in which they&apos;re written. Orwell knew it, writing Nineteen Eighty-Four in 1948&quot; \u2013 the year, as it happens, that Gibson was born \u2013 &quot;and I knew it writing Neuromancer&quot;. Orwell is one of the acknowledged influences Gibson returns to repeatedly here. Others include HG Wells, Jorge Luis Borges and William Burroughs. There are also pieces on musicians (Steely Dan are described, not entirely convincingly, as &quot;among the most genuinely subversive oeuvres in late-20th-century pop&quot;) and visual artists, including Greg Girard, whose photographs of the demolition of old Shanghai and the &quot;shoals of cheap-ass concrete thunderheads&quot; being built in its place are &quot;almost more than I can bear to contemplate&quot;. &quot;I know little more about Shanghai than these images,&quot; Gibson writes, but there are other pieces here on cities he knows better: the ones he loves \u2013 Tokyo, London, New York \u2013 and one he loathes, Singapore, which he calls &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot;. After Wired ran this article in 1993, the magazine joined the ranks of those banned by the Singaporean government, Gibson says in a short postscript. These brief afterwords \u2013 conversational, self-deprecating and no less thoughtful than the writing they comment on \u2013 are one of the collection&apos;s principal pleasures; many of the individual pieces, after all, are already available online. In 1989, Gibson wrote an article for Rolling Stone on the subject of &quot;the net&quot;: &quot;As a science-fiction writer, I&apos;m sometimes asked whether or not I think the net is a good thing.&quot; In the postscript to the piece in this volume, he writes: &quot;What I don&apos;t recall, quite, is what I would have imagined &apos;the net&apos; to be, at that point, however freely I tossed the term around for Rolling Stone.&quot; The piece includes two vivid memories from Gibson&apos;s childhood and youth: one of listening to Chubby Checker on a crystal &quot;Rocket Radio&quot;, which &quot;requires no battery at all&quot;, using &quot;a quarter mile of neighbour&apos;s rusting fence for an antenna&quot;; the other of finding &quot;60 feet of weirdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in roadside Ontario brush&quot;. He says more than once in the collection that he believes &quot;that all cultural change is essentially technology-driven&quot;. But as well as the pieces here on new technology \u2013 the internet, digital film \u2013 Gibson shows an abiding interest in old, obsolete or obsolescent technology (though it isn&apos;t true, he says, despite the many newspaper articles that repeat the assertion, that he still writes on a manual typewriter). The longest essay in the book, &quot;My Obsession&quot;, written for Wired in 1999, describes a year he spent in the late 1990s collecting mechanical watches, compulsively bidding for them on eBay. Part of their appeal lay in their being &quot;so brilliantly unnecessary. Any Swatch or Casio keeps better time,&quot; he writes. But &quot;the idea of the Collectible&quot;, he suggests, is a &quot;basic mammalian response to the bewildering flood of sheer stuff we\u00a0produce&quot;. A semi-autobiographical character in one of his early stories, &quot;The Winter Market&quot;, is an artist who works in &quot;garbage, kipple, refuse, the sea of cast-off goods our century floats on&quot;. The tension between the urge to accumulate stuff and the desire to escape from it is everywhere in Gibson&apos;s writing, fiction and non-fiction. He&apos;s given up on eBay these days; he&apos;s a must-follow presence on Twitter instead.

Oil prices edged above $121 a barrel. Traders also said that policy developments in China and hopes that Greece&apos;s second financial package will be agreed on Monday were helping to push up prices. Over the past month fears of supply disruption in Iran and upbeat economic data from the world&apos;s largest oil user, the United States, have helped raise oil prices including Brent, which is sourced from the North Sea. The combination of factors driving demand took the price to $121.15 a barrel during Monday morning trading, a level not seen since mid-June last year. Opec&apos;s second largest producer, Iran, stopped oil sales to British and French companies on Sunday, retaliating against tightening EU sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear programme.

It also hiked its forecast for 2013 to $125 a barrel, up from $121, arguing that geopolitical issues are creating increased demand for crude. Investors&apos; appetite for riskier assets after China&apos;s central bank boosted lending capacity by more than $50bn (\u00a332bn), as well as a softer dollar against the euro on expectations Greece would secure a debt bailout this week, are also supporting oil prices.

Three of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s six reactors suffered meltdown in the hours after Japan&apos;s north-east coastline was devastated by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and tsunami on the afternoon of 11 March. More than 100,000 residents from the area have had to leave their homes, and are unsure when, or if, they can return. The government announced in December that the plant had reached &quot;cold shutdown&quot; \u2013 a safe state achieved when temperatures inside the reactors stay below boiling point and radioactive leaks are kept to a minimum. But fears rose this month that fuel in the No 2 reactor was heating up again, prompting the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) to inject more cooling water along with boric acid, which is used to prevent a nuclear chain reaction. Asked repeatedly to explain the dramatic rise in temperature, Takahashi said the cause had been traced to a faulty thermometer, one of three inside the unit. &quot;The plant has reached a state of cold shutdown,&quot; he said. &quot;We will now try to allow people to return to their homes as soon as possible.&quot; Takahashi, who looked pale and exhausted, dismissed questions about his health. He took charge of the plant in December after his predecessor, Masao Yoshida, took early retirement to receive treatment for cancer of the oesophagus. Tepco officials said Yoshida&apos;s diagnosis was not linked to his exposure to high radiation levels in the early days of the crisis when, he later admitted, he and his colleagues were convinced they would die. Evidence of the damage inflicted on the ageing plant remains nearly a year on from the disaster. Of the three reactors that went into meltdown, one is covered with tarpaulin and another appears intact, but the third is a mess of tangled metal. High radiation levels persist in areas close to the most badly damaged reactors. About 100 new storage tanks, each capable of holding 1,000 tonnes of liquid, have been installed to store contaminated water from the reactor buildings. The water is then purified and used again to cool damaged fuel. The existing tanks will be full by April, Tepco said. Yasuki Hibi, an engineer for a construction firm, said conditions at the plant had improved significantly in recent months, but added that workers were still limited to two three-hour shifts a day. &quot;Radiation levels inside reactor No 3 are still too high for us to enter,&quot; he said. About 3,000 people continue to work at the plant each day, according to Tepco. They monitor radiation, decontaminate workers and vehicles, prepare uniforms and equipment, and clear radioactive rubble and other material. Kazuhiro Sakamoto, who hires workers and buys equipment for a Tepco affiliate, said: &quot;The worst time was when radiation levels reached 250 millisieverts a year [a temporary upper exposure limit the government introduced soon after the accident]. &quot;We couldn&apos;t find enough people to do the work, and we could only work in two-minute bursts.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["LA Galaxy at Boston is longer than Tokyo to Manila."], "tags": ["MLS", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-21T14:00:00Z", "title": "MLS: Where 1,000 miles is a short trip for away supporters", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/21/mls-away-portland-independent-supporters-council", "article": "When Tom Dunmore and 300 fellow Chicago Fire fans travelled to see their team play Toronto FC in 2007, they were met with incredulity: &quot;When we got there, the stadium security just didn&apos;t know what to do. They had no concept of how to handle people travelling together in a large group to cheer their team on away from home.&quot;  Their hosts&apos; consternation was perhaps understandable at the time, not least because it was their grand opening home game. But what the Chicago fans found then is still common for many seasoned away supporters, though these negative experiences are as underappreciated as is the phenomenon of away travel in MLS itself.  It&apos;s often ignored outside the United States, but there is a strong tradition of large groups travelling to support their teams, but this is at the amateur collegiate level. In professional sport, MLS is out on its own. Given the distances, the commitment of its away fans is without doubt world class; literally, few go further. The average journey for North American fans is still one of the longest you would undertake in most other leagues; the bigger journeys are more expeditions than road trips; Portland Timbers fans going to New York is the same as going from London to Baghdad. LA Galaxy at Boston is longer than Tokyo to Manila.  The journey those Fire fans made to Toronto clocked in at 1,000 miles round trip, and that&apos;s their second closest game; in England, no-one can travel that far at all, and it&apos;s pushing the longest trip most European fans would have to make. Only fans in Russia can hold a candle in terms of the distances travelled to see a team play, and even there, the average distances tend to be exaggerated by a small number of teams in Siberia and the far-east.  Dunmore, who as well as being the former Chairman of the Chicago Fire&apos;s Independent Supporters&apos; Association, Section 8 Chicago, also blogs at the influential pitchinvasion.net, explained that &quot;some clubs in MLS have historically had a hard time understanding the nature of supporter culture, where a group of boisterous fans want to travel across the country to support their team vocally and visually. A typical issue is that every team and stadium has different rules on what away fans are allowed to do. One stadium might allow flags and banners, another might not. We laboriously go through liaison with the home team about what we can bring with us, only at times to find the stadium authorities unexpectedly take a different view when we turn up at the game.&quot; Then there&apos;s the security, something familiar to fans around the world: &quot;Some stadiums employ security personnel who sometimes are unfamiliar with vocal, organized travelling support and this can create problems in making sure fan group visits are smoothly and consistently handled.&quot;  Aiming to improve the experience for away travelers was one key reason that fans from 16 of the 19 MLS teams gathered in Portland to formally adopt the charter of the Independent Supporters&apos; Council and so create the first all-league lobby group for sports fans in North America.  A smaller group of fans had been meeting annually under this banner for three years, but this year, Portland&apos;s Timbers Army got behind a big push to take things to a new level, something they were well-placed to do as one of the biggest and most organised fans&apos; groups in world soccer, never mind MLS.  Having spent 12 years working with similar groups in the UK and Europe, I was invited to add a little perspective and assistance, but I learnt far more than I shared. Most impressive was the strong spirit of consensus that speedily got through potential hurdles like revising the existing ISC Charter and laid down some ground rules about how the organisation will make decisions in the future; I&apos;ve seen such decisions take months to resolve, not be nailed before lunch on the first day. Like all such collective groups, the spirit of unity meshes with a self-interest; some problems can&apos;t be solved on your own. One of the key aims of the ISC will be to lobby MLS to take a lead in helping create some common standards across teams for away fans across the league.  Listening to their stories, you got a strong sense of how variable things are, with different teams&apos; fans getting different treatment at the same place, of the same team&apos;s fans getting different treatment in different cities, or sometimes the same group getting different treatment at different times at the same stadium.  These problems are crying out for some standardization based on best practice, much of it happening on an ad hoc basis already. Says Dunmore: &quot;The next year when we went to Toronto, the club realized that problems could easily be solved with better communication ahead of the game with visiting supporters. MLS has started to create standard practices and these can be improved further if the league communicates with supporter representatives from the ISC who can provide advice based on a wealth of shared travelling experience.&quot; More challenging for MLS will be the issue of scheduling. With distances being so far, the idea of going to every match is a non-starter, and so fans have to pick and choose. What irks many though is that often the nearest matches are scheduled close to each other rather than spread over the season, so what were geographically accessible games become financially impossible to attend, coming hot on the heels of a trip in recent weeks. Then there&apos;s scheduling those kind of games in midweek, meaning a smaller number of fans travelling, all of whom will probably have to take two days off work to be there.  ISC members recognised that programming a league schedule to the satisfaction of all is impossible, but they believe MLS could go a long way to increasing happiness by listening to fans.  Dunmore is lucky at the Chicago Fire to have a responsive Front Office; buoyed by the fact that the Fire took 500 on a Sunday to Columbus last season, team executives worked with their counterparts at the Crew to ensure the game will be played on a Saturday this season with the Fire looking to take even more this time.  &quot;The large trip to Columbus in 2011 was well-organized by both the Fire and Crew front offices,&quot; Dunmore says, &quot;we took 500 fans to a rival stadium and had barely an issue to worry about. It was a great day out thanks to careful, collaborative planning by fans and club staff in advance.&quot; The spectacle of such a turnout means a win-win-win. The Fire will get a bigger support on the road, the Crew get a bigger attendance and higher revenues and MLS get an exciting atmosphere between regional rivals. That plays to their more recent strategy which champions soccer not as the sport of the soccer mom and her family (though they&apos;re still a big part of the crowd) but one of passionate noise and intensity, with singing and organized &apos;tifo&apos; displays inspired by European and South American ultras quite unlike anything else in US pro-sports. The founders of the ISC have done well to be forming a group uniting fans from different clubs after just 16 years; England&apos;s took 38 years. The ISC could make even swifter progress to the decision-making table too.  The popularity of the sport in Europe has meant that ISC-style groups have often been seen as unrepresentative of the wider fanbase, and with stadiums often full, articulators of problems that executives simply don&apos;t recognize as issues; what&apos;s the problem with the Glazer takeover of Manchester United, they say, when Old Trafford is mostly sold out every week? Regularly sold-out stadia and bountiful TV contracts are still a far-off dream for most MLS teams but to get there, there&apos;s a potential for an alignment of interests. The sport&apos;s most loyal fans can feel their loyalty respected and honored, and fascinatingly, as the dialogue grows between them and their clubs and between the ISC and MLS grows, all kinds of fan-led growth could be created. At the ISC meeting, discussions were peppered with references to the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, but if a niche for MLS can be carved out as the sport that is built on the passion of its fans and which gives them a real voice way beyond the money they put down for a ticket, that would be a revolution, and one welcomed far beyond North America."}, {"sentences": ["Although the EU and 22 EU member states signed the treaty on 26 January 2012 in Tokyo, and the European council unanimously approved Acta in December, all 27 member countries have to formally ratify it for the EU to be a party to the treaty."], "tags": ["Acta", "Internet", "World news", "Intellectual property", "Technology", "Europe", "Piracy"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-22T16:24:19Z", "title": "Acta approval stalled by European commission", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/22/acta-stalled-european-commission", "article": "Approval of the controversial international anti-counterfeiting treaty Acta has been stalled by the European commission, which is to ask Europe&apos;s highest court whether implementing it would violate any fundamental EU rights. The decision comes as the treaty faces growing opposition in parliaments, city streets and the internet, with some countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Poland declaring they would not approve the agreement in its current form \u2013 a stance that would make it impossible to ratify, because it requires every European country to sign up and approve it. EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht said on Wednesday that an opinion from the European court of justice would clear what he called the &quot;fog of misinformation&quot; surrounding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. &quot;This debate must be based upon facts and not upon the misinformation or rumour that has dominated social media sites and blogs in recent weeks,&quot; De Gucht told reporters in Brussels. &quot;Acta will not censor websites or shut them down; Acta will not hinder freedom of the internet or freedom of speech.&quot; The ECJ will assess Acta&apos;s compatibility with the EU&apos;s fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and information or that of protection, he said. The decision to refer the treaty to the ECJ appears to reflect recognition by EU officials of the political obstacles Acta faces. Earlier this month protesters marched against the agreement in several European capitals including London, Berlin, Helsinki, Paris and Vienna. Internet lobbyists and health campaigners have rallied against it, saying that overly strict controls of copyright would exclude people from the internet and prevent developing countries from accessing generic medicines. The agreement asks internet providers to co-operate with national authorities to crack down on online piracy, for example by cutting off internet access to users who illegally download music or films if that is part of the legal framework in that country. &quot;Intellectual property is Europe&apos;s main raw material, but the problem is that we currently struggle to protect it outside the EU. This hurts our companies, destroys jobs and harms our economies,&quot; De Gucht said. At the same time MPs in a number of countries have said they will not sign it. Although the EU and 22 EU member states signed the treaty on 26 January 2012 in Tokyo, and the European council unanimously approved Acta in December, all 27 member countries have to formally ratify it for the EU to be a party to the treaty. The US has signed the agreement. Others include Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Mexico and Switzerland participated in the negotiations but have not yet signed. However Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Cyrus, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands have all refused to sign the agreement on the grounds that it endangered freedom of speech and privacy The hacking group Anonymous claimed responsibility last week for a series of hacks against the US Federal Trade Commission and consumer rights websites, whose front pages were replaced with a violent German-language video satirising Acta. Acta has been under negotiation \u2013 almost all in secret \u2013 since June 2008. Its drafters say it is needed to harmonise international standards to protect the rights of those who produce music, movies, pharmaceuticals, fashion goods, and a range of other products that often fall victim to piracy and intellectual property theft. The treaty has been questioned by members of the European parliament. In a statement Wednesday, David Martin, a spokesman on the issue for the Socialists and Democrats, the second-largest bloc in the parliament, welcomed the decision to get the court&apos;s opinion. &quot;Trade commissioner Karel de Gucht today admitted that there are still many question marks about Acta and what the implementation of the agreement, as it stands, would mean for citizens and for the freedom of the internet,&quot; Martin said. &quot;The parliament has been calling for more clarity for a long time, and we already requested legal opinions from several committees in the European parliament. Now this ruling will be a good guarantee for the impact on fundamental rights. EU officials say the agreement will not change EU law. They insist what was legal pre-treaty would remain legal the day after, and what was illegal would remain illegal. But they have said the EU must ratify it as an example to other countries where intellectual property rights are less well protected than they are in the EU, in order to protect European products and ideas from being stolen elsewhere. Opponents fear Acta would lead to censorship and a loss of privacy on the internet. The plan to gain court approval of the agreement has left at least some of them unimpressed. &quot;No legal debate can fix Acta or give it a legitimacy that by design it cannot have,&quot; said J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann, co-founder of the internet advocacy group La Quadrature du Net."}, {"sentences": ["Police found the bodies of a couple believed to be in their 60s and their son, thought to be in his 30s, at their apartment in Saitama, north of Tokyo, after the building&apos;s owner said he had been unable to contact them.", "Tokyo Electric Power and Tokyo Gas have said they do not assume poverty to be the cause of non-payment, and do not notify welfare agencies unless asked to do so by the residents themselves.", "&quot;This is not something you&apos;d expect in a developed country like Japan, but people are struggling to find jobs,&quot; ABC News quoted Norimichi Goishi of the Tokyo Institute for Municipal Research as saying."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-24T05:04:00Z", "title": "Family of three dies from apparent starvation in Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/family-die-starvation-japan", "article": "Authorities in Japan are under pressure to explain how three members of the same family were allowed to die of apparent starvation, after their bodies were discovered two months after their deaths. Police found the bodies of a couple believed to be in their 60s and their son, thought to be in his 30s, at their apartment in Saitama, north of Tokyo, after the building&apos;s owner said he had been unable to contact them. Officers entered the apartment to find the victims&apos; badly decomposed corpses lying on futons, along with the carcass of their pet cat. The fridge was empty, the cupboards contained very little food, and a few one-yen coins appeared to all the money they had. The discovery has raised questions over the official response to rising poverty levels among the elderly and the unemployed in the world&apos;s third-biggest economy. As far as welfare officials in Saitama were concerned, the family, residents of a city of 1.2 million, had simply ceased to exist. The victims appear to have been left to fend for themselves, despite their failure to pay their rent and utility bills. The cause of death is still unknown, but officials believe they either starved or committed suicide. The family was not on a list of vulnerable households that are regularly visited by officials from the city&apos;s government. Some neighbours were unaware the apartment was even occupied. Local media reports suggest the family was too ashamed to admit they needed financial help. When approached by the firm that manages the apartment, the woman reportedly said her son was working and her husband was unable to work due to chronic back pain. A neighbour had tried unsuccessfully to persuade the wife to contact welfare authorities after she asked for money at the end of last year, saying the family was &quot;in trouble&quot;. Experts voiced disbelief that the authorities had not been informed, even after the family failed to pay rent for six months and had their gas and electricity cut off. They had reportedly not received welfare payments since 2003, two years after they moved into the apartment. &quot;Some people have a resistance to the idea of receiving welfare or contacting local authorities,&quot; Takehiro Yoshida, a welfare lawyer, told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. &quot;Others are left isolated in their own communities.&quot; Yoshida called on utilities to report cases of repeated non-payment of bills to welfare agencies. Tokyo Electric Power and Tokyo Gas have said they do not assume poverty to be the cause of non-payment, and do not notify welfare agencies unless asked to do so by the residents themselves. Despite enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world, Japan is struggling to address rising rates of poverty, particularly among the elderly and disabled, a growing number of whom die in complete isolation. In the summer of 2010, a 76-year-old man in Saitama died of heatstroke after his electricity was cut off for non-payment. Last month, two sisters in their 40s, one of whom had a mental disability, were found dead in their freezing apartment in Japan&apos;s northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido. An 84-year-old man living in the same region was found dead alongside his wife, who had been suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s. More than 700 people have died of apparent starvation since 2000, according to the health ministry. Fears are growing that job losses among middle-aged men and the impact of the 11 March disaster will push the number higher in the coming years. &quot;This is not something you&apos;d expect in a developed country like Japan, but people are struggling to find jobs,&quot; ABC News quoted Norimichi Goishi of the Tokyo Institute for Municipal Research as saying.  &quot;Local officials can&apos;t always reach those in need. Deaths related to starvation are a lot more common than we think.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Sushi started as Tokyo street food, and the best places to eat it are still down by the city&apos;s Tsukiji fish market.", "A Tokyo speciality, and \u2013 right on the doorstep of Tsukiji \u2013 the freshest leftovers I&apos;ve ever tasted.", "Inoue for instance (4-9-16 Shin Ohashi Dori, Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo), serves a light ramen based on chicken stock \u2013 a real treat to eat among the shoppers and market workers.", "If the weather&apos;s cold, head indoors for a heavier ramen at Menya Musashi (Shinjuku-ku, Nishi Shinjuku 7-2-6,\u00a0Shinjuku,\u00a0Tokyo) \u2013 it&apos;s a proper sit-down do, studded with fat pieces of well-marinated pork belly.", "Under a nearby railway arch, and running along the pavement (Higashi Gotanda 1-26-8, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo) I had my Lost In Translation moment as a waiter tried to help me identify the skewered meat I was pointing at.", "But, for me, the spiritual home of Tokyo street food is the maze of tiny 10-cover establishments down Piss Alley.", "Now that Tokyo has a reputation for high-end restaurant food \u2013 including shojin ryori and kaiseki \u2013 they don&apos;t want to go back.", "It&apos;s beside the railway (at one point, there&apos;s a rusty ladder up to the main train track out of Tokyo) and the rumble of trains never goes away.", "Japanese street food isn&apos;t all about Tokyo, however.", "Getting there Seven nights in Tokyo with Virgin Holidays, including scheduled flights with Virgin Atlantic from London Heathrow direct to Tokyo, accommodation at the 4V Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo on a room-only basis with transfers included starts from \u00a31,219."], "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Street food", "Kyoto holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Asia", "Japanese food and drink", "Travel", "Food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-24T11:28:00Z", "title": "Fun dining at Japan's street food stalls", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/24/japan-street-food-kyoto-tokyo", "article": "My eighth amuse bouche arrived in a porcelain bowl that looked like it belonged in the British Museum. The &quot;potage of Kyoto red carrot in the image of New Year&apos;s rising sun&quot; was from a 17-course kaiseki menu \u2013 the haute cuisine of Japan, derived from the elaborate 16th-century rituals of the tea ceremony. The highly-formalised style has been an inspiration to the likes of Heston Blumenthal to Ferran Adri\u00e0. But with dinner at Hoshinoya in Kyoto costing \u00a542,000 (around \u00a3330), such sophisticated formality comes at a price. And in a country facing economic stagnation, it&apos;s a price that not everyone wants to pay. The kaiseki style is old-fashioned \u2013 deliberately so. Like the shojin ryori menu at the city&apos;s Kanga-an Temple. Sitting at a low table, designed to make everyone equal, I ate a bowl of soy bean milk skin, and an imitation chestnut. The prickly exterior \u2013 made from buckwheat noodles coloured with green tea \u2013 gave way to a sweet potato interior. I admired the artistry of the chef, but I didn&apos;t want to eat the food. And, as course followed course, I started to feel trapped by the confines of this Zen banquet. I longed for the freedom of street food. Street food has never flourished in Japan. The Japanese still see it as rude to eat on the go. But that&apos;s starting to change. Sushi started as Tokyo street food, and the best places to eat it are still down by the city&apos;s Tsukiji fish market. At one tiny stall, with four stools, I tried chirashi \u2013 &quot;scattered sushi&quot;. It was the off-cuts of the sushi (mine arrived with salmon, tuna and salmon roe) artfully presented on a donburi. A Tokyo speciality, and \u2013 right on the doorstep of Tsukiji \u2013 the freshest leftovers I&apos;ve ever tasted. The best places for ramen \u2013 the delicious Japanese noodle dish \u2013 are also on the squares down by the fish market. Inoue for instance (4-9-16 Shin Ohashi Dori, Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo), serves a light ramen based on chicken stock \u2013 a real treat to eat among the shoppers and market workers. If the weather&apos;s cold, head indoors for a heavier ramen at Menya Musashi (Shinjuku-ku, Nishi Shinjuku 7-2-6,\u00a0Shinjuku,\u00a0Tokyo) \u2013 it&apos;s a proper sit-down do, studded with fat pieces of well-marinated pork belly. Under a nearby railway arch, and running along the pavement (Higashi Gotanda 1-26-8, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo) I had my Lost In Translation moment as a waiter tried to help me identify the skewered meat I was pointing at. &quot;The bit of the bird that gets rid of the grit&quot; he said. Once I had banished the image from my mind, I ordered the gizzard. It was delicious. And only \u00a5100 (80p) per skewer. I followed it with chicken thigh and pig tongue. Washed down with a soup of radish, carrot and liver. At least I think that&apos;s what it was. But, for me, the spiritual home of Tokyo street food is the maze of tiny 10-cover establishments down Piss Alley. The authorities don&apos;t like the name, and are trying to rebrand it &quot;Memory Lane&quot; \u2013 without much success. To be honest, they would rather that Piss Alley didn&apos;t exist at all. They see street food as poor people&apos;s food, and a reminder of a time \u2013 straight after the second world war \u2013 when Japan didn&apos;t have enough to eat. Now that Tokyo has a reputation for high-end restaurant food \u2013 including shojin ryori and kaiseki \u2013 they don&apos;t want to go back. Mercifully though, the good people of Japan have other ideas. On a Friday night Piss Alley is heaving. It&apos;s like a film set of tiny buildings, with staircases leading nowhere. The place feels like it&apos;s painted nicotine brown (no smoking laws don&apos;t seem to apply to Piss Alley), and then spritzed with a hot, savoury steam. It&apos;s beside the railway (at one point, there&apos;s a rusty ladder up to the main train track out of Tokyo) and the rumble of trains never goes away. Nor does the smell of fried food and sake, as salarymen eat and drink their fill. There&apos;s Horaiya \u2013 an offal shop established in 1947. And Isuzu, which has been hiding behind its wall of beer kegs since 1948. But next door (nobody spoke enough English to tell me the joint&apos;s name) they do a huge ball of tempura vegetables \u2013 called kakiage \u2013 laid to rest in a wonderful savoury broth. The ball was held together with a lot of flour, which is why they only needed to charge me \u00a5380 for the privilege. But it was so much better at soaking up the broth. And, as I found out, slurping on your broth is deemed good manners. At Ebisu Yokocho (1-7-2 Ebisu, Shibuya Ward), a version of Piss Alley is being reinvented for a new generation. Here stalls are separated by curtains of plastic, and a cool crowd sit on crates and soap-boxes. At Ebisu Yokocho they have attempted \u2013 and succeeded at \u2013 what retailers round the world are desperately trying to do. They have put street food indoors. It is a lively food arcade, stuffed with tiny yatai\u00a0food stalls. Each with its own atmosphere and decor. Yakitori is next to kushikatsu. But it doesn&apos;t feel Disney. Expect to see this version of Japanese street food in a town near you sometime soon. Japanese street food isn&apos;t all about Tokyo, however. Osaka has a strong street food culture, and the batter-based okonomiyaki pancakes are city specialities. And in Kyoto, I found something of a bygone era about a sweet-potato seller. Even down to the hawker&apos;s cry \u2013 &quot;ishi-yakiimo-ya&quot;\u00a0\u2013 announcing his arrival. The sweet potato has held a special place in Japanese culture since it saved the country from famine in the mid-18th century after the rice crop failed. The fact that in Kyoto it comes deep fried, and candied with a sweet-salty syrup certainly helps. Nishiki is Kyoto&apos;s covered market, and home to its best street food. I found a baby octopus served on a lollipop stick. And I tasted extraordinary mochi \u2013 soft, round, rice cakes \u2013 stuffed with red bean paste and grilled. They were somewhere between sweet and savoury, and a reminder of how different the Japanese palate is from our own. And I watched a proud biscuit maker wielding his waffle irons over hot coals like a Samurai warrior. Japan&apos;s culture already fascinates the world \u2013 its street food has the capacity to do the same. If only the authorities can learn not to be so embarrassed by it.

Newspapers and Radio 4 have certainly cottoned on. He&apos;s had three this week already and it&apos;s still only Friday: Somalia yesterday, racism and homophobia in football on Wednesday and the ill-starred health bill summit at No 10 on Tuesday, the one where Andrew Lansley was cornered on camera by an irate customer. Does it all do much good? Cameras, that&apos;s the problem. To a greater extent than ever, public figures live and die by what the camera records them doing in a perambulatory sense, though it&apos;s not a new phenomenon. Roman triumph, medieval royal progresses (at great cost to wealthy subjects who had to provide B&amp;B), William Gladstone chopping down trees (though not rescuing fallen women), paintings, photos and reports all amplified the often erroneous impression that the great man or woman was DOING something. Summits are an extension of that impulse, traceable to ecumenical church councils since the early Christian era \u2013 think the first council of Nicaea, called by Constantine in 325 to sort out the finer theological points of the trinity \u2013 and sustained through more worldly concerns about territorial spoils in treaty-making ever since. At Westphalia (1648), Vienna (1814-15), Versailles (1919), the great and good were doing something. Or rather, seen to be doing something, not always wisely (as Keynes pointed out at the time, the savage &quot;Carthaginian peace&quot; Versailles imposed on Germany merely guaranteed another war). Ditto Nato, the G8, G20, EU (gosh, they meet all the time now), climate change, world trade organisation (etc etc), all doing good and bad. It&apos;s a patchy record. That&apos;s where instant summits \u2013 just add instant hot air \u2013 serve a purpose, even if they achieve very little of practical use because there hasn&apos;t been enough time to do the prep work, the months of painstaking negotiations done at international levels by &quot;sherpas&quot; \u2013 as in &quot;summit&quot; (geddit?). The idea of &quot;a parlay at the summit&quot; was popularised in the 1950s by the ageing Winston Churchill, desperate to broker a summit between Stalin and Truman as his last great contribution to world peace, though by this time he was getting to be a menace to it. The Somali summit in Lancaster House seems to fit the definition of a properly prepared summit \u2013 Hillary Clinton and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, also attended \u2013 though whether its conclusions will change much I am not qualified to say. (Old Somali hands have told me that British de-colonisers botched independence when they combined British and \u2013 very different \u2013 formerly Italian-held Somali protectorates into one state in 1960.) But let&apos;s give that meeting the benefit of the doubt, as we do some \u2013 certainly not all \u2013 of our international summits, usually multilateral, often worthy but dull. It&apos;s better that we meet than that we don&apos;t, prime minister Jim Callaghan once reminded an impatient opposition leader after a not very good G7 summit in Tokyo. Her name was Margaret Thatcher and she later became rather a forceful, if disruptive, summiteer. It&apos;s not that most industry chiefs like to be summoned to Downing Street: the novelty wears off quickly enough, and they know they may well be merely backdrops to an ill-prepared speech by the prime minister of the day which is designed to earn him/her a one-minute package on the TV news. Sometimes the top people are needed to finetune the details of an agreement which has already been hammered out in private. Often not much is achieved except to irritate all concerned. The health summit seems to have been a classic of its kind. Google it and you find pretty negative coverage \u2013 as in the Guardian&apos;s own live blog here \u2013 both about the substance of exchanges inside No 10 and the process whereby the Lansley bill&apos;s more vocal NHS critics were excluded. Then there was Lansley&apos;s own spat with protesters in Whitehall, the health secretary&apos;s melancholy Via Dolorosa, his back lashed by 75-year-old activist June Hautot. They were just the kind of pictures Cameron&apos;s staff should have been organised enough to avoid. As in: &quot;Come in via the Cabinet Office side entrance, please, Andrew.&quot; Most prime ministers share the very human belief that if they can get warring parties or obstinately selfish sectional interests \u2013 think the 1998 Good Friday agreement \u2013 in a room to feel his/her laser-like authority and eloquence, then something worthwhile can emerge. Occasionally it does, albeit with lots of hard work (Belfast &apos;98 again), but generally not. Better surely, as Gordon Brown liked to do, to announce that a meeting of Cobra would be taking place to address the emergency of the moment, all very hush hush, but it sounded good. Cobra is actually the Cabinet Office briefing room A, where the civil contingencies committee meets. In reality that&apos;s how most useful government \u2013 and corporate \u2013 business is done. No cameras, no hyped expectation. Sometimes a theatrical touch is appropriate, but it&apos;s a formula that quickly wears thin, leaving the impression that there&apos;s more spin than substance.

The lineup: Rob Orme (music, production). The background: Rob Orme, alias Submerse, is a 23-year-old DJ/producer who happens to be making some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful (dance) music anywhere on the planet. And he is all over the planet: he comes from Runcorn in Cheshire, home of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud and not much else, but his twin loves of 2000-era UK garage and Japanese pop, or rather J-pop, took him to Tokyo, where he currently lives and is pioneering a new form of music that caters to a local demand for 2-step rhythms, sad-female vocals and wan melody: J-garage. This essentially combines the skippy, skittering beats and crisp, clean production of UKG with the eerily poignant cries and whispers of young Japanese girls singing ever so cutely about the desolation and devastation of lost love. It works. There&apos;s a lot of Submerse&apos;s music about, mainly on Spotify and YouTube, and it varies in style if not quality, elements of ambient, drum&apos;n&apos;bass, UK funky, dubstep and bass(line) hardly outweighing the 2-step adoration. Actually, it&apos;s of an impressively high standard, and reflects his broad range of experience, doing remixes for a variety of artists \u2013 Example, for example \u2013 and releasing records for labels such as Med School, R&amp;S&apos; sister label Apollo, Ministry Of Sound, Sony and Maltine, the latter a Japanese imprint for which he&apos;s just made available for free download an album called Soul Gems. He&apos;s also been collaborating on some neo-garage tracks with Mel Blatt from All Saints and the Klaxons&apos; Jamie Reynolds. And when the former Music Techology student isn&apos;t fiddling with his studio set-up (the usual modern-day configuration of Mac, Ableton, Logic, KRK, Sub, Focusrite and Midi controllers), playing computer games, watching anime or eating sashimi, he&apos;s running his own record label. Lucky he likes late nights. In fact, Orme reserves the early hours for making music (&quot;I like sitting down by myself at 4am&quot;), which he classifies as &quot;skippy funky J-pop style 2-step mech emotive beats&quot;, sort of helpfully. Basically, if you liked 1999-2000 garage at its lushest and loveliest, its sugar-sweetest (Sweet Like Chocolate, Flowers) \u2013 and the Japanese have a history of fetishising the stuff \u2013 then you&apos;ll love what Submerse does. He began recording circa 2009, and you can detect an increased complexity and accomplishment in his tracks, with greater focus on detail. Some of them are straight revisits of 1999-2001 UKG, with cut-up female vocals reducing the language of love to a series of forlorn pleas. His EP titles \u2013 Dreamin&apos;, Crush \u2013 hint at his ambition to create the dreamiest, most crushingly pretty garage-pop. He comes close to achieving this on 2011&apos;s Tokyopop! and closer still on Tears, a brand new-for-2012 track, which, production-wise, represents the direction Orme will be pursuing this year. If you thought Rustie was a maximalist, try this ADHD pop. It&apos;s like bubblegum Burial, Orme filling every second of space with infinitesimal bursts, droplets, clicks, spasms and lovelorn cries, which provide the leitmotif for this exercise in pristine pain. The comments from listeners on the SoundCloud are instructive: they include &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;oh my&quot; and dozens more variations on the gasp and shudder. This is dance music that, like New Order and Pet Shop Boys before it, reestablishes the dancefloor not as haven for hedonists but as site for the expression and exorcism of heartache. Oh, and his favourite Ninja Turtle is Leonardo. The buzz: &quot;He&apos;s managed to combine elements of J-pop, bass and garage into a totally new genre: J-garage&quot;.  The truth: It&apos;s not future-garage as such, but it is the future of garage. Most likely to: Take J-garage global. Least likely to: Advertise J-cloths.

The US treasury department said it had introduced the measures in response to the yakuza&apos;s increasing involvement in drug and human trafficking, prostitution, money laundering and other cross-border activities. It said that those activities had brought it billions of dollars a year in illegal earnings. The sanctions targetted the two men at the apex of Japan&apos;s most feared crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi: Kenichi Shinoda, the gang&apos;s 70-year-old leader, and his second-in-command, Kiyoshi Takayama, 64. Shinoda, who is also known as Shinobu Tsukasa, was released from prison last April after serving a six-year sentence for firearms possession. Under the sanctions, US citizens will be banned from making transactions with the two men, whose American-owned assets will be frozen. The US treasury department said it has imposed similar sanctions against seven leading members of a multinational syndicate called the Brothers&apos; Circle. The measures are part of President Obama&apos;s attempts to &quot;target transnational criminal organisations and isolate them from the global financial system&quot;, David Cohen, the US undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. &quot;Today&apos;s action casts a spotlight on key members of criminal organisations that have engaged in a wide range of serious crimes across the globe. They use our financial system, they use our commercial system to both penetrate the markets, to disrupt the markets and to make use of their illicit proceeds. &quot;We will continue to work with our international partners to target those who deal in violence, narcotics, money laundering, and the exploitation of women and children.&quot; The Yamaguchi-gumi, whose members account for just under half of Japan&apos;s 80,000 gangsters, has been called the Walmart of the country&apos;s underworld, for its ability to brush aside opponents and generate huge earnings. Under Shinoda, it has established a presence in Tokyo, far from its home turf in the western port city of Kobe. It has moved away from traditional sources of income into new areas such as finance, construction, the securities markets, and the formation of front companies with a presence overseas. The treasury department said Shinoda and Takayama were involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking and money laundering. &quot;As leaders of the Yamaguchi-gumi crime syndicate, both Shinoda and Takayama play key roles in directing the syndicate&apos;s policies and settling disputes with other yakuza syndicates,&quot; it said. The US offensive was introduced after Obama issued an executive order last year. It coincides with fresh attempts in Japan to rein in the yakuza after years of tacit acceptance of their supposed role as a deterrent against petty crime in urban neighbourhoods. At the end of last year, Tokyo became the last of Japan&apos;s 47 prefectures to introduce measures aimed at pressuring legitimate businesses to cut their ties with the mob. Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, said the government would watch the US administration&apos;s moves with interest. &quot;&apos;We are exchanging information with the US on a regular basis,&quot; he added. Despite their prominent role in some sectors of Japanese society, yakuza membership is declining. In 2010 there were 78,600 registered gangsters, a fall of 14% since 1991, according to the national police agency. The agency said Yamaguchi-gumi membership fell 4% in 2010 to 34,900 members from the previous year."}, {"sentences": ["Set in a futuristic Tokyo, where robots walk among us and have no idea they&apos;re not human, ostensibly Binary Domain is so far, so Blade Runner, but what follows is a third-person, squad-based shooter, more immediately reminiscent of Gears of War or Mass Effect.", "Heading up a multinational undercover squad sent in to Tokyo to find and stop the creator of these humanised robots, players control Dan Marshall, a stereotypically gung-ho US agent."], "tags": ["Shoot 'em ups", "Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "PS3", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-26T00:05:29Z", "title": "Binary Domain \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/26/binary-domain-xbox-ps3-review", "article": "Set in a futuristic Tokyo, where robots walk among us and have no idea they&apos;re not human, ostensibly Binary Domain is so far, so Blade Runner, but what follows is a third-person, squad-based shooter, more immediately reminiscent of Gears of War or Mass Effect.

To fend it off, we&apos;re prepared to smother ourselves in quacksalvers&apos; unguents, submit to abusive surgery, dye our hair and lie about our age. We treat those no longer able to disguise its ravages with embarrassed condescension or worse. We daren&apos;t even call them &quot;old&quot; any more, but must rely on euphemisms like senior or third-ager, as if referring to victims of an unspeakable affliction. The media are usually accused of helping to shape inconvenient attitudes, and in this case cinema gets its share of the blame. After all, in pursuit of the teen dollar, it has championed attributes to which only the young can be expected to aspire. Unsurprisingly, the tribunes of elderly people complain that the landscape of the big screen is no country for old men. To some extent, this is unfair. Dumbledore, Gandalf and Obi-Wan Kenobi have dispensed the wisdom of the aged, even though society at large has forgotten it ever existed. The likes of Gran Torino, Million Dollar Baby, Tokyo Story, Fear Eats the Soul, Harold and Maude, The Sunshine Boys, Driving Miss Daisy and The Straight Story have portrayed older characters with both compassion and respect. Nonetheless, it has to be admitted that the complainants have a point. Sometimes, as in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? or Sunset Boulevard, ageing has been treated as a source of horror. More often, elderly characters have simply been pushed to the fringes of the action, and, by implication, to the fringes of life. In 2005, two academics assessed different age-groups&apos; prominence in 88 top-grossing films and compared it to their presence in the population. Thirtysomethings were heavily over-represented and fortysomethings did OK, while fiftysomethings were significantly under-represented and the over-60s severely so. Once marginalised and therefore cut down in screen-time, older characters have had to be stereotyped, with often unbecoming results. There have been a good few kindly old grandmas, but more often the elderly have been shown as ineffectual, grumpy, behind the times, depressed, lonely, slow-witted, sickly, whining, rude, miserly, hard-of-hearing, ugly, interfering, heartless, intransigent, doddering, mentorish, frisky or profane . However, with the coming of our own millennium, cinema determined to do better. It was now in pursuit of the increasingly valuable grey dollar, and out to suck up to the old as eagerly as it had sucked up to the young. Recently, Red (short for &quot;retired, extremely dangerous&quot;) saw Bruce Willis reassembling a team of ageing black-ops operatives to prevail in cheery mayhem. The Expendables brought back action stars from the 1980s to make mincemeat of less venerable bad guys. Unfortunately, such efforts failed to satisfy the nigglers. These films, along with those featuring other kinds of improbably hoary hellraisers, were condemned for requiring the old to ape the behaviour of the young. Old people too far gone to manage this, it was suggested, would only be further demeaned. Still, the movies had other tricks up their sleeve. Films such as Iris, Away from Her and The Iron Lady directly addressed the issues posed by infirmity in old age. Their spin was heavily sympathetic, but even so they weren&apos;t always welcomed. Some argued that they sanitised the conditions they depicted, thereby belittling real-life sufferers&apos; needs. Others made a contrary complaint. Last year saw the publication of The Silvering Screen, by Canadian academic Sally Chivers. She objected to films that &quot;rely on illness or disability narratives to convey the social burden of growing old,&quot; thereby treating ageing as a disease. What cinema ought to be doing, she suggested, is promulgating &quot;the idea that an old person has value that exceeds the value attached to young appearance&quot;. A big ask, you might have thought. Still, along comes The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and, boy, does it do its damnedest. Admittedly, its septet of seniors out to find themselves in the east are required to display traditional old-folk foibles, like confusing Wi-Fi and wireless, and distrusting doctors with a different skin colour. Foreign food? &quot;If I can&apos;t pronounce it, I don&apos;t want to eat it.&quot; All the same, they&apos;re grappling with big stuff. For them, later life means self-realisation, not inconsequence. That&apos;s getting your first-ever job, finding love, breaking free from a stagnant marriage or overcoming a lifetime&apos;s guilt. Their guidance saves the young from making enormous mistakes, and even succeeds in humanising the staff of a call centre. No one is expected to slaughter terrorists or seduce teenage lovelies. Ageing isn&apos;t pathologised. The only sign of debility is one readily operable gammy hip. Death, when it puts in an appearance, is sudden, painless and discreet. So Dr Chivers should be happy, if not her adversaries. But does the film endear us to later life? Sadly, no. For heart-warming though the action is, it&apos;s hopelessly implausible. In this world, &quot;I&apos;m lonely,&quot; is a successful chat-up line, and a ratty old Hobnob addict can metamorphose into a finance whizz capable of rescuing an ailing business. The sunny Jaipur hotel turns out to enshrine an alternate reality. What ageing means there isn&apos;t what it means in the world around us. However much we emulate the positive outlook of its fortunate inhabitants, we&apos;re unlikely to be similarly rewarded. In non-exotic environments, ageing may indeed endow some with their own Indian summer of leisure, affection and fulfilment. More can expect to encounter varying degrees of irrelevance, decline, sickness, hardship, regret, abandonment, loss and loneliness. We don&apos;t like any of these things: that&apos;s why we dread old age. Films such as The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel can offer us only a brief respite from our fear of what&apos;s to come. To provide enduring reassurance, cinema would have to decontaminate ageing as we actually know it. Even for the big screen, that may just be too much of a challenge."}, {"sentences": ["In the year since the disaster, Yamamoto says he has not received any feed from the government; what little he has came from private donors, including farmers in Australia after they were approached by the country&apos;s meat and livestock office in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Japan disaster", "Farming", "World news", "Nuclear waste", "Environment", "Animals"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T19:39:19Z", "title": "Fukushima's rebel farmers refuse to abandon livestock", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/fukushima-rebel-farmers-feed-cattle", "article": "     The police officers guarding the entrance to Japan&apos;s nuclear evacuation zone barely glance at Yukio Yamamoto&apos;s permit before waving him through. The 69-year-old cattle farmer has been making this journey several times a week for almost a year. Yamamoto is one of about 10 farmers from Namie who are defying government orders to euthanise their cattle, their market value obliterated by ingestion of radioactive caesium. Nothing, he says, will stop him from carrying out what is almost certain to be the last duty of care to animals that have been his family&apos;s livelihood for generations. Not the nuclear contamination that has made his hometown of Namie uninhabitable; nor the piercing cold that blankets his farm on this winter afternoon. And definitely not the officials who dismiss his compassion as hopelessly misplaced. Almost a year since the Fukushima Daiichi accident turned 930 square miles of land into a no-go zone, birdsong and the laboured groans of his 36 black-haired wagyu cows \u2013 animals once highly prized for their premium-quality beef \u2013 are the only signs of life near the farmhouse he once shared with his family. Human activity has all but ceased since 80,000 residents living within 20km of Fukushima Daiichi fled their homes after the first reactor exploded, 24 hours after the plant was crippled by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami. Yamamoto, who obtained a permit allowing him to enter the nuclear evacuation zone to feed his animals, agreed to take the Guardian on a brief visit to his farm, which is 14km from the plant. His route takes him past fields strewn with tsunami wreckage, still untouched, and through the centre of Namie, a town of that once housed 22,000 people but now lies abandoned. Warnings about the imminent arrival of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s toxic payload drove every last resident from their homes, and forced farmers to condemn their animals to slow, painful deaths from starvation. The nuclear accident has inflicted serious damage to brand Fukushima and its annual $3.2bn (\u00a31.57bn) farming industry, but Yamamoto refuses to believe that all is lost. &quot;I left like everyone else after 11 March,&quot; he said. &quot;I couldn&apos;t stop worrying about my cows, so I started coming back in every other day to feed them.&quot; The round-trip from his temporary accommodation took six hours. In May, the then prime minister, Naoto Kan, ordered the killing of livestock by lethal injection after radiation made them commercially worthless. Local farmers say the operation has been blighted by mishaps, including the escape of an estimated 1,000 cattle from their homesteads, and conflicting data on how many cows have been killed. &quot;Straight after the disaster, my cows had nothing to eat or drink ... many of them starved to death right where they were tethered,&quot; Yamamoto said. &quot;I had to decide whether to leave the ones still alive or keep them healthy, even though we were separated.&quot; But time could be running out for the animals whose survival has turned into a personal mission. In the year since the disaster, Yamamoto says he has not received any feed from the government; what little he has came from private donors, including farmers in Australia after they were approached by the country&apos;s meat and livestock office in Tokyo. &quot;Eventually the feed will run out, and the government has said it will kill every last cow,&quot; says Yamamoto, whose cows once fetched well over $10,000 per head. &quot;But that is something I can&apos;t allow to happen. &quot;I could never kill these cows. They are like members of my family.&quot; He is pinning his hopes on studies being conducted by academics to gauge the level of contamination in livestock. &quot;No one has said for sure if cows that eat and drink in Fukushima really are beyond help,&quot; he said. &quot;We want someone to conduct a proper study.&quot; &quot;We accept that the meat will never go on sale, but the cows could be put to some other commercial use,&quot; says Ryoichi Harada, another rebel farmer who helps Yamamoto feed his animals. As he leaves Namie at dusk, Yamamoto passes the entrance to another farm, the black figures of wagyu cows just visible on a distant ridge. At the entrance, animal skulls have been placed next to signs demanding that the authorities end the euthanasia programme. The site has been hastily renamed Hope Farm, but in Yamamoto&apos;s voice there is only despair: &quot;Japan is supposed to be an advanced nation, so how is it that we have forgotten to care for our animals?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Further into the evacuation zone, near a disused public relations office belonging to the plant&apos;s owner, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), radiation levels rise to 2 microsieverts/hour (the normal background level is 0.2-0.3).", "Voices rarely rise above a murmur as experts analyse data, while two large screens on a wall link the room, where the air is filtered, to the situation outside and Tepco&apos;s headquarters in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T19:53:49Z", "title": "Fukushima, a year on: 3,000 workers take on the twisted steel and radiation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/fukushima-workers-twisted-steel-radiation", "article": "The remains of the shattered reactors are still some distance away when you first notice the sheer destruction of Japan&apos;s nuclear disaster. The journey into the heart of the world&apos;s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl 26 years ago begins much earlier, in the towns and villages that exist in name only, their residents having been sent fleeing a year ago. Homes and shops lie empty, the roads are deserted. In the town of Naraha, groceries sit untouched on the shelves of a convenience store; a handful of cars punctuate a supermarket carpark, abandoned by their owners amid the panic that followed the first explosion at one of the Fukushima Daiichi plant&apos;s reactor buildings. Most of the buildings that lie just inside the 12-mile (20km) nuclear evacuation zone \u2013 even the grand wooden homes \u2013 withstood the violent seismic shifts unleashed by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake on the afternoon of 11 March. But, as the Guardian witnessed on a rare trip to the nuclear plant, the destruction is more insidious than collapsed roofs and ruptured tarmac, but no less shocking. Almost everywhere, beeping monitors alert visitors to the invisible foe that has befouled entire communities: radiation. Further into the evacuation zone, near a disused public relations office belonging to the plant&apos;s owner, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), radiation levels rise to 2 microsieverts/hour (the normal background level is 0.2-0.3). The readings soar to 35 microsieverts/hour in Okuma, a town near the plant&apos;s perimeter, where residents have been told their former homes could remain uninhabitable for decades. Fukushima Daiichi covers a huge swath of land stretching from its hilltop entrance down to the coast, where its six reactors were easy targets for the 14-metre tsunami that roared ashore soon after the quake. From a vantage point to the south of the site it is easy to see the mangled innards of reactor buildings No 3 and 4 and, behind them, the vinyl shroud covering the No 1 reactor \u2013 the first unit to suffer a hydrogen explosion last March. There are few signs of the 3,000 workers on site \u2013 a small portion of the many thousands of contractors and subcontractors who have joined the mission to save the plant from an even greater catastrophe. Pockets of workers in protective suits huddle around coiled pipes and hoses used to feed and recycle coolant to the damaged reactors. In the distance are rows of tanks containing tens of thousands of tonnes of radioactive water drawn from the reactors&apos; flooded basements. While temperatures inside the reactors have stayed below the required boiling point, radiation is still too high for workers to enter some areas. The utility&apos;s contamination map shows radiation inside reactor No 3 as high as 1,500 microsieverts/hour. The world is in awe of the speed with which Japan has cleared tsunami rubble from other stretches of its north-east coast. But along the Fukushima Daiichi waterfront, the removal of debris deposited by the waves never really began. The seawall, which failed to hold back the ocean on 11 March, is no more. Instead, piles of mesh sacks filled with rocks are all that separate the water from the exposed bowels of the reactors&apos; turbine buildings, now a mass of twisted metal, shutters and ladders, where upended trucks sit in ditches filled with wreckage. Work in this area of the plant is all but impossible. &quot;Most of the workers here perform a two-hour shift in the morning and again in the afternoon,&quot; says Katsuhiko Iwaki, deputy manager of the Fukushima Daiichi stabilisation centre. &quot;But there are areas where the dosages are so high they can only stay for two or three minutes \u2026 just enough time to connect a hose before their alarms signal it&apos;s time to leave.&quot; Elsewhere, almost every spare patch of ground is covered in pipes and hoses, and sheets of wood and steel. Avert your gaze from the gaping holes in the reactor walls and you could have stumbled upon an unwieldy building site. Only the mission here is not to rebuild, but to dismantle. The success of the operation to remove melted nuclear fuel from the reactors \u2013 a process that will not start for 10 years \u2013 will depend on the hundreds of Tepco staff hunkered over computer screens in the plant&apos;s emergency control room. Voices rarely rise above a murmur as experts analyse data, while two large screens on a wall link the room, where the air is filtered, to the situation outside and Tepco&apos;s headquarters in Tokyo. Takeshi Takahashi took over as plant manager in December after his predecessor was diagnosed with cancer (which is unrelated to the disaster). &quot;We need to avoid major releases of radioactive materials of the kind we saw after the accident,&quot; he says. &quot;We achieved cold shutdown in December, but we must ensure we keep making improvements because we still can&apos;t say for sure the facilities on site are totally trouble-free.&quot; He refused to speculate on who was to blame for the accident before the government had completed its investigation, but he accepted criticism of his employer&apos;s transparency in the early days of the crisis. &quot;We often hear we didn&apos;t communicate properly, and I apologise for that,&quot; he says. &quot;It was never our intention to suppress information, but there was a chaotic time after the accident when we tended to neglect efficient communication.&quot; Tepco appears to have adjusted its post-disaster mantra, at least in public. Last year its priority was to stabilise the reactors and prove the plant&apos;s destiny was back in the hands of its operator. The utility has since shifted its focus to the tens of thousands of relocated residents. &quot;I would like to apologise for the trouble we have caused local people,&quot; Takahashi says, unprompted. &quot;We&apos;re doing our best to make it possible for evacuees to return home as soon as possible, but we have to put their safety first.&quot; But no one can say when, or if, the stirrings of civic life will be seen in the deserted communities around Fukushima Daiichi. And amid the opprobrium directed at Tepco&apos;s corporate culture, it is easy to forget the victims include men, and a small number of women, who are witnessing the recovery effort from the inside. Saori Kanesaki, who once guided visitors around Fukushima Daiichi, is one of 16,000 residents of Tomioka who were driven from their homes last March. &quot;Before the accident it was my job to tell visitors that nuclear power was safe,&quot; says Kanesaki, who now works at the plant for a Tepco affiliate. &quot;But given the situation, if I were to tell them that now \u2026 I would be lying.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Had the Fukushima Daiichi power plant been abandoned, as the company who ran it, Tepco, wanted to do, it could have unleashed a chain reaction of plant meltdowns that could have resulted in the evacuation of Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Nuclear waste", "Waste", "Energy", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T20:37:25Z", "title": "Japan's nuclear disaster: a long half-life | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/28/japan-nuclear-disaster-fukushima-editorial", "article": "As the people of Pripyat, a once bustling Soviet city built for the workers of Chernobyl, will tell you, evacuation from a nuclear disaster is a one-way ticket. Nearly 26 years later, time is frozen. The hammer-and-sickles still hang from the lamp-posts as they did on the day the town&apos;s residents were told to get on the buses. A similar fate awaits many of the 80,000 evacuated a year ago from Fukushima. The Japanese government is raising hopes of an early return to the evacuation zone, and there are parts of villages to which former residents could move back this spring \u2013 if they wanted to. But life without neighbours, or the region&apos;s traditional livestock and fishing industries, would be a shadow of its former self. Much of this area \u2013 particularly towns like Okuma, near the perimeter of the stricken nuclear plant \u2013 is as doomed as Pripyat. As our reporter found out when he was allowed in on Tuesday, groceries sit untouched on the shelves of a convenience store, cars abandoned in a supermarket car park. The only signs of life are the beeping monitors alerting visitors to the invisible foe. It could take decades for cleanup workers to get all the fuel out of the reactors \u2013 if indeed they ever succeed. The world is in awe of the speed with which Japan cleared the rubble from the tsunami that devastated its north-east coastline, but it is now clear that the nuclear disaster could have been an even bigger catastrophe than the tsunami that triggered it. Had the Fukushima Daiichi power plant been abandoned, as the company who ran it, Tepco, wanted to do, it could have unleashed a chain reaction of plant meltdowns that could have resulted in the evacuation of Tokyo. This is the doomsday scenario, but according to a leaked report of the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation \u2013 a team of university professors, lawyers and journalists who spent six months investigating Japan&apos;s response to the triple meltdown at the plant \u2013 it could all too easily have happened. Tepco&apos;s senior management emerges worst of all from this report. The former prime minister Naoto Kan, who was distrustful of Tepco and relied on advisers who had no experience of an emergency of this magnitiude, comes off slightly better. The unsung hero is the plant manager Masao Yoshida, who kept on injecting seawater into the stricken reactors. With just two of its 54 nuclear reactors in operation, Japan is importing coal and oil as if there is no tomorrow \u2013 and no Kyoto protocol, whose emissions targets it will now not meet. Japan&apos;s overreliance on nuclear power as a &quot;clean&quot; alternative to coal- and oil-fired stations should give the world pause for thought. Britain is now going down the same route. The debate is complex, but it must not assume the same thing couldn&apos;t happen here. That&apos;s what they said in Japan after Chernobyl."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking on Thursday, two months after helping the British men&apos;s team overcome a disappointing performance at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo to qualify for the Games at the London Prepares test event at the O2 , Keatings said he is back to his best.", "&quot;In Tokyo the fitness was there.", "&quot;I was back a lot quicker than I thought but what I was lacking in Tokyo was competition experience.", "Keatings, who made uncharacteristic errors on the high bar in Tokyo, where Britain finished 10th, admitted to nerves before the high-stakes competition in London \u2013 where they needed to come in the top four.", "&quot;We were still nervous because leading up to Tokyo everything was going right and it just went wrong on the day.", "The high bar was the piece that really hit us in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Gymnastics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-01T19:16:02Z", "title": "Daniel Keatings back in the old routine and on the Olympic medal trail", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/01/daniel-keatings-london-2012-olympics", "article": "Daniel Keatings has claimed he is in better shape now than when he won silver in the all-around at the 2009 world championships as he targets a medal at the London Games. Speaking on Thursday, two months after helping the British men&apos;s team overcome a disappointing performance at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo to qualify for the Games at the London Prepares test event at the O2 , Keatings said he is back to his best. &quot;In Tokyo the fitness was there. I&apos;d come back from [a knee] injury quickly. I was fighting fit within a few months, whereas 15 years ago that would have been a career-ending injury,&quot; he said. &quot;I was back a lot quicker than I thought but what I was lacking in Tokyo was competition experience. Once I&apos;d got the competition experience back, I got a good result at the test event. I&apos;m training better than ever, I&apos;ve got a lot of new stuff coming in and my consistency has gone through the roof.&quot; He said he will be trying new routines at a series of competitions as he battles to secure an Olympic place. The British team&apos;s score at the O2 would have gained them third place in the world championships. Keatings, who yesterday took part in a stunt where he vaulted over Britain&apos;s Got Talent troupe Spellbound in Trafalgar Square to highlight Bupa&apos;s partnership with UK Sport, is now targeting one of five places in the Olympic team. &quot;There were six places in the team for the test event and there are only five for the Olympics, so one person is going to have to drop out. Let alone the five or six others trying to make the team,&quot; he said. The final squad is unlikely to be announced until as close to the Games as possible, with Keatings and his rivals training six hours a day. &quot;We&apos;ll have a few set trials in local competitions and there&apos;s the Europeans in May. The team won&apos;t be announced until four weeks before the Olympics. It keeps everyone working that little bit harder,&quot; he said. Despite the competition for places, he said that in the wake of the success at the test event, his team-mates are now &quot;like family&quot;. Keatings, who made uncharacteristic errors on the high bar in Tokyo, where Britain finished 10th, admitted to nerves before the high-stakes competition in London \u2013 where they needed to come in the top four. &quot;We were all disappointed and nervous as well. It&apos;s not great to say, but because of our results over the last few years we all thought we were going to make it,&quot; said Keatings, who trains with Louis Smith in Huntingdon. &quot;We were still nervous because leading up to Tokyo everything was going right and it just went wrong on the day. The high bar was the piece that really hit us in Tokyo. It was the first piece in London, I was the first up and it was scary. But as soon as I finished my routine the relief washed over me, and from then on I knew it was going to be a good competition.&quot; The 22-year-old Keatings won silver in the all-around at the same venue in 2009 and said he is targeting an individual medal at the Games. &quot;I am working towards the all-around, I&apos;m working towards making the parallel bars final and the pommel horse final. The hardest thing is making the final \u2013 if you make it you&apos;ve got a chance because anyone can make a mistake.&quot; He said that competing in front of 20,000 spectators at the O2 would suit him and the other British gymnasts, including the Beijing bronze medallist Smith and Daniel Purvis of Liverpool. Keatings added that he is fully recovered from the serious knee injury he suffered in 2010 and is hopeful that success this summer would continue the huge boost to the sport&apos;s profile and success in recent years. He took up gymnastics at a local club aged five because he was too young to take up kickboxing. &quot;Back then I looked up to the Russians, the Japanese, the Chinese. Now, hopefully we&apos;ve put British gymnastics on the map and people can start looking up to us lot,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s there, it&apos;s five months away. It&apos;s quite scary how quickly it&apos;s coming up. But it&apos;s exciting. With better results there&apos;s going to be expectation. But you need to rise to that expectation.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["!&quot; Bad week Haile Gebrselassie could miss out on a place at the Games after he slumped to a disappointing fourth-place finish at the Tokyo marathon.", "The Ethiopian said: &quot;After Tokyo I am a bit disappointed."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-02T09:00:05Z", "title": "London 2012: best of the web | James Hilsum", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/mar/02/london-2012-10-best-web", "article": "New Olympic museum The British Olympic Association is to open a museum to commemorate London being one of the first three cities to host the summer Olympics.

On occasion, the shiny and endlessly reverberating palace she and producer Paul Epworth have built up can seem a bit T&apos;Pau. Really, though, it&apos;s a case of &quot;if you build it, they will come&quot;. Which is to say, if you make an album so preposterously large-sounding that it becomes impossible to ignore, then surely people will be sucked in, as if by the planetary gravity of such a massive entity. All of which might be a bit much had Florence not created a mildly eccentric, all-over-the-place-emotionally public persona and pulled off coups (like her Dizzee Rascal collaboration) that have preserved much of her initial charm.

A Seattle band in the grunge era, Earth&apos;s music was light years away from the cathartic rock songs of their peers, with long drones of feedbacking, downtuned guitars forming the instrumental equivalent of a poker face. Over the subsequent 20 years, however, the band have admitted more space into their music, with melodies taking on greater importance. These days founder Dylan Carlson investigates ghostly forms, presences, fairies etc, and Earth&apos;s records, in turn, have taken on something of this searching and suggestive, rather than downright oppressive, quality.

He works with actors as regularly as he writes for musicians, and his compositions consistently blur the distinctions between drama, music theatre, opera and instrumental music. Almost all his works in the last 15 years have a visual dimension, and invariably carry with them a whole network of literary, political and cultural connections. Today, members of the National Youth Orchestra join forces with students from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire for one of the few Goebbels pieces that does belong in the conventional concert hall.

By the end of last year it had sold 20,000 shares, and hopes to reach the 50,000 mark within five years. The money will be used to replace lost boats and equipment; investors, who will be invited to take a hands-on role in cultivation, will be repaid in fresh seafood. Ogatsu&apos;s fledgling recovery is being repeated in other parts of Miyagi prefecture, where 9,500 people died and 1,700 are missing. In Higashi Matsushima, 100 fishermen are bringing in hauls of the town&apos;s enormous oysters. The famed islands that dot the bay deprived the tsunami of some of its ferocity, but not enough to save the oyster beds. &quot;We had just finished harvesting that year&apos;s oysters, but the tsunami swept away all the seeds for the following year,&quot; says Masami Hachiya, president of the local fisheries co-operative. &quot;We had to start from scratch.&quot; Using seed oysters brought in from outside, the first batches of oysters \u2013 even bigger than usual because there are fewer of them sharing the bay \u2013 are already on sale. &quot;Production and sales are about half of what they were before the tsunami, but it&apos;s just enough for us to make a living,&quot; Hachiya says, adding that the lucrative clam and whitebait trade would be restarted soon. Progress in Ogatsu is much slower. The post-disaster exodus inland has cut its population from 4,300 to less than 1,000. The number of fishermen, whose average age was over 60 before the disaster, has fallen from 250 to about 40. It will be two years before any oysters reach maturity, and another year before the sea squirts are ready. That said, the company hopes to produce 1.3m kilos of seafood and turn a modest profit by summer 2013. Ogatsu&apos;s struggle is being repeated across Japan&apos;s north-east, where the tsunami caused 1.2tn yen of damage to the fishing industry. In all, 319 fishing ports and 22,000 fishing boats were damaged and last year&apos;s total catch was 60% down on the previous year. The number of fishermen in the region has fallen by a 10th in five years, while only a quarter of those left are below 50. In Miyagi prefecture alone, a third have said they will quit because of the disaster. &quot;We had to stand up and do it for ourselves,&quot; says Ito. &quot;We couldn&apos;t wait for the bureaucrats behind their desks to help us. The government has passed three supplementary budgets, but it could be another two years before we receive any compensation. &quot;The difference between us and the government is that I was directly affected by the disaster. I feel like I&apos;ve died once already \u2026 I&apos;m not scared of failure any more. I survived, and I want to make the most of the chance I&apos;ve been given.&quot; Takashi Tachibana, a food business entrepreneur and a co-founder of Oh Guts, moved from Tokyo to Ogatsu last year to to help market the brand and attract investment. The idea, he says, is for the fishermen to produce, sell and process everything themselves, bypassing the costly and inefficient distribution system many blame for stifling small Japanese fisheries. &quot;You can feel the energy of the people here,&quot; says Tachibana. &quot;Some fishermen may not like the idea of being employed by outsiders, but they will have direct contact with the people who buy their products. That makes a huge difference.&quot; For Ito, restructuring is a small price to pay for the chance to board his boat and inspect beds teeming with oysters and scallops. &quot;We don&apos;t bear a grudge against the sea,&quot; he says. &quot;It took away our living and our loved ones, but now it&apos;s beginning to give something back.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Thousands of others have already left the region in search of jobs and a new start in cities such as Sendai and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-08T19:47:00Z", "title": "Japan tsunami: parents still praying for chance to lay their children to rest", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/08/japan-tsunami-one-year-parents-children", "article": "The trickle of visitors to Okawa primary school began soon after dawn. Three men in dark overcoats, their shaved heads exposed to the freezing elements, stepped out of their black sedan and bowed before a makeshift shrine that has come to symbolise the most distressing episode of the Japan tsunami disaster. Later, a woman arrived and lit sticks of incense, shielding them from the wind, then lingered in front of the tributes: paper cranes, plastic toys and dolls, a bell and bouquets of flowers. Beside them lay a stone carving of a mother cradling an infant bearing the words: &quot;Protect the children.&quot; The message carried extra poignancy for Miho Suzuki, whose two children were among the 74 pupils swept to their deaths last March, along with 10 staff. The body of her son, Kento, was discovered a week later, but after a year-long search, there is still no sign of her eight-year-old daughter, Hana. &quot;I can&apos;t say when or how this pain will end,&quot; said Suzuki, who makes daily pilgrimages to the school, its concrete shell one of the few structures left standing in Ishinomaki, where 3,097 people died and another 2,770 are still missing. &quot;We found our son, but we want Hana back, too. When they found my son&apos;s body I could at least rub his cold hands and wipe the mud from his face. Until Hana is back my family can&apos;t look forward. When she is with us again, perhaps that&apos;s when we can start to move on.&quot; The force of the waves carried bodies for miles along the Tohoku coast or out into the open sea. The official death toll from the disaster stands at 15,854, but another 3,274 \u2013 almost three-quarters of them aged 60 or over \u2013 are unaccounted for. The chances of recovering the corpses, now identifiable only by DNA samples, are receding by the day: search teams found at least 100 bodies a month soon after the disaster, but by the autumn, the number had dropped to a handful. In the fishing town of Kesennuma, police and coastguard crews conduct regular offshore searches in the hope of finding bodies trapped in cars or beneath wreckage resting on the seabed. On the morning the Guardian joined a search team aboard the patrol boat Sasakaze, divers braved icy water and low visibility but returned from the depths with nothing. Only two bodies have been recovered along the entire north-east coast since the start of the year, but coastguard officials insist that the search will go on. &quot;We know from experience how difficult it is to find people who have been swept out to sea,&quot; said Hirofumi Onodera, Kesennuma&apos;s coastguard captain, whose mother and eldest son are among the missing. &quot;But we&apos;ve never thought for a moment of giving up.&quot; The lone figure of Wataru Sato stood at the water&apos;s edge, watching the divers surface briefly before they returned to the bottom of the harbour. Sato, a 68-year-old fisherman, spent weeks looking for his sister, Kiyako, after she was swept off a nearby bridge. &quot;I looked for her every day for 50 days, and then realised it was no use,&quot; said Sato, who lost 10 members of his extended family. &quot;I&apos;m only just beginning to accept that she may never be found.&quot; The search for bodies continues against a dramatic change in the coastal landscape. Then-and-now photographs are testament to the speed with which the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima have cleared their disfigured cities, towns and villages of debris and rubble. Areas that were once a mass of shattered houses and mangled cars, and boats dragged in by the waves, are now flat, vacant spaces. Improvised memorials of stones, crockery and modest heirlooms are the only sign that these deserted tracts of land were once occupied by houses, shops and schools. But the tidy piles of debris \u2013 an estimated 23m tonnes of it \u2013 also point to an inertia that hangs over the north-east coast. So far only 6% of the rubble has been taken away to be recycled, buried or incinerated, with other regions opposed to taking in material they fear could be radioactive. Debris from Fukushima prefecture is to be stored locally. The environment minister, Goshi Hosono, admitted the current pace of disposal could derail plans to complete the job by March 2014: &quot;I want to speed up this process because it is a huge barrier to reconstruction efforts,&quot; he said. Local leaders, meanwhile, are still debating the wisdom of rebuilding in areas that history shows are susceptible to devastating tsunamis. So far not one of the municipalities affected by the disaster has submitted the necessary plans for reconstruction inland or on higher ground, blaming lack of resources and available land, and disagreement among residents. According to one survey, only about half the 6.7tn yen (\u00a352bn) of the reconstruction budget approved last year has been spent, including less than 3% of the cash set aside to repairs roads, levees and sewers. Demand for building materials is rising, but there is little sign of the predicted post-tsunami construction boom, fuelled by government pledges of at least 19tn yen to &quot;reshape&quot; the battered coastline. Japan&apos;s new reconstruction agency, which has been given the job of slicing through the red tape delaying the recovery, was launched only last month. Yuhei Sato, the governor of Fukushima prefecture, spoke for many when he said: &quot;From the victims&apos; perspective, I can&apos;t help but ask ... couldn&apos;t they have launched the agency sooner?&quot; No one, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has articulated a coherent vision for the Tohoku region&apos;s recovery. Officials appear reluctant to countenance anything that involves combining neighbouring towns into new, bigger entities, a measure that would sound the death knell for smaller communities but which some experts believe is inevitable. A solution to the rebuilding problem cannot come quickly enough for the 330,000 people living in temporary accommodation. Thousands of others have already left the region in search of jobs and a new start in cities such as Sendai and Tokyo. The exodus is being led by young people, who are abandoning ageing towns and villages that were afflicted by economic decline and depopulation long before the disaster. The immediate humanitarian crisis has given way to concerns about health problems associated with displacement and life in temporary accommodation \u2013 high blood pressure, pneumonia and heart disease \u2013 particularly among elderly people. In the three worst-affected prefectures, the deaths of more than 1,300 people after 11 March have been attributed to the disaster. The total, according to a survey by the Kyodo news agency, includes an undisclosed number of suicides among residents of temporary housing units. &quot;We are paying more attention to mental health issues now that the emergency response phase has ended,&quot; said Toshitaka Irie, a Japanese Red Cross worker. &quot;We are touring temporary housing complexes to try to get people to open up about their trauma. The problem is that in Japan, people tend to keep things to themselves.&quot; Serious damage to the health infrastructure is hampering efforts to provide healthcare to survivors dotted around a wide area. Hospitals and clinics were among the buildings that were crushed or swept out to sea, while others lie abandoned inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In Ishinomaki, however, there will be little discussion of the future until the wounds of the Okawa tragedy begin to heal. That is unlikely to happen soon. &quot;Some parents want to keep part of the school as a monument to the disaster,&quot; said Naomi Hiratsuka, whose 12-year-old daughter, Koharu, was among the victims. &quot;But I want it to be demolished. There is talk of replacing it with a park, but who would want their children to play in a place like this?&quot; In the distance, workers dredged a section of river as part of their search for the four missing children and one teacher. &quot;This search is just for show,&quot; said Hiratsuka, who obtained a digger&apos;s licence while she was searching for her daughter, whose remains were discovered last autumn, several miles from the spot where she died. &quot;The authorities want to be seen to be doing something for the anniversary. I have been asking them to conduct an intensive search for month, yet it&apos;s taken them almost a year to do anything.&quot; She said her daily search would continue: &quot;I&apos;ll do everything I can to get them back to their families. You look around here and think that everything has changed, but nothing will change as long as they are still somewhere out there.&quot; Some of the parents considered suing school officials for keeping the 108 children in their charge in the playground for 40 minutes before evacuating to a nearby bridge rather than up a steep hill located a short walk away. Suzuki understands their anger, but for her any recriminations will have to come later. &quot;No matter how angry I get with the teachers, it won&apos;t bring back my children,&quot; she said. &quot;What worries me most is that the authorities will call off the search because they&apos;re running out of money. But there are still places where we want them to look, even if there&apos;s only a small chance of finding anyone. I won&apos;t rest until every inch of ground has been covered.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Nobody will skip it on their tours, that would be petty and counter-productive, but they do their business there then head to New York or Tokyo."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Scotland", "British identity and society", "UK news", "Scottish independence", "Music", "Culture", "Frightened Rabbit"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-08T21:00:00Z", "title": "Scottish music: rock of the north", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/08/scottish-music-rock-north", "article": "Aidan Moffat is contemplating whether devolution makes a certain kind of sound. &quot;There seemed for a long time in Scotland to be an embarrassment in being yourself,&quot; says the former Arab Strap vocalist. &quot;When I was young, all Scottish bands seemed to want to be English or American and I found that really peculiar. We&apos;re still a fucking miserable bunch, but we certainly seem more proud and comfortable with our own identity than we were in\u00a0the past.&quot; Novelist Alasdair Gray&apos;s dictum to &quot;work as if you live in the early days of a better nation&quot; \u2013 now carved on the wall of the Scottish parliament \u2013 is finding its most obvious application in Scotland&apos;s vibrant arts output. Almost 15 years after devolution and with the SNP government gearing up for an independence referendum in 2014, a period of seismic change is finding a parallel expression through music. You won&apos;t find many bands north of the border hymning independence or singing about the sanctity of the union \u2013 it&apos;s less clear-cut than that. There is, however, evidence of what folk musician and Burns Unit member Karine Polwart calls &quot;a massive sense of cultural confidence&quot;: acclaimed scenes encompassing everyone from cutting-edge electronic artists to million-selling rock bands; collaborations across genres and art forms; above all, a tangible sense of a nation looking to itself for inspiration and validation. &quot;Many musicians are embracing their Scottishness,&quot; says BBC Radio Scotland&apos;s Vic Galloway. &quot;It&apos;s not about tartan, bagpipes and shortbread, but a contemporary forward-thinking Scotland that isn&apos;t afraid to sing in its own accent and embrace its own culture.&quot;           In the past, Scottish musicians overwhelmingly required the approval of a record industry anchored in the south of England. That has changed, or is at least changing. Selkirk&apos;s Frightened Rabbit generate very little heat in the London press but have signed to Atlantic, pop up on Jimmy Fallon&apos;s TV show and play nightly to audiences of thousands in the US. They have done it by forging links between their base in Scotland and the rest of the world. Many other bands are embarking on a similar path. Instrumental electro-rock group Errors are typical. Signed to a Scottish label and based in Glasgow, &quot;15 years ago we probably would have had to make that decision to move south,&quot; says guitarist Steve Livingstone. &quot;Now there&apos;s more confidence about staying in Scotland. You don&apos;t have to have an office in London to communicate with the rest of the industry.&quot; Musicians may still need to look south for PR and publishing, but &quot;bands are in many ways side-stepping London,&quot; says Galloway. &quot;Nobody will skip it on their tours, that would be petty and counter-productive, but they do their business there then head to New York or Tokyo. They&apos;ve realised that there are wider opportunities, and that clearly mirrors the political situation.&quot; Meanwhile, a devolved Scotland has shored up its own institutions. T in the Park is the UK&apos;s second-biggest live event and globally renowned, while Celtic Connections is one of the leading lights in the worldwide roots calendar. Organisations such as Scottish Arts Council, Creative Scotland and even the National Theatre of Scotland all play supporting roles. In the bones of the music, too, there are obvious signifiers of a cultural shift. One is a widespread willingness to reclaim traditional music and twist it into new shapes. &quot;For years folk music was the only form that always used a Scottish voice and language, that was the only place it was acceptable,&quot; says Moffat. &quot;We&apos;ve found a new respect for that and its value has come to light again.&quot; Two decades ago the Proclaimers were, notes Moffat, &quot;roundly mocked&quot; for being virtually the only high-profile Scottish act to sing in their own accent; now it&apos;s the norm. Language is always political, and the willingness of singers to embrace their natural voice constitutes a clear statement. &quot;Hearing Arab Strap sing in their local dialect gave me the confidence to sing in my own accent and write about where I live,&quot; says the Twilight Sad&apos;s singer James Graham, who has become accustomed to American audiences &quot;singing back at us in a pretend Scottish accent, which sounds like Groundskeeper Willie. We don&apos;t wear a Scottish badge, but if people are put off by the accent they&apos;re not going to like our music. It actually feels a bit weird when you hear a Scottish band not singing in their own accent.&quot; Not everyone agrees. Music isn&apos;t football or politics, and some musicians worry that overtly transmitting their Scottishness enforces old stereotypes or even leans toward a form of cultural apartheid. For Livingstone, &quot;the accent still has too many ties that aren&apos;t particularly positive. I&apos;m not that comfortable with it. It still seems quite cheesy to me, and some bands who sing in Scottish aren&apos;t actually using their natural accents. It&apos;s exaggerated.&quot; Vic Galloway concedes the point. &quot;There are bands out there \u2013 I could name them but I won&apos;t \u2013 who have obviously heard Glasvegas or Arab Strap or Fence Collective and are overdoing their own accent. They sound disingenuous.&quot; Moffat acknowledges a &quot;danger that you can end up shutting yourself off&quot; by being too colloquial, &quot;but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to happen. As long as we can maintain an international reach there&apos;s no harm in looking to our own culture.&quot; Glasvegas&apos;s James Allan believes that the connection between political and cultural change &quot;is probably quite indirect. Your surroundings always creep in, but it&apos;s not to do with a specific political vision for the country.&quot; He points out that &quot;issues aren&apos;t very different throughout the world \u2013 the things I sing about aren&apos;t exclusive to Scotland&quot;. Several musicians emphasise the importance of the internet in breaking borders while making the point that what&apos;s happening in Scotland has been happening in other parts of the UK and further afield: more musicians exploring their local culture, more Welsh-language pop and songs with a Mackem or Yorkshire brogue. Polwart reckons the changes in Scotland run deeper, emphasising a mutually supportive network of artists and an upsurge in collaborative projects like Ballad of the Books and Whatever Gets You Through The Night, a new multimedia endeavour featuring specially commissioned words and music by musicians, poets, playwrights and novelists from across Scotland, including David Greig, RM Hubbert, Withered Hand and Errors. &quot;Communitarianism is a really strong part of our national character,&quot; she says. &quot;The links now across genres are incredible and very natural, people are no longer operating in their little pockets. There&apos;s a general respect that just wasn&apos;t there 20 years ago. It&apos;s normal in Scotland and I&apos;m not sure it is normal anywhere else in the UK. It&apos;s beautiful and quite special.&quot; Has devolution driven these changes or has culture dictated the political agenda? It&apos;s impossible to tell, but it&apos;s likely that the same shift in thinking that made the Scottish parliament a reality and has put independence on the table parallels the way Scotland&apos;s arts have evolved. &quot;I do feel it&apos;s all connected and quite exciting,&quot; says Polwart. &quot;It&apos;s part of a whole debate about whether there is something distinctly different about the Scottish way of doing things. Devolution is a product of that feeling rather than a cause.&quot; Although she cheerfully talks about holding &quot;two fingers up at what&apos;s going on in the London-centric scene,&quot; Polwart is adamant that the resurgence in Scotland&apos;s national identity is not, by and large, anti-English. &quot;There&apos;s none of that chippiness. It&apos;s nothing to do with hatred or defining yourself against something else.&quot; James Graham agrees that the creative energy is overwhelmingly positive. &quot;There&apos;s a collective feeling that something is happening, and I&apos;m proud to be a part of that.&quot; It remains to be seen whether independence becomes a reality, and whether it would prove a blessing or a curse for Scotland. Whatever occurs in 2014, a significant process of cultural realignment is already well under way. &quot;Everyone has big plans,&quot; says Moffat. &quot;I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;ll vote in the independence referendum, but in the general election Alex Salmond was the only one going: &apos;We&apos;re brilliant.&apos; Everyone else says: &apos;Times are tough, it&apos;s horrible.&apos; He said: &apos;Fuck all that, we&apos;re amazing!&apos; He&apos;s a perfect reflection of a new attitude that seems to be catching \u2013 and he&apos;s right. We should be proud of our culture, and we don&apos;t need the approval of anyone.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Now four years on he may be back to make more history and compete in his third Games \u2013 the first of which was in his native Tokyo in 1964."], "tags": ["Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-09T17:51:17Z", "title": "London 2012: best of the web | Lee Rosborough", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/mar/09/london-2012-olympics-blog", "article": "Stripping ultra-fit in Gaza The training for Palestinian athletes could not be more of a contrast to that of Team GB and many other nations competing at the London games.

On 11 March 2011 \u2013 3/11, as it&apos;s become known \u2013 one of the largest earthquakes in the history of the country was followed by a tsunami that swallowed 500km of the coastline of the Tohoku region. As Japan grapples with the recovery process, the demographic and financial problems that existed prior to 3/11 have accelerated. And although hardly anything positive can be said about the largest disaster in Japan since the second world war, it did unite the nation and sounded a much needed wake-up call. A strong sense of national compassion and gratitude for what people still had emerged. In Tokyo, where citizens are known never to converse with strangers, greetings were exchanged more often. In the subway, when an earthquake alarm sounded, strangers would offer each other reassurance. However, while initially everyone in Japan rushed to volunteer and help the people of Tohoku, things are a little different now. One can&apos;t help but wonder if the discourse would be different had it been Tokyo that was washed away. The fact is Tohoku&apos;s economy and industries were already in severe decline prior to 3/11. It was one of the most isolated regions of Japan, and young people were leaving in vast numbers, seeking better opportunities elsewhere. Hospitals were in debt and farmers and fisheries suffered from increased competition. In all honesty I had never been to, or thought of Tohoku before 3/11. While all of Japan felt sorry for the citizens of Tohoku and remained concerned about the condition of the nuclear plant in Fukushima, the rest of the country began to resume its normal way of life in the months following 3/11, and the plight of Tohoku started to recede in people&apos;s minds. The media focuses on it less, people talk about it less frequently \u2013 even though the recovery there has been extremely slow, especially in comparison with cities like Kobe, Japan&apos;s port city that bore the brunt of a massive earthquake in 1995. I work for Impact Japan, an organisation that develops new projects to help the area. Many of the youngsters from Tohoku that I work with lost their friends and families to the tsunami. I met a boy named Masahiro Kikuchi. Although only 17, his head is covered with grey hair from shock and stress. I know two 16-year-old girls who faced the horrible decision of saving themselves from the tsunami or staying behind with their injured mothers and dying. They chose life, and it haunts them. As you listen to them, dry your own tears and struggle to offer them some meaningful words of comfort, they try to ease the process for you by smiling and laughing. I wonder at how these kids can still smile. They do, however, and it is inspiring to listen to them as they calmly say that, despite everything, they are not the most unfortunate children in the world. Hope lies in their compassion and bravery, and we cannot abandon them. It is most painful when I hear young adults express their feelings of guilt, for daring to hope that their dreams will become a reality when their home-towns are suffering. They say that they should keep their goals smaller and focused on helping their communities. Sustainable aid, such as providing better housing for those displaced, re-employing nurses who lost their jobs due to the destruction of hospitals in newly established clinics, improving and generating new industries, or helping young people maximise their potential, is now more important than immediate, short-term aid. To help in the long-term, we must create an environment where the people can thrive, build, and feel free to aspire.

At 2.46pm local time (5.46am GMT), a year on from the moment the magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck, people across Japan bowed their heads and observed a minute&apos;s silence, while sirens sounded in the dozens of coastal communities still in mourning for the 15,800 people confirmed dead and 3,300 others still missing. In Tokyo, some train services came to a standstill, and the emperor, empress, prime minister, foreign dignitaries and hundreds of survivors attended a ceremony at the capital&apos;s national theatre. In Ishinomaki, where the tsunami left more than 5,700 people dead or missing, hundreds attended a service at Minato primary school, where some had taken refuge after the disaster. Many remained silent after the official silence, hands clasped in prayer as Buddhist monks chanted sutras before an altar laden with white chrysanthemums. As darkness fell, children lit paper lanterns bearing simple messages that resonate across the region: togetherness, hope and strength. The people of the city, almost half of which was submerged beneath waves of up to 10 metres in height, are torn between two overwhelming emotions: deep sadness at the loss of life, and a determination to look forward. Masaru Sasaki, a 71-year-old taxi driver, came to remember his wife, daughter and grandson, all swept away by the waves. &quot;In some ways, the last 12 months have passed quickly,&quot; he said. &quot;But when I think of my family, it seems like a lifetime. &quot;I am lucky enough to be able to work, and I gain strength each day from my passengers. If I didn&apos;t have that, I don&apos;t think I could go on living.&quot; The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, vowed that Japan would be &quot;reborn as en even better place&quot;. &quot;Our predecessors who brought prosperity to have repeatedly risen up from crises, every time becoming stronger,&quot; he said. &quot;We will stand by the people from the disaster-hit areas and join hands to achieve the historic task of rebuilding.&quot; It is impossible to overstate the size of that task. Exactly a year after they were sent fleeing by waves of up to 20 metres in height, more than 320,000 displaced people are still living in temporary housing along the north-east coast. An estimated 23m tonnes of rubble has been removed and placed in piles, but only a fraction has been buried or incinerated. The cost of rebuilding dozens of cities, towns and villages on higher ground is expected to cost Japanese taxpayers $230bn (\u00a3145bn) over the next 10 years. Some of that will come from an expected doubling of the sales tax; rather less palatable, for many, are the tens of billions the government will spend to prop up the company at the centre of the nuclear crisis, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). The sense of loss was tinged with bitterness at the slow pace of reconstruction and the government&apos;s handling of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. On Friday, newly released government documents revealed that Japan&apos;s cabinet was aware of the imminent risk of a meltdown, but elected to suppress the information for weeks unless it sparked panic among the public. Tepco did not publicly acknowledge a partial meltdown in three reactors until May. &quot;I no longer trust the government,&quot; Ayumi Sato said as she left a memorial service in Ishinomaki cradling her baby daughter. &quot;This disaster has made me realise that the only people capable of looking after our daughter&apos;s future are me and my husband.&quot; Amid the solemnity came protest. In Fukushima prefecture and Tokyo, thousands turned out to demand the permanent closure of all of Japan&apos;s nuclear reactors. An estimated 12,000 protesters in the capital formed a human chain around the parliament building. All but two of the country&apos;s 54 reactors are currently closed for maintenance checks, and will not be permitted to restart unless they pass tests of their ability to withstand catastrophic events and win approval from host communities spooked by the Fukushima accident. The triple meltdown at Fukushima forced the immediate evacuation of 80,000 people living within 20km; a similar number have left other towns and villages outside the evacuation zone where high levels of radiation have been found. The operation to decontaminate the area is expected to last years, and neighbourhoods closest to the plant could remain uninhabitable for decades. In Tokyo, Emperor Akihito acknowledged the difficulties facing Fukushima&apos;s displaced residents. &quot;In order to make the area inhabitable again, we face the difficult problem of removing radiation,&quot; the 78-year-old, who has recently undergone heart surgery, said in a brief address. &quot;We shall not let our memory of the disasters fade, pay attention to disaster prevention and continue our effort to make this land an even safer place to live.&quot; After workers at Fukushima Daiichi observed a minute&apos;s silence, Tepco&apos;s president, Toshio Nishizawa, expressed his &quot;heartfelt sympathy&quot; to the victims of the disaster and apologised to residents living near the stricken plant. &quot;While always keeping in mind the tremendous responsibility we have to maintain stable conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, we will continue to safely work toward the mid- to long-term decommissioning of the reactors. &quot;The day of 11 March is forever etched on the hearts and minds of every Tepco employee.&quot; Many survivors chose to mark the day in private. Yuko Sugimoto, who became a symbol of the tsunami when she was photographed, draped in a blanket amid the wreckage, searching for her son, Raito, whose nursery was partly submerged. Sugimoto and Raito, who had been rescued by the military from the nursery roof, were reunited two days later. A year on, life was beginning to return to normal, she said, but for her son, the mental scars had yet to heal. &quot;He won&apos;t let me leave him, even for a minute,&quot; she said at her new home outside Ishinomaki. &quot;When we had tsunami warnings after 11 March he was physically sick. He&apos;s doing his best to appear normal, but I know that on the inside he is still in a great deal of pain.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Fail-safe measures to cope with a super-disaster are practically beyond the nation&apos;s wealth: the worst-case scenario is sequential or even simultaneous occurrence in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, the central Pacific coast and the southwestern Pacific coast.", "And the highly concentrated population and functions of megalopolises, particularly Tokyo, will have to disperse to smaller hub cities in order to dissipate the risks involved in a super-disaster."], "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Earthquakes"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-11T14:00:01Z", "title": "After the earthquake: changing Japan | Masahiro Matsumura", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/11/japan-tsunami-earthquake-recovery-future", "article": "On the first anniversary of the huge earthquake that hit Japan&apos;s northeastern Pacific coast, its people are still coming to terms with their grief and trying to work out what the disaster meant for the nation. Although 3/11, as it&apos;s become known, was a bolt from the blue, the country \u2013 located in one of the world&apos;s largest and most active volcanic zones \u2013 had long expected a great earthquake and tsunami to occur sooner or later. It was well prepared for the type of disaster that would happen once every 100 years, but not for a far greater one-in-a-1000-years one. No wonder the catastrophe overwhelmed Japan&apos;s well-laid plans for protecting people, buildings and infrastructure. Fail-safe measures to cope with a super-disaster are practically beyond the nation&apos;s wealth: the worst-case scenario is sequential or even simultaneous occurrence in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, the central Pacific coast and the southwestern Pacific coast. Alongside national and local government efforts to improve disaster preparations, individuals now have to consider the topographic, geological and social features of their homes and workplaces, and have less choice over where to live than in the past. The areas devastated on 3/11 need a new and comprehensive approach to urban planning and social programmes. In coastal areas, people may work on the seafront but have to live on high ground. The elderly in this rapidly greying society, who often live alone, need to move into regional hubs for better care and services, such as collective housing. And the highly concentrated population and functions of megalopolises, particularly Tokyo, will have to disperse to smaller hub cities in order to dissipate the risks involved in a super-disaster. The general sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by the continuation of the restrictions on the electricity supply caused by the shutdown of all the country&apos;s nuclear power plants for checks. The badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant discharged massive amounts of nuclear pollutants, endangering population in the immediate vicinity. As the only nation that has suffered an atomic bombing, Japan reacted sharply to the nuclear accident. However, its people were unknowingly exposed to a considerably higher level of radiation resulting from the nuclear test explosions that China conducted in the 1960s, and nowadays they commonly undergo radiation-based medical examinations such as X-raying and CT scanning. In order to make up the 30% drop in power supply caused by the shutdown, electricity companies have reactivated old thermal power plants, and businesses and individuals have conserved power. People wore fewer clothes in the summer to reduce the need for air conditioning, and wrapped up warmer in winter. And many businesses worked over weekends, shifting a weekend holiday to a week day, to ease peaks in power demand. Nonetheless, energy from fossil-fuels costs more than nuclear, so bills have been higher, which has damaged Japan&apos;s international competitiveness. As the sense of fear calms down, however, the public will probably learn to accept nuclear power again, though with a reduced dependence. All the nuclear plants withstood the 3/11 seismic shock, though the three damaged reactors at Fukushima did not survive the tsunami. And two of those three reactors used the old, defective US-built turn-key model, prior to the construction of Japanese-designed, modified ones. Protection against the tsunami threat can be improved; but if sufficient work cannot be done, the plants on the Pacific coast will have to be relocated to the opposite Sea-of-Japan coast that suffers far fewer earthquakes. This could all have been done even before 3/11. In this sense, the nuclear accident was attributable in part to intellectual arrogance and a longstanding but inadequate safety regime. With their loss of peace of mind, many Japanese people feel as if they have been expelled from a country close to paradise. Yet 3/11 has made the people far tougher and the nation more resilient. The postwar era is now over, and the post-disaster era is under way. Natural disaster, not war, will finally transform Japan&apos;s carefree cold-war era collective mind. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["     It was an otherwise quiet Friday afternoon at the Associated Press bureau in central Tokyo.", "From AP&apos;s seventh-floor office in Tokyo, he oversaw the agency&apos;s &quot;small army&quot; of journalists who embarked by car and air to the north-east of the island.", "It just went on and on and on; there was no sleeping for the first 60 hours.&quot; Edelsten is speaking by telephone from his car in Tokyo."], "tags": ["News agencies", "Media", "Associated Press", "Tsunamis", "Japan disaster", "Fukushima", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-12T15:11:13Z", "title": "Japan's tsunami one year on: the newsman's story", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/12/japan-tsunami-anniversary-news", "article": "     It was an otherwise quiet Friday afternoon at the Associated Press bureau in central Tokyo. Camera crews had left the bustling capital for the regions, and the agency&apos;s TV newsroom was desolate apart from two people sitting silently at their computers. Then the earthquake hit. A devastating tsunami slammed into the north coast of Japan and sent violent tremors down the island. &quot;We were wrapping stuff up, doing administrative work, and then the whole building started shaking,&quot; recalls Miles Edelsten, the veteran AP producer who has experienced innumerable earthquakes during his 12 years in Japan. &quot;It was after 20 or 30 seconds that I realised this was the biggest tremor I&apos;d ever felt. It went on for so long.&quot; Edelsten believes he filmed the first footage of the tsunami to come out of the region. His shaky footage of terrified colleagues and rocking buildings was far from perfect \u2013 &quot;It looks blue because I didn&apos;t have time to do the white balance&quot; \u2013 but it became one of the defining images of the first natural disaster to play out live on TV news channels across the globe. &quot;I thought, the world has never seen a live tsunami before \u2013 there&apos;s no way they can miss this,&quot; he says. &quot;At the time that was the best footage because it was the newest. The first thing the world saw [of the tsunami] was our office shaking and the terrified faces of our Japanese colleagues.&quot; Edelsten broke with agency procedure and bypassed permissions to beam the video out to the world. His video was being broadcast on all the major networks within 20 minutes of being filmed, he estimates. The next 24 hours went by in a blur. From AP&apos;s seventh-floor office in Tokyo, he oversaw the agency&apos;s &quot;small army&quot; of journalists who embarked by car and air to the north-east of the island. The agency boss insists he was not concerned about competing with the huge volume of citizen-generated video being uploaded to the internet. The website YouTube said that 7,000 tsunami-related videos were published on the site in the hours after the first tremor. Thousands more shared information on Twitter and Facebook. &quot;It really didn&apos;t stop for about six weeks,&quot; says Edelsten. &quot;It starts slower than you think. After the first rush of getting your footage out there, it becomes a volume game. It just went on and on and on; there was no sleeping for the first 60 hours.&quot; Edelsten is speaking by telephone from his car in Tokyo. He is driving back from the Fukushima radiation zone, where he was interviewing a local farmer who refused to evacuate the area along with the 100,000 who left when three nuclear reactors went into meltdown. The farmer&apos;s story will feature on AP bulletins as part of its coverage of the tsunami&apos;s first anniversary on Sunday. &quot;Looking back, even at the time it was quite obvious we were the biggest story in the world,&quot; Edelsten says. &quot;It&apos;s something that has never really been seen before, because the Asian tsunami wasn&apos;t really caught on camera.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["    Hometown: Tokyo."], "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Culture", "Britpop"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-13T16:50:40Z", "title": "New band of the day \u2013 Taffy (No 1,227)", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/13/new-band-taffy", "article": "    Hometown: Tokyo.  The lineup: Iris (vocals, rhythm guitar), Koichin (bass), Asano (lead guitar), Ken (drums). The background: We tend to think of revivalists as bands lifting from a specific genre or era, but Taffy cast their net a bit wider, taking influences from British alternative music from 1986 to 1996 \u2013 ie from C86 to Britpop, and most points (shoegazing, indie-grunge, not baggy) in between. (But mainly Britpop.) This is when the UK guitar scene was at its &quot;whitest&quot;, least groovy (pace Madchester, hence perhaps Taffy&apos;s disinclination to embrace it) and, well, guitary, and those guitars were alternately fuzzy and jangly. Playing their debut album, Caramel Sunset, due out in May, is a bit like listening to one of those mid-90s indie compilation albums, titled for some unfathomable reason Shine, that Steve Lamacq or Jo Whiley used to advertise on TV, featuring lots of those girl-fronted bands with three token indistinguishable backup blokes such as Echobelly, Salad, Catatonia or Sleeper. Why they would want to do this \u2013 that is, evoke an era that has mainly been consigned to the dumper of history, except by Viva Brother and All the Young \u2013 we&apos;re not sure.  Something that has also stumped us is how Taffy have taken a largely ignorable period and managed to make it not a horrible racket at all but actually something tuneful and great. Suddenly we&apos;re nostalgic for a time we thought we wanted to forget. Apparently, the Japanese have been fetishising this brand of Brit-indie for a while now with bands such as Clams and Hotel Mexico, and maybe that&apos;s why Caramel Sunset is so easy on the ear. Taffy haven&apos;t fallen into this because it&apos;s a safe career move, as one got the impression some of the Thames Valley and Britpop bands did. They&apos;ve been studying this music for a while, poring over it, honing and finessing it, and have come up with an idealised version that actually improves on what it&apos;s designed to be copying. They&apos;ve perfected something that was deeply flawed.  At times, it almost comes across like parody, and a successful, fully realised one at that \u2013 cf the crass underachievement of yesterday&apos;s confused mess of a concept outfit. Whatever you think of them or what they do, you have to admit they do it well. The sing-song tone of frontwoman Iris, whose voice we love \u2013 someone please play it to Adele and all the soul girls every night before they go to bed; maybe it&apos;ll persuade them to stop blaring \u2013 captures the insouciant swagger of Sonya Echobelly, Justine Frischmann, Louise Wener et al. And they&apos;ve got the pale wash of guitar, bass and drums spot-on. It&apos;s to Taffy&apos;s credit that they make what they do so readily classifiable and identifiable, considering how uniquely characterless Britpop was. Young Girls and Cherry Pie breaks with the remit, being more &apos;76 (a Blondie/Buzzcocks bed-in) than &apos;86 or &apos;96, and it highlights the sometimes creepy Japanese predilection for all things cute. Most of these tracks are riffy and fast \u2013 one of them is reminiscent of Status Quo&apos;s Paper Plane being performed by the Primitives (who are back, by the way). Everyone&apos;s a zinger, baby, that&apos;s no lie. And they rattle through them like the music&apos;s about to go out of fashion, which is funny because that&apos;s never going to happen. The buzz: &quot;Fuzzed-up pop gems. Guitar buzzes like a toy chainsaw over which Iris&apos;s angelic voice glides effortlessly&quot; \u2013 The Japan Times.  The truth: It&apos;s like Britpop never stopped happening.  Most likely to: Commit the sin of imitation. What to buy: So Long is released by Club AC30 on 21 April, followed by the album Caramel Sunset on 7 May. File next to: Shonen Knife, Echobelly, Salad, Bis.

What was your big breakthrough? Performing the complete series of Mozart piano concertos in London and\u00a0Tokyo, and then recording them.\u00a0It\u00a0was very much a matter of\u00a0timing: the record company had\u00a0wanted me to\u00a0record Schubert, but\u00a0[the\u00a0film] Amadeus had just come\u00a0out,\u00a0and Mozart was very much\u00a0in\u00a0vogue.

I don&apos;t want to possess anything that is important \u2013 I want it to be somewhere that everybody can go to. But if I were forced to, I&apos;d choose The Little Street, a\u00a0teensy painting by Vermeer, or one of\u00a0Van Gogh&apos;s paintings of clogs. They&apos;re self-portraits, really. I couldn&apos;t face his face every day, but I&apos;d like to face his shoes. What one piece of music would work as the soundtrack to your life? Mozart&apos;s Marriage of Figaro.

Phil Baty, rankings editor at Times Higher Education magazine, said there was a clear risk that UK universities, other than Oxford and Cambridge, would be &quot;relegated from the premier league \u2026 in the eyes of the world, with tangible and sustained damage&quot;. &quot;Perception is reality and it seems that we are perceived as a fading power,&quot; he said. &quot;Our data provides clear evidence that, in terms of prestige among academics around the world, there is the start of a power shift from the west to the east.&quot; Academics taking part in the survey have worked in universities for an average of more than 16 years and published several papers. There are several other league tables of the world&apos;s universities, but this one only ranks institutions on their reputation. Universities are likely to use the rankings to judge how much they should charge in tuition fees. Shabana Mahmood, the shadow minister for higher education, said: &quot;While it is a sign of our strength that the UK is one of only four countries represented in the top 20 universities in the world, the government should sit up and take note of the relative decline of UK institutions compared to those in Europe, the far east and Australia. &quot;This is symptomatic of the chaos and confusion being created by the government as a result of their rapid changes to higher education. Trebling tuition fees and cutting funding to universities has damaged the promise of Britain and this has been reflected around the world.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Developed by Sega&apos;s Smilebit team (now responsible for the Yakuza series), this unusual adventure pitted rival graffiti gangs against each other on the streets of Tokyo, tagging buildings and vehicles while avoiding the cops.", "The game&apos;s three chapters will take in five areas of both Tokyo and the fictitious Grind City, all visually overhauled, but still recognisable to fans.", "Plus, the vibrant depiction of a hyper-real Tokyo street culture \u2013 all robotic otaku and brash decora girls \u2013 is likely to be worth the entrance price all by itself."], "tags": ["Simulation games", "Games", "Technology", "Rap", "Dance music", "PS3", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "PC", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-15T12:47:56Z", "title": "Jet Set Radio - preview", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/15/jet-set-radio-preview", "article": "A decade ago, for a few fleeting moments, Sega had some of the most creative and boundary-pushing developers in the business. Its arcade division was pumping out brash, genre-hopping oddities like Crazy Taxi, Brave Fire Fighters and Jambo Safari, while on Dreamcast there were dizzyingly fresh experiences such as Rez, Chu Chu Rocket and Shemue \u2013 games of imagination, colour and flamboyance. Games that truly celebrated their game-ness. Then there was Jet Set Radio. Developed by Sega&apos;s Smilebit team (now responsible for the Yakuza series), this unusual adventure pitted rival graffiti gangs against each other on the streets of Tokyo, tagging buildings and vehicles while avoiding the cops. It had a ridiculous J-rap/dance/rock soundtrack and daft characters who reflected a crazy nineties reading of early eighties New York street culture. Most importantly, it popularlised a new way of rendering 3D visuals so that every object had a cartoon-like black border. It was called cell-shading, and for a while everyone was doing it \u2013 indeed, lots of developers still are (see Catherine, Borderlands 2 and Fable Heroes). It was perhaps one of the most important things to happen to polygonal graphics since the introduction of texture mapping; it meant that 3D didn&apos;t have to be synonymous with photo-realism, that 3D could also be strange and subjective. It was modernism all over again. Now Sega is bringing out a new translation for XBLA, PSN and Steam, in 16:9 widescreen HD. It&apos;s an amalgamation of the original Jet Set Radio with the US version, Jet Grind Radio (which added a couple of extra maps and new songs), and the Japan-only update, De La Jet Set Radio. The game&apos;s three chapters will take in five areas of both Tokyo and the fictitious Grind City, all visually overhauled, but still recognisable to fans. Key selectable characters Gum, Tab and Beat are also back, displaying their aggressive rude kid attitudes as though it were still 2000.     Jet Set Radio    I played a brief demo of the Shibuya bus station level at a Sega press event in London last week. As ever, the challenge is to locate the graffiti tags left by rival gang members and then cover them up with your own. While exploring the environments, there are rails to grind, ramps to jump and tricks to pull off; these still combo together nicely, bringing in the open, breezy fun of the early Tony Hawks titles. The controls have been well mapped to modern twin analogue controllers. The right stick controls the camera, allowing you to size up areas and plan tricks with more ease; right trigger is speed, and left sets you up in front of a wall to start spraying some paint. Tagging is a case of copying the onscreen directions with the left stick in order to control your characters&apos; spray can. Things feel a little fiddly at first, and my skater was constantly failing to get onto the correct trick lines because the turning circle is very wide. But, as in the original, you get the hang of it and begin to learn the correct routes through the leaps, walkways and stopped traffic. With the timer ticking down, officers of the law soon arrive, marching in like a freakish combination of the Thought Police and the Keystone Cops. The game retains its sense of both freedom and pressure. It&apos;s still fun. Sega is looking to add extra contemporary value to the release. Along with online leaderboards, players are able to create their own tags; according to the Sega rep I spoke to, there are plans for an upload service allowing graffiti to be shared and rated \u2013 although other reports suggest this has been ruled out. The publisher is also considering DLC packs by famous graffiti artists (the game&apos;s original tags were created by early Banksy collaborator, Inkie). It also comes with Trophies and Achievements.     Jet Set Radio    The soundtrack has yet to be fully announced, but some tracks are likely to be missing due to licensing difficulties. The question is, I guess, whether this idiosyncratic title will have anything to offer newcomers. I think it may. Like the also soon-to-be-updated Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater, Jet Set Radio speaks about a period in game design when developers were toying with open-world structures while catering for a new audience of post-pub, twenty-something players who wanted their lifestyles reflected in the games they bought. Whole new genres were emerging. They were interesting days. Plus, the vibrant depiction of a hyper-real Tokyo street culture \u2013 all robotic otaku and brash decora girls \u2013 is likely to be worth the entrance price all by itself. Jet Set Radio is a fashion museum with a serviceable freestyle skating game attached. And if you were there at the time of Sega&apos;s pomp, those heady days of experimentation and craft, it is almost certain \u2013 unless the other maps are catastrophically bad \u2013 to raise a warm smile of recognition. \u2022 Jet Set Radio will be released on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC in summer 2012 "}, {"sentences": ["Gadget fans have been camping outside Apple stores in London, Sydney and Tokyo to be among the first to get their hands on the new iPad.", "About 450 people queued outside Apple&apos;s Ginza store in downtown Tokyo."], "tags": ["iPad", "Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Gadgets", "Business", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-16T09:19:51Z", "title": "New iPad goes on sale: thousands queue around the globe", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/16/new-ipad-on-sale-thousands-queue", "article": "Gadget fans have been camping outside Apple stores in London, Sydney and Tokyo to be among the first to get their hands on the new iPad. The third version of Apple&apos;s popular tablet computer will also go on sale in the US and several other countries on Friday. Some people have spent days queuing outside the Apple store in London&apos;s Regent Street, which opened at 8am, and more arrived in the early hours of Friday morning. The new model iPad comes with a faster processor and a much sharper screen, as well as voice dictation and an improved camera, similar to that of the iPhone 4S. It ranges in price from \u00a3399 to \u00a3659. First in the queue was Zohaib Ali, 21, from Uxbridge in north-west London, who waited for five days and already owns an iPad, iPhone, iPod, Macbook and iMac. &quot;The iPad is the best product of the year and there won&apos;t be any more until 2013 so I am happy to queue. I love Apple products,&quot; he said. Men outnumbered women 10:1, and the average age of those in the queue was 25. It was a queue of confirmed technophiles, each carrying \u00a31,217 worth of electronic gadgets, from iPods to smartphones and laptops. Those waiting were handed free food and drink by companies they had contacted through Twitter. Noah Green, a 16-year-old student from Stanmore, north-west London, had been fourth in the queue but took \u00a3300 to move back. He said: &quot;It is worth it. I am still 18th in the queue so I will be one of the first to buy an iPad. I am going to sell it though and earn some money.&quot; When asked why they were queuing, almost a third \u2013 32% \u2013 said they were die-hard Apple fans, followed by 27% who said they had returned after queuing for earlier generation iPads, according to gadget insurer Protectyourbubble.com. Meanwhile, 15% said they were waiting because they had missed out on pre-orders, and 10% were there to soak up the atmosphere. There were fewer people waiting in line than for the iPad 2 launch, probably because Apple has opened another store in Covent Garden. In Sydney, David Tarasenko, a 34-year-old construction manager who was the first to pick up the iPad from a Telstra store at midnight, said ever since Apple chief executive Tim Cook had revealed the tablet&apos;s third iteration, he couldn&apos;t wait to get one. &quot;When Tim Cook announced it, it sounded like such a magical tool. I just got hyped into it, I guess,&quot; he said. He bought one with 4G mobile broadband capability \u2013 although warning stickers on the box say that that specific functionality will not work with Australia&apos;s networks. About 450 people queued outside Apple&apos;s Ginza store in downtown Tokyo. Some slept outside the store to be at the front of the queue when it opened at 8am, two hours earlier than usual. The excitement has benefited Apple&apos;s stock, which briefly touched $600 (\u00a3381) for the first time on Thursday. Apple is the world&apos;s most valuable company, with a market cap of nearly $555bn. Two years after the debut of the first iPad, the launch of a new version has become the second-biggest &quot;gadget event&quot; of the year, after the annual iPhone release. A year ago, thousands lined up outside the flagship Apple store on New York&apos;s Fifth Avenue. The tablet computer sold out on launch day, even though it did not go on sale until 5pm. In Hong Kong, a steady stream of buyers picked up their new devices at preset times at the city&apos;s only Apple store. The system, which required buyers to have local ID cards, helped thwart attempts by visitors from mainland China to scoop up gadgets early and avoid sales tax at home. The iPad&apos;s release date in China has not been announced yet. Those who placed orders online will have to wait for two to three weeks for delivery. Apple quickly ran out of supplies it set aside for advance orders. The new tablet is called &quot;the new iPad,&quot; rather than &quot;iPad 3&quot;. This is consistent with Apple&apos;s naming practice for iPods, MacBooks and iMacs, but a break with the way iPhone models are named. Despite competition from cheaper tablet computers such as Amazon.com&apos;s Kindle Fire, the iPad remains the most popular tablet. Apple has sold more than 55m iPads since its debut in 2010, including some 40m last year, and is estimated to have more than 60% of the tablet market. Wall Street expects a strong start for the latest iPad and some analysts even expect sales of the current model to overtake the iPad 2. Apple will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100 to start at $399. Sam Noble, of digital marketing specialist Koozai, said: &quot;People queuing for days on end on Regent Street is not just a curiosity among consumers, but a precursor to fundamental change in the way companies and consumers interact. &quot;Tablets and mobile devices are rapidly overtaking desktop PCs as the preferred way people consume content online, so companies need to shape their content and campaigns accordingly. Few are doing so despite the fact that change is staring them in the face. Are their websites and PPC strategies optimised for tablets and mobile devices?&quot; Online reviews of the new iPad have overwhelmingly praised Apple for its improved screen resolution. &quot;My epiphany came when I placed my iPad 2 next to the new model, with the same text on the screen. Letters and words that had seemed sharp on the older model five minutes earlier suddenly looked fuzzier,&quot; said Walt Mossberg at the AllThingsD website. The inner workings of the iPad are similar to previous models, based on a teardown by the Californian gadget-repair firm iFixit, one of whose team queued up in Australia to get one of the new tablets and quickly took it apart. iFixit cofounder Luke Soules found Apple suppliers Qualcomm, Broadcom and Samsung had maintained their key roles in the newest iPad. It includes a Qualcomm LTE cellphone chip and a Qualcomm wireless modem for 3G and 4G. Broadcom supplies a semiconductor handling wireless tasks like WiFi and Bluetooth, according to iFixit."}, {"sentences": ["Sushi-lovers with \u00a3250 can invest in the Tokyo Sushi Kit \u2013 it comes complete with everything from a rice cooker to a rolling mat."], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-16T10:00:00Z", "title": "Food DIY: the whole kit and caboodle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/mar/16/food-diy-whole-kit-caboodle", "article": "Have you ever thought about trying your hand at making your own cheese or sausages, or having an ambitious stab at molecular gastronomy, but been unsure where to start? Enter the proliferation of kits containing ingredients, implements and instructions, and promising that making your own can be as easy as buying in. But are they any good? Anyone who spends much time watching the interminable stream of food programmes on television can be forgiven for forming the impression that merely cooking dinner isn&apos;t good enough any more. The implication is that if you&apos;re not sous-viding like Jason Atherton, spherifying like Ferran Adri\u00e0 or making your own air-dried beef like our own Tim Hayward you&apos;re just not putting enough effort in. By removing much of the guesswork (and some of the skill) from these processes, food kits promise to make it possible for home cooks to produce professional results while still claiming the kudos of doing it themselves. Even if you don&apos;t fancy yourself as the next Dom Coyte, cheese seems like the obvious place to begin a journey into the world of food kits. I spoke to Jaap de Jonge of Jongia UK, who sells a huge range of equipment for the artisan and amateur cheesemaker: wax, wire, cultures and more. A starter kit for home cheesemaking contains instructions for hard and soft cheeses, as well as culture, rennet, moulds, muslin and a thermometer. A soft cheese will be ready to eat in about three days; a cheddar-style hard cheese will need to mature for at least 30 days. Making your own sausages requires nothing more than a mincer with a nozzle attachment, casings, seasoning and of course your choice of meat, but there are many kits available online, that include spice mixes, casings, mincers and even the starter culture you&apos;ll need for fermented sausages like salami. Making biltong at home is easy and will make your kitchen smell delicious. Although it&apos;s possible to dry the meat in any well-ventilated space, a biltong maker will speed up the process, so your biltong will be ready in three to five days rather than seven to nine. Some biltong kits include the drying machine; others come with meat included to save you a trip to the butcher. Heston Blumenthal may have been quoted saying that molecular gastronomy is dead, but it&apos;s certainly alive and well in the home kitchen. Cream Supplies stocks a range of kits that allow you experiment with gels, foams, spherification and popping-sugar easter chocolates at home. Even Lakeland has got in on the act. These kits contain the various chemicals you&apos;ll need to work molecular magic at home, plus DVDs with instructions and serving suggestions (and some slightly odd translation - &quot;curry wind&quot; doesn&apos;t exactly whet the appetite). Sous-vide cooking doesn&apos;t seem to be going away any time soon, and if you&apos;ve got the cash and the counter space, you buy the kit online. If merely making your own isn&apos;t taking the concept far enough for you, how about growing your own? For \u00a312.50, a home mushroom growing kit promises three to five crops of mushrooms over two to three months, or if you&apos;re really setting out to impress your friends around the dinner table, why not grow your own truffles? If you&apos;re sick of Sun-Pat, you can grown your own peanuts and transform them into home-made peanut butter. Serve on toast with a cup of home-grown tea or coffee. So will DIY food kits actually save you money? Even if you discount the cost of time spent in the kitchen, most food don&apos;t come cheap. A &quot;connoisseurs&apos; jam-making kit&quot; will set you back the best part of \u00a3100, and although it contains everything you need bar the strawberries themselves, you can get a lot of Bonne Maman for that kind of money. Sushi-lovers with \u00a3250 can invest in the Tokyo Sushi Kit \u2013 it comes complete with everything from a rice cooker to a rolling mat. Firebox has a home chocolate-making kit that&apos;s a relative snip at \u00a314.99, although it only makes 210g. Macaroons seem to have well and truly taken over from cupcakes as the teatime treat du jour, and with a box of six from Ladur\u00e9e costing almost \u00a310, a DIY kit from Selfridges might represent a long-term saving at \u00a338, if you eat enough of them."}, {"sentences": ["[Didi was later released without charge after Tokyo&apos;s finest took a trainer imprint from the car and saw that it wasn&apos;t a match.]"], "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-16T10:05:35Z", "title": "Dietmar Hamann: 'I don't find jokes funny'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/16/dietmar-hamann-liverpool-small-talk", "article": "Hello Didi Hello Small Talk Well, let&apos;s cut to the chase. You&apos;ve written a book about how much you loved your time in Liverpool. Share the love \u2026 Well it&apos;s all about the people. They&apos;re unique. They&apos;re witty, genuine and love their football clubs. There have been some fantastic changes made in the city too since the capital of culture. So coming from Munich to Newcastle and then Liverpool wasn&apos;t a culture shock? The most important thing to me is that the people are warm and friendly. And it was like that in Newcastle and then at Liverpool and obviously it is people that you deal with so it is that that most matters to me, all day long. Most people would buy a guide book to get to know a city. You decided to drink in Blue pubs didn&apos;t you? Well sometimes you&apos;d get a bit of hassle when you&apos;d drink in Red pubs. Only people coming over and wanting to have a chat. I didn&apos;t mind but I like some quiet time now and then and people didn&apos;t bother me so much in the Everton pubs so if I wanted a quiet drink and a read I&apos;d just go in and relax a bit because I knew the fans from the other half of the city would be respectful. So you wouldn&apos;t get drawn into debates about Tony Hibbert then? Oh no, no, no. You&apos;ve got to respect Everton and Moysie&apos;s doing a great job. Like Jan Molby before you, you very quickly became an adopted scouser didn&apos;t you? Yeah, you just pick the accent up really quickly and learn how hard it is to get a taxi in the city. I remember once I couldn&apos;t get a taxi home so I decided to lie down in front of a car to make it stop. What? Like a human speed bump? It wasn&apos;t as dramatic as it sounds. I got up as soon as I heard it was getting close and offered the driver \u00a350 for a lift home. He asked me where I wanted to go but I couldn&apos;t remember my new address. That made the Liverpool players I was out with see me as someone other than the stereotypical serious and organised German, I think. It&apos;s a good job that car stopped or you may not have survived to be part of what happened in Istanbul. Most Liverpool fans credit the win to you being brought on for the second half. But having seen what Milan had done to Liverpool did you even fancy being a part of it at that stage? No. It&apos;s not the most pleasant thing to be brought on at 3-0 down but you know if you go on you&apos;ve got nothing to lose. If you get beat 5-0 you know the game was lost in the first half anyway. I&apos;d have rather come on at 0-0 or 1-0 down but that&apos;s how it was and after the way Milan played in the first half they deserved to be 3-0 up. All you can do is try your best, get a goal back and get a bit of fight in the team. But I don&apos;t think anybody expected the comeback after what they&apos;d seen in the first half. It was some comeback. And then it went to penalties and you took the first for Liverpool. Now, you seem like a laid-back person but even you must have been nervous? I was a bit tense more than nervous because the fact that Serginho missed the first one made it easier for me because if I missed it would still be 0-0, but I knew how important it was to score and get ahead for the first time on the night. So you just concentrate on what you know you have to do and hope the ball goes into the net. Back to the stereotypes, I imagine being German helps too \u2026 I&apos;ve missed a couple before, you know, so I&apos;m definitely not the best German penalty taker. Is it true \u2013 and Small Talk advises you to explain this question \u2013 that you celebrated Liverpool&apos;s Champions League win in a shower cubicle with the former Liverpool chairman David Moores? Yeah, that&apos;s right. He didn&apos;t want to give me a cigarette because I&apos;d left mine in the hotel but eventually he obliged but we needed to go somewhere a bit more private. So you were just stood opposite each other, inches apart, puffing away? Yeah, we were just stood in the shower shaking. He was shaking because his nerves were shot and I was shaking because I couldn&apos;t believe what had happened. It was a fantastic moment to share with him because he was such a loyal fan to the football club. It was a perfect ending to the perfect game. Small Talk imagines you don&apos;t remember much about the next couple of days \u2026 We went back to Liverpool [for the homecoming parade] and had a party in the Sir Thomas hotel. I got my first proper bit of sleep on Friday, I think. Did Rafa even let his hair down? I wouldn&apos;t know. I was with my friends and family but I imagine he afforded himself a couple of glasses of red. He&apos;s always a pretty controlled man so I wouldn&apos;t have thought he&apos;d have gone too crazy. One of the things Small Talk noticed about you on the football pitch was your ability to win free-kicks. Is that something you practised. Because you were bloody good at it \u2026 No, no, no, no, no. Obviously you&apos;ve got to take advantage if players come steaming in, especially when the opposition is chasing the game, and you&apos;ve got to go down and buy a free-kick and maybe run the clock down by half a minute or so and try to win the game. It&apos;s probably a bit more common in other countries than in England. Those cheating foreigners, eh Didi. Anyway, how into tactics was Rafa? Didn&apos;t he once show you how to beat Barcelona with salt and pepper shakers? Yeah, when I went to see him in his house where I lived near him on the Wirral after I left Liverpool. He&apos;s thinking about football all the time. It&apos;s always great to talk to him about the game. He&apos;s very knowledgeable and he gets things right a lot more times than he gets things wrong. I can&apos;t speak highly enough of him. He&apos;s so very intelligent. You&apos;ve played under some decent managers haven&apos;t you: Franz Beckenbauer, Otto Rehhagel, Kenny Dalglish, Giovanni Trapattoni, Rafa Ben\u00edtez, Sven-Goran Eriksson, G\u00e9rard Houllier, erm, Mark Hughes, erm Phil Thompson. Who was the best? It&apos;s hard to say because I was pretty successful with most of them. But probably Trapattoni because at a young stage in my professional career he helped me a great deal with countless hours on the training pitch. I mean, nothing was too much for him. And with G\u00e9rard Houllier, Sammy Lee, Thommo, Joe Corrigan. They were just a great team. And Rafa and Paco [Ayestar\u00e1n] won the Champions League. I think the team behind the team is often more important than the manager because if you don&apos;t have good people around you it makes it very hard. Trap doesn&apos;t half come out with some mad things now and then \u2026 Yeah, and it&apos;s always down to him not speaking the language very well. He would say some very powerful things if he could speak the language better, but nevertheless he was still an inspiration. I remember at Bayern when we&apos;d lost a home game and we were in training and he was trying to tell us that we can&apos;t just go into the stadium and tell the fans we are sorry for it. We have to show balls. But he was looking for the word for cojones in German and couldn&apos;t think of it. So one of our south American players told him the word for fanny instead, mushi in German. So he was telling us &quot;Yes, yes, we&apos;ve got to go out there and show the fans that we have a fanny.&quot; And he kept saying it over and over again. We were trying not to laugh because it was a serious situation. We&apos;d just lost a game two days before and he was angry. But eventually we burst out laughing and thankfully he joined in with us when he realised what he&apos;d been saying. You like a glass of wine now and then don&apos;t you Didi? Yeah, sure. Is it true you thought you&apos;d play better if you had a bottle or two in the week leading up to a match? Usually you weren&apos;t supposed to have a drink three days before a game so I&apos;d have three or four glasses sometimes on nights in the week leading up to Wednesday and then I wouldn&apos;t have a drink at all. I always saw it as part of my preparation. I didn&apos;t want to get to Thursday and then look back on the week and think: &apos;Oh, I wish I&apos;d had a glass of red!&apos; So if I wanted it I&apos;d have it. And I always did pretty well through my career doing things that way. And did you always smoke too? It was probably something I did more in the later stages of my career. I smoked earlier on too but probably not as much. So how many ciggies a day did you have when you were playing for Liverpool? About 10 a day, I think. You must be one of the only Germans to like cricket. How did you get into that? Through watching the Ashes and by playing in a few charity matches. Ian Rush and Jan Molby play every year so they often used to ask me to come along when they were one short. What&apos;s your highest score? Three. No, hang on. I played for the over-45s on the Wirral last year and I got about 12. Ah, so as a ringer against the old fellas you can compete but not against the young ones. Have you ever bowled anyone out? No. I&apos;ve never had a go at bowling. Have you been invited back? No. Never mind. You and Sven get on quite well don&apos;t you? He&apos;s a great man who involves everyone and just treats everyone like family. He creates a special atmosphere at his football clubs and I think that&apos;s why he&apos;s been in the game such a long time. I remember when I was at City we were out on a trip in Thailand and it&apos;d already been decided he wouldn&apos;t be at City much longer. He knew it, we knew it, everybody knew it. And I was out by the pool relaxing when he brought two glasses of champagne out. He handed me one and I asked him: &apos;What are we celebrating, boss?&apos; and he just turned to me and said: &quot;Life Kaiser, we&apos;re celebrating life.&quot; That was Sven for you. You must have met some characters through your career. Who was the craziest? Probably Dioufy [El Hadji Diouf]. He was just very flash, drove crazy cars and wore crazy clothes. Was he crazier than Jamie Carragher&apos;s dad? Philly deserves to get a mention yeah. He was a character all right. What are you listening to at the moment? Oh, I&apos;m not big into music. I probably don&apos;t know half of the people who are singing when I&apos;m listening to it. I reckon the last CD I bought was about 10 years ago. Favourite film? Point Break. Let&apos;s not bother discussing Keanu Reeves&apos;s acting ability. What would you put in Room 101? What? You&apos;ve been in Britain all this time and you don&apos;t know what Room 101 is? No. Small Talk begins a long, drawn out explanation of Room 101 \u2026 So anything Didi? Ooh. Er. That&apos;s a difficult one. Can we come back to that one? Erm, yeah. This might be easier. If you had to go out on a date wearing one of \u2013 and Small Talk is in no way stereotyping here \u2013 Jamie Carragher&apos;s tracksuits or lederhosen, what would it be? Oh lederhosen, definitely. I put them on every year when I go back to Munich for the beer festivals. I love them. Bratwurst or a pan of scouse? I wasn&apos;t so keen on scouse when I had it, so definitely Bratwurst. Cheese or chocolate? Cheese. Nice bit of stilton? No, emmental for me. Classy choice Didi. Who&apos;d win a fight between a lion and a tiger? Erm. I think the lion. The tiger would be a bit quicker but the lion would be a bit stronger. Is that how you looked at yourself in your career, not the quickest but ultimately successful? Yeah, I think most of it is about mentality and teamwork and everybody working for the team. I think most of the trophies I won in my career were down to team spirit and we&apos;d often be playing against better teams but we stuck together and it got us through. On the subject of your pace or lack of it, what&apos;s all this about you getting outrun by the Japanese police? Oh, I was injured after a bad tackle by Michael Essien and Liverpool were out at the World Club Championship in Japan. It was after the final [Liverpool had lost 1-0 to S\u00e3o Paulo] and I was with Jamie Carragher and some of his mates. I don&apos;t think all of them were his mates, though. As per usual for scousers anywhere in the world, none of them could get a taxi so they decided to run over the roof of the next one that came along to make it stop. The Japanese police don&apos;t mess around and were quickly over there. Everyone ran. I tried to. They&apos;d have probably caught me anyway, but with my knee being bad they were quickly on me and took me in.

A certain Liverpool player seems to be of the same opinion Didi \u2026 I just think shaking hands should be for after the match not before it. In rugby they&apos;ve got it right when the losing team applauds the winning team off the field. Yeah, I&apos;d get rid of pre-match handshakes. And before you go can you tell us a joke? I don&apos;t find jokes funny. Yeah, Small Talk knows what you mean \u2026 I get all these emails and texts and stuff but they very rarely even make me smile. I just delete them. Oh well.

This morning, the chancers who run European football travelled to Nyon to see how the final stages of the continent&apos;s top tournaments will pan out. Gathering in the Lennart Johansson Room at Uefa HQ \u2013 the only corporate function venue in Europe with walls built from bricks of compressed foie gras \u2013 soccer&apos;s top mandarins reclined into comfortable marshmallow-shaped seats and sat back waiting for the draws for the quarter-finals onwards of both Big Cup and The Andre Villas Boas Memorial Vase. They then started to wail and cry like a kindergarten full of toddlers who had just fallen off their trikes, upon realising that the chairs were not actually made of marshmallow, and they wouldn&apos;t be able to snack on anything until guest Paul Breitner had completed the draw, when the nice waiters and waitresses were due to come round with pints of bone-marrow gravy to tide them over until lunch. Ten whole minutes without sustenance! Luckily, Breitner is not a man to faff about, and he quickly paired Apoel with Real Madrid, Marseille with Bayern Munich, Benfica with Chelsea, and Milan with Barcelona. Then, to the increasingly loud sound of rumbling stomachs and grumbling delegates, he efficiently established that Chelsea will face Barcelona or Milan should they progress to the semis, before briskly evacuating the stage to make way for an emergency between-draw buffet. &quot;When you get down to the last eight teams, any draw is difficult,&quot; said EBJT puppet Roberto di Matteo, his voice barely audible as several fork-lift trucks trundled past, shipping in pallets of quail pizza, deep-fried venison quiche, and refreshing port jus lollipops. &quot;I&apos;ve seen Benfica many times. They were in Man Utd&apos;s group. It&apos;s a tough game for us. I think the fact that we play the first game away for us is good.&quot; As the delegates gathered round the groaning board like an oil slick, to devour their 11.30am repast, a Uefa suit popped up to pair AZ with Valencia, Schalke with Athletic, Sporting with Metalist, and Atletico with Hannover in the AVB Memorial Vase. But nobody was really listening. Not because Vase is considered an inconsequential bauble \u2013 far from it \u2013 but simply because it was lunch in 29 minutes, and everyone was beginning to jabber and salivate with excitement. Pork belly mousse, four-bird roast, and lamb sweetbread pannacotta with beef-dripping compote! Mmm! And that&apos;s just the amuse-bouche! QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;From the beginning of this season it has been a disaster. Maybe we were too confident at the beginning of [Big Cup]. Maybe we were thinking we have the name and we would go through easily, and we ended up going out in [Basel/Basle/Baaaarrrrll]. It&apos;s been a bad season for Manchester United in Europe and we can&apos;t disagree with that. We have to be honest with ourselves. We don&apos;t deserve to be in [Big Cup] or [Big Vase]. That&apos;s it&quot; \u2013 Patrice Evra, a man who knows a thing or two about not having the right attitude in big competitions, laments a Manchester United Big Cup campaign in which all they could say with any certainty, is that they were better than the sixth-best team in Romania. NON-LESSONS FROM THE PAST In the last 11 years, over a dozen new states have been created on Earth; an extra billion people have been brought into the world; and clones have been made of sheep, water buffalos and tea-timely football newsletters with a fondness for hard booze and easy gags. But at no point during that fecund era have Sunderland AFC managed to produce a victory over Everton. This is a pertinent fact ahead of the teams&apos; FA Cup quarter-final tomorrow at Goodison Park. At least you&apos;d think it was pertinent because it has been mentioned by every fuggin&apos; preview of the game that the Fiver has read. In reality, of course, the results of matches from yesteryear, which were contested by different players and different managers in different conditions, have about as much relevance to tomorrow&apos;s game as the fluorescent green leotard and matching leg-warmers of the former TV-am dynamo, Mad Lizzie. Whether Don Hutchinson was firing into the net for the Toffees or whacking opponents in the swizzles for the Candystripes makes no difference to what James McClean, Jack Rodwell and Tony Hibbert are going to do tomorrow, even if the last of that trio has probably played in all 159 previous meetings between the clubs (of which Everton have won 63, Sunderland 48 and 117 have been drawn and no, we haven&apos;t checked that and don&apos;t even know if the figures add up but suspect they don&apos;t because they were chosen entirely at random because THERE IS NO POINT IN DOING OTHERWISE). &quot;Everton&apos;s record against us is very, very good but it&apos;s not something that worries me unduly,&quot; declared Martin O&apos;Neill today, possibly before revealing that he has no plans to bring a spare pair of trousers to the game even though several men to whom he has no connection have ripped their strides in recent years. Coincidentally, tomorrow&apos;s match takes place in the same tournament as the clashes between Liverpool and Stoke, Chelsea and Leicester, and Spurs and Bolton - and all of those teams have also played against each in the past! The Fiver is not going to tell you what happened in the previous encounters and then attempt to extrapolate from those what will happen this week. This is a point of principle, you understand, not of sheer Friday-afternoon laziness. FIVER LETTERS &quot;I know Lord Ferg gets more stick than an errant public schoolboy, but hats off for him applauding Bilbao as the best team last night. Honest question: is there a more sporting manager in defeat out there? Imagine the Special One would have been yanking Marcelo Bielsa&apos;s sub-Mitt Romney side-parting rather hard at the final whistle, and then some&quot; - John Wright. &quot;At least the English clubs&apos; capitulation in Europe means we get more Ice Road Trucker repeats on Five&quot; \u2013 Brandon Green. &quot;It&apos;s Friday afternoon.

And if you&apos;ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS Kolo Toure is jumping up and down with excitement at the prospect of Carlos Tevez&apos;s return to the Man City first team. &quot;He&apos;s a fighter, he is a strong character and his quality is fantastic. For me, I can&apos;t wait,&quot; zinged Toure. &quot;Particularly because we won&apos;t have to talk about this story 852 times a day anymore,&quot; he didn&apos;t add. David Moyes has defended his decision to play his 84th team against Liverpool in the week. &quot;We have got a lot of players here and a good squad when they are fit,&quot; he trumpeted. &quot;We chose to use them and give a few of them a game.&quot; &apos;Arry Redknapp is unfazed by Spurs&apos;s recent dip in form. &quot;We have had a couple of results that haven&apos;t gone our way but the performances have been excellent,&quot; he said as Gareth Bale&apos;s leg fell off. &quot;If we were playing badly you would start to worry but we haven&apos;t,&quot; he added as Rafael van der Vaart fell down a well. &quot;We were just unfortunate,&quot; he finished off, as Luka Modric fell into a black hole. STILL WANT MORE? Sir Dave Richards has revealed himself to be a bit like Weird Uncle Fiver, but even more embarrassing, sobs Barney Ronay. &quot;What, no Chris Coleman?&quot; is not one of the responses to Scott Murray&apos;s Joy of Six: British and Irish managers who made their mark abroad. Actually, thinking about it, maybe it is. Fancy reading about a cricket-playing German who smokes cigarettes in Istanbul shower cubicles when he&apos;s not on the run from the Tokyo police or laughing at Giovanni Trapattoni shouting f@nny instead of b@lls? Well this Small Talk with Didi Hamann should satisfy you. Fancy reading about a Welshman who makes a heart shape when he scores a goal because he&apos;s good at football and isn&apos;t Craig Bellamy? Don&apos;t be like that. This Gareth Bale interview will have to do. And the &apos;Chelsea manager&apos; EBJT-Frank Lampard-Didier Drogba-Ashley Cole showed the positive side of player power in the 4-1 Big Cup win, whoops David Lacey.

Oh, there might have been some coverage on the east coast but basically, to Americans, the only world leaders who matter come from Russia or Israel. And maybe, today, China. In 1989 I went with the then president, George HW Bush, to Tokyo for the funeral of the Emperor of Japan. On the morning, we learned that the Senate had vetoed Bush&apos;s choice of defence secretary. The hundreds of American reporters stayed in the hotel basement to be briefed. Feeling that most politicians are a dime a dozen but that Japanese emperors get buried at roughly half-century intervals, I went on the almost empty bus to the funeral, where a few British and Australian hacks sat among the almost empty rows of press seats. And at the British embassy in Washington they still chuckle about the junior housing minister who came over from London and asked them to arrange his television appearances. \u2712We spent last weekend on an extended break in Nice. Our apartment, belonging to friends of friends, overlooked the Promenade des Anglais, which was good because we could see the ending of the Paris-Nice bicycle race, a warm-up for the Tour de France. Bradley Wiggins won, roughly when England were beating France at rugby in Paris. &quot;Le dimanche anglais,&quot; Nice Matin called it, quite happily. No nonsense about &quot;Les rosbifs, fichez le camp, vous bastards!&quot; The sun shone almost blindingly on the Baie des Anges. Cheerful people strolled up and down, past stands that showed how great artists had painted the scene in front of us; in Britain, they&apos;d have been covered in spray paint. We mastered the bus system and went vast distances for \u20ac1, up to the Chagall and Matisse museums, across to the lovely Villefranche-sur-Mer. Around the port there were innumerable restaurants, many with the menu in French, English and Russian since there is a long tradition, recently revived, of wealthy Russians coming here, as you can tell from the gigantic berthed yachts. Once again I was vaguely disappointed by the food. My tip would be to eat cheaply where the locals go; you might not get the amazing view, but you will get some good scoff. I loved the tartiflette, which is half of a molten Reblochon cheese on a bed of potatoes, cream, onions and pork lardons. Delicious, filling, utterly French. \u2712I was not altogether surprised to read that a couple in Brittany are planning to sue Ikea in France, claiming they put private investigators on to them after they complained about late delivery. In contrast to the generally benign air exuded by Sweden \u2013 safe cars, camp pop singers and excellent thrillers \u2013 there has always been something faintly sinister about Ikea. Take the names of their various product lines, such as Basisk, Bensky and Fisko \u2013 all these sound vaguely like code words for something we are not meant to know. There is, too, the way that if a crucial item is missing from your self-assembly kit, it takes months to recover it, as if selling houseware were a front for something else. And there is the cult-like air. On Saturday morning the queue of devotees near Wembley extends into the North Circular Road because the car park is full, half an hour before the store opens. We have bought Ikea furniture, although we stopped after noticing that wardrobes tended to sway in the breeze when the bedroom door closed. My theory is that the Swedes, who once governed a vast swath of northern Europe, are preparing to strike again. The first step is to put miniature listening devices into almost every British home. So check your Benji coffee table very carefully when you try to put it together without the Allen key. \u2712Thanks for the all labels and stupid signs that you have kindly sent in to me. I do apologise if you&apos;re wondering why your brilliantly funny one didn&apos;t appear; often it&apos;s because we&apos;ve already had something similar, such as flowers marked &quot;Do not consume&quot;, the &quot;Buy one, get one free&quot; shoe sales, packets of fish announcing &quot;Allergy warning: contains fish&quot; and Sainsbury&apos;s practice of putting &quot;Do not microwave&quot; on almost everything, including bottles of whisky. But I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve had the Tesco label sent in by Andrew Phillips. &quot;Pudding rice. Ideal for rice pudding.&quot; Or the Yeo Valley Farms tropical treats, &quot;a blend of mango, passion fruit and pineapple. Supporting British farms,&quot; found by Kenneth Davies. Joe Locker noticed that a tub of Flora brand edible lubricant was labelled as both &quot;original&quot; and &quot;new&quot;. And Giles Martin was delighted when his Danish mother-in-law sent her 11-year-old grandson a three-pack of underpants. They said, in English, &quot;Warning: contains small parts.&quot; Some announcements are just plain silly. Michael Walsh was notified by Transport for London that &quot;on Saturday and Sunday there is no service between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge in order to maintain a high-frequency service.&quot; We know what they mean, but they might have put it better. David Adams was in north London where he saw a florist&apos;s window with a big inflatable flower marked &quot;Happy Mother&apos;s Day.&quot; Immediately beneath was a notice saying &quot;No schoolchildren allowed inside.&quot; The abuse of language continues. Jeremy Beecham points out that officially rubber bullets first became &quot;baton rounds&quot; and are now &quot;attenuated energy projectiles&quot;. They will still put your eyes out. Mick O&apos;Connell&apos;s brother wrote a letter about his council tax, not to the &quot;borough treasurer&quot; or &quot;council offices&quot; but to &quot;The Directorate of Transformation&quot;. Weirdest of the lot was from an anonymous reader who also gets the Sunday Times. The flimsy plastic bag containing the magazines is marked &quot;This wrapper is totally recyclable. To recycle, send the wrapper to RR Flexo Ltd (Mailing Film Suppliers), Flexo House, Watton, IP25 6BG.&quot; I bet even George Monbiot doesn&apos;t put it in an envelope, address it, attach a stamp, and take it to the postbox."}, {"sentences": ["A\u00a0compendium of global, newsy nuggets with a furious aversion to celebrity, it wanders from Saudi arms deals to fashion shoots in Tokyo barber shops, all leavened with an obsessive fascination with aviation.", "Everyone has just returned from a fifth birthday party in Budapest (they have also celebrated with their subscribers in Tokyo, Seoul, Berlin and are on their way to New York)."], "tags": ["Magazines", "Design", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Art and design", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Culture", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-17T20:17:00Z", "title": "Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9: the man who sold the world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/17/tyler-brule-wallpaper-monocle-magazine", "article": "&quot;So what&apos;s the secret?&quot; I ask Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, the exquisitely groomed editor of Monocle. As the sun glances through the windows of his Marylebone office, the man who has made a success of a\u00a0magazine, of a printed product at a\u00a0time of media crisis, begins to talk. He starts to ramble, so I interrupt, saying that I&apos;m disappointed, that I was expecting something pithy. Br\u00fbl\u00e9, who at 43 has real physical presence, a\u00a0gift from his American-football-playing father, looks aghast and for a moment his raw competitiveness shows. He struggles for the right line: &quot;People need to attend to details,&quot; he says at last. &quot;I believe in a\u00a0tidy ship. No jackets on the backs of chairs.&quot; I like Br\u00fbl\u00e9. You&apos;d have to be po-faced (or, the sceptics say, know him well) not to. He&apos;s an original. Nearly 20 years ago, an editor I know told me that in him she&apos;d found her perfect glossy-magazine foreign correspondent: &quot;He&apos;s not scared of war, and he knows a good pair of trousers.&quot; The Br\u00fbl\u00e9 myth began shortly afterwards when he was twice shot while in Afghanistan. He had a\u00a0conversion on a hospital bed, less Damascene and more Mayfairean. He thought about what really mattered to him \u2013 and it was friends, a\u00a0nice house and travelling. Since then he has turned this vision \u2013 himself \u2013 into two successful businesses. He went on to found Wallpaper* and, subsequently, Monocle. His assistant walks in and asks whether I\u00a0would like &quot;some baumkuchen from Germany?&quot; Br\u00fbl\u00e9 breaks in: &quot;Actually it&apos;s from Japan. It&apos;s one of those things that you&apos;d now be hard pressed to find in Germany, but the Japanese have gone nuts for it.&quot; Of course, Br\u00fbl\u00e9 knows I\u00a0will write about this. Self-awareness is what he does. Art directing his life, his style is his business model. The baumkuchen is delicious, like an aspirational Swiss roll. Wallpaper*, with its tagline &quot;The stuff that surrounds you&quot;, was the epitome of urban dreaming. The magazine baumkuchened up the idea of Homes &amp; Gardens, and in 1997, a year after he founded it, Time Inc bought it for a\u00a0reported $1.63m. For several years, Br\u00fbl\u00e9 lived the corporate life, but it didn&apos;t suit him and he says now: &quot;We&apos;ve seen the creep of the consultant on to the editorial floor \u2013 and that brought on a certain crisis of confidence.&quot; When, inevitably, he fell out with the Americans, a noncompete clause saw him branch out into consultancy with Winkreative, where he has brought his taste to bear on everything from Swissair to the country of Taiwan. But as soon as the legal restrictions fell away, Br\u00fbl\u00e9 went back into magazines, founding Monocle. A\u00a0compendium of global, newsy nuggets with a furious aversion to celebrity, it wanders from Saudi arms deals to fashion shoots in Tokyo barber shops, all leavened with an obsessive fascination with aviation. It is about the infrastructure of living internationally. It earnestly, if wittily, wants us to enjoy our planes, our hotels, our metro transportation systems. But it&apos;s never going to advise you to kick off all your clothes and jump into the nearest stream. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 says he&apos;s selling more than 70,000 copies of Monocle at \u00a36 each. According to ABC, who audit these things, 11,000 sell at newsstands and 2,000 by subscription in the UK, while the rest go abroad. Last year he founded a 24-hour digital radio station which seems to want to be a\u00a0baumkuchened-up Radio 4 and although it has not yet achieved anything like the depth, you can hear the aspiration. Add a\u00a0biannual newspaper and a\u00a0global chain of shops selling the accessories for a Monocle-based life, and you get a picture of the Br\u00fbl\u00e9 empire. It&apos;s all based on a philosophy that runs counter to prevailing thought in the media. &quot;It didn&apos;t make sense to us to give away our journalism for free. But we did have to think: &apos;How do we add value online?&apos; We started with video then it became radio, but it couldn&apos;t replicate what we were doing in print.&quot; Br\u00fbl\u00e9 leads me down to the morning conference. Everyone has just returned from a fifth birthday party in Budapest (they have also celebrated with their subscribers in Tokyo, Seoul, Berlin and are on their way to New York). In the meeting, they spend much of their time discussing the various airlines they&apos;ve used. There is an echo of a\u00a0male fascination with giving directions \u2013 Monocle meetings seem to play on this geeky joy. Back in his office, I ask Br\u00fbl\u00e9 who would be his perfect reader. He pulls out his mobile. &quot;This email just came in. &apos;I am a\u00a021-year-old studying economics and government in Australia. I have not achieved the means to live by the majority of the magazine&apos;s ideas, I&apos;m simply writing to thank you for the wealth of, for lack of a better word, awesomeness of the magazine.&apos; Now would I go to an advertising meeting and talk about that being the core reader, maybe not, but then I\u00a0would as well because here is someone who is going to be with us for a long time, who is part of a different media generation.&quot; Br\u00fbl\u00e9 is half Estonian, but was raised in Canada. &quot;I grew up in a variety of cities from Ottawa to Montreal to Toronto, in an era before the invasion of US channels across the border. From an early age I was dazzled by the big nightly newscasts and I always wanted to stay up late and see these men and women broadcast from around the world. In parallel, I grew up in a\u00a0magazine household, whether it was Forbes or my mother&apos;s decorating magazines. And when I\u00a0visited my Estonian relatives \u2013 people who had fled Germany \u2013 there were always copies of Stern and Spiegel. Also there was a\u00a0certain gruesomeness in the German reportage. It was all incredibly exciting to me.&quot; Into this is incorporated the painfully modern aesthetic that infuriates so many. Those programmes on his radio station and the section titles in his magazine reflect the man. He is an urbanist, he is absolutely a globalist, and he likes to speak from the perspective of seat 1A of the intercontinental jetliner. From there Br\u00fbl\u00e9 finds himself first despairing of innovation in his adopted country. &quot;There is so much international talent in London \u2013 architects, graphic design \u2013 but it&apos;s all despite itself, not because the government and private sector get together to celebrate it. It happens because of the natural forces, that we&apos;re English language, that we&apos;re in the EU. You can&apos;t just rock up in New York as an Austrian and get a job in graphic design, but you can here.&quot; So would he move the his business out? &quot;We&apos;ve had this discussion. The question is where. That&apos;s the curse of it all. The government thinking: &apos;Where would these media companies go?&apos; I\u00a0mean, we&apos;re not going to go to France.&quot; What about Scandinavia? After all, Monocle is forever claiming Copenhagen or Helsinki is the best place in the world to live. Br\u00fbl\u00e9 looks aghast, revealing the conflict between aesthete and businessman. &quot;The Scandis are a\u00a0bit too socialist.&quot; He swings his hand around the office. &quot;Everything in this room is from Scandinavia, but the maternity leave would kill us.&quot; So Copenhagen may be the best place to live in Br\u00fbl\u00e9&apos;s world, but it is no place to run a business. We&apos;re winding down. Don&apos;t you get bored of flying, I ask. &quot;I&apos;m moving to grand tours rather than there and backs.&quot; Your partner must hate it. &quot;He travels with me a lot.&quot; Any plans for children? A strangled laugh. &quot;Not yet.&quot; (Pity, his rigorous aesthetic would be a hoot on Mumsnet.) Br\u00fbl\u00e9 gives me a tour of the studios, separate floors dedicated to magazine, radio and consultancy. It is like a cool architectural practice run by a cult. He has told me: &quot;Everyone needs to be on the same page \u2013 I&apos;m not a huge fan of creative conflict.&quot; It&apos;s supposed to be cuddly, but comes across as slightly scary. Nonetheless, it makes sense because a good answer to my original question is that a publication&apos;s success usually rests on readers buying into a\u00a0singular vision. That&apos;s certainly true in Br\u00fbl\u00e9&apos;s case, and the view is absolutely from behind those thick-framed glasses. As he walks me into the crisp sunshine, I\u00a0can&apos;t stop myself messing with the show he&apos;s put on. &quot;Tyler, there was someone in there with their jacket on the back of their seat.&quot; He looks momentarily crestfallen and mutters something about people on work experience. The next day I tell this story to one of his staff. &quot;Oh that&apos;s why that guy was fired,&quot; he jokes. At least I hope he was joking."}, {"sentences": ["Kamurocho, the fictional Tokyo district that has starred in every game in the series so far, is now in the grip of a zombie invasion, which means ditching the franchise&apos;s stock in trade hand-to-hand combat for clunky third-person shooting."], "tags": ["Shoot 'em ups", "Role playing games", "Games", "Technology", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-18T00:05:11Z", "title": "Yakuza: Dead Souls \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/18/yakuza-dead-souls-review", "article": "Toshihiro Nagoshi&apos;s Yakuza series is huge in Japan, but has only a cult following in the west.

The comedy carpet recently won a Civic Trust award for Blackpool and is shortlisted for the Design Museum&apos;s design of the year. Despite granting planning permission and allowing it to open last October, Blackpool Council now feels the granite and concrete carpet is too close to tram tracks on Blackpool&apos;s historic promenade. Andy Altmann, a designer who collaborated with Young on the project, is furious with council officials. He and Young are about to travel to Japan to collect the prestigious Tokyo Grand Prix design award, beating off competition from over 3,200 projects from across the globe. &quot;The comedy carpet is world class piece of public art,&quot; Altmann added. &quot;The council has treated us and it shamefully. Their actions have made me feel physically sick. I still can&apos;t quite believe what they have done.&quot; Ken Dodd said he was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; to hear of the damage to the comedy carpet and hoped that the artwork would be reinstated to its original design. He joked that &quot;the holidaymakers in Blackpool may give whoever was responsible a black eye&quot;. According to a spokesman for Blackpool Council, officials were quoted a figure of \u00a350,000 for removal of the flags and placement elsewhere by the Comedy Carpet Company, which proved to be too expensive. However, an email sent to the council by the firm last July \u2013 and seen by the Guardian \u2013 puts the cost between \u00a33,000 and \u00a33,600. Alan Cavill, assistant chief executive at Blackpool Council, said: &quot;The comedy carpet is a great success for Blackpool and continues to attract many visitors to marvel at the work. After observing how visitors interact with the carpet, many are seen to look down while reading the phrases and frequently step back to look at the comments. &quot;Regretfully if a visitor to the carpet was to step back off the very end of the carpet into the line of an oncoming tram then this could potentially be very dangerous. &quot;We are looking forward to discussions with the artist as to how the missing credits can be replaced in a safer way.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;This means that not only do the boys look after each other, but it&apos;s possible to let 65 boys out on their own in Tokyo and you can be sure that all of them will turn up punctually to rehearsals,&quot; said Christian Wolff, the pastor of St Thomas Church."], "tags": ["JS Bach", "Music", "Germany", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-21T19:32:29Z", "title": "World's oldest choir celebrates 800 years of singing in harmony", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/21/oldest-choir-800-year-anniversary", "article": "It has survived the Thirty Years War, the plague, and both the Nazi and Communist regimes. This month one of the world&apos;s oldest choirs \u2013 Johann Sebastian Bach was its choirmaster in the 18th century \u2013 marks its 800th anniversary with an array of celebrations. The Thomanerchor is being feted across Germany, particularly in its native Leipzig: exhibitions, religious ceremonies and film documentaries will focus on the remarkable history and achievements of an institution that is arguably the country&apos;s greatest living cultural export. The choir, which has around 90 schoolboy members, is also being hailed for its founding egalitarian and educational principles, which endure to this day. Bach joined the choir when it had been running 475 years; for 27 years, he was its cantor, or choirmaster, with the task of composing a new cantata for the boys every week, an act that indelibly bound the choir and composer and gave the Thomanerchor its abiding nickname, &quot;the Bach choir&quot;. Its trademark sound, bright and clear, is said to stem from its years under Bach&apos;s strict but creative leadership. The relationship with the composer remains an emotional one. When they sing in the St Thomas church, metres from the grave in which Bach is buried, the choristers describe feeling close to the composer, even more than 250 years after his death. &quot;If the choir is singing well together you can certainly feel the presence of Bach,&quot; said Konrad Didt, 19, who is in his final year with the choir. The familial atmosphere is said to have much to do with a system that is as old as the choir itself. Nine or ten Thomaner \u2013 all of different ages, from nine to 19 \u2013 live together in Stuben, or parlours, which change personnel every year. As a result, older boys look after the younger ones: helping them with their homework, feelings of homesickness or learning a Bach cantata. &quot;This means that not only do the boys look after each other, but it&apos;s possible to let 65 boys out on their own in Tokyo and you can be sure that all of them will turn up punctually to rehearsals,&quot; said Christian Wolff, the pastor of St Thomas Church. In recent years, in line with other subtle modernisations, the Stuben system has been adjusted to allow the boys more private space. Many of this year&apos;s celebrations, including a film documentary, will focus on the choir&apos;s astonishing longevity \u2013 how it has managed to survive not just the Thirty Years War and the plague \u2013 which almost destroyed it \u2013 but also the second world war, when it was moved to a safe destination outside Leipzig after the school was destroyed in a bombing raid. The boys were driven into the bombed-out city in a lorry to sing their Sunday concerts every week. &quot;People used to flood the church, because the choir gave them great solace at that time,&quot; said Stefan Altner, the choir&apos;s general manager. The choristers were forced to join the Hitler Youth movement during the Nazi era, but managed to remain relatively isolated from the prevailing politics. After 1945 the choir found itself locked in communist East Germany. While most of the boys were forcibly recruited to the communist youth movement, attempts by the atheist regime to change the religious repertoire were dropped when it was realised the Thomanerchor was the country&apos;s most esteemed cultural export and should be preserved. &quot;You could say that Bach is our patron saint in this regard,&quot; said Altner. The choir&apos;s leadership also resisted attempts to switch the foreign language that the boys learned from Latin to Russian, arguing that Latin was vital for the choir&apos;s ability to perform church music. Experts say its place as something of an island in both Nazi and Communist times helped it preserve its agile and virtuoso sound, which has ensured its international standing. However, surviving dictatorships is one thing. Now the choir faces its biggest challenge ever as it struggles to recruit new members. Fewer young Germans are exposed to classical music in the age of the mp3 player. The choir has been sending talent scouts into kindergartens to expose young Germans to the music of Bach in the hope of being able to spot potential choristers. It also has plans to open its own kindergarten as a way of preserving its future. Singing for their supper St Thomas, part of a monastery, was founded in the 13th century as a school for the poor, which accepted musically gifted students from all over Germany. Those who passed an entrance exam were given free tuition, room and board in return for singing. It came into its own in the 16th century when Germany became a country of choirs after the Reformation as communal singing started to define public and private life with every workplace and village boasting its own choir. The Thomanerchor took centre stage and maintains to this day a position as one of the leading choirs in the world. A long-standing tradition encourages its all-male lineup to tutor each other in everything from table manners to how to master a Bach cantata."}, {"sentences": ["Next Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome in Japan the Oakland Athletics will officially launch the 2012 Major League Baseball season, and at the same time mark the 10th anniversary of the moment a journalist called Michael Lewis turned up at the club to research what was supposed to be a newspaper article about their general manager."], "tags": ["MLB", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T12:53:37Z", "title": "Billy Beane leaves Moneyball behind to refocus on statistical truths", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/22/billy-beane-moneyball", "article": "Next Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome in Japan the Oakland Athletics will officially launch the 2012 Major League Baseball season, and at the same time mark the 10th anniversary of the moment a journalist called Michael Lewis turned up at the club to research what was supposed to be a newspaper article about their general manager. Lewis found the subject unexpectedly interesting, and the article became a book, which became a phenomenon: Moneyball sold a million copies and spawned a film, in which Brad Pitt&apos;s portrayal of the central character earned him an Oscar nomination. With the film now released on DVD and his publicity duties completed, Billy Beane can finally step out of the Moneyball machine. &quot;What with the book and then the movie, it&apos;s been in the public eye for a decade,&quot; Beane says. &quot;It&apos;s been a great experience, I wouldn&apos;t trade it for the world, but it&apos;s kind of relaxing now everything is starting to calm down. I love my job, and maybe some anonymity will help me really focus on it.&quot; The team could probably do with some attention. The A&apos;s have qualified for the post-season play-offs, the commonly-accepted definition of basic baseball success, only once since the book&apos;s release in 2003. That year had marked a fourth successive appearance, a minor miracle given their budget, but over the past decade his once-revolutionary techniques have become commonplace. Beane&apos;s success was achieved by taking the drastic step of disregarding traditional scouting methods in favour of detailed analysis of statistics. This enabled him to identify the most productive players irrespective of the all-round athleticism and merchandise-shifting good looks that clubs had previously coveted. &quot;We had nothing to lose,&quot; he says. &quot;We were in a position where we could try anything and no matter what happened we were probably not going to end up any worse.&quot; His disillusionment with old-fashioned scouting was fuelled in part because he himself was the perfect example of its failure. As a 6ft 4in 18-year-old he was one of America&apos;s most sought-after prospects when the New York Mets won the battle for his signature in 1980. But the predicted success never came; in 1988 he was on to his fourth club, moving to Oakland as a free-agent outfielder. &quot;There were a lot of guys who maybe weren&apos;t the natural athlete I was, but they were much better baseball players,&quot; he has said. &quot;They were measuring the wrong things.&quot; Two years later, having hit three home runs in six Major League seasons and boasting the horribly ho-hum batting average of .219 \u2013 which in the 2011 season would have made him the 145th most productive batter in MLB \u2013 he gave up and became an opposition scout. Success off the field proved considerably more achievable: within three years he was assistant GM, and he took over the top job in 1997. Fourteen years after his appointment Beane continues to make good use of the players others leave behind. This close season, for example, the A&apos;s brought in Manny Ramirez, a 12-time All-Star and one of the game&apos;s biggest names, who was without a club after twice testing positive for banned substances. &quot;He&apos;s arguably a hall of fame player, and we basically signed him because there was no risk and a lot of reward,&quot; Beane says. &quot;He cost us the minimum salary and he&apos;s still a productive player. We could do quite well out of it, and if we don&apos;t it cost us nothing.&quot; The Cuban defector Yoenis Cespedes was a less typical signing. &quot;He&apos;s the best player from the Cuban amateur team, and we signed him to a four-year $36m contract with frankly a very limited amount of information. He was a higher risk,&quot; Beane says. &quot;Our ability to track that kind of player is limited, but a lot of teams had spent their budget by the time he became available, and a centre-of-the-diamond athletic player at the prime of his career is worth the risk.&quot; Beane&apos;s revolution at the A&apos;s was assisted by Paul DePodesta, a tall, thin Harvard-educated number-cruncher (who refused to lend his name to the film, and thus appears as Peter Brand, a short, overweight Yale-educated number-cruncher) who is now vice-president of player development and amateur scouting at the New York Mets. &quot;The process of discovering sabermetrics was longer than in the movie, but there were certainly eureka moments along the way and one of those was when I brought in my former assistant,&quot; Beane says. &quot;I&apos;d started my own investigations, but when Paul came in that was the spark, and it created a very unique partnership. It was like Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, a very similar relationship.&quot; Beane sprinkles conversations \u2013 at least those with Englishmen \u2013 with references to football, a sport with which he has become mildly obsessed. He says the challenge of attracting players to the Coliseum, the A&apos;s dilapidated stadium \u2013 they are due to finalise a move to a new venue in San Jose imminently \u2013 is &quot;like convincing someone to play for Blackpool instead of Arsenal; they&apos;ve got two very different stadiums, and players love to play at a great stadium&quot;. I later hear him tell TalkSport that his club are &quot;sort of like Wigan&quot;. Happily, Beane&apos;s love of English football is reciprocated. He has strong links with Liverpool, whose co-owner John W Henry once attempted to hire him for the Boston Red Sox. Their director of football, Damien Comolli, has wholeheartedly embraced Beane&apos;s methods and described reading Moneyball as the moment &quot;when everything fell into place&quot;. Chelsea&apos;s director of football operations, Mike Ford, is another key ally. &quot;I&apos;m always somewhat sheepish talking to football people, people who have followed the game since they were children,&quot; he says, &quot;because I never played one minute of soccer in my life, not one minute. I appreciate the athleticism and skill but as a fan I can&apos;t relate, having never scored a goal in my life.&quot; Beane watches several matches a week, subscribes to European football magazines and listens to podcasts \u2013 including the Guardian&apos;s own Football Weekly \u2013 in the car. &quot;I watch as much as I can,&quot; he says. &quot;We probably get more matches over here than you have over there. It depends on my schedule, but if there&apos;s a big game and I can&apos;t watch it live I&apos;ll just record it. It&apos;s a great release if nothing else.&quot; The inevitable question is whom Beane, so famous for identifying hidden gems, would identify as the most undervalued player in football. &quot;You&apos;re asking me to quantify performance and I&apos;m not necessarily privy to some of the metrics,&quot; he deadpans. &quot;You know, I&apos;d actually say Lionel Messi. He&apos;s so remarkable, watching him play he&apos;s probably still undervalued. When you&apos;re scoring five goals in one Champions League match, there&apos;s no value that&apos;s too high.&quot; Baseball, composed essentially of a succession of set pieces, seems more likely to submit to statistical analysis than more free-flowing sports such as football, but that isn&apos;t stopping anybody from trying. &quot;There&apos;s key metrics for every sport,&quot; Beane says. &quot;The challenge is finding which numbers actually matter. To say that in football there&apos;s not key numbers that mean something, I think that would just be foolish.&quot; Though managers have been guided by statistics at least since Charles Reep&apos;s theories provoked a more direct brand of football in the 1950s, there remain those who make decisions based on little more than habits and hunches. &quot;I always thought that because of the emotion of football a lot of visceral decisions were made,&quot; Beane says. To avoid succumbing to similar failings, he famously refuses to watch any of the A&apos;s competitive matches live. &quot;We try not to make emotional decisions here,&quot; he says. &quot;I prefer to know the result and then make decisions with a more rational mind.&quot; His approach is perhaps not one for romantics but Beane has little time for those who would prefer top-level sport to remain a game of guesswork. &quot;The ends justify the means,&quot; he says. &quot;However you get there, the only thing that matters in sport is that you get there.&quot; Moneyball is out now on Blu-ray and DVD, courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"}, {"sentences": ["When China eclipsed Japan as the world&apos;s second biggest economy in 2010, there was less gnashing of teeth in Tokyo than some had expected.", "Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China&apos;s military spending."], "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T15:44:17Z", "title": "Japan casts wary eye across East China Sea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/22/japan-wary-east-china-sea", "article": "When China eclipsed Japan as the world&apos;s second biggest economy in 2010, there was less gnashing of teeth in Tokyo than some had expected. Given China&apos;s size and dizzying growth over the last two decades, Japanese business leaders accepted long ago that a shift in the economic rankings was inevitable. Japan is more concerned about China&apos;s military growth: how it will affect long-running bilateral disputes over territory and access to energy sources, and where it will leave the regional balance of power in an era of post-US hegemony. The potential for bilateral discord was evident in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkaku islands, an uninhabited archipelago in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by China. The trawler&apos;s captain was released after a short detention, but the incident, and several less volatile encounters since, have reminded Japan that, strong economic ties aside, the potential remains for lasting friction with an increasingly formidable rival. There is much at stake for both countries. The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits. Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China&apos;s military spending. In response, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar alliance with the US and is building closer military ties to other countries in the region, including Australia, the Philippines and South Korea. Japan has also sought to strengthen its claims to disputed territories by stealth. Its recent decision to give Japanese names to dozens of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, including the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu \u2013 drew an angry response from Beijing. &quot;No matter what names Japan has given to the islands affiliated to Diaoyu island, it will not change the fact that these islands belong to China,&quot; China&apos;s foreign ministry said in a statement. Although Japan senses a more immediate threat from North Korea&apos;s nuclear missile programme, China will remain a cause for concern as long as its military spending, and the increasingly combative behaviour of its navy, continues. That was clear this month when the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, called on China to improve transparency over spending after it announced a double-digit increase in its defence budget for the second year in a row. &quot;There are some parts in the breakdown of China&apos;s defence budget that are unclear, and it&apos;s desirable to boost the transparency in the defence budget and China&apos;s [overall] defence policies,&quot; he said. China&apos;s defence spending surpassed Japan&apos;s in 2007, making it the second largest spender after the US. To demonstrate the strength of the regional alliance now forming in response to China, Japanese self-defence forces will participate for the first time in joint annual military exercises with the US and the Philippines within the next few weeks. In addition, the coast guard is to be given new powers allowing it to investigate illegal landings on disputed islands, eject suspicious vessels without inspecting them and make arrests. And the proposed relocation of 8,000 US troops from Okinawa will only happen provided Washington is assured of the southern Japanese island&apos;s role as a forward-deployment base for its core contingent of marines. In a recent report, Japan&apos;s national institute for defence studies warned that China&apos;s naval build-up presented a challenge to the country&apos;s security (pdf). China&apos;s aim, the report said, was to project enough power to deter other countries, including Japan, from independently developing energy resources and put itself on an equal maritime footing with the US. &quot;China&apos;s increasing assertiveness has had a negative impact on the maritime security environment in the Asia-Pacific,&quot; the institute said. &quot;To date, peace and stability in the ocean have been maintained through co-operation between the United States, the only country that can deploy naval forces globally, and many countries that share interests. &quot;China&apos;s recent behaviour, as demonstrated by its advance into the surrounding waters\u00a0\u2026 is irreconcilable with the existing order in many ways.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It is taken from a concert with the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester in Tokyo in 2003, but has only now been released for the first time."], "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T22:32:01Z", "title": "Schoenberg: Pelleas und Melisande; Wagner: Prelude to Tristan und Isolde \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/22/boulez-schoenberg-pelleas-melisande-review", "article": "Pierre Boulez has recorded Schoenberg&apos;s symphonic poem before, 20 years ago with the Chicago Symphony for Erato.

The Perfect Rower \u2013 100 years of racing for glory, charts Britain&apos;s success in what is one of the founding sports of the Olympics and, aptly, is being held at the River &amp; Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, the area recognised as being the birthplace of competitive\u00a0rowing. Visitors to the exhibition, which runs from 31 March to 30 September, will be able to see artefacts from the two previous London Olympics, in 1908 and 1948, and the impact rowing made at each Games. In 1908, Britain secured four medals in the boat, while four decades later came the remarkable tale of Dickie Burnell and Bert Bushnell, men of contrasting build and social background who were thrown together six weeks before the &apos;austerity&apos; Games and went on to win gold in the double sculls. &quot;They were chalk and cheese; Burnell, a large man who went to Eton, Bushnell, a lightweight who had a chip on his shoulder about university education, but they made an incredible team because neither bore grudges,&quot; said the rowing historian Christopher Dodd, who has worked on the exhibition. &quot;Another great story from 1948 is that of Ran Laurie, the father of the actor Hugh, who won gold in the coxless pair with Jack Wilson. The pair rowed for Cambridge in the 1930s but arrived at the Games having worked for the colonial service in Sudan during the war.&quot; The exhibition also shows how the diets of rowers has evolved over the past century. &quot;There have been some strange fads over the years,&quot; said Dodd. &quot;At one time rowers used\u00a0to eat a raw egg dipped in sherry before they raced, not realising that doing so was likely to make them sick once they were on the water.&quot; Yoshida&apos;s winning yell Out-and-out confidence among athletes is a rare thing so the Japan&apos;s Saori Yoshida should perhaps be praised for giving such a frank assessment of her chances at London 2012. &quot;If I wrestle the way I can, I won&apos;t lose,&quot; said Yoshida during a recent training camp in Tokyo, and it is hard to argue with the 29-year-old given she won gold in the women&apos;s 55kg division at the 2004 and 2008 Games and has a remarkable nine successive world titles to her name.

Tears for souvenirs. Four years later in Mexico City, an anthem was embedded imperishably in sporting and political legend when the American 200m medallists Tommie Smith and John Carlos listened to the Star Spangled Banner with bowed heads and raised gloved fists in pointed Black Power salute. (The Daily Mail, by the way, next day described that as &quot;Olympic sacrilege and disgrace&quot;.) Eight years later, for the Moscow Games, Mrs Thatcher banned the British team from flying its flag or playing the national anthem \u2013 something about someone invading poor little Afghanistan? By happy fluke, Britain&apos;s first gold medal was the swimmer Duncan Goodhew&apos;s. Typically, one-off Duncan had premeditated victory and, elated, clambered out of the pool \u2013 at once, gloriously, to wrap himself into a homemade red-white-and-blue Union Jack dressing-gown. Who needed flags or anthems then? Nor, to be sure, a few days later at the athletics stadium when tough-of-the-track Steve Ovett beat hot favourite Seb Coe in the 800m final. On the podium, no flag to salute, but national drama enough when Seb, blank-eyed and shattered, leaned up to accept reluctantly a handshake from winner Steve \u2013 and the following Sunday, Clive James in the Observer gorgeously described the look on Coe&apos;s face &quot;as if he&apos;d just been handed a turd&quot;. Nice Mr Lancaster&apos;s &quot;new&quot; fresh-faced England rugby union team of the last couple of months seemed more collectively and determinedly choral at anthem time than any recent predecessors, literally all singing from the same hymn sheet. Their roof-raising coincided with the former England hooker Brian Moore admitting on Radio 4 the other day his fond memory, for all his vauntedly proud republicanism, of singing the pre-match anthem at Twickenham with &quot;a frisson of passion and thrill down his spine every time&quot; \u2013 and equal, apparently, to his first hearing the Queen of the Night aria from the Magic Flute. Balladeer Tom Jones watched a few of Wales&apos;s matches this year and each time I was touchingly reminded of that mighty fine little one-time Neath fly-half of the 1980s, Dai Parker, who unluckily missed out on a deserved Welsh cap because, in his prime, the No10 factory was still on full production. Dai was enchanted, however, late in his career, before Neath played a club game in Dublin, when he heard the announcer order both teams to line up for the national anthems. Hooray, Dai whooped to himself, at last he would experience the legendary orgasmic sensation: &quot;I stood proudly to attention in front of the band, the tears welled, and I could feel the hairs stiffen at the nape of my neck as they began to blow&quot; when, oh dear, out of the loudspeakers blared ruddy Tom Jones&apos;s ruddy Green, Green Grass of Home."}, {"sentences": ["Reports said the three men were hanged at prisons in Tokyo, Hiroshima and Fukuoka."], "tags": ["Japan", "Capital punishment", "Human rights", "Amnesty International", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-29T04:22:00Z", "title": "Japan hangs three prisoners after 18-month stay of executions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/29/japan-hangs-three-prisoners-executions", "article": "Japan has carried out its first executions in more than 18 months, hanging three death row inmates on Thursday and angering campaigners who believed the country was moving towards abolition of the death penalty. Reports said the three men were hanged at prisons in Tokyo, Hiroshima and Fukuoka. They included Yasuaki Uwabe, who was convicted of killing five people at a train station in 1999. The executions are the first since July 2010; none of the 132 people on death row was executed in 2011, the first time a year had passed without executions for 19 years. Their executions came as a blow to campaigners, who only this week welcomed Japan&apos;s apparent de facto moratorium on capital punishment. Hideki Wakabayashi, executive director of Amnesty International Japan, accused the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) government of reneging on an earlier promise to look seriously at its use of the death penalty. &quot;We still need to have a national debate,&quot; Wakabayashi told the Guardian. &quot;But while we are doing that there has to be a moratorium on executions. The DPJ is supposed to support human rights. The executions also run against the international movement against he death penalty. I don&apos;t know where Japan thinks it is going with this.&quot; There is speculation that the justice minister, Toshio Ogawa, has come under pressure from senior DPJ colleagues, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to sign off on executions while the party attempts to sell a controversial consumption tax rise to the public, which remains overwhelmingly in favour of the death penalty. &quot;Public support for Noda&apos;s cabinet is declining, so my personal feeling is that this was one of many steps aimed at boosting its approval ratings,&quot; Wakabayashi said. Earlier this week Amnesty International had singled out Japan for praise over the absence of executions in 2011, despite evidence that successive justice ministers had come under intense pressure to sign death warrants. In the announcement, Amnesty&apos;s Catherine Baber did note that &quot;executions could resume at any time&quot;. &quot;We continue to be concerned for the roughly 130 people on death row, including several prisoners with mental illnesses, and we call on the minister of justice not to resume executions but rather to work towards abolition.&quot; In September 2010 the then justice minister, Keiko Chiba, ordered a review of the death penalty. Her four immediate successors refused to approve executions, but Ogawa, who was appointed to the post in January, said the review had reached an impasse. &quot;I don&apos;t really want to do it, but it is part of the justice minister&apos;s job description,&quot; he told journalists. &quot;With 130 inmates on death row and public opinion 85% in favour of the death sentence, it would be inexcusable of me not to sign off on executions.&quot; In a damning 2009 report, Amnesty accused the Japanese authorities of subjecting death row inmates to &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment&quot;. Campaigners have also voiced concern over the safety of several convictions, including that of Masaru Okunishi, who has spent four decades on death row for poisoning five women in 1961.  Prisoners are not told when they will be executed until a few hours before they are led away to the gallows, and their relatives and lawyers are informed only after the execution has been carried out.  In a report issued this week, Amnesty noted a rise in the number of executions worldwide in 2011 [PDF], mainly due to a significant increase in the Middle East. The US - the only G7 country to carry out executions last year - is one of 58 countries, including Japan, China and Iran, that retain capital punishment. More than 140 countries, including all EU members, have abolished the death penalty in law or practice."}, {"sentences": ["Over the past week alone, events have been called off from Tokyo to Orlando."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Kiss", "Marilyn Manson", "Music", "Festivals", "Culture", "Music festivals"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-29T09:49:30Z", "title": "Sonisphere 2012 festival is cancelled", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/29/sonisphere-2012-festival-cancelled-queen", "article": "The 2012 Sonisphere festival at Knebworth has been cancelled.

Along with practically everybody in the games media, I&apos;ve spent a lot of time thinking and writing about this over the past few weeks, going over the potential reasons for Game&apos;s failure to compete and its spiralling implications \u2013 not just for the obvious victims, its UK customers and employees, but for everyone who buys, makes and sells games. You can read about all of that here if you&apos;re interested, but there&apos;s no other way to spin it - this is bad news for all of us. What I haven&apos;t seen much talk about is our personal relationship with games retail. Game as it currently stands, with its limited selection of strong sellers and at times rather aggressive emphasis on pre-owned, up-selling and pre-order deposits, bears little resemblance to the Game that I visited when I was growing up. Games shops were actually places that I used to go to hang out when I was a teenager, to browse with friends and occasionally make new ones. It&apos;s this experiential side of retail that things like Steam and Amazon haven&apos;t replaced, and I really miss it. Our local Gamestation in Edinburgh, before it was swallowed by Game Group, was a two-floor gamer&apos;s paradise with new stuff on the bottom floor and a top floor full of T-shirts, figurines, demo stations and racks full of retro games going back to the NES. The most valuable of these items were displayed in glass cases. I remember staring longingly at a mint condition (and very overpriced) copy of the super-rare SNES game Secret of Mana inside one of those cases for about two months. Now and then there&apos;d be someone else staring longingly at it right beside me, and we&apos;d strike up a conversation. The staff were friendly and passionate (as many Game and Gamestation employees still are), and would happily chat for a half hour, trading recommendations and experiences. It was a real enthusiast store. I spent a faintly ridiculous amount of money and time there. After Gamestation&apos;s acquisition, whilst games sales were really booming between around 2006 and 2010, a lot of this disappeared. Retro was sidelined and eventually eliminated entirely in favour of a Game-like pre-owned model that focussed on newer games only. The merchandise became slowly more generic until most of the quirky stuff was gone and only the DS cases and Mario plushes remained. I stopped visiting games shops very quickly and started buying online. I attributed the death of the games shop as I remembered it as a necessary complication of my hobby&apos;s move into the mainstream, and mourned it only briefly. When I moved to Japan at the end of 2008 though, I discovered a world where the game shop was still an experience. There, alongside the rows of shiny new games at the front of the store, you&apos;d find Dreamcast and N64 and Mega Drive games just an aisle away. Pretty much every games shop apart from the massive Bic Cameras and Yodabashi Cameras superstores gave as much floorspace to older games as it did to the new stuff, with 10-year-old boxes proudly displayed and baskets full of miscellaneous cartridges in which you might find a treasure. Near where I lived in Nagoya there was a second-hand games and CD store, K&apos;s House, that looked and smelled like someone&apos;s attic, with cartridges and disc cases and mysterious, obsolete peripherals and controllers stacked head-high. Now and then, flipping through N64 games in there, I&apos;d see some Japan-only game that I&apos;d read about as a nine-year-old in a magazine and delightedly hand over \u00a5500 (\u00a33.80) for it. My shelves are liberally adorned with such curios. God only knows how much money I spent. I could have predicted that the experience of shopping for games somewhere like Osaka&apos;s Den Den Town or Tokyo&apos;s Akihabara would be exhilarating for any geek, but what I didn&apos;t understand about Japanese retail is that most stores were like this. In Britain, shopping is something I do grudgingly and in as little time possible, picking up things online wherever possible. In Japan it became a recreational activity. All of this will probably sound intimately familiar to anyone who collects vinyl. The record shop is perhaps a British equivalent to the Japanese games store. But surely there must be a place for enthusiast shops here, still, alongside the megachains like Game (or whatever Game is replaced with in the coming weeks). If it turns out that the British high street cannot support a games megachain, does that mean it can&apos;t support smaller, more specialist shops either? Can&apos;t there be somewhere for enthusiasts to shop, too, whilst mums and gifters and more casual browsers pick up FIFA and COD and Just Dance from bigger chains and supermarkets? Bigger retail stores are vital to the health of the games industry, but for a long time they&apos;ve been all there is. Maybe they do exist, somewhere, and I just don&apos;t know about them.

While the artists Labrinth has worked with as a producer and songwriter \u2013 Tinie Tempah, Wretch 32 and Professor Green \u2013 have brightened the landcape of pop considerably, there&apos;s the creeping sense that the genre they spearheaded might have come to a critical mass. There are singles that are patently making the charts because they cravenly cleave to a popular template, not because they have any actual merit of their own. Artists with a talent so nugatory it has to be measured in nanometres are headlining arena tours. Pop-rap appears to have reached what you might call its Scouting for Girls moment. The question for Electronic Earth isn&apos;t whether it can produce hit singles \u2013 it already has done, three times \u2013 but whether Labrinth&apos;s talent can outlive the inevitable waning of the pop-rap vogue. If he&apos;s worried about this, it doesn&apos;t show. Electronic Earth begins with a track on which the listener is beckoned aboard a spaceship by a choir of Auto-Tuned voices: the implication appears to be that, like Sun Ra or Parliament, Labrinth&apos;s musical innovations operate at a such a superhuman level, the only rational explanation is that he comes from another planet, rather than Stoke Newington. In an act of brash cockiness that would have impressed Noel Gallagher at his most imperious, Climb on Board brazenly swipes its melody from Rihanna&apos;s The Only Girl in the World. Meanwhile, Earthquake proclaims itself &quot;a groundbreaker&quot;, so revolutionary that Labrinth feels impelled to say sorry to straight society for the devastating effect his music is bound to have on the status quo: &quot;Let me first apologise to the shirts and the ties ... Before you know it there&apos;s rubble and dust.&quot; He also gives a shout out to his label boss, the legendary overlord of boundary-shattering musical insurrection, Simon Cowell: &quot;Hey\u00a0Simon, we&apos;re fucking it\u00a0up.&quot; Of course, no one ever got far in urban music by acting the shrinking violet. Nevertheless, there are moments when, surrounded yet again by Auto-Tuned vocals and honking rave synthesisers, you feel the urge to take Labrinth to a quiet corner of his spaceship and tell him it&apos;s not really enough just to write songs about how devastatingly original and groundbreaking you are: you&apos;re actually supposed to make original and groundbreaking music, too. Equally, there are moments when Electronic Earth is nearly as audacious as Labrinth thinks it is: Sweet Riot&apos;s bullishly unfunky thud; the sparse, menacing buzz and growl of Sundown. Treatment is as good a conjunction of stadium rock and electronic pop as anything on the similarly minded Coldplay album Mylo Xyloto: that fact that it bears comparison to Coldplay should tell you in advance whether you want to hear it or not. The path from producer to artist is notoriously tricky. They&apos;re different jobs, requiring different skills. Labrinth avoids the most obvious pitfall \u2013 he can actually sing \u2013 but writing words seems to flummox him: &quot;I&apos;m out of my mind like in a mental asylum&quot; runs Treatment&apos;s chorus. He is big on the discouraging initial lyric, where he hits you with an opening line that makes you wonder how you&apos;re going to get through the song without ending up out of your mind like in a mental asylum yourself: &quot;Every day she wanna bite my pillow.&quot; He is also big on lyrics that convey something other than what he means. &quot;I feel a cold flush going through my hair,&quot; he sings on Let the Sun Shine, which makes it sound like persons unknown have stuck his head down a lavatory and pulled the chain. &quot;Hey you know what, I don&apos;t care,&quot; he adds, defiant in the face of a bogwashing. A pinnacle of sorts is reached on the duet with Emeli Sand\u00e9, Beneath Your Beautiful, a title you might think is a misprint, but isn&apos;t: he really is using beautiful as a noun rather than an adjective. Of course, the problem with singing about a lady&apos;s beautiful is that it sounds like a coy euphemism for her private parts. &quot;Let me see beneath your beautiful,&quot; he cries, like a man who thinks the object of his affections might be sitting on his missing car keys. Labrinth might well dismiss such criticism as beside the point. He currently sits at No 4 in the singles chart with Last Time, which opens with perhaps the most discouraging initial lyric of the lot: &quot;I love Tokyo, I&apos;ve never been.&quot; His present is assured. His future is a more thorny issue, one Electronic Earth doesn&apos;t satisfactorily answer."}, {"sentences": ["Experts doubt Japan has the ability to shoot down the rocket in mid-flight; instead, the precautionary moves appear to be aimed at reassuring the public that Tokyo is taking North Korea&apos;s latest provocation seriously.", "In a report published on Friday, the national institute for defence studies in Tokyo warned that North Korea&apos;s progress on nuclear technology, coupled with recent regime change, had increased the risk of conflict breaking out in the region."], "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "Philippines", "China", "Nuclear weapons", "Satellites", "Space"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-30T11:28:13Z", "title": "North Korea missile launches raise tensions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/north-korea-missile-launches-tensions", "article": "North Korea&apos;s test-launch of two short-range missiles this week has raised anxiety levels in the region, as the regime in Pyongyang prepares to defy international opinion with the launch next month of a long-range rocket, which many believe is connected to its ballistic missile programme. South Korean defence officials said that North Korea had launched two surface-to-ship missiles from a site on its west coast early on Wednesday, a day after world leaders attending a nuclear security summit in Seoul urged the regime to cancel the rocket launch and return to six-party nuclear talks. North Korea insists that the forthcoming launch, which is expected around 15 April to coincide with the centenary of the birth of the country&apos;s founder Kim Il-sung, is designed to put an observation satellite into orbit. The US, South Korea and Japan, however, say it would be a violation of UN security council resolutions banning North Korea from missile activity, as the same technology could be developed for use in multistage missiles, including those capable of hitting the US mainland. If the launch goes ahead it will immediately kill off a deal, which was reached at the end of February, in which the US agreed to provide 240,000 tonnes of food aid provided that Pyongyang end its uranium enrichment programme and tests of long-range and nuclear missiles. The prospect of a fourth North Korean long-range missile launch since 1998 is causing disquiet across the region, partly due to concerns that it will veer off course and potentially dump debris on its neighbours&apos; territory. On Friday Indonesia&apos;s foreign minister Marty Natalegawa urged North Korea to abandon the launch, saying it would &quot;undermine peace and stability in the region&quot;. The Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, said he was concerned that debris may fall on his country&apos;s territory, calling the planed launch a &quot;needless provocation&quot;. Japan is concerned that the rocket may fly over the southern island chain of Okinawa and has ordered its self-defence forces to intercept the rocket or its fragments if they pose a threat. In an unusual show of transparency, Pyongyang has told the international maritime organisation that the rocket will be launched between 7am and noon from 12-16 April. The first stage of the Unha-3 rocket will come down about 87 miles (140km) off the west coast of South Korea, while the second will fly over a chain near the main Okinawa island before falling into the sea east of the northern Philippines. Japan&apos;s defence minister, Naoki Tanaka, said the odds of the rocket striking Japan were low, but added: &quot;We want to be fully prepared for the possibility of rocket fragments falling on our territory.&quot; Japan will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles in its south-west and Okinawa, and send three Aegis-equipped destroyers carrying missile defence systems to the Japan Sea and East China Sea. Experts doubt Japan has the ability to shoot down the rocket in mid-flight; instead, the precautionary moves appear to be aimed at reassuring the public that Tokyo is taking North Korea&apos;s latest provocation seriously. The planned launch is causing particular alarm in Japan, which is already within striking distance of North Korea&apos;s medium-range Rodong missiles. In a report published on Friday, the national institute for defence studies in Tokyo warned that North Korea&apos;s progress on nuclear technology, coupled with recent regime change, had increased the risk of conflict breaking out in the region. Satellite images taken earlier this week show North Korea is making preparations for the missile launch from its Tongchang-ri site, located about 35 miles from the northern border with China. Expert analysis showed trucks and fuel tanks outside two large buildings used to store propellant for the rocket, although the rocket itself was not visible."}, {"sentences": ["Having been an also-ran at the Tokyo 1964 Olympics, he knew these games were now or never, so he stubbornly entered the 5000m and came second by just 0.2 seconds."], "tags": ["Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "Athletics", "Paralympics 2012", "Cathy Freeman", "Olympics 2000", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-03-30T21:59:00Z", "title": "Five great Olmpic moments", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/30/olympics-2012-athletics", "article": "Kip Keino, 1500m, 1968     Kip Keino running in the 5000m at the 1968 Games.

Klein, 83, initially trained as a painter under Fernand L\u00e9ger in Paris in the 1950s, before relocating to New York and, despite having no formal training, landed a job as a fashion photographer at American Vogue. There he earned a reputation as an iconoclast, using a wide-angled lens to often surreal effect and introducing movement and energy in the form of blurred motion into his street shoots. His time at Vogue was the inspiration for his first feature film, Who Are You, Polly Maggoo? released in 1966, from which this still is taken. The film is a gleeful satire of the fashion industry starring Dorothy McGowan, a model who, legend has it, was discovered by a fashion scout among a crowd of teenagers awaiting the arrival of the Beatles at Kennedy Airport. Grayson Hall shines as the brilliantly bitchy Miss Maxwell, a magazine editor based on Diana Vreeland. Other films followed, including the anti-imperialist Mr Freedom and an acclaimed documentary, Muhammad Ali, the Greatest. Klein returned to photography in the 1980s, but it is his earlier books, most notably Life is Good &amp; Good For You In New York, that endure.

For 40 years, between 1950 and 1990, this passion was a key ingredient driving one of the most remarkable periods of growth in economic history. But for the past 20 years, Japan has been stricken by stagnation. In the late 1980s-90s, it suffered a financial crisis nearly as severe as our own. The economic model \u2013 the Ministry of International Trade and Industry guiding Japanese companies; the keiretsu networks of loosely conglomerated firms and associated banks; the great global brands \u2013 suffered an implosion.

In 2009, the Democratic party of Japan was elected by a landslide, pledging a root and branch reform of every bureaucratic, corporatist and anti-democratic element in Japan&apos;s broken system. It also pledged to recast economic policy to serve the people. Despite some epic mistakes, notably its handling of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, it still holds an opinion poll lead over its rival, the Liberal Democratic party (LDP). However, forces within the government are very much open to pondering where it should go next. Ten days ago, I was invited by the DPJ government to go to Tokyo to contribute to this ongoing conversation. Cabinet members wanted to discuss what a 21st-century social contract might look like, respecting both necessary labour market flexibility and security. They wanted to understand the contribution that open innovation ecosystems and an entrepreneurial state can play in driving forward innovation and investment. Above all, they asked: how could Japan reinvent its stakeholder capitalism of the second half of the 20th century so that it was more democratic? And they thought there might be something in my ideas rehearsed in the books The State We&apos;re In and Them and Us. In short, how could Japan do good capitalism? It is the question \u2013 not only in Japan but, I would argue, in Britain. In Japan the devastating earthquake in Tohoku 12 months ago has made it even more acute. Three hundred and forty thousand people are still without homes. At least 19,000 died. And the nuclear power station at Fukushima very nearly suffered a meltdown [see footnote]. At the time of the crisis, Japan hoped that, with the DPJ in power, there would be a decisive change from the way such matters had been handled in the past \u2013 obfuscation, delay, inactivity and anxiety to protect corporate interests. Yet the new government bounced off the secrecy of Tokyo Electric Power Company, the bureaucratic ministries, a muzzled media and the enveloping tentacles of the employers&apos; organisation, the Keidanren, as if nothing had changed. Prime Minster Kan became party to delivering inadequate and late information via the impenetrable state and corporate networks; many Japanese became devotees of BBC World News as the only purveyor of truth. Kan was forced to resign last summer. But the Japanese electorate is not ready to return to the status quo. They know they need nuclear power which just 12 months ago provided more than a third of their electricity needs; but as power stations are being closed down for safety inspections local communities are vetoing their reopening. In May, the last nuclear power station operating will also be mothballed. The terms for their restarting are tough. Local communities, fired up by a new citizen activism, want effective oversight, transparency of information and commitments to meet international safety standards. It is Japanese good capitalism, driven by citizen demands from below. Faced with this new phenomenon, the LDP is at a loss, while the DPJ itself seems to be re-gathering its conviction that its reform agenda is the only way forward. At an open meeting in the Japanese parliament, I was struck by the interest DPJ MPs showed in discussing innovative ways of kickstarting credit flows \u2013 as anathema to the Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance as they are to the Bank of England and Treasury. The Bank of Japan has just expanded a version of the Bank of England&apos;s quantitative easing programme; but abstains from the activism it used to show in the great days of Japan&apos;s growth. The conclusions are obvious. Japan&apos;s financial system is broken; an activist state has to restart bank lending by assuming some of the risk \u2013 just as it must in Britain. If Japan could reset its macroeconomic policy, there is an enormous pool of dynamic hi-tech medium-sized firms that could immediately grow very fast. Consultant Gerhard Fasol argues that in areas like LED lighting or mobile phone payment systems, Japan is 10 years ahead of the rest of the world. The Fujitsus and Toshibas of tomorrow are in the wings. What Japan needs is for the increasingly sclerotic giants to be challenged by these many insurgents, who need new institutions to support their ambitions to go global. A new entrepreneurial, accountable state could drive a second phase of powerful Japanese growth. These debates are foreign to our primitive business culture, which undervalues service and innovation and scarcely thinks about a more productive capitalism. There is a long list of British companies that have tried to break into Japan&apos;s market and failed. Observers say the common theme is wholesale insensitivity to the need for service and innovation, the precondition for any success in Japan. Britain and Japan are two island economies, both mired in private debt with stricken financial systems. Although Japan has a long way to go, it is becoming obvious, confirmed by last week&apos;s British budget, which of the two countries is most likely to create the 21st-century framework for growth and prosperity. The Asian story of the next decade will be Japan&apos;s renaissance and China&apos;s relapse. \u2022 The following correction was published on 8 April 2012:Discussing the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan last year a Comment piece maintained that &quot;the nuclear power station at Fukushima very nearly suffered a meltdown&quot;, yet as early as May last year the Tokyo Electric Power Co admitted that fuel rods in three reactors had melted down within hours of the quake.

The rebirth of Japan&quot;)."}, {"sentences": ["The Oakland A&apos;s split a pair of games with the Seattle Mariners at the Tokyo Dome, and then retreated back to North America for more spring training games."], "tags": ["MLB", "US sports", "Philadelphia Phillies", "New York Mets", "Miami Marlins", "Los Angeles Dodgers"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-02T08:00:00Z", "title": "MLB 2012 preview: National League", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/apr/02/mlb-preview-2012-national-league", "article": "Depending on who you speak with, we have either already had opening day or we haven&apos;t had opening day yet, which makes the whole thing a bit confusing. The Oakland A&apos;s split a pair of games with the Seattle Mariners at the Tokyo Dome, and then retreated back to North America for more spring training games.  You can make reasonable arguments on both sides, but the fact is, on Wednesday, the Miami Marlins will host the defending champion St Louis Cardinals, in their spanking new ballpark, which by the way you can follow along with us, as it happens, just before 7:00pm EST. So call it whatever you want, the only thing that really matters is that baseball is back, and it will be with us almost every single day until late October, and for its legions of fans around the world, that&apos;s a big relief. So, having said all of that, here&apos;s part two of our 2012 Major League Baseball preview featuring the teams of the Senior Circuit.  National League West Arizona Diamondbacks 2011 Finish: 94-68 NL West Champs Main Moves: Pitcher Jason Marquis has moved on yet again. Hurlers Craig Breslow and Trevor Cahill came over in the Oakland deal which sent Ryan Cook and Jarrod Parker to the A&apos;s. Outfielder Jason Kubel left the Twins to sign with Arizona. Depth Chart Video: Rookie manager done good The short story: What a difference a year makes. In 2010 the Diamondbacks were awful, even worse than they were in 2009, the year they hired A.J. Hinch, who was, um, the D&apos;Backs Farm Director, to manage the team. That didn&apos;t go so well--he had never managed a team before which can work if you&apos;re a big name in the game but not you&apos;re a farm director. This I imagine led to something of a clubhouse credibility issue with his players. Anyway, the team was awful and towards the end of &apos;10 they fired both Hinch and the man responsible for the Hinch hire, GM Josh Byrnes, and then hired the highly respected Kevin Towers, who then brought in Kirk Gibson. Sure, Kirk was also a rookie in the managerial game, but he had been serving as bench coach, and heck, he&apos;s Kirk Gibson. Last year he headed up a ballclub that went from zeroes to heroes in the desert, beating out the Giants to become NL West winners. How did it happen? Well, I remember hearing somewhere from someone that the animated Gibson and his bench coach, Alan Trammell, more or less scared the players into winning, which isn&apos;t that much of a leap considering their personalities. Young talent helps as well, and having Ian Kennedy and Daniel Hudson at the top of the rotation provided reliability and a combined 37-16 record, never mind getting the 31 starts and 3.38 ERA from rookie Joshua Collmenter. J.J. Putz become a lights out closer, while the offense put up some of the best numbers in the NL, particularly Justin Upton, who is a complete and total animal. Paul Goldschmidt came up later and had a big impact, while Gerardo Parra had a breakout season. Aside from a slow April, Arizona were pretty consistent, and now they&apos;ve added Trevor Cahill to the staff, which can only help. There&apos;s no reason they can&apos;t win again.The long story Hashtag: #boringbutgood Prediction: D&apos;Backs and Giants fight to the finish in the west. Colorado Rockies 2011 Finish: 73-89 4th place 21 GB Main Moves: A lot of blah left and a lot of blah came in. They did deal for pitcher Guillermo Moscoso which was good. Jamie Moyer made the rotation, he&apos;s only 49. They signed catcher Ramon Hernandez, infielders Marco Scutaro and Casey Blake, and outfielder Michael Cuddyer. Depth ChartBad Video: The humidor...of course. The short story: The Rockies played below expectations last year which was disappointing for their fans. As they wallow in self-pity those fans should think about this: considering everything the organization has been through since joining the National League in 1993, that they came out of spring training with any kind of expectations should be seen as a comprehensive victory. Remember the Denny Neagle debacle? Well, in 1999, a season in which the Rockies lost 90 games, they had just one starting pitcher with an ERA under five. The rest? 8.04, 5.04, 6.20, 6.61, and 6.33. Oh, and Neagle wasn&apos;t even on that team, he was part of the high-priced cavalry (with Mike Hampton) that came to rescue the staff, and, well, that didn&apos;t happen. Since 2002 the humidor has helped keep the ball inside Coors Field, and pitchers don&apos;t lose their minds like they used to up in Denver&apos;s thin air. Having said that however, the pitching has regressed each season from 2009 to 2011, something the team is trying to fix in 2012. It&apos;s not often that help comes from the Baltimore Orioles, but Jeremy Guthrie should provide some stability in the rotation, as will Jorge De La Rosa, should he make a successful comeback from Tommy John surgery. That won&apos;t happen until July though, if it indeed happens at all. In the meantime, there&apos;s 49-year-old Jamie Moyer to fill the void, or at least a few column inches in the local papers. Juan Nicasio broke his neck in a scary incident last season, but has been a good story coming out of spring with his pitches reaching 97 miles-per-hour, while Drew Pomeranz, who came over in the Jimenez deal, could have an impact in the rotation. Starters Tyler Chatwood and Guillermo Moscoso have an upside also--Rafael Betancourt is the closer, taking over for Huston Street. The bats are older and more established. Michael Cuddyer and Casey Blake signed with the Rockies bringing a veteran presence, not that Todd Helton is some kind of young buck. Marco Scutaro is another older player bought in to help stabilize the lineup that has Troy Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez. These guys could go either way, but if they get a few breaks, they could become a real problem for some teams. The long storyHashtag: #canmanningpitch? Prediction: It&apos;s hard to see what&apos;s in the can, don&apos;t you think? Los Angeles Dodgers 2011 Finish: 82-79 3rd place 11.5 GB Main Moves: Frank McCourt is out! Losing pitcher Hiroki Kuroda to the Yankees in free agency, saying goodbye to reliever Jonathan Broxton, who was not to be trusted anyways. Enter pitchers Chris Capuano and Aaron Harang. Depth ChartVideo: One more year in the booth for Vin Scully            The short story: Finally, the Dodgers are finally free of the disastrous distasteful doolittle who dunked this once golden franchise into a giant tub of doody. Frank McCourt has left the building, and he&apos;s taken the vibes that have paralyzed this team over the past few seasons with him. McCourt, the same guy who was once part of a move to yank the Red Sox from Fenway Park, did pretty OK for himself, something that fans can live with just as long as he never, ever returns to Chavez Ravine. It&apos;s amazing to think that McCourt made the period that News Corp. owned the team seem like the good times, that&apos;s just how bad it has been. Now there&apos;s Magic Johnson in the front office, whose familiar smile has got to be a sight for sore eyes. They&apos;ll get busy on building a winner, something LA hasn&apos;t had since 1988, a very very long time for a franchise that&apos;s won a lot, but it won&apos;t happen overnight. Still, they have the NL MVP runner up in Matt Kemp, and the Cy Young Award winner in Clayton Kershaw, and that&apos;s pretty good, but it&apos;s not enough for a team in transition. Really though, who cares, because 2012 will be whatever it is, and that&apos;s just fine considering what&apos;s gone on in Dodger Stadium during recent years. The message for this season is go out, drink a beer, get a tan, watch some baseball, listen to Vin Scully and Think Blue. Winning will come later. The long story Hashtag: #showtime  Prediction: The happiest third place finish in Dodgers history. San Diego Padres 2011 Finish: 71-91 5th place 23 GB Main Moves: Pitchers Heath Bell and Aaron Harang are out. Outielder Carlos Quentin came over from the White Sox, pitcher Edinson Volquez from the Reds with Cubans Yonder Alonso and Yasmani Grandal and pitcher Brad Boxberger (not Cuban) for pitcher Mat Latos, which was a big deal.  Depth ChartVideo: Bleak present, bright futureThe short story: What is it about Southern California and ownership issues pertaining to divorce? Well, somewhat incredibly, just down the I-5, in San Diego, there&apos;s a situation that&apos;s getting pretty hairy, and it goes back to John Moores, the principal owner of the Pads divorcing his wife back in 2008. Soon after the split, Moores was looking for buyers, and found a willing partner in Jeff Moorad, who had been a players agent and was a managing partner with the D&apos;Backs. It was decided that Moorad would become CEO and buy the team over a number of years--by March 2010, he had purchased 49 percent of the club. In January, with Moorad approaching the 51 percent threshold, MLB was scheduled to vote on his becoming a majority owner, but the league pulled the plug on it. Apparently, some believe that Moorad wants to skim off a future deal for television rights to pay back some of his partners rather than sinking that money into the club. True or not, Moorad stepped down as CEO and now the Pads ownership situation is in flux, and we know how well that worked for the Dodgers. Anyhow, before all that, the big Padres move was the trade of Mat Latos, a young highly rated prospect, to the Reds for a package of talented kids and the inconsistent pitcher Edison Volquez. Why did they deal a 24-year-old who went 9-14 and was amongst the best NL pitchers in strikeouts and earned run average? Well, the Reds were desperate for an arm, and gave up a lot of young talent, adding to a farm system that is seen as the best in baseball according to top evaluators. What&apos;s left for Pads fans while they wait for the kids? Well, they have injury prone slugging left fielder Carlos Quentin, who is out for at least two weeks with a knee issue, second baseman Orlando Hudson who has also been banged up, and I guess they have Huston Street closing games, and that&apos;s not so bad, even if San Diego wont have too many leads to protect. Other than that, it&apos;s time to watch those pretty flowers grow, and solve that ownership situation.The long story Hashtag: #eh Prediction: The waiting is the hardest part. San Francisco Giants 2011 Finish: 86-76 2nd place 8 GBMain Moves: Trading for outfielder Melky Cabrera from Kansas City for Jonathan Sanchez and obtaining outfielder Angel Pagan from the Mets for outfielder Andres Torres. Carlos Beltran signed with St. Louis. I&apos;m still upset I missed Pat Burrell&apos;s retirement press conference.Depth Chart Video: The play that ended the Giants 2011 seasonThe short story: The Giants were champions in 2010, winning with dominating pitching and a challenged offense that had just enough pop and more than enough mojo. A lot of that mojo came from their catcher Buster Posey, the young cog that gave the Giants offense a powerful presence that reverberated up and down their lineup. When he went down in that now infamous collision in May, San Francisco lost the straw that stirred their drink, and with it, any chance of repeating as champions. The deadline deal for Carlos Beltran didn&apos;t help the lineup, but it did cost them a top prospect, and the Giants missed out on the playoffs, squandering a season of stellar pitching performances from one of the premiere staffs in all of baseball. Now that he is back, hopes are high that he can make a full recovery, and that his presence will increase their chances of the Giants making the playoffs once again. Outfielder Melky Cabrera should help as well, providing his breakout season in Kansas City last year was no fluke, while outfielder Angel Pagan is an offensive upgrade on Andres Torres, minus his deplorable baseball instincts. This ain&apos;t the 1927 Yankees, but when you consider that the Giants won 86 games with one of the worst offenses in the NL, it&apos;s shouldn&apos;t take much to get them back into the tournament. Meanwhile, the front office has failed thus far to lock up front line starter Matt Cain, who will be a free agent after the season, and don&apos;t think the Giants haven&apos;t noticed that their fierce rivals to the south are looking to make a big splash.The long story Hashtag: #itsallaboutposeyPrediction: Arizona and the Giants down to the wire. National League Central Chicago Cubs 2011 Finish: 71-91 5th place 25 GB Main Moves: Finally dismissing GM Jim Hendry, trading for Theo Epstein to lead the Cubs front office, and Jed Hoyer being hired as the new GM. Good riddance Carlos Zambrano. Infielders Aramis Ramirez and Carlos Pena are out, Ian Stewart comes over from Colorado, outfielder David Dejesus is in from Oakland. Hiring manager Dale Sveum, and trading for Anthony Rizzo from San Diego. Depth Chart Video: What ain&apos;t gonna happen...this year.            The short story: I guess with these Cubs it&apos;s a case of good news bad news. The bad news is that after over 100 years, Chicago&apos;s North Side World Series drought is set to continue. The good news is that they have someone in there now who has some experiences with curses. The Cubs were the beneficiaries of the post-September madness in Boston, and now Theo Epstein, who crushed the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;, is running the Cubs in a bid to extinguish the &quot;Curse of the Billygoat&quot;, which would be quite the double if he can pull it off. He&apos;s already pulled a cheeky move, sending over Chris Carpenter to the Red Sox as compensation for himself, a matter that Boston aren&apos;t happy about considering that he just had surgery. Otherwise Theo is getting the house in order, overhauling the organization, appointing Jed Hoyer as GM, while putting together a plan with a goal of putting the Cubs into the playoffs every year, which would increase their chances of winning it all exponentially. What about 2012? Well, the team is a disjointed mess, but if you believe new manager Dale Sveum, their rotation of Matt Garza, Ryan Dempster, Jeff Samardzija, Chris Vol\u00adstad and Paul Maholm is amongst the best in the NL. Then again, what&apos;s he supposed to say? My rotation is so-so with a lot of question marks? The bats are a mixed bag with Alfonso Soriano and his .289 OBP due $54m over the next three years. Ian Stewart, Marlon Byrd and David DeJesus aren&apos;t getting anyone excited, but catcher Geovany Soto could if he returns to form after an awful 2011. Then there&apos;s the standout shortstop Starlin Castro who had over 200 hits in 2011, and whose either a building block for the franchise, or trade bait as part of the overhaul. Bryan LaHair is the first baseman for now, as super prospect Anthony Rizzo should get a shot this year after starting the season in the minors--that could be fun to watch when there&apos;s nothing else going on in August. It&apos;s a funny thing to tell Cubs fans to be patient, but they&apos;ll need to be in 2012. The long story Hashtag: #itsnotgonnahapenyet Prediction: It&apos;s going to get worse before it gets better. Cincinnati Reds 2011 Finish: 79-83 3rd place 17 GB Main Moves: The big deal for starting pitcher Mat Latos. Reliever Sean Marshall was acquired from the Cubs, Ryan Madson signed from Philly to close...until he got hurt. Depth Chart Video: What happened to this guy? The short story: Reds fans were excited. They acquired Mat Latos from the Padres to get the front-line starter they desperately needed, traded for Sean Marshall to be the eighth inning guy, and signed Ryan Madson to be the closer. With Tony La Russa, Albert Pujols and Prince Fielder out of the division, they were thinking, &quot;Why not us?&quot;, and with good reason. The Reds were 2010 NL Central champs, but their pitching fell off in 2011, which is why GM Walt Jocketty gave up the store to get Latos, and gave Madson a big chunk of cash, funds that could have been used to give second baseman Brandon Phillips a long-term deal. Well, now that Madson is out for the year after blowing up his elbow this spring, his $8.5m salary, a lot of money for little guys like the Reds, will do nothing to help the team. Worse, now that their pitching balance is altered, the Reds are leaning towards a bullpen by committee to close out games, and we know how well that usually works. The potential x-factor in all this is the flame-throwing Cuban Aroldis Chapman, who struggled previously in the pen, but looked good as a starter this spring. With the bullpen an issue, there&apos;s a temptation to use him as a reliever, something still being chewed over at press time. We all know the Reds can score--with big bats like Joey Votto, Phillips and Jay Bruce, that hasn&apos;t been the problem for this group. However, unless someone can jump into that closers role and tie up the eighth inning, there could be a lot of adventures late in games in Cincinnati. Buckle up. The long story Hashtag: #inwithachance? Prediction: A three way war in the NL Central is a lot of fun. Houston Astros 2011 Finish: 56-106 6th place 40 GB Main Moves: Come on man, don&apos;t make me do it. Depth Chart Video: Go west, AL West. The short story: The Astros are getting set to head to the AL West in 2013 in the name of symmetry. Why does there have to be an equal number of teams in each league? That&apos;s a tough question to answer but I will say this--if we&apos;re going to do that, why stop there? They should also make it so that each stadium has exactly the same dimensions and the very same ballpark menu as well. I&apos;m still smarting from the umpires merging under one MLB umbrella and the closing of the league offices--now this! The &quot;upside&quot;? We get Interleague Play throughout the entire season, and &quot;fairer&quot;, even divisions. Isn&apos;t that great? No, it&apos;s not. Astros fans are livid, and so is their former slugger Lance Berkman, who says the new owner was basically held over a barrel to accept a discount on the team sale price in exchange for a move to the AL West or take a walk. So, after celebrating their 50th season in 2012, they will move to a new division and get beat up by the Angels and the Rangers for a long time. The team was more or less liquidated over the past two seasons, and some believe that they can challenge the 1962 Mets modern day record of 120 losses to which I say, HANDS OFF HOUSTON! The long story Hashtag: #wevebeenhadhoodwinkedbamboozled Prediction: Anything other than a last place finish will be like winning the World Series. Milwaukee Brewers 2011 Finish: 96-66 NL Central Champs Main Moves: Infielders Aramis Ramirez and Alex Gonalez Depth Chart Video: Braun stumbling in a much more amusing way. The short story: Call it a Brewers winter of discontent. Ryan Braun reportedly tested positive for performance enhancing drugs and Prince Fielder was signed by the Tigers. We all knew that Prince would head for greener pastures, but Braun&apos;s test was a shocker. A baseball golden boy and reigning MVP, Braun&apos;s positive test was greeted by disappointment to say the least. Then the controversy grew when the test was ruled invalid after arbitrator Shyam Das ruled with Braun&apos;s appeal, which was based on alleged improper handling of the sample. Braun held a press conference this spring to discuss the matter, but it hasn&apos;t stopped the boos during exhibition games, and now he&apos;s said that those fans don&apos;t have all the information. The problem is he&apos;s also saying that &quot;it really wouldn&apos;t do anybody any good&quot; to provide more information. Really? If the information would help inform fans further as to his innocence than why not disclose it? Frankly, I&apos;m a little confused by that stand. Anyway, life goes on for the Brew Crew who enjoyed one of their finest seasons in 2011, and having Braun on the opening day roster rather than serving a 50-game suspension is a massive boost. Milwaukee signed third baseman Aramis Ramirez, who disappointed with the Cubs, but should be able to help the lineup recover some of what was lost when Fielder left. Otherwise, Francisco Rodriguez will be back in the eighth inning role, while Brewers GM Doug Melvin locked up catcher Jonathan Lucroy, and is trying to sign pitchers Zack Greinke and closer John Axford to long term deals. They also brought in Japanese import Norichika Aoki to add depth in the outfield. In a wide-open NL Central, the Brewers have more than enough to repeat as division champions. The long story Hashtag: #noprincenoproblem Prediction: Brew Crew compete despite rocky offseason. Pittsburgh Pirates 2011 Finish: 72-90 4th place 24 GB Main Moves: Pitchers A.J. Burnett and Erik Bedard, catcher Rod Barajas and infielder Clint BarmesDepth Chart Video: We are family! The short story:  In 1992, I was still in high school, Princess Diana and Prince Charles separated and the Pirates won 96 games. They took their third consecutive NL East title before losing in their third straight NLCS, this time to the Braves, again, in seven games. Since then Pittsburgh have failed to finish .500 or better, a statistic that can only be described as &amp;*$#^ unbelievable. That&apos;s 19 years--19! Can you imagine what it must be like to be a fan of this team? Patrick Conway can, he&apos;s been there the whole way, watching night after night, loss after loss. It&apos;s impressive really. Most of us would have jumped into any one of the three rivers available to Steel City residents, but not Patrick. Ever the optimist, Patrick thinks this could be the year the Bucs hit the big .5-0-0. Actually, Pittsburgh were in first place as late as July 25th before the rotation gave out, something he hopes will be fixed with the acquisitions of now A.J. Burnett and Erik Bedard. Patrick also thinks the key to the season will be third baseman Pedro Alvarez, their talented prospect who botched 2011 in a major way. If he can expand on the promise he showed in his rookie season, then he and Andrew McCutchen could become a nasty 1-2 punch the lineup desperately needs. Finally, Patrick also says we need to follow young Bucs Alex Presley, Jose Tabata, James McDonald, Neil Walker--if they improve on their 2011 campaigns, .500 could be within reach.Hashtag: #enoughalready Prediction: .500 or bust! St. Louis Cardinals 2011 Finish: 90-72 2nd place 6 GB Main Moves: You may have heard, first baseman Albert Pujols and manager Tony La Russa are gone. Outfielder Carlos Beltran is in. Former Cards catcher Mike Matheny is the new skipper. Depth Chart Video: Simon Brotherton and David Freese The short story: In baseball there are highs and there are lows. You just don&apos;t expect them to come so close together. The St. Louis Cardinals came from nowhere in 2011 to win the World Series, and then their fans watched two all-time Cards figures leave Busch Stadium. First manager Tony La Russa called it a day, and then the Angels swooped in and signed Albert Pujols. The icing on the cake was the departure of Dave Duncan, La Russa&apos;s right hand man for decades, who made his name rescuing lost causes and elevating aces to new levels. Most organizations would have hit the panic button, but the Cardinals are always cool customers, and you get the feeling that everything will be just fine, as it always is in St. Louis. They hired their former catcher Mike Matheny, to manage the team, moved outfielder Lance Berkman to first base to replace Pujols, and signed Carlos Beltran to fill Berkman&apos;s spot in left. Easy. They also benefit from the return of ace Adam Wainwright, who missed out on the championship season with injury. If there&apos;s a bump in the road it&apos;s the nerve issues in Chris Carpenter&apos;s shoulder which means he will miss the start of the season--Lance Lynn will fill his spot for now. Will the Cardinals suffer from losing Pujols? Of course they will. Will Carpenter missing time be an issue? Potentially, if he doesn&apos;t come around, but didn&apos;t the Cards just win the World Series without their other ace on the active roster? It&apos;s not like they&apos;re playing in the AL East, so the Cardinals will be just fine, as they always are, which is kind of annoying. The long storyHashtag: #charmedfranchise Prediction: Always in the mix. National League East Atlanta Braves 2011 Finish: 89-73 2nd place 13 GB Main Moves: Very little despite the collapse, but they did deal pitcher Derek Lowe to Cleveland. Depth Chart Video: Wake me up when September ends The short story: The Red Sox collapse got a good chunk of the headlines when it came to the September folds, but the Braves tank job was pretty impressive as well, and don&apos;t think for a second that it&apos;s not up there with the very best. Atlanta went 9-18 in September, while those Cardinals went 18-8, crushing Houston on the final day of the season as the Bravos dropped one in extra innings to a Philly team that just wanted to go home. Blowing an 8.5 game wild card lead in 23 days must mean sweeping changes right? Wrong. This isn&apos;t Boston, it&apos;s Atlanta, where they&apos;ve had two managers in 20 years, and everyone is cool, calm and collected. How did the Braves respond in the offseason? By doing virtually nothing, figuring the disastrous conclusion to Fredi Gonzalez&apos; first season at the helm was an aberration. Should he have been held accountable? Perhaps. He ran Craig Kimbrel, their young closer, into the ground, pulled Chipper Jones out of the three spot in the lineup, benched Jason Heyward for a bit, relied too much on Derek Lowe, all while their heavy hitting catcher Brian McCann disappeared for six weeks. The team is solid, but are they solid enough to do virtually nothing after such an horror show? A lot of that will depend on just how good the Marlins and Phillies will be. Meanwhile, it&apos;s the last go around for Chipper Jones, who announced he would retire at the end of the season, one which he&apos;ll begin on the DL.  The long story Hashtag: #lightningonlystrikestwiceifyourethemets Prediction: The Bravos struggle at times but hang around.  Miami Marlins 2011 Finish: 72-90 5th place 30 GB Main Moves: Manager Ozzie Guillen, infielder Jose Reyes, pitchers Heath Bell, Carlos Zambrano and Mark Buehrle. Would you like anything else sir?

Miami, which is what they&apos;re called now, have a new name, set of uniforms, stadium, and manager, Ozzie Guillen, who escaped from Chicago to land back in the organization that he won a ring with in 2003 as the third base coach. The whole outlook of the team is different, their plan is finally in place, mostly thanks to the controversial ballpark built on the site of the old Orange Bowl. If you build it, will they come? Well, we&apos;re about to find out. Pathetic attendance in Florida has long been tied to mostly bad teams playing baseball in a football stadium during blazing hot and wet summers. Well now they have a baseball only ballpark, with a retractable roof, air conditioning, and, what on paper seems to be more than a decent ballclub. We&apos;ve seen teams that have invested heavily in free agents fall on their face before, but I&apos;m pretty sure that won&apos;t happen in Miami. It&apos;s all there, with the veteran imports looking great next to Hanley Ramirez and all the young talent on the roster. The key to the pitching will be whether or not Josh Johnson can stay healthy, and if Carlos Zambrano can calm down and just pitch--Miami are counting on the whole change of scenery thing working out for Carlos. The bullpen is above average now that Heath Bell is in place as the closer. Health is the key to the lineups success because the talent is there. Can Jose Reyes&apos; hamstrings hold up? Can Hanley stay on the field? If they can, they&apos;ll tie up a dynamic, speedy lineup that is capable of almost anything. If they can&apos;t, the Marlins bats will struggle as they did in 2011.

Depth Chart Video: A look at the new dimensions in Queens. It&apos;s pretty realistic, less the fans in the seats.The short story: In high school, for whatever reason, almost all of my friends were a year older than me. So when I was a junior, and the senior prom was coming up, I knew that I had to find a way to join my friends at the big dance. So I got a date and a tuxedo, got in the limo with the gang and head off to the prom. Jody De Santis and I ate dinner in the fancy restaurant below the ballroom at the hotel. After they finished eating upstairs at the party, we made our move, sneaking into the event. Thankfully, no one said a word. I knew that I had just one shot at going to a prom, and so while I was there, I made sure that I savored every single minute of it. Some Mets fans will be wishing they did the same back in October of 2006, but who would have ever guessed that those core of Mets players would never make it back.

Philadelphia Phillies 2011 Finish: 102-60 NL East Champs Main Moves: Reliever Ryan Madson went to Cincy, outfielder Raul Ibanez to the Yankees and Jonathan Papelbon arrived as a free agent from Boston. Depth ChartVideo: Roy Halladay, ace, hero.            The short story: The Phillies won 102 games and were on their way to winning a second World Series title in four years when they ran into the blazing hot Cardinals machine and Chris Carpenter. They lost Game Five of the NLDS 1-0 with their ace Roy Halladay losing to his buddy in what was probably the best playoff pitching performance that we&apos;ve seen since Jack Morris and John Smoltz in Game Seven of the 1991 World Series. In a surreal scene, Ryan Howard fell to the ground on what was to be the final play of the series, the first baseman rolling in pain as the Cards celebrated on Philadelphia&apos;s home field. The Phillies offense will suffer for it in 2012: he won&apos;t be back from the torn Achilles tendon injury until late May or possibly early June. Meanwhile, Chase Utley&apos;s left knee will keep him off the opening day roster, and some in Philly are speculating that he&apos;ll never play again. Philadelphia&apos;s bats have weathered Utley&apos;s injuries before, but with Howard out it&apos;s just too much. That means that right out of the gate, the Phillies look a lot like the 2011 Giants, a team with tremendous pitching, and no sticks. They also have potential issues in the bullpen&apos;s bridge to new closer Jonathan Papelbon with relievers Antonio Bastardo and Mike Stutes a bit banged up. Any team with Halladay, Lee and Hamels will be competitive, but right now, the Phills look old and expensive.

Washington Nationals 2011 Finish: 80-81 3rd place 21.5 GB Main Moves: Acquiring pitcher Gio Gonzalez from Oakland. Pitchers Brad Lidge and Edwin Jackson via free agency. Depth Chart Video: Je me souvien The short story: It has been a tough seven years for the Washington Nationals, but you know what they say eighth time&apos;s a charm. The farm system is stacked, and the big club are in a position to improve. Last year they climbed to within a game of .500, and that&apos;s despite losing their young, all-world ace Stephen Strasburg for the season, and dealing with Jayson Werth&apos;s season long swoon. They traded for Gio Gonzalez to boost a rotation that also has Jordan Zimmerman, Edwin Jackson, and of course, a healthy Strasburg, even if his innings will be limited. Their lineup struggled last season, but you have to think that Werth can&apos;t be that bad again, and Zimmerman was incredible in the second half of the season, posting monster numbers following an injury derailed first half. Michael Morse is a beast, who hit for a .910 OPS, with 31 homers despite a propensity to whiff. If others in the lineup can improve slightly, there&apos;s no reason why the Nats can&apos;t score more in 2011, and that, combined with some decent pitching, means that they could get above .500. If there is an issue with the Nats it&apos;s the injuries they suffered this spring. Closer Drew Storen won&apos;t be ready until mid-April at least, while Morse also starts 2012 on the DL with a muscle injury. That means more from Brad Lidge and Mark De Rosa for a while, which is fine in the short term, but not if they play regularly into May. Meanwhile, we&apos;re all waiting for super prospect Bryce Harper to make his MLB debut--he&apos;ll begin his season in AAA. Stay tuned.

The multi-tracked guitars and bass intro of Iron Maiden\u2019s Phantom of the Opera opens slowly as the double Olympic gold medallist first appears on screen. He is somewhere in the south-west of the United States of America and the intense early morning heat is captured by the fuzzy quality of the pictures.   Related: Daley Thompson causes furore at LA Olympics: From the archive, 11 August 1984:    The caption says it is 8am and time for Daley Thompson, who is puffing hard as he runs towards the camera, to break training for refreshment. He wipes the sweat from his face. The lights turn amber and Thompson, now sitting in the bleachers, tosses a bottle of Lucozade in the air, opens it and begins glugging. The guitars accelerate as Thompson crouches in his starting blocks, the light goes green on the first beat of the snare drum and he blasts down the track in powerful, lithe strides, his eyes focused on the finishing line. When he crosses it, Desmond Lynam utters the strapline: \u201cLucozade, the refreshing glucose drink.\u201d Since 1929 Lucozade had been marketed as an aid to recovery and was sold primarily in chemists. In its crinkly, cellophane wrapper it became a ubiquitous sight, along with bunches of grapes, on top of the bedside cabinets on hospital wards throughout the UK. When it wanted to branch out beyond its established, infirm customer base in 1985 it could have not chosen a more radiant emblem of health, vigour and intense competitive spirit than Britain\u2019s greatest ever all-round athlete. It worked wonders for the brand but in 30 seconds it also encapsulated Thompson\u2019s dedication and dynamism. Everyone knew the famous story of his Christmas day training sessions to gain an edge on his rivals, which were more a sadistic psychological weapon than a masochistic trial for himself. Now here he was at 8am, in fierce, hazy heat, not beginning but breaking his training routine. In deeds more than words, though there were plenty of those too, he corroborated the judgment of his friend, Sebastian Coe. \u201cDaley is a Stalinist,\u201d Coe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to win; he has to mentally destroy his opponent.\u201d \u201cStalinist\u201d was one of several adjectives used to describe Thompson\u2019s drive and character. While he was a darling to sections of Britain\u2019s youth who serially ravaged joysticks while playing his eponymous computer game and the wider public who admired his charisma, self-belief and ribald maverick irreverence, to many members of the athletics press corps he was \u201carrogant\u201d, \u201csarcastic\u201d, \u201cimpertinent\u201d, \u201csolitary\u201d and in the words of one famous analysis \u201cobjectionable, charmless and rude\u201d. The charge sheet, to some of those who covered the sport, was long \u2013 when he won gold at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton he refused to attend the traditional winners\u2019 press conference, preferring to have dinner with his \u201cauntie\u201d Doreen Rayment, a family friend who had been his landlady, guardian, chauffeur and sponsor since his mother had told him four years earlier to find employment or leave home. In 1982, the year he broke the world record twice and was European and Commonwealth champion, he was castigated for refusing to carry the England team\u2019s flag at the opening ceremony in Brisbane. There were rumours, too, that he occasionally told autograph hunters to get stuffed if he was preoccupied with training. When he won the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year award at the end of that year and was given the trophy by Sir Garfield Sobers, he turned up in his usual tracksuit and said \u201cI feel like shit\u201d when he began his acceptance speech. Twenty years later no one would have been shocked but in 1982, swearing on prime time Sunday night television, particularly on a programme as prim as the Sports Personality of the Year, was genuinely incendiary. But if his behaviour that night was seen as boorish and contemptuous, it was relatively piddling compared with the outrage he caused after winning his second Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles in 1984 would provoke. Thompson\u2019s defence of his stance, the lack of civility to the press, is that he could not be bothered with them because they did not really understand the decathlon. No Briton had ever won a medal in it since the modern decathlon had been inaugurated at the 1912 Olympics until Thompson won gold at Moscow in 1980. In 1964 Great Britain did not send an athlete to Tokyo to compete in the discipline and in 1972 its best-placed competitor, Barry King, finished 15th. In 1976 in Montreal, Thompson, on the day of his 18th birthday, finished 18th but the United States\u2019 Bruce Jenner, who broke the world record and won gold at the Games, had seen enough in the Englishman to anoint him as his most likely successor. As a gesture of handing on the baton, Jenner took Thompson home with him to California for three weeks after the Games and told him of his potential for greatness. The build-up to the Moscow Games was overshadowed by the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan which began on New Year\u2019s Day 1980. The US president, Jimmy Carter, announced that athletes from his country would boycott the Olympics unless the USSR withdrew its troops by 20 February and, when the deadline passed without compliance, West Germany also refused to send a team. Despite the urging of the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, that Britain should join its allies the British Olympic Association ignored her wishes. It relied instead on tokenistic opposition to the invasion \u2013 its athletes did not attend the opening ceremony and winners were feted by the Olympic flag and anthem instead of the Union Flag and God Save the Queen. The West German boycott deprived the decathlon of Guido Kratschmer\u2019s participation. Kratschmer was the current world record holder, having overhauled Thompson\u2019s mark in 1980, and the silver medallist at Montreal. Asked before the Games whether the West German\u2019s absence demeaned the competition, Thompson was defiant. \u201cAthletes are not bothered about where their rivals come from or whether they read Das Kapital in bed,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cEverybody knows the dates and the Olympic champion is the best there at that time. It\u2019s no good being 8,000 miles away and saying: \u2018I would have won if I\u2019d been there.\u2019 Nobody remembers who wasn\u2019t there \u2013 only who won. He\u2019s the champion and that\u2019s all history will be concerned about.\u201d The scheduling of events in the two-day decathlon played to Thompson\u2019s strengths. The first two, the 100m and long jump, were his best and day one continued with the shot, high jump and 400m. While throwing was his weakest suit, having four disciplines in which he was so adept on the first day habitually allowed him to build a significant lead that would stack up the pressure on the chasing pack. On 25 July 1980 in the Lenin Stadium, Thompson\u2019s 10.62sec for the 100m and 8m in the long jump gave him 2,000 points from two events and a huge lead. He then managed 15.18m in the shot, a poor 2.08m in the high jump when his personal best at that point had been 2.15m, and 48.01sec in the 400m to leave him with a midway total of 4,532 points, 254 points in front of the Soviet Union\u2019s Yuri Kutsenko. It also put him ahead of his first day score when he broke the world record in May that year in G\u00f6tzis. The first day had been cold, the second colder still and damp which ruined his chances of finding the explosive speed required for the hurdles and keeping him on course for the world record. He ran 14.47sec and after the discus led by 198 points. The pole vault and javelin cemented his lead and he jogged the 1,500m as dark descended on Moscow in 4min 49sec. The crowd in the stadium, which had saved their most enthusiastic applause for Soviet bloc athletes rather than their Western counterparts, made an exception for Thompson and favoured him with a standing ovation. When he came out to receive his medal, he leapt up to click his heels and, while the Olympic anthem was playing after he was given gold, he conducted the small British contingent of spectators through the National Anthem that officially had been denied him by Mrs Thatcher\u2019s sanction. It was after 2am by the time he returned to the village following the mandatory drugs test and, finding all his team-mates had turned in, went to bed. \u201cI can celebrate for the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cRight then after a competition, I\u2019m too tired to bother. Two days later I feel really good about it but by then I have it in perspective. I know it\u2019s not the greatest thing that\u2019s ever going to happen to me. If it were, you\u2019d never be able to pick yourself up and do it all over again next year.\u201d Doing it all over again was precisely what he accomplished over the next four years and when he arrived in Los Angeles he was the Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic champion. But, although he had been unbeaten in competition for six years and had twice posted world records since Moscow, West Germany\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Hingsen had set new benchmarks in 1983 and 1984. Hingsen, at 6ft 7in, towered over Thompson but in six meetings before the LA Olympics Thompson had always prevailed regardless of Hingsen\u2019s world records. Thompson used the West German and his compatriot Siggi Wentz as his inspiration whenever training proved gruelling. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hurting bad,\u201d he said, \u201cI tell myself it\u2019s all because of the boys in Germany and by the time of the competition all I want to do is take it out on them.\u201d He certainly took it out on them in Los Angeles but had to dig deeper than he ever had before. The temperature on the first day of the decathlon was 29C, 15C higher than the warmest day in Moscow, and the notorious Los Angeles smog descended on the stadium. In the 100m Thompson was drawn with Hingsen and Kratschmer and after a false-start he stormed out of the blocks to win the heat in a personal best 10.44sec which earned him 944 points, 122 more than Hingsen. In the long jump he began with 7.83m, then 7.84m before registering 8.01m with his final jump, another personal best in the decathlon and 21cm further than Hingsen. It would have earned him fifth place in the individual long jump final and extended his lead to 164 points. The tall West German\u2019s forte was in the three throwing events, the hurdles and the high jump where his height gave him a clear advantage but his 15.87m in the shot was below par for him and Thompson again recorded a personal best with 15.72m. After three events and three best ever competition performances Thompson went off to lunch. In the afternoon Hingsen clawed back some ground in the high jump but hurt his knee in taking 77 points out of Thompson\u2019s lead and the Londoner blazed back in the 400m to end the day with a cushion of 114 points over his rival. The following morning Hingsen won the 110m hurdles in 14.29sec but Thompson was only .05sec behind him and looked secure, 108 points ahead with four events to go. The glory of the decathlon, though, is that a lead can disappear at any time: a fall in the hurdles, a false-start disqualification in the sprints, a no-height in the pole vault or, more commonly, an opponent\u2019s huge margin of superiority in a single event can unseat the leader. If Hingsen threw further than Thompson in the discus, the champion\u2019s supremacy after the seventh event would still read four of the disciplines to his principal challenger\u2019s three. But if Hingsen threw significantly further than Thompson he could muster the points to make that immaterial. On his first throw the man in second place threw 49.8m, his longest ever in a decathlon while Thompson could manage only 37.9m. Then Hingsen excelled his ephemeral personal best with his second throw of 50.82m and Thompson struggled to exceed his first throw by centimetres. Hingsen did not make it a hat-trick of PBs so, when Thompson went into the circle for his final attempt, the scores from their second throws gave the West German 886 points and the Englishman 710 which would have made Hingsen the overall leader for the first time and by a potentially decisive 68 points. Thompson muttered to himself as he walked to the circle, swinging his arms to shake away any tension and breathing deeply. When he spins and launches the discus, his technique is hardly textbook, too close to his hips and too far from his shoulders to get the optimum distance. It was a triumph of physical power as well as willpower and, when the discus flew through the air past the 40m mark, the BBC\u2019s commentator Ron Pickering could not contain his excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s a better one, it\u2019s a better one, it\u2019s a better one, it\u2019s a better one,\u201d he screamed, his pitch rising as he reached the end of his sentence much like Barry Davies did with his \u201cInteresting, very interesting\u201d classic. When it landed it had reached 46.56m, another personal best in competition. \u201cIt was the best and worst moment of my life,\u201d Thompson wrote in his autobiography. \u201cFor that one moment I wasn\u2019t interested in winning. Some people shy from the high-pressure moments. It was what I had been looking for, a culmination of all I had trained for. Just to be faced with the situation in an Olympics \u2013 the feeling was incredible. And I\u2019d faced it and overcome the thing I\u2019m least competent in, the discus. I really hit the shit out of that discus.\u201d Instead of trailing he maintained a lead and, though it was down to 34 points, he would restore his comfort zone in the pole vault, clearing 5m to Hingsen\u2019s 4.50m and back-flipping in jubilation on landing after his best effort. The lead was 152 points. During the pole vault Hingsen had been sick and Thompson beat him again in the javelin, Pickering going for an encore with \u201cIt\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not bad\u201d when Thompson\u2019s throw landed on 65.24 metres. After nine events Thompson had essentially won and, though he needed to run the 1,500m in only 4min 34.8sec, 11 sec slower than his personal best, to break the world record he treated it as something of a cakewalk, grinning as he came home in 4min 35sec. \u201cComing down the final straight of that 1,500m,\u201d he said, \u201cit [the world record] was the last thing on my mind.\u201d He added: \u201cAll I was thinking was two down one to go\u201d \u2013 a reference to his ambition of winning three Olympic golds. His performances in the Coliseum over two days were exemplary but what happened during the two hours after his victory was confirmed dominated the coverage. To begin with he whistled the national anthem as the Union Flag was hoisted after he was given his gold medal. Four years earlier he had demonstrated similar insouciance but his conduct in Los Angeles divided opinion between those who thought him cheeky and others who accused him of sacrilege. He had already appeared for the medal ceremony with a slogan on his T-shirt castigating the host broadcaster\u2019s obsession with US athletes but at the winner\u2019s press conference he turned up with a different one which said: \u201cIs the world\u2019s 2nd greatest athlete gay?\u201d Rumours about Carl Lewis\u2019s sexuality had been rife during the Games and Thompson\u2019s dig, playing to the gallery of the US tabloids, was crass and no one bought his excuse: \u201cIn England gay just means happy.\u201d Thompson went on to explain his euphoria to US viewers, saying: \u201cI haven\u2019t been this happy since my granny caught her tit in a mangle.\u201d When it was the turn of the British reporters, he was asked what Princess Anne, who had greeted him on the track after his victory, had said to him. \u201cShe said I\u2019m a damn good looking guy,\u201d Thompson replied. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke,\u201d he added with a wink. He spoke about wanting to have children, which prompted a double question of whether he had anyone in mind to be the babies\u2019 mother and to elaborate on what the Princess had said to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve just mentioned the lady,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the answer to the second question is she said: \u201cI hope they\u2019ll be white.\u2019\u201d The Daily Mirror\u2019s headline the day after called Thompson \u201cChamp Chump\u201d and Frank McGhee, the paper\u2019s veteran \u201cvoice of sport\u201d took the decathlete to task. \u201cOn the victory rostrum the way Thompson whistled where so many others have wept when his anthem was played was at the worst despicable, at best unfunny. There is too much cruelty in his so-called humour. Maybe he can\u2019t be taught how to behave but he needs to be told.\u201d In the Observer, the Melbourne Olympics gold medallist and athletics correspondent, Chris Brasher, said Thompson \u201cspoke to the world with a tongue of a brilliant athlete who sounded like a tinkling cymbal because he has no charity, no kindness, no grace\u201d. Brasher had a valid point and made it well but it should not tarnish Thompson\u2019s golden achievements. He was a complex character, difficult and stubborn as much as he was dedicated and determined. No decathlete had a more finely attuned competitive instinct and in 1984 at Los Angeles when he needed it most he once again proved that he would peak when it counted. He may not have been as warm as he seemed but he was always as good as he looked and no one in 1984 looked better. What the Guardian said Saturday August 11 1984. Daley gold loses some polish, by John Rodda Daley Thompson\u2019s athleticism and competitiveness are unrivalled but when he leaves the arena he runs up a points record in disaster. The British Olympic Association and Buckingham Palace have played down Thompson\u2019s tasteless remarks about the president of the BOA, Princess Anne, made in the press conference after he had won his second Olympic decathlon gold medal. But Thompson, as he did some two years ago when he shocked millions of TV viewers in uttering a four-letter word when accepting a sports award, has smudged his reputation. He has also bewildered many people at the very moment they are extending their admiration and showing wonderment for the dedication and application he brings to his event.   Related: Why Olympians shine under the spotlight    His distaste \u2013 and that is probably a mild word \u2013 for the media partly explains his conduct. He has suffered down the years so much ignorance in the reporting of his event and that distortion undoubtedly has an effect upon him. He is a perfectionist in 10 sporting disciplines and he expects, unrealistically, all those involved, be they officials or part of the media, to attempt to match him. His last lap of the final event, the 1500 metres, showed that the age when sportsmen gave their all for the gold medal are gone. He decided that he did not want to break the world record, which was there for the taking, and the fact that he missed it by just one point was just coincidence. His time of 4min 35sec for the event was 0.1 sec slower than he required, giving a points total of 8,797. The record was set by J\u00fcrgen Hingsen, his West German rival who won the silver medal, in May at Mannheim. Thompson said afterwards that after the pole vault, the eighth event, he decided that he could not achieve his ambition of breaking the record with a score of more than 9,000 points. He won the gold by the considerable margin of 142 points and the record-breaking is left for another time. \u201cI would like all these people to come back and watch me,\u201d he said. It really is but another few steps towards arranging a meeting next year against his Olympic rivals in a permit meeting in the United States \u2013 that way he can ask for participation money. On the two days of his competition here there were more than 300,000 people in the stadium \u2013 how many were there specifically for the decathlon and would go to see him somewhere in California is a commercial calculation which Thompson should leave to someone else. He will earn a lot of money from that event, though soon after he walked into his press conference his commercial value and viability must have been dropping. After two Olympic golds Thompson has lost none of his enthusiasm. He intends to compete in Seoul in 1988 but before then he will be taking a good competitive look at the new rival on the horizon, William Motti, a 20-year-old Frenchman who finished fifth with 8,266 points and who has a lot of raw edges to be worked upon over the next four years. The 203 points between Thompson and the 9,000 mark will come from a 70-metre javelin throw, which he is reaching in training, lopping a lot of seconds off the 1500 metres run \u2013 his best in a decathlon is four minutes 22 seconds \u2013 and getting his high jumping back to 2.15 metres. But in working towards those targets he must take care to preserve the rest. Thompson knows after three Olympic Games and nine years\u2019 experience of the event how to work at that \u2013 but at 25 he still appears unable to handle his responsibilities off the track."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Not only would any self-respecting Bond not go near a ubiquibeer such as Heineken, but they would each favour a fine brew from the homeland: the Connery Bond would go for something dark by Brewdog, like Tokyo; Lazenby Bond would sip a chilled Little Creatures; and Brosnan Bond would knock back a Guinness Special Export.", "&quot;I visited the Ministry of Crab while I was in Sri-Lanka this February,&quot; writes Matthew Boynton from Tokyo."], "tags": ["England in Sri Lanka 2012", "Sri Lanka cricket team", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Over by over reports"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-04T11:38:00Z", "title": "Sri Lanka v England \u2013 day two as it happened | Rob Smyth and Simon Burnton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/04/sri-lanka-england-live-obo", "article": " Preamble Morning. In Peep Show, a favourite phrase of the future Mr Victoria Coren is &quot;I think I know who&apos;s winning&quot;, usually while he has a piece of brown toast or something similarly triumphant. Sometimes, however, it&apos;s nice not to know who&apos;s winning. One of the 174,281 reasons that Test cricket is the greatest sporting format of all is that, even after hours or days of play, we often have no idea who&apos;s winning.  Take this Test match in Colombo. Ordinarily you would say England are on top, with Sri Lanka 238 for six after an engrossing first day. But these are not ordinary circumstances: the pitch is crumbling, and England&apos;s confidence against spin has crumbled. The match is deliciously poised, and will probably be decided by how England bat in their first innings. They need to polish off the Sri Lankan tail with leadpipe cruelty and then set about securing a first-innings lead of around  one  100. That, you don&apos;t need me to tell you, is easier said than done.  Play starts at 5.30am English time.  5.01am Some things are so cliched that they can&apos;t actually happen, right? Well ... This OBO comes to you with a dollop of PTSD. On the way to work, while braving the streets of King&apos;s Cross at around 4.30, your intrepid OBO correspondent was propositioned not once but twice by an eccentric, posh quinquagenarian. She probably wouldn&apos;t be offended if I said she was no Samantha Brick. As I took a detour to the shop for some water, she said &quot;looking for ladies, darling?&quot; While I was tempted to launch into a brusque diatribe about how the increasing misuse of the plural reflects all that is wrong with society in the 21st century, I settled for a simple &quot;no thank you&quot;. Then, as I came back the same way towards work, she said &quot;changed your mind?&quot; The gentlemen was not for turning. He was for running, however, as fast as possible until he got to work and gave the security guard a big hug of relief. The gentlemen thinks he can taste a little sick in his mouth.  91st over: Sri Lanka 238-6 (Mathews 41, Randiv 5) The second new ball is only nine overs old, so England have a chance of running through the lower order. Angelo Mathews is a dangerous player, however, who can slip into one-day mode if necessary. For now he defends an accurate opening over from Jimmy Anderson. Crikey, Sky have just shown some close-ups of the pitch. It doesn&apos;t look good. I haven&apos;t heard such talk of enlarged cracks since they were going through those second-hand records in Ghost World. This could be a beast to bat on by tomorrow, never mind days four and five. England simply must do their work in the first innings.  &quot;I suppose whilst you follow the games down under or on the subcontinent you must only be kept company by workshy expats and the occasional new parent forced to stay awake all night,&quot; says Andrew Jolly. &quot;Any difference in quality between the domestic and international contributions?&quot; Not really. They&apos;re all as bad as each other, honk. The only real difference is the volume of emails.  92nd over: Sri Lanka 243-6 (Mathews 45, Randiv 6) Steven Finn is squirted to third man for a single by Suraj Randiv. Finn is 23 today, and The scoreboard has a big happy birthday message \u2013 to Steven Flinn. Mathews cleaves a wider, shortish delivery through the covers for four later in the over.  93rd over: Sri Lanka 247-6 (Mathews 46, Randiv 9) Randiv is beaten by a beautiful full-length from Anderson that moves away a touch off the seam. Four from the over.  94th over: Sri Lanka 247-6 (Mathews 46, Randiv 9) Mathews is beaten by a delivery from Finn that keeps low. We&apos;ll see more of that as the match progresses, though maybe nothing as amusing as these. England aren&apos;t chasing wickets this morning, instead bowling their usual disciplined fourth-stump line.  95th over: Sri Lanka 247-6 (Mathews 46, Randiv 9) Randiv is a competent lower-order batsman, with a first-class hundred to his name. He defends solidly during a maiden from Anderson.  &quot;At the P Sara Oval since 2002: average first innings score: 340, average first innings Run Rate: 3.56,&quot; says Andrew Jolly. &quot;So on that basis, you could probably argue that England have done a pretty good job and deserve to be in front. Ahhh, I love explaining the &apos;who&apos;s in front in a Test match conundrum&apos; to North Americans/new girlfriends.&quot;  96th over: Sri Lanka 248-6 (Mathews 47, Randiv 9) It&apos;s a bit of a blinking contest at the moment. England, Finn in particular, are slipping in the occasional short ball to complement the line-and-length stuff. Randiv, who has taken most of the strike this morning, is showing good awareness of his off stump and leaving whenever possible. One from the over.  &quot;Isn&apos;t there a bit of precedent for bowlers celebrating their birthdays with wickets - or even a hat trick?&quot; says Sara Torvalds. &quot;Here&apos;s hoping Finn gets a couple early and doesn&apos;t need to bat today (or tomorrow)!&quot; That roguish bundle of unfettered erotica, Peter Siddle, took an Ashes hat-trick on his birthday.  97th over: Sri Lanka 254-6 (Mathews 53, Randiv 9) Mathews dumps a short ball from Anderson through midwicket for four to bring up a mature half-century from 142 balls. Well played. &quot;A few years ago, all the talk was of spinning the ball hard to get turn, drift and dip,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;This winter, England have been undone by rollers rather than spinners, even Saeed Ajmal turning very few sharply. Ah, DRS you will say, but it can&apos;t just be that can it? Maybe there&apos;s just too much anxiety to get on with things and not enough respect for the value of blocking and batting time.&quot; Batting time is a bit of a dying art, for sure. It&apos;d be interesting to see the average length of a top-six batsman&apos;s innings for each of the last few decades.  98th over: Sri Lanka 256-6 (Mathews 53, Randiv 11) Sri Lanka have played really well thus far, with a lot of discipline and common sense. They are batting time, basically. They know that as the ball gets older batting will get easier, and if they get past 300 they will be winning. Possibly. &quot;Am I alone in detecting a distinct obsession with erotic themes today?&quot; says Nick Masters. &quot;The reverse-grab-a-granny was worrying enough \u2013 but calling Peter Siddle a &apos;roguish bundle of unfettered erotica&apos; suggests strongly that you&apos;ve been at the absinthe again. Is watching England&apos;s self-destruction the cause of this sad, priapic frenzy? Have you considered seeking professional help?&quot; It&apos;s the PTSD. What appears on the page is quite beyond my control.  99th over: Sri Lanka 256-6 (Mathews 53, Randiv 11) A surprise yorker from Anderson is dug out well by Mathews. A maiden. We&apos;ve had 18 runs from nine overs this morning.  100th over: Sri Lanka 257-6 (Mathews 53, Randiv 12) Swann comes on for Finn. Randiv, beaten in the flight, screws a drive in the air but wide of Swann. Then he misses a sweep at a big-spinning delivery, prompting a loud LBW appeal. He was outside the line of off stump. An excellent start from Swann.  101st over: Sri Lanka 257-6 (Mathews 53, Randiv 12) A double change, with Bresnan coming on for Anderson. The ball has done very little for the seamers this morning, and it does the cube root of eff all in that over. A maiden.  WICKET! Sri Lanka 258-7 (Randiv c Pietersen b Swann 12) This is an excellent catch from Kevin Pietersen, running back from deep mid on. Randiv, who had been so disciplined all morning, gave Swann the charge and hammered him down the ground. He didn&apos;t get enough on it and Pietersen, running back, took a splendid leaping catch with both hands. He was knocked off his feet in the process of taking the catch but held on when he hit the floor.  102nd over: Sri Lanka 258-7 (Mathews 54, Prasad 0) &quot;So then, Casanova Smyth \u2013 Sri Lanka to make 380, England to make 170 and 155 before Strauss accidentally mysteriously falls on a pair of Ian Bell&apos;s nail-clippers with Andy Flower nowhere in the vicinity,&quot; says a man called Prince Humperdinck. &quot;A reasonable prediction, you think?&quot; Yeah, you have to feel England are in a bit of trouble here. The Strauss business is surely a non-story, though. I&apos;d be astonished if he wasn&apos;t England captain at the start of the summer. If the summer goes badly, he might follow Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan by resigning during a home series against South Africa, but that&apos;s a long way down the line.  103rd over: Sri Lanka 261-7 (Mathews 57, Prasad 0) Mathews pushes Bresnan nicely down the ground for a couple. The new Prasad, like Randiv before him, has a first-class century to his name.  WICKET! Sri Lanka 261-8 (Mathews c Strauss b Swann 57) This is a big wicket for England, and a lovely piece of bowling from Graeme Swann. Angelo Mathews, beaten in the flight, checked his shot and chipped the ball straight to Andrew Strauss at short midwicket.  104th over: Sri Lanka 261-8 (Prasad 0, Herath 0) Here&apos;s an interesting(ish) stat. Before that breakthrough, Sri Lanka were averaging over 30 for the last four wickets in this series. The two other occasions on which a team has done that against England in the last nine years were ... Sri Lanka in 2003-04 and 2007-08. So this clearly isn&apos;t the easiest part of the world in which to blow away the tail. Probably because every item of clothing is glued to your person and your eyes are stinging with sweat. Since you asked, England&apos;s worst ever series in terms of cleaning up the tail was \u2013 of course \u2013 the 1989 Ashes. Geoff Bloody Lawson.  105th over: Sri Lanka 263-8 (Prasad 2, Herath 0) &quot;Two forcing shots in an hour and both brought wickets,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;I hope England&apos;s batsmen took note.&quot;  106th over: Sri Lanka 264-8 (Prasad 2, Herath 1) Herath likes to give it some humpty with the bat. But not yet, not just yet. This is an important little spell. The difference between 265 and 300 is, well, 35 runs. But it feels bigger than that. Thirty-five runs is a lot in a low-scoring affair. &quot;A recent argument with the lawnmower has resulted in a few days&apos; recuperation in Truro hospital and an opportunity to improve my left-handed texting skills,&quot; says James Brittain-Long. &quot;The OBO providing excellent company as always but please, no more talk of erotica. I&apos;m as broadminded as the next OBOer but early morning in the Trauma ward is hardly the time or place for that sort of talk.&quot; Don&apos;t worry. I think I&apos;ve recovered now that I can see daylight through the windows. It&apos;s the night that scares me, always the night. I&apos;m already dreading the walk to work tomorrow. What if she sees me again? She&apos;ll think I&apos;m deliberately playing hard-to-get! I was just walking to work, officer ...  107th over: Sri Lanka 269-8 (Prasad 6, Herath 2) Prasad steers a wider delivery from Bresnan to third man for four.  108th over: Sri Lanka 269-8 (Prasad 6, Herath 2) A maiden from Swann to the hitherto strokeless Herath. In other news, how do you play this, then? You have to love Richie Benaud&apos;s commentary. &quot;Useful ...&quot;  WICKET! Sri Lanka 270-9 (Herath c Prior b Bresnan 2) Prasad hooks Bresnan for a single. &quot;One bouncer for the over signalled,&quot; says Mike Atherton on Sky, but with a strange foreboding in his voice, the sort of tone that would usually accompany a phrase like &quot;Freddy Krueger&apos;s through the front door, and I don&apos;t think he&apos;s come to see if we can lend him some sugar.&quot;  Anyway, that single brings Herath on strike, and he falls from the last ball of the over. After all those diligent blocks, he can resist his basic instict no longer and snicks a disgusting roundhouse mow through to Matt Prior.  109th over: Sri Lanka 270-9 (Prasad 7, Lakmal 0) Tim Bresnan has, very quietly, picked up two for 43 from 20 overs.  110th over: Sri Lanka 271-9 (Prasad 8, Lakmal 0) England have a shout for caught behind turned down when Prasad pushes outside off stump at a quicker one from Swann. Swann, who didn&apos;t appeal originally, asks Prior if Prasad hit it. &quot;Yes,&quot; says Prior, &quot;but it won&apos;t show up.&quot; So England decide not to review the decision. They should have done, however, because replays did show a slight deviation. I&apos;m 98.72 per cent certain that would have been overturned by the third umpire. Of course, normally you wouldn&apos;t review caught behinds if there&apos;s no Hotspot because you risk losing a review, but with Sri Lanka nine down they should probably have gone for it. Let&apos;s hope that doesn&apos;t cost them 417 runs.  111th over: Sri Lanka 275-9 (Prasad 12, Lakmal 0) Prasad tries to hook a bouncer from Bresnan, but it&apos;s too high and too wide for him to control the stroke and he ends up dragging it just wide of leg stump. The next ball is punched gloriously through extra cover for four. &quot;Off to Cyprus for a week today which on the face of it seems great but I am concerned about missing the cricket,&quot; says Gary Stanley. &quot;Anyone know of a venue near Pissouri where I can watch it/tap into wifi?&quot;  WICKET! Sri Lanka 275 all out (Lakmal b Swann 0) Swann cleans up the No11 Lakmal with a beauty that rips through the gate to hit the stumps. He has taken three for four this morning. England showed impressive patience after not taking early wickets, and they will be pretty pleased to dismiss Sri Lanka for 275 \u2013 especially as they were 216 for four at one stage yesterday. The scorecard is very similar, in fact, to the first innings of the second Test between these sides 11 years ago. England took a first-innings lead of 90 in that match. They&apos;d certainly take that again now. I still think Sri Lanka are slightly on top.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: England 4-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 4, Cook 0) The hard yards start here for England. Suranga Lakmal begins the innings to Andrew Strauss, with a short midwicket and another man a couple of yards to his left. Strauss steers an edge to third man for four to get off the mark.  &quot;This next three hours is the biggest test of England&apos;s character since the second innings at Brisbane in 2010,&quot; says Phil White. &quot;It will be a great example of how this format tests the mind like no other.&quot; Yep. Whatever they do over the next few hours, England will certainly show us the life of the mind.  2nd over: England 7-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 4, Cook 3) A bit of an escape for Cook, who edges Prasad just short of Sangakkara at first slip. England really can&apos;t afford to lose wickets against the new ball; they need all 10 in hand for when the spinners come on. Six minutes to lunch.  3rd over: England 11-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 4, Cook 7) Lakmal switches around the wicket to Cook, so as to make him play more often. The risk is that if you&apos;re too straight Cook can work you through midwicket for four. As he does from the last ball of the over. &quot;You talk about Bresnan quietly picking up two for 43 in this match,&quot; says Chris Drew, &quot;but I&apos;ve just checked his stats, and he&apos;s currently averaging overall 23.51 for bowling, and 45.42 for batting. That, in the words of of Richie Benaud, is useful\u2026&quot;  4th over: England 11-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 4, Cook 7) Strauss tries to cut a delivery from Prasad that cramps him for room and flies just wide of leg stump. That was desperately close, but Strauss lives to fight another session. That&apos;s lunch. England have had a decent morning, after wrapping up Sri Lanka&apos;s first innings for 275, but they will have to bat really well to get the big first-innings lead that might be necessary on this pitch. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  LUNCH  A couple of lunchtime links 1. IPL fantasy cricket F.U.N. 2. Devon Malcolm bowling like the wind (thanks to Phil Rhodes for this).  Work Productivity&apos;s Andrew Jolly has been busy, working out the average length (in minutes) of a top-six batsman&apos;s innings by decade. Interesting stuff; the drop off is not as great as we might have expected.  1910 41.551920 59.881930 66.521940 77.291950 68.621960 91.061970 101.581980 110.831990 114.202000 113.812010 109.10   5th over: England 17-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 4, Cook 13) Lakmal resumes after lunch to Cook, who forces two through the covers and times four more off the pads. &quot;Just go disguised as a streetwalker yourself,&quot; says Mike Selvey of, er, propositiongate. &quot;She&apos;ll leave you alone. Or she might beat you up for stealing her pitch. Perhaps best not then.&quot; She couldn&apos;t beat me up, Selve; she was  older than you  in her fifties at least.  6th over: England 21-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 8, Cook 13) Strauss drives Prasad very nicely down the ground for four. This has been a pretty innocuous opening spell from Prasad, who isn&apos;t making Strauss play nearly enough. No, I won&apos;t accept any blame if he now takes nine for 12. &quot;I know you asked about batting time, but isn&apos;t it also about batting deliveries (that isn&apos;t a phrase is it?),&quot; says Tim Woollias. &quot;Batting an hour when over rates were a lot higher would mean facing (and defending) more deliveries.&quot; It is indeed, but let&apos;s not be too picky given all the diligent work Andrew has done on his company&apos;s time.  7th over: England 24-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 10, Cook 14) As usual, England&apos;s openers are building their innings on a need-to-play basis. That leads to Lakmal switching around the wicket to Strauss, who squeezes a couple to third man. It&apos;s a good start, this, but then the spinners aren&apos;t bowling. &quot;When I read the last two sentences of Over 104, my face twitched involuntarily,&quot; says Steve Hudson. &quot;After 23 years, for god&apos;s sake.&quot;  8th over: England 24-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 10, Cook 14) Cook continues to leave and block Prasad. A maiden. Not much is happening, which suits England just fine. You could argue that the openers should go after the new ball, but Strauss isn&apos;t in good enough form and it&apos;s not really in Cook&apos;s nature. &quot;Anyone else get really annoyed by people adding &apos;-gate&apos; onto the end of a word when describing a &apos;scandal&apos;?&quot; says Matt Turland. &quot;It&apos;s wrong on so many levels because it&apos;s based on that Watergate nonsense but that was the name of the complex. If we applied common wording to it, it would be referred to as Watergategate. Or is it just me?&quot; It&apos;s not just you. We&apos;re in this together, Matt; together forever. It does irk me inordinately, especially when applied to something minor. Snickersgate. Jengagate. Fezgate. Bananaramagate.  9th over: England 26-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 11, Cook 15) Now the game really begins. Rangana Herath is coming on to replace Lakmal. Spin bowlers average 15.86 runs per wicket against England in Tests in 2012; last year that figures was 82.73. That&apos;s staggering. Cook gets a leading edge to a quicker ball, but it&apos;s all along the ground and safe. Two from the over. &quot;Some 11 years ago I was sitting on a bench waiting for a girlfriend in Jerusalem&apos;s Independence garden,&quot; says Phil Podolsky. &quot;It was right by her school. It was also, I learned later, the hotbed of Jerusalem&apos;s gay/stray scene \u2013 the epitome of everything that&apos;s wrong with a city in the grip of religious repression. Anyhow, I was propositioned by a few elderly gentlemen, one of whom took particular umbrage to my rejection as he clearly refused to believe that the volume of Nabokov I was trying to read was anything more than a front for cruising for oldsters. I was equal parts grossed out and offended in the name of culture.&quot;  10th over: England 26-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 11, Cook 15) Cook digs out an attempted yorker from Prasad, the only vaguely memorable incident in another maiden. &quot;The interesting stat for me in the batting times is for the 1930s,&quot; says Steve Hudson. &quot;The popular conception of flat tracks, popgun bowling and fat batting averages in timeless Tests seems to be misguided.&quot;  11th over: England 27-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 12, Cook 15) Herath has a slip and short leg for Strauss, and has a biggish LBW appeal when Strauss hides his bat behind his pad. He was well wide of off stump, however, and I don&apos;t think it turned nearly enough. &quot;Multi-storey car-park gate \u2013 it&apos;s wrong on so many levels,&quot; says David Vaudin, who is indeed here all week.  12th over: England 33-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 13, Cook 20) Cook swivel pulls Prasad for a couple and then cuts two more through the covers. If England get bowled out by Dhammika Prasad we&apos;ll need to have words, because he does look innocuous. &quot;Completely with you on the whole -gate thing,&quot; says Dennis Johns. &quot;It&apos;s pretty well covered here.&quot;  13th over: England 34-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 13, Cook 21) Cook is dropped at short leg! It was almost another brilliant catch from Thirimanne, who was brilliant in that position at Galle. Cook pushed Herath firmly off the pad towards Thirimanne, who got both hands under the ball, barely inches from the ground, but couldn&apos;t quite hang on. Had he taken that catch it would have gone to the third umpire to see whether the ball carried; I suspect it did, although the Sky commentators reckon it wouldn&apos;t have been given out by the third umpire. All of that is what the point is not; the point&apos;s that he dropped it anyway. &quot;The practice of adding &apos;gate&apos; to everything began with William Safire \u2013 one Nixon&apos;s speechwriters, who also worked as a journalist,&quot; says Martin Lloyd. &quot;Byadding the gate suffix to minor scandals he aimed both to make them look bigger than they were, and diminish his former boss&apos;s crimes in comparison. By now it&apos;s so common there&apos;s probably folk who think Watergate was to do with a rogue bottle of Evian in the White House.&quot;  14th over: England 36-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 14, Cook 22) It&apos;ll be spin from both ends, with Tillakaratne Dilshan coming on. Presumably that&apos;s because Suraj Randiv does not like bowling with the newish ball. Cook jams his bat down on a delivery that keeps low. Two from the over. The England balcony \u2013 Pietersen, Trott, Prior, Gooch and Flower \u2013 are gathered around a screen, having a good giggle at something. &quot;I&apos;m seriously considering committing a terrible scandal in Harrogate just to perplex headline writers,&quot; says Nick Brown.  15th over: England 41-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 19, Cook 22) Strauss edges Herath wide of slip for four and then survives a big shout for LBW. He was miles outside the line, and Jayawardene is far too cool-headed to waste a review on that.  &quot;I was propositioned once near the aptly named Hope Street in Liverpool,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;I was at art college and had been sent into the streets to draw the backs of houses, which is exactly what I told her when she asked if I was looking for business.&quot;  16th over: England 41-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 19, Cook 22) A maiden from Dilshan to Strauss. It&apos;s going pretty well for England at the moment. &quot;BLF researchers have found a picture of Geoffrey Boycott with a beard,&quot; says Keith Flett. &quot;Unfortunately the context means that Geoffrey has now been banned for life from the Beard Liberation Front in retrospect.&quot;  17th over: England 45-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 22, Cook 23) Herath has moved around the wicket now. Not much is happening for him though. The Sky commentators, particularly Tony Greig and Sir Ian Botham, think Randiv will be the big threat on this pitch.  18th over: England 46-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 23, Cook 23) In other news, my colleague Philip Cornwall points out that even our style ghttp://www.espncricinfo.com/sri-lanka-v-england-2012/engine/current/match/521226.htmluide is onside when it comes to -gate issues. Click here and search for &apos;gategate&apos;.  19th over: England 48-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 24, Cook 24) Strauss edges Herath a fraction short of Jayawardene at slip. It was a good delivery, angled across Strauss and then straightening a touch to find the edge of his defensive push, and for a split second Herath thought he had his man. Herath looks a bit more dangerous from around the wicket because he can go past the edge on either side of the bat. A single from Cook means that this now equals England&apos;s highest opening partnership of the winter.  20th over: England 49-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 24, Cook 25) It&apos;s time for Suraj Randiv. He is bowling from a different end to Graeme Swann, which is a surprise in terms of the breeze, it says here. He also has a slip and short leg to Cook, and aborts consecutive deliveries \u2013 the second after accidentally hitting the umpire with his shoulder. It was a gentle collision, not a full Colin Croft. &quot;Fezgate. Bananaramagate,&quot; says Mick James. &quot;Having googled both of these, finding out that you made them up has sent me into a depression that may last all morning.&quot;  21st over: England 51-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 24, Cook 27) Cook works Herath for a couple to bring up England&apos;s first half-century opening partnership of the winter. Then he checks a drive not far short of the bowler. Batting isn&apos;t easy, by any means, but England look relatively comfortable. &quot;I reckon Beefy and Greigy are reading my tweets then!&quot; says Mike Selvey of the suggestion that Randiv will the dangerman. &quot;Can I have a sort of lifetime achievement award from Keith Flett for my 1978 effort seen in my avatar?&quot; This, you will surely agree, is a proper beard.  22nd over: England 53-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 25, Cook 28) Randiv beats Cook with a beauty that turns sharply from off stump. That&apos;s the most dangerously delivery we&apos;ve seen in this innings. Two from the over. &quot;Seeing as Nick Brown mentions Harrogate, about a quarter of a century ago there actually was a scandal in my old trade union involving nomination papers, from a branch in Harrogate, on which Tippex miraculously and controversially appeared, erasing a nominee&apos;s name,&quot; says Justin Horton. &quot;For some reason people (myself apart) didn&apos;t refer to it as Harrogategate, preferring Tippexgate. (Or it might have been some generic term for correction fluid, with -gate as a suffix. But not the obvious and amusing choice.)&quot;  23rd over: England 57-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 28, Cook 29) I don&apos;t think England have played a single sweep shot yet, which is interesting and more than a little surprising. Herath goes back over the wicket and is driven through extra cover for a couple by Strauss. So he goes back around the wicket. Strauss has got a start, although, as Nick Knight points out on Sky, that hasn&apos;t been a problem this winter. He has been getting a lot of nothing scores, twenties and thirties. &quot;Assuming that Dilshan and Sangakkara get a few next time round, England may need to make 550 runs to win this match \u2013 so what&apos;s a safe split between the innings?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;I&apos;m thinking 500 and 50 but maybe that&apos;s going too far. On a crumbling fifth-day pitch under pressure I&apos;m not sure England would get 50.&quot; Honk!  24th over: England 57-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 28, Cook 29) A maiden from Randiv to Strauss. &quot;How appropriate,&quot; says Finbar Anslow, &quot;that England&apos;s first half-century opening partnership of the winter should happen in the spring.&quot;  25th over: England 62-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 28, Cook 34) A rare boundary for England, with Cook pulling Herath round the corner and through the boundary rider Prasad. That was a shoddy bit of fielding. &quot;Words cannot express my love for the Guardian style guide (or should that be the Guardian Style Guide?),&quot; says George Young. &quot;I love the superbly supercilious tone, most likely because it&apos;s a tone I&apos;d like to employ regarding matters of grammar but feel unable to because of stupid old social etiquette.&quot; You should see the looks you get if you don&apos;t put the umlaut in H\u00e4agen-Dazs.  26th over: England 62-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 28, Cook 34) This is boring cricket in terms of boundaries (six) and wickets (none), but it&apos;s a fascinating battle of wills even before you consider the Strauss sub-plot. A maiden from Randiv to Cook, who has taken the bulk of the strike (61 per cent) and looks very solid.  27th over: England 63-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 29, Cook 34) Herath has a biggish appeal for LBW against Strauss turned down by Asad Rauf. He certainly got it to straighten, but there was plenty of doubt over height so Sri Lanka decide not to review. Hawkeye showed it would have hit the top of the leg bail, so the original decision would have stood anyway. A good over from Herath.  28th over: England 66-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 32, Cook 34) Suranga Lakmal replaces Randiv, who may switch ends at some stage. The first ball is poor: full, on the pads and clipped for two by Strauss. England are getting them in dribs and drabs, and they can keep doing that for the next two days for all we care. &quot;Ah!&quot; begins Dave Weston, and there are plenty more exclamation marks where that came from. &quot;What a marvellous winter of English cricket it has been! Such a magnificent crumbling of a false dawn! Our position as No1 Test side lasted all of five minutes. All that big talk about consolidating as the No1 team. Such hubris! For all the kids who have grown up in the noughties with England on a roll (mostly, sometimes) welcome to the English winter! Crap freezing sleet and grey misery compounded by our boys getting bamboozled by second-rate spinners in glorious weather. This is what it means to be English! I&apos;m welling up!&quot;  29th over: England 68-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 33, Cook 35) Jayawardene has three men in close on the leg side for when Herath is bowling around the wicket: short leg, short midwicket and short mid on. Strauss works a single round the corner, and Cook does the same. &quot;Best point out to Dave Weston that position as No1 still pertains at present and will continue to do so if they win this match,&quot; says Mike Selvey.  30th over: England 68-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 33, Cook 35) Lakmal beats Cook with a fine delivery. It was fuller and slightly wider, luring Cook into the drive before snaking past the edge. This is slow going but extremely interesting. No matter how well it is going for England, the circumstances of this particular innings mean it will always be as precarious as a Jenga tower; Strauss and Cook know the job isn&apos;t even a quarter done. &quot;Vaguely on the theme of suffixes, anyone else find themselves unable to think the name &apos;Tillakaratne Dilshan&apos; without following it up with &apos;big banana feet&apos;?&quot; says Richard Marsden. &quot;No? Just me then? Ok, as you were.&quot; Tragically enough, every time I hear Stephane Sessegnon&apos;s name, I automatically think &apos;Sessegnon, dead and gone&apos;.  31st over: England 72-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 37, Cook 35) An escape for Strauss, who flicks Herath through the hands of Thirimanne at short leg. It was technically a dropped catch; as always with those, they either stick or don&apos;t. &quot;Having just consulted the dictionary to check the existence of the word grindy and having found it absent I would like to announce its immediate coinage,&quot; says Alex Campbell. &quot;I have submitted the following definition to the OED:  adj. Cook-like, 34 - 101 - 3 - 0 - 33.66.&quot; So this is what R Kelly was on about.  32nd over: England 73-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 37, Cook 36) England are 15 minutes away from surviving the session unscathed. Has that happened this winter? I suppose Cook and Trott must have batted through a session during the second Test against Pakistan. &quot;I was horrified to read a (hopefully April Fool&apos;s day) report that Heineken have secured a product placement deal in the next Bond film,&quot; says Tom Van der Gucht. &quot;Now, I&apos;d never had Bond down as a lager drinker; however if he was to stray from the hard spirits and champers I&apos;d like to think he&apos;d aim for something with a bit more \u00e9lan, sophistication and flavour. Maybe a Delirium Tremens, Sierra nevada Torpedo IPA or a Jaipur IPA, but certainly not a fizzy can of whiz that would be more at home in a frat house.&quot; The new Heineken is fairly nice, no? One of the few ubiquibeers that is actually drinkable. That said, you are right; Bond wouldn&apos;t drink it. Maybe he&apos;d drink Kwak from the usual glass. Also, in defence of Heineken (who aren&apos;t paying for this free advertising, although they can if they like. A crate? A can? A drop?)\u00a0the choice of music for their new advert is impeccable. It&apos;s the song from Ghost World!  33rd over: England 74-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 37, Cook 37) Randiv has switched ends as expected, so Herath takes a break after a spell of 12-0-33-0. Cook works a single to leg. This is solid stuff from England, the kind of clinical accumulation that these two used to do so well before England decided to experiment with their levels of competence for a bit. &quot;I can&apos;t think of the name Gordon Brown without adding &apos;texture like sun&apos; to the tune of the Stranglers classic Golden Brown,&quot; says Steven Bedwell.  34th over: England 77-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 37, Cook 39) Lakmal bowls the first no-ball of the game, which is also the first extra of the innings. Cook then works a couple off his pads through square leg. England are getting there, slowly but (thankfully) surely. &quot;I hope you are not prostituting yourself out to Heineken after all our friends at Adnams have done for you,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;That would be too fickle.&quot; Ah yes, Adnams. You must be referring to that gin from Southwold brewers Adnams, bottled at a chunky 48%. It&apos;s a traditional juniper-led gin with a nice heavy palate and a great kick.  35th over: England 80-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 39, Cook 40) Look at England, stockpiling runs like it&apos;s the most normal thing in the world. There are three singles in that Randiv over. Despite Cook&apos;s best efforts, we&apos;ll have time for one more over before tea. &quot;My son and I sing &apos;angry Jayaram&apos; to the tune of &apos;Crazy Horses&apos; by the Osmonds to my girlfriend,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;She&apos;s often angry and her surname is Jayaram. In case you were wondering.&quot; I sure won&apos;t die wondering now.&quot;  36th over: England 83-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 42, Cook 40) Strauss pings Lakmal off the pads for three to conclude an excellent session for England. It&apos;s been somnolent stuff, and there is still much to do, but they at least have a platform from which they might build a matchwinning lead. Simon Burnton will be with you for the evening session; you can email him at simon.burnton@theguardian.com. I&apos;ll leave you with this from Philippa Conroy. &quot;Not only would any self-respecting Bond not go near a ubiquibeer such as Heineken, but they would each favour a fine brew from the homeland: the Connery Bond would go for something dark by Brewdog, like Tokyo; Lazenby Bond would sip a chilled Little Creatures; and Brosnan Bond would knock back a Guinness Special Export. Not sure about the English though.&quot;  TEA  37th over: England 85-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 43, Cook 41) Randiv, whose first six overs went for six runs, gets the final session under way, and England let loose, compiling two singles. I&apos;m sorry to change the subject (slightly) from beer, but I&apos;ve been reading this morning about the Colombo seafood restaurant Ministry of Crab, co-owned by Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, which opened a few months ago. &quot;This is the realisation of my dream to be part of a culinary experience that I hope will enthral your taste buds,&quot; says Sangakkara. I like the name, even if it&apos;s illegal. You can watch a rather lengthy and noisy report from its gala opening here. I wonder if Botham and Willis make a wine that&apos;ll match their spice-n-seafood-focused menu? Are there any other cricketing caterers?  38th over: England 85-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 43, Cook 41) A maiden from Lakmal. This is already England&apos;s second-best partnership of the winter, after the Trott/Cook 139 in Abu Dhabi. Someone has come on to hit the ground with a hammer.  39th over: England 86-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 44, Cook 41) The man with a hammer spent a couple of minutes pounding a foothole until it agreed to go away. It was a charmingly unsubtle approach to dealing with the problem, which hopefully hasn&apos;t caused the pitch much additional damage. &quot;33rd over before an extra was scored (according to your text commentary)?&quot; exclaims David James (not that one, I assume). &quot;A record? Must be surely.&quot; I&apos;ve no idea, but there have only been five in this Test so far, so they&apos;re coming at a rate of approximately one every 30 overs \u2013 it&apos;s not entirely out of keeping.  40th over: England 89-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 47, Cook 41) Strauss&apos;s pull earns three runs. Charlie Jeffery suggests Chris Old, who runs a fish and chip shop in Cornwall. &quot;The key to the fish is getting the batter right, making sure it&apos;s not too thick,&quot; he told The Observer in 2008. &quot;You don&apos;t want a soggy dough, it&apos;s got to be nice and crispy.&quot; He&apos;s right, you know.  41st over: England 91-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 48, Cook 42) Randiv continues, and though there is some movement for him, neither batsman appears even remotely concerned about it. &quot;I visited the Ministry of Crab while I was in Sri-Lanka this February,&quot; writes Matthew Boynton from Tokyo. &quot;Didn&apos;t realise it was owned by those two fine batsmen though. The culinary highlight of the trip though was to the cafe in Colombo where Duran-Duran filmed Hungry Like the Wolf, and where I ate a bacon and egg pasty.&quot; Oh yes, Duran Duran&apos;s seminal Sri Lanka Video period. Also included Save a Prayer, I believe. Aren&apos;t there \u2013 he wrote, desperately shoehorning things back on topic \u2013 some scenes of beach cricket in that one?  42nd over: England 91-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 48, Cook 42) Prasad replaces Lakmal and grabs his fourth maiden of the innings (out of seven overs). &quot;A list off the top of my head of cricketers who I imagine to be heavily involved in catering: Arjuna Ranatunga, Inzy, Ian Blackwell, Ian Austin, Darren Lehmann, Dwayne Leverock, Mike Gatting, Samit Patel,&quot; suggests Elliot Carr-Barnsley. I meant cricketers who run catering establishments, not those who bankroll them. And there&apos;s no place on the OBO for that kind of lazy mockery based on a chap&apos;s physical appearance, is there. Oh, there is?  43rd over: England 95-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 50, Cook 44) A half-century for Strauss earns him a standing ovation from a crowd desperate for something interesting to cheer, as England continue to slowly compile runs. Having said that, they got four off that over. A list of cricketing caterers from Paul Billington: &quot;Alistair Cook, Graham Onions, Phil Mustard, Monty Panesarnie, Phil DeFretatas. Sorry.&quot;  44th over: England 96-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 50, Cook 45) England struck four boundaries in their first six overs, but since then \u2013 two overs after lunch \u2013 there have been two in 38 overs, the last one 10 overs ago. &quot;I don&apos;t know of anyone running a restaurant, but I can reveal that former Hampshire tweaker Raj Maru makes an excellent jam sandwich,&quot; writes James de Mellow. OK James, I&apos;ll bite: when did Raj Maru make you a jam sandwich?  45th over: England 100-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 50, Cook 49) Three fielders crowd the bat on the on-side as Herath bowls to Cook, so he reverse-sweeps rather nicely for four to bring up England&apos;s 100. &quot;Hasn&apos;t Matt Hayden written a couple of cookbooks?&quot; asks Paul Roberts. &quot;Presumably involving &apos;England bowlers circa 2002-03 on toast&apos; and the importance of visualising your dish on the table before you turn the oven on.&quot; He has indeed, Paul \u2013 as our own Kevin Mitchell wrote about here. &quot;If a cricketer can cook, surely you can have a crack at it!&quot; he says.  46th over: England 110-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 55, Cook 54) Since I mentioned the lack of boundaries England have been running at 1.5 an over. True, it&apos;s only two overs. Anyway, Cook brings up his 50 with a nicely-timed slice through third man. &quot;Now that England have (finally!) adopted a proper scoring rate for SL conditions and have ceased to get themselves out by playing inappropriate shots for the pitch, they are going to walk this,&quot; writes Ranil Dissanayake. &quot;SL&apos;s frontline quick has an average of over 60. SIXTY! This attack can&apos;t take wickets, it can only accept them.&quot; It is starting to look that way.  47th over: England 112-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 56, Cook 55) &quot;There&apos;s quite a rich vein to be mined with cricketing cuisine,&quot; writes Tom Gucht. &quot;Matt Hayden has published a couple of cookbooks sharing his love of BBQ&apos;s (covered elsewhere \u2013 ed), and Geraint Jones is involved with the Jonesy&apos;s kitchen at St Lawrence that sells meat reared on his own small holding. Actually, that falls somewhat short of the definition of a rich vein, but still as Rudy from Misfits would say two off the hand is worth one in the bush and all that.&quot;  48th over: England 116-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 59, Cook 56) Four runs from Dilshan&apos;s latest over, but the most interesting moment was one that wasn&apos;t hit \u2013 Strauss left the third ball, which flew not that far from his stump. Well, probably a foot. &quot;Legendary ex-Wallaby winger David Campese used to run a caf\u00e9 in Sydney&apos;s Rocks, that was known \u2013 appropriately enough \u2013 for its quick, light-footed, efficient service,&quot; writes Edmund King. &quot;But somehow I don&apos;t think a cricketer could pull that off. Can you imagine a latte prepared for you by, say, Mark Richardson or Mike Atherton? It would be a fraught, heart-stopping, drawn out thing, and would take about 4 hours. I don&apos;t think I could handle the psychological strain, quite frankly.&quot;  49th over: England 119-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 60, Cook 58) Strauss comes down the pitch to Herath&apos;s fourth delivery but only prods the ball to Thirimanne at silly point. Fortunately the fielder fell down and spilled the ball, as there was significant run-out potential there. Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, I bring you James de Mellow&apos;s full Raj Maru jam sandwich story: &quot;It was a sweltering August afternoon in 1999 and South East Hants Under-12s were storming to victory over the New Forest/losing to those mean Andover boys from North Hants. Anyway, we&apos;d been let down by the host club on the tea front and Raj must have been sent off to the nearest supermarket to make amends. His cost-effective solution was a couple of jam jars and a few loaves of bread to feed 22 disappointed kids. Could have been some Penguins, too. Bet it&apos;s all ice baths and protein shakes in district cricket these days.&quot; So your story&apos;s changed since the 44th over \u2013 he actually makes a terrribly disappointing jam sandwich.  50th over: England 122-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 61, Cook 60) Three singles off Dilshan&apos;s over, and we&apos;re going to have a drinks break now. &quot;Have eaten at Tendulkar&apos;s in Mumbai, which featured on its menu Tendulkar&apos;s mum&apos;s Bombay duck,&quot; writes Martin Wakefield. &quot;Unfortunately, it wasn&apos;t the dubious stinkfish we remembered before it was banned by the EU, but disappointingly palatable.&quot; Jay Rayner, eat your heart out.  51st over: England 122-0 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Strauss 61, Cook 60) A maiden from Randiv. And Ben Myddleton points out that Glenn McGrath also published a book of barbecue recipes, &quot;Barbecue With the Master&quot;, in which &quot;the master&quot; reveals his qualifications as a cook-book author: &quot;I am a very competent barbecue cook and have entertained people with my barbecuing skills.&quot; Unlike most Englishmen when faced with McGrath, I am not bowled over.  WICKET! England 122-1 (Strauss c Jayawardene b Dilshan 61) A breakthrough, as Dilshan finds Strauss&apos;s edge for the second time in the over, and the ball flies straight into the keeper&apos;s gloves.  52nd over: England 123-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 60, Trott 1) CHANCE! Dilshan gets one to straighten, and it catches Strauss&apos;s edge and flies straight to slip, sadly bouncing a couple of feet before it reached him. Two balls later, though, Strauss did indeed go. &quot;I followed a tangent from the cricket catering story and am now stuck thinking about an entirely imaginary conversation with David Lloyd about biscuits,&quot; writes Harry Phillips. &quot;I imagine him to be the sort of post-war-no-nonsense chap who could muse about custard creams v bourbons for weeks, if not months. A wonderful use of the daydream.&quot;  53rd over: England 125-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 60, Trott 3) Lots of close fielders as Randiv bowls to Trott \u2013 a slip, a leg slip, short leg and silly mid on. There must be more winery-owning cricketers, in addition to the Botham/Willis partnership, surely? Though on a related note, Jonty Rhodes once launched a short-lived and spectacularly unsuccessful post-retirement venture exporting South African wine to India.  54th over: England 128-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 62, Trott 4) I failed to update you when England were precisely 150 runs away from equalling Sri Lanka&apos;s first-innings total, at the end of the 53rd over. They are now 147 runs away. &quot;This is the kiss of death and no mistake,&quot; writes Peter Foster, &quot;but is there any more reassuring sight than Jonathan Trott coming out at three in a situation like this? If this was April 2009, it&apos;d be Ravi Bopara, and I would already be preparing for collapse.&quot;  55th over: England 134-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 68, Trott 4) Cook hits Randiv&apos;s final ball through point for a smart four. Meanwhile, Harry Phillips (52nd over), your dreams have come crashing down around you. David Lloyd could not sustain a custard cream v bourbons debate &quot;for weeks, if not months&quot;. He could barely manage 140 characters. Neil Withers asked him his opinion on Twitter. His response: &quot;custard creams are quite mellow, Bourbons have an &apos;edge&apos;&quot;  56th over: England 136-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 69, Trott 5) Dilshan bowls, the batsmen grab a run each. &quot;When I was a student in the mid 1990s, I used to work at a posh wine bar/restaurant place in West Didsbury,&quot; writes Jeremy Weate. &quot;One of the evenings during the Old Trafford Test in walked Bumble and Athers. I distinctly remember Lloyd ordering paella. They drank Pinot Grigio.&quot;  57th over: England 138-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 70, Trott 6) Nine overs left now. Sri Lanka keep tempting Cook to cut, the tactic that did for Strauss. Cook, though, isn&apos;t falling for it. &quot;I ate at Sourav Ganguly&apos;s restaurant in Calcutta - before it went bust,&quot; writes Rowan Hooper. &quot;It was more glam than gourmet.&quot;  58th over: England 138-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 70, Trott 6) Herath returns to the attack, and Trott edges one along the ground to slip, not a catching chance. James Robinson emails from Los Angeles. &quot;I walked right past Ozzie Osborne on Sunset Strip the other day, which i found slightly thrilling I that way you always do when you see a celeb but aren&apos;t supposed to admit,&quot; he writes. &quot;And last night the bar man at the Chateau Marmont told me Chevy Chase, who was sat across from us, had just ordered a $1,200 bottle of 1968 French red. He actually let me sniff Chevy Case&apos;s cork, which is something I never thought I&apos;d do/write.&quot; It&apos;s a dream come true, verily it is.  59th over: England 140-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 71, Trott 7) David Lloyd continues to talk biscuits on Twitter. &quot;Hobnobs with chocolate are v good and a rich tea is a good stand by,&quot; he writes, not specifying whether he likes his Hobnobs with milk or dark chocolate, which I think is key information, because if he&apos;s talking milk chocolate here he&apos;s got it all wrong. He adds that &quot;Flapjacks are sensational!&quot; which may or may not be true, depending, but one thing a flapjack never is, is a biscuit.  60th over: England 142-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 71, Trott 9) A nicely-timed stroke from Trott sends the ball trundling through mid-on and earns him a couple. &quot;A more reassuring sight that Trotty digging his guard in this situation is Matt Prior bustling to the crease when we&apos;re already 150 ahead,&quot; suggests Martin Sinclair. &quot;Let&apos;s hope we get to see it some time tomorrow.&quot;  61st over: England 148-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 76, Trott 10) England have returned to the process of merrily if unhurriedly accumulating ones and twos, though no sooner do I write that than Cook chops one away through third man for four. &quot;I paid a very enjoyable lunchtime visit to a winery in Martinborough, on the North Island of New Zealand, called Coneys,&quot; writes Paddy Murphy. &quot;The owner was a tall wirey eccentric gentleman with a moustache and a t-shirt that simply read &quot;YES I AM&quot; because, he explained to us, of the number of people that asked &quot;Are you Jeremy Coney&apos;s brother then?&quot; Produced a pretty good bone dry Riesling too.&quot;  62nd over: England 150-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 77, Trott 11) A not wildly confident claim for lbw against Trott off the fourth ball of Herath&apos;s over. The umpire is unmoved, and no review is requested. Which is just as well, as the ball was going well wide. England trail by 125. There&apos;s some discussion over Jeremy Weate&apos;s story (56th over) about David Lloyd&apos;s restaurant order. &quot;I refuse to believe that Bumble, Accrington&apos;s foremost working-class hero, would eat paella (&quot;foreign muck&quot;) washed down with Pinot Grigio, as Jeremy Weate contends,&quot; writes Matthew Kilsby. &quot;I&apos;m certain that Bumble would prefer a beef dripping sandwich washed down with a pint of mild.&quot; Fortunately we have the truth from the horse&apos;s mouth, coming up shortly.  63rd over: England 150-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 77, Trott 11) A maiden from Randiv. David Lloyd has used the popular medium of Twitter to put an end to these nasty paella-based rumours. &quot;Rubbish, that bloke in posh restaurant,&quot; he writes. &quot;Had 12 pints and 8 pies!&quot;  64th over: England 154-1 (in reply to Sri Lanka&apos;s 275; Cook 77, Trott 15) A super stroke from Trott sends the last ball of Lakmal&apos;s over flying past mid on and away for four. &quot;Years ago I used to occasionally sing in a choir in a smart church in Chelsea,&quot; writes Chris Goater. &quot;We used to congregate in a nearby pub for a swift one before the service, and one time we sang at a wedding where David Gower was the best man and Rory Bremner was one of the ushers. They all piled into our pub, and I know Gower has a reputation as a wine man, but I distinctly remember him accepting a pint off Bremner, who had ensconced himself behind the bar and started pulling pints for people.

No doubt who had the best of day two, but progress has been slow \u2013 this looks increasingly likely to be England&apos;s first five-day match of the winter. England will want to treble their current score to give themselves a first-innings lead of around 150, and at this rate it&apos;ll take a lot of batting to get there. Anyway, we (well, Rob) will be back first thing tomorrow morning to watch them try. I hope you join us."}, {"sentences": ["Exhibition expansion ...

The shipbuilding industry that made it might be gone, but the Titanic disaster has launched a thousand movies, TV shows, concerts, stage plays, festivals, and iceberg metaphors. And now it&apos;s generating substantial chunks of architecture. Last week, Belfast staked its claim with the definitively named Titanic \u2013 a striking new visitor attraction entirely devoted to the ship and its story. Designed by Eric Kuhne, it&apos;s been compared to the Guggenheim and the Sydney Opera House, but it looks to me like a cross between an iceberg and Daniel Libeskind&apos;s Jewish Museum in Berlin \u2013 neither of which are ideal reference points. Anyway, the museum is just the centrepiece for an entire waterfront &quot;Titanic Quarter&quot;. The whole surrounding waterfront area is being redeveloped and rebranded as &quot;a driver for high quality investment in the city&quot;. They&apos;ve even got a little logo based on the ship&apos;s chimneys. So there you go: maritime disaster to urban status symbol. But Southampton is also angling for a piece of the action. That was the liner&apos;s first port of call, after all. So it&apos;s no surprise to find that the first exhibition at Southampton&apos;s new SeaCity Museum is all about the Titanic. The museum opens next Tuesday, the exact date the Titanic set sail. &quot;Nowhere was the tragedy of the Titanic disaster more felt than in Southampton,&quot; says the website. Take that, Belfast! There&apos;s at least more to both the city and the museum than just the Titanic, in terms of maritime history. Designed by Wilkinson Eyre, it&apos;s a part-conversion of Southampton&apos;s grand 1930s Civic Centre, which housed the law courts and police station. A new wing of exhibition space has been added on, and glazed roof extensions added, though many of the original features have been preserved (the police station&apos;s prison cells are now the toilets, for example). After years of American appropriation, it&apos;s good to see Britain taking back ownership of its own colossal failure \u2013 sorry, industrial heritage. Before now, the best Titanic experience you could get was probably the twin Titanic Museums in the random locations of Branson, Missouri, and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, both of which are housed in full-scale replicas of the front half of the ship \u2013 complete with fibre glass icebergs. Moving on, in Newcastle today, the Baltic gallery builds on 10 years of success with a new arts venue in the city centre. Baltic 39, as it&apos;s called, is more than just a public gallery. The converted warehouse also includes artists&apos; studios and teaching facilities for Northumbria University&apos;s fine art department, plus a restaurant and the Stand Comedy Club in the basement. The conversion of the six-storey building was by Austrian architects Jabornegg &amp; Palffy, who&apos;ve left as much of the building as possible just how it was, though they&apos;ve added a new staircase and an extra storey to house the rooftop gallery. It&apos;s Jabornegg &amp; Palffy&apos;s first British project, though they previously collaborated with Rachel Whiteread on Vienna&apos;s Judenplatz Holocaust memorial.     Exhibition expansion ... Palais de Tokyo, Paris    Not one to be outdone, Paris&apos;s Palais de Tokyo is also celebrating its 10th anniversary by expanding its operations. The reopened building, on the banks of the Seine, now claims to be the largest contemporary art centre in Europe, with four floors of exhibition spaces. Originally built for the World&apos;s Fair in 1937, the monumental Palais has housed everything from a modern art museum to a film school to a squat in its troubled history. This latest incarnation was designed by leading French architects Lacaton and Vassal, who did the original conversion 10 years ago. They have sought to create &quot;an astonishing architectural journey&quot; out of the building&apos;s cavernous interiors, which resemble a &quot;magnificent industrial wasteland&quot;, they say. You could call it Paris&apos;s answer to Tate Modern, except it has no permanent art collection \u2013 and the Palais is dedicated not just to visual art but also music, fashion and design. It promises a radical new approach to exhibitions, inviting curators to use the whole building.     National treasure ... Harmondsworth Great Barn in Middlesex has reopened. Photograph: Boris Baggs/English Heritage    Finally, good news for heritage fans: a 15th-century national treasure reopens today, having been saved from destruction. The Harmondsworth Great Barn, in a village west of London, is the largest and best preserved medieval timber structure in the country. It&apos;s almost compulsory to point out that John Betjeman once described it as &quot;one of the wooden wonders of the world&quot; and &quot;the cathedral of Middlesex&quot; (in the latter instance, to the Guardian&apos;s own Simon Jenkins, apparently, when they visited in 1963). It was built in 1426 and incredibly, despite a Grade I listing in the 1950s, it was used as a working barn until the 1970s, but it was snapped up by a property speculator anticipating a third runway at Heathrow, just next door, and fell into neglect. Rain started getting in and the original timber was in peril, until English Heritage took it over. Betjeman&apos;s cathedral comparison was more than mere poetry. The 60 metre-long timber structure is designed along the same lines as churches of the era, with an enormous system of 13 oak trusses supporting the vast roof and dividing the space into a central nave and flanking aisles. It was doubtless built by the same carpenters, and 600 years later, it&apos;s still an awe-inspiring creation. Thanks to Betjeman&apos;s words, a loyal local support network, and English Heritage we can still see it. It&apos;ll be open two weekends a month, starting on Easter Sunday."}, {"sentences": ["Last week the Mariners and the A&apos;s slugged it out in Tokyo; on Wednesday the Marlins and their shiny new stadium, uniform, stars, were comprehensively beaten by the World Series-owning St Louis Cardinals."], "tags": ["MLB", "US sports", "Sport", "Atlanta Braves", "New York Mets"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-06T14:14:00Z", "title": "New York Mets give Opening Day hope with win over Atlanta Braves", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/06/new-york-mets-atlanta-braves", "article": "The Opening Day of any summer sport is a day to cherish: a fresh start for players, teams, fans. On the same day that the county cricket season started in England, Major League Baseball had its third Opening Day.  Last week the Mariners and the A&apos;s slugged it out in Tokyo; on Wednesday the Marlins and their shiny new stadium, uniform, stars, were comprehensively beaten by the World Series-owning St Louis Cardinals. Thursday another batch of teams got their Opening Day. Citi Field benefits from a full-house in the sunshine and the Mets&apos; stadium was buzzing by first pitch. But as a long pitching duel developed between Johan Santana and Tommy Hanson, the mood calmed as friends caught up on the winter&apos;s news, statisticians made summer predictions, and father&apos;s tried to control their kids. But one comedian behind me spent the first five-and-a-half innings harking back to last season when the sun didn&apos;t always shine. Nothing David Wright could do was good enough, or would ever be good enough. Right up until Wright drove home the only run of the afternoon. Wright was 2-for-3 and that RBI. Wright&apos;s sixth-inning single scored center fielder Andres Torres, who later left the game with a calf strain. Atlanta, meanwhile, who scored just seven runs during their disastrous six-game losing streak to end the 2011 season, managed just four hits against five Mets pitchers. It has been a difficult few years for Mets fans: the long legal battle being fought by the club&apos;s owners over Bernie Madoff has drained resources and sapped the fight out of the club. The league&apos;s best hitter, Jose Reyes, left over the winter for the want of a few millions and is now wearing a fancy new Miami Marlins uniform. But the legal battle is now over and an opening day win brings some hope of a better summer. Along with Wright&apos;s hitting, Mets fans were cheered by starting pitcher Santana&apos;s five scoreless innings. Only 161 more games to go in the Mets 50th year as a Major League Baseball team.

It refers to 1966, when she and her then husband and co-songwriter, Gerry Goffin, were living in suburban New Jersey and raising two daughters. Inspired by coolsters who advocated taking drugs to expand one&apos;s consciousness, Goffin was on a quest to ingest as much LSD as he could. King herself was an abstainer. &quot;In reality such explorations were mostly unscientific, with no built-in controls,&quot; she writes primly. This earnestness permeates the book, making it the kind of pop memoir you couldn&apos;t possibly mistake for, say, Keith Richards&apos;s Life. Though King&apos;s career has had its eyebrow-raising moments \u2013 to escape her affluent Los Angeles lifestyle, for instance, she once spent three years in an unheated cabin in Idaho \u2013 she is still, even at 70, a nice Jewish girl from Brooklyn. And she writes that way, constructing sentences correctly, telling anecdotes with scrupulous attention to detail (avoiding drugs in the 60s had its benefits \u2013 she can actually remember the decade) and fretting maternally about family and friends. It makes for a cosy, comforting book: this is someone, you fancy, who would remember your birthday and return your calls. It&apos;s little surprise that King originally wanted to be a teacher, although her gift for music presented itself so early \u2013 she claims to have written her first song when she was three \u2013 that there was never much chance she would end up in the classroom. Essentially, she has never been edgy, and doesn&apos;t mind it at all. Her &quot;core characteristic&quot;, she says, is &quot;just wanting everyone to be happy&quot;. Accordingly, the most heartfelt chapters of A Natural Woman aren&apos;t those that focus on the pop-legend parts of her life, such as the years she and Goffin spent crammed into a cubicle at their music publishers&apos; Broadway office, writing hit after hit, or her period of wafting around LA&apos;s Laurel Canyon in the early 70s, hanging around with fellow Canyon biggies such as Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. Those sections of the book are fascinating, but what she pours her heart into are lengthy descriptions of home life with her husbands (there have been four) and four kids. Of living in rural Idaho, her home to this day, she rhapsodises: &quot;We had no phone, no two-way radio \u2026 Visitors on cross-country skis brought our mail.&quot; Nice work if you can get it. There&apos;s a bit too much of this towards the end of the story, which is clogged by a dull account of her legal fight to stop the public accessing a road running through her ranch; this is where her earnestness becomes tedious rather than charming. As a jobbing songwriter, King co-authored some of pop&apos;s most enduring songs, including &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Natural Woman&quot; and &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;; as a solo artist, she made the 25m-selling album Tapestry \u2013 still one of the biggest-selling LPs of all time. Aged 18 and working with the Shirelles on &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, she volunteered to compose the string section herself. She&apos;d never written for strings before, but her elegant arrangement helped the song to get to No 1 in 1960, and it&apos;s still considered one of the great teen-romance records. She was also instrumental in creating the Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter sound that dominated the serious end of American pop in the early 70s. She looks back on all of this, though, as if it were something that just somehow happened to her. Though she writes in detail about the making of Tapestry, she barely mentions its subsequent success. It&apos;s an odd omission. Any record that spent a full six years in the Billboard chart is, at the least, a small cultural phenomenon. It must have been life-changing, yet she skims over what it felt like suddenly to be America&apos;s biggest-selling singer. There are three brief sentences about winning four Grammys in 1972 (she didn&apos;t attend the ceremony &quot;because it was in New York and I wanted to stay in California with my family&quot;), and a bit more about how she coped with fame: &quot;I just wanted to do what I&apos;d been doing as a wife and mother before the success of Tapestry. I made clothes for everyone in the family, tended our small garden and occasionally went out for sushi lunch in Little Tokyo \u2026&quot; And that&apos;s about it. King would have made a terrible American Idol contestant, if the programme had existed then. Her driving force was simply to make music, and then only because it happened to come easily to her. Her run of 60s classics with Goffin yields the dry observation: &quot;We continued to write enough hit songs to cover our\u00a0mortgage.&quot; There&apos;s some soul-searching about her relationships with men, which brings the revelation that her third husband, Rick Evers (who died of a cocaine overdose in 1978), physically abused her. It comes as a shock, because all of King&apos;s other men, even acid-guzzling Goffin, seem such decent sorts. Sisterly to the last, she includes information about how other abused women can get help, and sums up that chapter of her life with the words: &quot;I thought about the peace that Rick had experienced so rarely in his life, and I hoped with all my heart that he had finally found it.&quot; Her generosity, towards him and almost everyone else, lights up A Natural Woman. Even the platitudinous closing thoughts \u2013 &quot;I kept pushing music away because I thought it was keeping me from having a normal life. At this moment, I understand that for me, music is normal life&quot; \u2013 ring sincere. This is a pop icon you&apos;d (probably) like to have as a friend."}, {"sentences": ["His stint with the Highlanders in the Super 15 is the last leg of a three-year odyssey that has also taken him to Paris and Tokyo, before he returns to Wasps next season, the club where it all started."], "tags": ["England rugby union team", "New Zealand rugby union team", "Stade Fran\u00e7ais", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-07T21:55:02Z", "title": "James Haskell scours globe to enrich his game en route back to Wasps | Michael Aylwin", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/07/james-haskell-england-new-zealand-rugby", "article": "If you should ever fancy an airgun pellet between the shoulder blades, you could do worse than cavort through the backcountry around Dunedin shouting, &quot;Woo-hoo, The Hask!&quot; The chances are you will tweak the nerves of James Haskell, who will almost certainly be out hunting somewhere nearby, armed with said weapon and urged on by Andrew Hore and his other new team-mates at the Highlanders. &quot;Please don&apos;t refer to me as The Hask,&quot; he says politely, but with a clear undertone. Then he complains they all call him that in Dunedin, the latest city he calls home, before launching into an explanation of the provenance of a nickname he considers a travesty. It&apos;s something to do with a perception that he promotes himself as a brand. It is true that he has his own website and is an avid user of social media, but for all his love of gadgets and techno-geekery there is something very old-fashioned about him as well. For a start, there&apos;s his proclivity for lying low in the wilderness of the South Island alongside grizzled All Black front-row forwards. &quot;Andrew Hore is a big one for shooting,&quot; says Haskell. &quot;He describes it as doing a few jobs, so he&apos;ll come up to me and say, &apos;I&apos;ve got a few jobs on. You interested?&apos; Last time it was some rabbit shooting, a bit of pest clearance on the farm of a friend of his, with him and Jamie MacKintosh [the Highlanders captain and a prop forward capped by the All Blacks].&quot; And then there&apos;s the fact that Haskell is to be found on the other side of the world at all, when every other English back-row forward of his calibre and generation is to be found up here, fighting for a place in the national team. Haskell is ambitious, but not to the exclusion of everything else. His stint with the Highlanders in the Super 15 is the last leg of a three-year odyssey that has also taken him to Paris and Tokyo, before he returns to Wasps next season, the club where it all started. Never let it be said that he is shy of the more glamorous aspects of his profession, but this journey smacks more of a passion to see the world and to live life. &quot;It takes a lot of sacrifices to come over here. You&apos;re leaving your friends and family to go to a place where you don&apos;t know anyone. Financially, over here it&apos;s a\u00a0very different ball game. The money just isn&apos;t competitive, so you have to make it a purely rugby decision. And you&apos;ve got to give up your England place. So I don&apos;t think this will become a common move.&quot; Ah, his England place. It might have been forgotten \u2013 amid all the recent excitement over England&apos;s ascension from &quot;the gutter&quot;, as Graham Rowntree put it \u2013 that their growing stock of options in the back row will soon be supplemented further by the return of Haskell. England&apos;s descent into the depths was so vertiginous and so quickly reversed that it is tempting to ask whether it ever really happened. As someone who has seen England from the inside and out in recent times, Haskell&apos;s a good person to ask. &quot;It is up to Wig [Rowntree], his choice of words, but it was a difficult period of time. People made mistakes. But the problem with anything in life is that if you just focus on the media, without any inside knowledge of what went on, you naturally have a biased opinion. Everyone wanted an England team to be proud of [at the World Cup] and they were disappointed. If you took everything that was written at face value \u2014 that the guys were on a stag do and so on \u2014 then it helped to compound the problems and put English rugby into a dark place. But with the new coaches it&apos;s on the way up again and back to where it should be. Guys are focused on performance and the talk is about the rugby, and nothing else.&quot; Haskell did not get to watch much of the Six Nations and what he did see was in highlights packages. Kick-off times in the northern hemisphere make it very difficult for those in New Zealand to follow rugby up here and this is reflected in their indifference towards it. There is an amusing video on the internet in which Haskell asks some of his Highlanders team-mates their opinions of northern-hemisphere rugby. The more mischievous (Hore, for example) use it as a chance to indulge in banter about how boring it is, but all of them confess to not knowing because they never watch any of it. This is one\u00a0of several cultural differences Haskell has had to embrace during his recent adventures. &quot;It&apos;s interesting. You ask people in England what they think of Super 15, they&apos;ll have a lot more comments than the other way round. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve always found with Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They just focus on what they&apos;re doing, whereas in the UK we look outwards more. Talking to the guys who are All Blacks, when they&apos;re preparing for an international they do some analysis on patterns of play, but they don&apos;t focus on the minutiae of their opponents. Some players might disagree, but I reckon if you asked an All Black after a game who his opposite number was, most of the time he wouldn&apos;t know, unless it was someone like Jonny Wilkinson.&quot; After the World Cup, Haskell went to Japan to play alongside Ma&apos;a Nonu and Tamati Ellison for Ricoh Black Rams for a few months. He describes Japanese rugby as the fastest he has ever played. The players are so well drilled that skill levels are higher than in the Top 14 in France, where you might see 10 or 15 balls go down in a Stade Fran\u00e7ais training session. But the French are infused with their natural flair and a ferocious devotion to physicality. Their emotions fluctuate wildly. Japanese emotions can run high too, but they are tempered by the attention to drills. In New Zealand, the approach is more recognisable to an Anglo-Saxon one, but they are blessed with a culture that promotes touch rugby from a young age, with less focus on weights and conditioning. After such an experience, Haskell will surely return to England a better player than he was when he left on a two-year deal with Stade Fran\u00e7ais in 2009, and it is to his credit that he has seen fit to embark on such an adventure. It was noticeable how improved his form for England was in the 2011 Six Nations, courtesy of his French sojourn, and Wasps (in particular) and England will wait with interest to see how he returns from his subsequent stints in Japan and New Zealand. &quot;I wanted to play Super 15. I wanted to develop some maturity, some leadership and to work on my skill set. Also I want to have played all round the world. Then you can come to informed opinions. People make very many comments in life when they don&apos;t have the background or the knowledge. I&apos;ll be able to tell you what it&apos;s like in four of the big leagues in the rugby world. I&apos;ve had a great experience. I&apos;ve played with some of the best players in the world, and I&apos;ve loved every minute of it.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Here&apos;s what our writers will be seeing this week (all subject to last-minute change): Sufjan Stevens at the Barbican, London Lawson Trio at the Purcell Room, London Tokyo String Quartet; Andreas Haefliger at Wigmore Hall, London The Osmonds at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall Ronika at the Old Blue Last, London Sandrine Piau at Wigmore Hall Chick Corea/Gary Burton at the Barbican Michael Janisch at Colston Hall, Bristol Toy at XOYO, London New Band of the Day Live at the Barfly, London LSO/Harding at the Barbican Dream of Gerontius in Birmingham NYO/Hazelwood in Gateshead Andrew WK at the Forum, London Laibach at the Manchester Academy BBC Symphony Orchestra/Jarvi at the Barbican Icebreaker with The Scottish Ensemble and Pekka Kuusisto in Glasgow Il Pastor Fido at St Georges, Hanover Square, London Lauryn Hill, O2 Arena, London Daniel Johnston at the Union Chapel, London Graham Coxon in Gateshead If you&apos;ve seen, or are going to see, any concerts this week, let us know in the thread below."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-09T12:00:01Z", "title": "Live music: coming up", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/09/live-music-coming-up", "article": "Each week we publish a list of concerts our writers will be covering in the next few days, and we invite you to tell us about shows you&apos;ve attended recently, or bands you hope to see soon.

As he flew to Japan overnight, the prime minister said he was &quot;up front&quot; about the &quot;perfectly responsible and respectable&quot; decision to travel with executives from six defence contractors, including BAE Systems and AgustaWestland.  Britain is preparing to embark on developing weapons jointly with Japan after Tokyo named the UK as its first overseas defence trading partner after the US. Speaking on board his chartered plane, the prime minister said: &quot;There are a number of defence manufacturers with us. I&apos;m completely up front about that because we do have a very strong defence sector. It accounts for a lot of jobs, we have some of the toughest rules on defence exports anywhere in the world. &quot;But as these countries, particularly Japan, that have tended in the past to buy only American equipment are opening up, there are opportunities for people like AgustaWestland, who make helicopters, who are on this plane. I think that&apos;s perfectly responsible and respectable.&quot; Downing Street \u2013 acutely sensitive to charges that the prime minister drums up business for defence manufacturers on his overseas tours \u2013 will hope that the focus of Tuesday&apos;s visit will be on Nissan&apos;s Yokohama headquarters. After landing at Tokyo&apos;s Haneda airport at lunchtime Japanese time, the prime minister headed to the plant where the carmaker will announce a \u00a3127m investment in its Sunderland plant to produce its new hatchback, expected to create 225 jobs. Cameron said the Nissan announcement, the first of a series of deals in Japan and in countries in south-east Asia he will visit this week, showed the importance of his trade mission. The prime minister, who is being accompanied by 33 British business leaders and representatives of four universities, said: &quot;Part of the job of the prime minister is to load up an aeroplane full of business people, large and small, get our exports up, get our investment up, get out there and fly the flag for Britain. That is what I am trying to do this week.&quot; The prime minister added: &quot;It is an important trip. Obviously these are key diplomatic relations with Japan and south-east Asia that we want to build. We think in some ways we have underplayed these relations in the past. We want to boost them and strengthen them. Above all this trip is really about British business. We need to rebalance the British economy, we need to grow our exports, we need to grow our investment, we need to grow our manufacturing and our industries. All these countries represent huge opportunities.&quot; But Cameron&apos;s talks in Tokyo with Yoshihiko Noda, his Japanese counterpart, will be dominated by expected deals on defence co-operation and Britain&apos;s role in helping Japan with its nuclear decommissioning. These could eventually dwarf the relatively modest Japanese inward investment deals, worth \u00a3200m, that will be signed on the trip. The prime minister is taking representatives of the defence manufacturers, which also include Babcock, MBDA, Rolls Royce and Thales, because officials believe there is a major opportunity as Japan opens up its multibillion-pound defence market. Britain hopes to win a share of the market, which had been open only to Japanese and US companies since 1967. A blanket ban came into force in 1976, although this did not apply to the US. In December last year Japan lifted the ban \u2013 a move technically outside the terms of the postwar constitution, enacted in 1947, which banned &quot;land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential&quot;. Japan has traditionally circumvented the ban by building up its armed forces with the help of the most formidable of the allied powers in 1945, the US. The Mainichi newspaper last week quoted defence ministry officials in Tokyo as saying that Cameron and Noda would formally agree to begin defence co-operation talks. The officials said it could take a year to decide on areas where the two countries would co-operate, but they are expected to start initially with the joint development of military equipment. Britain says progress has already been made in highly technical preliminary negotiations. This has involved persuading the Japanese that UK defence equipment is &quot;interoperable&quot; and meets the security requirements of both sides. Cameron will work hard to press British interests after Japan recently chose US-made Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets over the Eurofighter Typhoon manufactured by a consortium of European companies, including BAE Systems. Cameron faced embarrassment in February last year over the promotion of Britain&apos;s defence industry when he took a delegation of manufacturers to the Gulf. He began the trip by hailing democracy in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square \u2013 before flying to Kuwait with eight defence manufacturers. The prime minister will argue that this trip is different because Japan is a democracy. Downing Street believes in recent years Britain has overlooked its relationship with Japan, which is the world&apos;s third largest economy and whose investments in the UK come to more than \u00a326bn, accounting for 130,000 jobs. Japan is only the 14th largest export market for UK goods, though this grew by 7% last year. Tony Blair paid the last bilateral visit by a British prime minister to Japan in 2003. Cameron was due to visit Japan last October on his way to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Australia. But by then he had already visited China, India and the US. In an interview with the Japanese daily Yomiuri, the world&apos;s largest newspaper, Cameron said he hoped to revive ties with an old ally. &quot;We do have very good relations between Britain and Japan. We&apos;re old friends, we&apos;re old allies, we&apos;re partners in many senses. But I think we can take the relationship even further.&quot; Cameron paid tribute to the way the Japanese people had responded to the twin disasters of the tsunami and the subsequent nuclear disaster at Fukushima last year. &quot;I greatly admire and respect the way the Japanese have overcome the enormous challenges of recovery following last year&apos;s earthquake. The UK stood by Japan in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake when we kept our embassy open in Tokyo and through the reassuring advice of our chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, who will be joining me on this trip. &quot;Looking to the future, we want to continue to support the Japanese as they reconstruct the Tohoku region and tackle the challenges of the nuclear clean-up. British companies have significant expertise in nuclear decommissioning and clean-up, with 19 nuclear sites in the UK currently being managed through the process.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["As revealed at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show, the goth rock demon slayer is to be reborn after four varyingly successful adventures."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "PS3", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-10T16:41:51Z", "title": "Devil May Cry \u2013 gameplay footage revealed at last", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/10/devil-may-cry-trailer", "article": "     Dante is back \u2013 and now we have some rather scintillating new imagery.

In a collaboration between UK studio Ninja Theory and Capcom&apos;s R&amp;D division, DmC: Devil May Cry takes us back to the roots of the series, exploring the early years of the smart-jiving protagonist. Here&apos;s the first trailer from the forthcoming PS3 and Xbox title. It shows Dante sparring demonic foes in an abandoned fun fair, while a rightwing religious news channel calls for his execution. The whole thing looks a lot more... American, with a younger, prettier lead and lots more Hollywood bad boy dialogue. Once again, the combat system combines pistols and swords and there look to be some rather histrionic juggle combos allowing you to go totally Fruit Ninja on falling enemies. Although Cambridge-based Ninja Theory (Heavenly Sword, Enslaved) is taking on most of the development duties, the project is being overseen by Hedeaki Itsuno who worked on all four of the previous instalments, so we can expect a certain amount of continuity \u2013 though we&apos;re hoping the Ninja Theory team get to put plenty of their own spin on things; especially with the depth of the third-person combat mechanic.

Who better, then, than John Prescott to give the chancellor a well-deserved Twitter knuckling? Prescott began his attack early on Tuesday with the inevitable: &quot;Osborne shocked to discover what bears do in the woods.&quot; He followed this up with: &quot;Luke, I&apos;m your father&quot; and &quot;The Beatles were a popular beat combo from the 60s&quot;. By mid-morning Prescott&apos;s #shockosborne hashtag was trending on Twitter, and cyberspace was awash with jokes at poor Gideon&apos;s expense. Some were topical: &quot;Osborne quite surprised to hear Titanic sunk&quot;; others punning: &quot;Gideon shocked when shoving a silver fork into plug socket.&quot; And many referenced Catholicism and a well-known religious leader. It&apos;s a tough choice for Osborne in future: a favourable headline in the Telegraph versus a day of being a virtual pinata. \u2022 Another government dilemma is what to give your foreign host. In Tokyo on Tuesday David Cameron came up with the perfect present for Japan&apos;s PM \u2013 a custom-made Brompton bike, manufactured in Brentford, Middlesex. Downing Street was delighted with the choice, with one radiant No 10 source telling the travelling press pack: &quot;Prime Minister Noda loves cycling. So we thought a Brompton bike would make a good gift from London and the UK.&quot; The bike, in red telephone box livery, cost a thousand quid. Next up is Aung San Suu Kyi, whom Dave visits on Friday. When Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, dropped into Burma last year he gave her the Downton Abbey season one box set, Yes Minister and It Ain&apos;t Half Hot Mum. Season 2 of Downton Abbey is out now. Downing Street, take note. \u2022 It is, of course, better to give than to receive. But nobody appears to have passed this adage on to Afghan MPs, who were elected in 2010 amid persistent allegations of fraud. Last month the MPs asked the international community to buy them all iPads, claiming they &quot;needed them to do their jobs&quot;. Western diplomats politely declined the request, resentful of being viewed by Hamid Karzai&apos;s parliament as an endless bucket of cash. &quot;It&apos;s not really corruption, just a mad sense of entitlement indicative of how messed up the relationship with this place is,&quot; one wise soul in Kabul tells me. \u2022 British relations with Afghanistan&apos;s next-door neighbour Iran are also less than happy. Last November the UK shut its embassy in Tehran after a mob of angry students attacked the building. Now Tehran has taken another unfriendly step, barring access to the official London Olympics website, london2012.com. Iranians who log on are redirected to peyvandha.ir, a site featuring local news and photos of national attractions including a leafy park. The benighted Iranians are clearly missing out big time. On Tuesday, for example, the Olympic site featured an ad for an exclusive 2012 teapot and a page devoted to the adventures of Wenlock and Mandeville, the Games&apos; spoon-like alien-mascots. \u2022 The Soviet Union may have disappeared with communism into history&apos;s dustbin. But old habits of thinking sometimes linger. In a move that might cheer the restless shades of Lenin and Trotsky, Russia&apos;s Duma is to set up a new &quot;counter-revolutionary committee&quot;. Its aim isn&apos;t to protect the glorious proletarian revolution from the bourgeoisie but to stop the diabolical Americans from meddling in Russia&apos;s &quot;space&quot;. Moscow is terrified that a democratic revolution might sweep away the current inhabitants in the Kremlin, whose spotless record in fighting corruption speaks for itself. \u2022 More from the riveting diaries of Tory peer Michael Spicer.

The prime minister, who will fly into Jakarta with some of Britain&apos;s leading defence manufacturers, said it was time to sell some of the &quot;best defence equipment in the world&quot; to an important democracy. Cameron is on a five-day trip to Asia, which will culminate in a historic visit to Burma on Friday, to try to boost Britain&apos;s economic ties with the world&apos;s fastest growing region. On his first day in Japan on Tuesday Cameron mounted a strong defence of his decision to exploit a liberalisation of Tokyo&apos;s defence procurement rules. Executives from six defence companies, including BAE Systems and AgustaWestland, are accompanying the prime minister on his tour of Asia. &quot;It is absolutely right that a British prime minister takes defence companies with him on a trade mission like this,&quot; he said in Tokyo. As he prepared to fly to Jakarta, he said Britain should now be free to sell arms to Indonesia which he described as one of the world&apos;s great democracies. &quot;Britain makes some of the best defence equipment in the world and it is right that it is available to Indonesia, under the very same criteria that we apply to all our partners around the world,&quot; he said in an interview with Jakarta&apos;s Kompas newspaper. &quot;That is why some of our leading defence companies are with me on this visit.&quot; There were reports last year that Britain was involved in negotiations with Indonesia to sell 24 Eurofighter Typhoons in a \u00a32bn deal. Britain denied there were specific discussions, though ministers said they were keen to explore defence projects with Indonesia. The Labour government banned the export of fighter jets to Indonesia in 1999 after reports that Jakarta had used BAE-built Hawk aircraft to bomb civilians in East Timor. In the same year Indonesia relinquished its control of East Timor which became a sovereign state in 2002. But Human Rights Watch has been highly critical of Indonesia&apos;s human rights record in recent years. On the eve of a visit to Jakarta by President Barack Obama last year, the group criticised Indonesia for a lack of accountability of security forces for &quot;continuing abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture in Papua and other areas&quot;. Cameron will meet Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who was elected president of Indonesia in 2004 in the first direct elections after the fall of Suharto in 1998. Britain believes that Yudhoyono has been instrumental in underpinning democracy in the world&apos;s largest Muslim nation of 245 million people. In his interview with Kompas, Cameron said: &quot;Indonesia has transformed itself in the past decade into one of the world&apos;s most important democracies, with a free media and elections. The military no longer plays a role in politics, but fulfils its proper role defending the country from external attack.&quot; He added: &quot;In Britain we now have what is one of the most rigorous and careful arms licensing systems in the world, to ensure that arms do not fall into the hands of those who might misuse them. But at the same time we believe that democratic and responsible countries like Indonesia have a right to defend themselves, and to buy the equipment needed to do so.&quot; Cameron wants to widen Britain&apos;s economic links with Indonesia which is due to become the sixth or seventh largest economic power in the world, and he believes that his visit provides an invaluable platform to reach out to Muslims in the country and beyond. The prime minister&apos;s remarks to Kompas contrasted with comments in Tokyo where he played down Britain&apos;s defence interests in Indonesia. &quot;Indonesia is much more broadly based on trade. We have 0.07% of Indonesia&apos;s market. The [UK] defence businesses \u2013 some of them will still be on the trip [to Indonesia]. But it is a much more broad-based economic relationship that we are looking for.&quot; In Tokyo, Cameron visited Nissan&apos;s Yokohama headquarters where the carmaker announced a \u00a3127m investment in its Sunderland plant to produce its new hatchback. The main focus of his talks with Yoshihiko Noda, his Japanese counterpart, focused on defence and on helping Japan with nuclear decommissioning. Japan has named Britain as its first overseas defence trading partner after the US after a recent relaxation of its procurement rules. The prime minister was accompanied to Japan by Professor Sir John Beddington, the government&apos;s chief scientific adviser, who said the British embassy in Tokyo should remain open last year after the Fukushima nuclear disaster which followed the tsunami. Beddington is regarded as something of a hero in Japan. Cameron said: &quot;Britain very much stood with Japan at that difficult moment in terms of Fukushima. Now we are working with the Japanese to try and help with the nuclear clear-up and the steps that need to be taken around Fukushima. We think there are important opportunities there for British expertise to come into play. We also want to see good co-operation in the nuclear industry between Britain and Japan in the future.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["There have been reports that Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, who joined him in Tokyo, is unhappy with the cap."], "tags": ["Tax and spending", "Economic policy", "Budget", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news", "Charities", "Voluntary sector", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-11T13:18:36Z", "title": "David Cameron raises charities' hopes of tax relief rethink", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/11/david-cameron-charities-tax-relief", "article": "David Cameron has promised to listen &quot;sympathetically&quot; to concerns raised by a host of charities about government plans to impose a cap on tax relief for philanthropic gifts. As the protests against the plans grow, the prime minister defended George Osborne&apos;s decision to impose the cap in the budget. But he said ministers would listen with care. Speaking in Jakarta, on the second stage of his Asian trip, the prime minister said: &quot;George Osborne said in the budget very carefully we would look at the effect on charitable donations because we want to encourage charitable giving. I repeated that in my speech at the launch of Big Society Capital. We&apos;ll look very sympathetically at these concerns.&quot; The remarks by the prime minister are likely to raise hopes among charities that the chancellor may be prepared to review his announcement in the budget that he would crack down on people who made unlimited use of tax reliefs &quot;year after year&quot;. The chancellor said in his budget speech: &quot;From next year, anyone seeking to claim more than \u00a350,000 of these reliefs in any one year will have a cap set at 25% of their income. We&apos;ve capped benefits. Now it&apos;s right to cap tax reliefs, too.&quot; Downing Street sources indicated that the prime minister was not signalling a change of tack. One source said: &quot;The prime minister was reasserting the position that he and the chancellor have set out previously.&quot; Treasury sources have also indicated over the past week that Osborne is unlikely to back down. The chancellor feels strongly he has made the right decision because his scheme is modelled on a cap in the US which is regarded as the home of philanthropy. But the chancellor offered at the time of the budget to consult philanthropists. The budget Red Book says: &quot;The government will explore with philanthropists ways to ensure this new limit will not significantly impact upon charities that depend on large donations.&quot; The prime minister said that he and Osborne were united. He said: &quot;I&apos;ve no doubt there is a problem with some people who are using a range of tax allowances to reduce their effective tax rate down to very, very low often single figures. The proposal in the budget was to say that there should be a limit on their tax allowances to \u00a350,000 or up to a quarter of your income. It&apos;s very important to recognise that. &quot;Even in America, there is actually a limit on the extent of tax allowances that you can use \u2026 The idea is stopping some of the abuse that is taking place. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt abuse is taking place. We&apos;ve been very clearly informed of that by the Inland Revenue, who are responsible for these matters. Some people have been using charities established in other countries to funnel money in, so they&apos;re not paying 50p tax or 45p tax but 10p or 20p tax. I think that isn&apos;t right. I&apos;m confident we can get the balance right. The chancellor and I are absolutely aligned on achieving this.&quot; Cameron said he was keen to encourage charitable donations. There have been reports that Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, who joined him in Tokyo, is unhappy with the cap. Hunt gave a major speech last year to try and create what he called a US-style culture of philanthropic giving. The prime minister said: &quot;I want to see an increase in charitable giving, an increase in philanthropy in Britain. It&apos;s important we achieve that. That&apos;s why we enhanced gift aid provisions, that&apos;s we introduce provisions where we can relieve inheritance tax if you leave part of your will to charity.

Despite charging its 15.7 million annual adult visitors \u2013 that&apos;s anyone over the age of 11 in Disney&apos;s world \u2013 a minimum of \u00a351 per visit, the theme park lost \u20ac55.6m (\u00a345m) last year, and its debts are a towering \u20ac1.9bn. The debts are so huge that the company&apos;s chief executive has admitted it will still be paying them off for the next 12 years. While Zinedine Zidane and the Oscar- winning actor Salma Hayek turned up to kick off the park&apos;s birthday party last week, there is no new blockbuster attraction, as there has been for previous anniversaries, because austerity has come to the Magic Kingdom. The park, which sprawls over about 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) of old beetroot fields east of Paris, has chalked up losses of more than \u20ac212m over the last few years, despite increasing sales to more than \u20ac1.3bn a year. The company&apos;s share price has crashed by 50% over the past year to just \u20ac4.43. One leading City analyst has even warned that the company&apos;s finances are in such a dire state that it will probably never make a profit. The park is now the most popular tourist destination in Europe, with more than double the number of visitors to the Louvre \u2013 and it recently recorded its 250-millionth customer since the iron gates swung open in 1992. But the increase in the number of visitors has come at a price. In a bid to boost attendance at a time when Europeans are being battered by economic turmoil, Disneyland Paris has been offering discounts of up to 50% on the price of packages, which include tickets to its two parks and accommodation at its seven on-site hotels. As a result revenue increased by only \u20ac23m last year. Twenty years ago Robert Fitzpatrick, Walt Disney&apos;s then chairman, boasted: &quot;My biggest fear is that we will be too successful.&quot; But it didn&apos;t take long for the fairytale to turn into a financial disaster. The signs were not good from the outset. When Michael Eisner, Disney&apos;s former CEO, launched the company on the Paris stock exchange he was greeted by protesters waving &quot;Mickey, Go Home!&quot; placards and pelted with eggs. The intelligentsia of Paris also opposed the park, with some deriding it as a &quot;construction of hardened chewing gum&quot;, while French theatre director Ariane Mnouchkine&apos;s &quot;cultural Chernobyl&quot; monicker is still used to deride it. On its opening day on 12 April 1992 motorists were warned of massive tailbacks near the park, then called Euro Disney, in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e about 18 miles east of Paris. The French government reckoned that up to half a million people were planning a visit on the big day. In the event the huge car park complex was only half full, suggesting only about 25,000 people turned up. Perhaps Disney&apos;s biggest misunderstanding of its customers was a ban on wine, with staff in fancy dress only allowed to sell soft drinks and non-alcoholic &quot;mocktails&quot; just moments away from the world&apos;s best champagne vineyards. The booze ban was swiftly lifted, visitor numbers began to increase and the company recorded its first quarterly profit in 1995. But rumours quickly circulated that the park was on the verge of bankruptcy and Walt Disney, which owns almost 40% of the company, and its banks were forced to bail out the park. Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal also owns a 10% stake. At the same time the company finally bowed to pressure to change its name, with Eisner admitting: &quot;As Americans, the word &apos;Euro&apos; is believed to mean glamorous or exciting. For Europeans it turned out to be a term they associated with business, currency, and commerce.&quot; It was probably a smart move: today it would have been linked with crisis and cuts. The company also has a history of difficult relations with its staff. In 2009, on one of Disneyland Paris&apos;s busiest days of the year, staff protested against a pay freeze by striking and marching through the park, causing the first ever cancellation of the famous daily parade down its Victorian-themed Main Street. Broadcaster Jonathan Ross visited the park recently and tweeted: &quot;We are at Disneyland Paris for the 20th anniversary. There&apos;s a dispute and strikers march down Main st. Worst Disney parade.&quot; Four of the seven Disney unions were demanding a pay rise of at least 4%, compared to the 1.5% on offer. Philippe Gas, the park&apos;s sixth CEO, conceded this week that &quot;[Disneyland] didn&apos;t work in the early years how we wanted.

But the analyst, who declined to be named, said Disneyland Paris &quot;should have a good outlook because of the anniversary ...

John Carter, its Mars film released last month starring Willem Dafoe, cost an estimated $350m (\u00a3220m) to make and market but brought in just $184m in global box-office sales in its first two weekends. That was well short of expectations, and likely to drag the movie studio to a second-quarter operating loss estimated at between $80m and $120m. The studio might now look to avoid the subject of the red planet, after another major flop last year with Mars Needs Moms. That picture boasts the 13th worst opening ever for a film playing in more than 3,000 cinemas, according to the website Boxofficemojo.com, having grossed $6.9m on the opening weekend and $21.4m in total. The film had a budget of $150m and ended with a $100m write-down. These efforts follow others such as Disney&apos;s 2004 historical drama The Alamo, which resulted in a $75m write-off. Events beyond the company&apos;s control have also contributed to painful losses. Fewer visitors to the Tokyo Disney theme park following last year&apos;s earthquake and tsunami resulted in a Y3bn (\u00a323m) operating loss between April and June. \u2022 This article was corrected on 12 April 2012 because the original said Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e is about 18 miles west of Paris.

In Tokyo on Tuesday the PM said he was &quot;very relaxed&quot; about the publication of his tax records and said the &quot;time is coming&quot; for politicians to open up their personal finances. But tax records are one thing, private assets another. The BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr famously asked Dave in 2009 if it was true he and Mrs C were worth \u00a330m. Marr got the reply: &quot;No, absolutely not.&quot; Since then Cameron&apos;s wealth has remained a subject of mystery, with estimates ranging from \u00a316m to \u00a33.2m. As one wise source points out, publishing the PM&apos;s tax records won&apos;t tell us much. Cameron \u2013 like other members of the upper-middle class \u2013 is asset rich, but income less rich. So has the PM ever revealed how much he has? Downing Street is unhelpful. &quot;Er, I would need to check. His salary is a matter of public record,&quot; a spokesperson says. Make me transparent, Lord. But not yet. \u2022 In an interview with Sky News, the PM took a subtle dig at another high-profile tax avoider, Vince Cable. Cable, you will remember, was embarrassed last year for failing to pay VAT on his best-selling book. The revenue whacked Cable with a bill for \u00a3500. Asked on Wednesday if he had done anything people might view as avoiding tax, Cameron replied: &quot;No, I don&apos;t think I have.&quot; He then took out a dagger and jabbed it at the business secretary: &quot;The issue I think for lots of people has been have you paid VAT on things and all the rest of it.&quot; So much for Lib-Con fraternity. &quot;At the moment it&apos;s needle-needle,&quot; one observer says of intra-coalition relations. \u2022 Another day, another jolly press feud. Last month Rupert Murdoch \u2013 new Twitter convert that he is \u2013 shot off a mocking tweet to Alexander Lebedev. That day a hitman pumped four bullets into German Gorbuntsov, a Russian banker living in Canary Wharf. Murdoch wrote: &quot;Another Russian shot down in London. Wonder what ex KGB boss Lebedev could tell his paper Independent?&quot; On Wednesday Lebedev fired his own scorching reply. He began: &quot;Dear Mr @rupertmurdoch Sorry for the delay \u2013 wasn&apos;t aware you&apos;re familiar with Twitter.&quot; And then: &quot;I&apos;ll advice [sic] Indy to help Scotland Yard,and assist myself. Without recourse to phone hacking or &quot;tips&quot; to corrupt officers, Mr @rupertmurdoch.&quot; Ouch! Miaow! Please gentlemen. This isn&apos;t decorous. \u2022 Alarming news from east Kazakhstan. A woman in a village near Ust-Kamenogorsk was baffled when her guard-dog went missing. She reported the pitbull&apos;s disappearance to the police, explaining that it was kept on a chain so couldn&apos;t have simply run off. When local detectives investigated they discovered the dog&apos;s skin in a nearby courtyard. Under interrogation, the woman&apos;s unemployed neighbour admitted he had indeed stolen the dog, Kazakhstan Today reported. And eaten it. \u2022 Male politicians are not mere robots but human beings. Sometimes they even cry. On Wednesday Ken Livingstone revealed his emotional side, sniffling at a launch of his new party political broadcast. &quot;The people you saw on the screen represent hundreds of thousands of Londoners who desperately want a mayor who is going to make their life easier in this city,&quot; Ken said, as Ed Miliband patted him on the back. For sure, the broadcast is slicker than anything his team has previously produced; it features a boxer, a groundsman, one posh woman and an extremely cute baby. But who exactly are they? The Labour party confessed yesterday that the Londoners are all actors \u2013 but actors who support Ken. Of the crying, it said: &quot;It was very genuine. It really was.&quot; \u2022 Another gem from the diaries of the Tory peer Michael Spicer. Spicer reveals that, age nine, he fell in love with the &quot;gorgeously attractive&quot; Princess Margaret. But it was another lucky woman who won his heart. In his acknowledgements Spicer thanks his &quot;darling wife Ann \u2026 for putting up with my absence from the washing-up sink.&quot; Ah yes: the progressive secret at the heart of every partnership.

Profits from UK banking recruitment plunged 50% year-on-year between January and March, dragging the firm&apos;s overall UK profits down 3.7% to \u00a330.6m. Chief executive Steve Ingham said: &quot;Clearly there are still issues around the euro zone sovereign debt and these things are influencing our business, but ... I don&apos;t think things are getting worse. Our conclusion on March was that banking remains difficult [and] certain geographies remain more challenging than others.&quot; He pointed to Italy, Spain and Britain. European stock markets were rocked by a wave of panic selling on Tuesday amid fresh fears over Spain and Italy, which saw borrowing costs jump. Michael Page, which is seen as a bellwether for the wider economy, described the UK market as &quot;very challenging and highly competitive&quot; but said this was offset by stronger performances in other countries, including Germany and France, which grew by 36% and 10% respectively. Group profits climbed 6.9% to \u00a3136m in the first quarter. Shares in the company dived 6% in the morning following a recent strong run for the FTSE 250 index stock, and finished the day 3.6% lower at 437.8p. In Asia, where the firm employs more than 1,000 people, profits climbed 23% to \u00a326.3m. However, like UK and North America, the weakness in banking reduced growth rates, particularly in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. Amid the turbulence in financial markets over recent months, profits from banking recruitment worldwide dropped 12% and the sector now accounts for 8% of the firm&apos;s trading (UK banking makes up 1%). Recruitment in engineering, construction, property, supply chain and business procurement, accounts for nearly a fifth of its business. Investec Securities analyst Robert Morton switched his recommendation on the stock to &apos;hold&apos; from &apos;buy,&apos; saying: &quot;The recruitment sector will clearly face some choppy waters in the very short term, but we still believe that the underlying structural recovery/growth story for the sector remains intact.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Rough Trade Shops currently has two stores in London, but attempts to establish outlets in Tokyo, Paris and San Francisco all ended in closure."], "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Culture", "Shopping trips", "New York", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-12T11:55:25Z", "title": "Rough Trade to open store in New York", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/rough-trade-record-shop-new-york", "article": "New York City is to get its own Rough Trade shop.

Soon after he had completed his doctoral dissertation on cubism at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, it was published as Cubism, A History and an Analysis, 1907-1914 (1959), and has stood ever since as the clearest exposition of that extraordinary era in the history of the art of the 20th\u00a0century.     John Golding     In a field in which so many literate and knowledgable writers had known Pablo Picasso well \u2013 from the compiler of the Dictionnaire Picasso, Pierre Daix, to his first English biographer, the painter Roland Penrose, his most discriminating collector, Douglas Cooper, and the writer of what is likely to be the definitive biography, John Richardson, \u2013 this was a remarkable achievement. Golding added to it in 1988, when an exhibition in Paris and Barcelona, organised around Picasso&apos;s Les Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon (1907), overlapped with another show, Late Picasso, in Paris and London, of\u00a0Picasso&apos;s late period (1953-73), and\u00a0Golding wrote what remains one of the finest accounts of Picasso&apos;s achievement in an essay of nearly 11,000 words in the New York Review of Books. Yet more than with any of his writings, he made his public mark with another Picasso scholar, Elizabeth Cowling, by curating two groundbreaking Tate exhibitions: Picasso: Sculptor/Painter, in 1994, and Matisse/Picasso, in 2002-03, which also travelled to the Grand Palais in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The first of these shows demonstrated what many people already suspected, that as a sculptor/painter, Picasso had more sculptural ideas than most specialists in that field. After its success, the Tate&apos;s director, Nicholas Serota, challenged his dream team to come up with something as\u00a0good. Cowling suggested Matisse/Picasso to Golding, who concurred enthusiastically. Everybody knew about the creation of cubism by Picasso and Georges Braque, &quot;like two mountaineers roped together&quot;, as Braque described it. The idea that the wary and slow-burning relationship between Picasso and Matisse should have been just as productive, though lasting more than half a\u00a0century rather than the six or seven hectic Picasso-Braque years, had\u00a0never been so boldly proposed as\u00a0in\u00a0this exhibition. Golding attacked the project with determination, talking not just great galleries but reluctant private collectors into parting with masterpieces chosen not simply for their quality but to be placed in conjunction, Picasso with Matisse, Matisse with Picasso, to show how they fed off each other. Together with a catalogue essay by Golding, argued with characteristic calmness and\u00a0lucidity, the exhibition was a\u00a0triumph of enlightened scholarship and sheer pleasure. Neither Picasso nor Matisse of course was ever an abstractionist. Golding was, and the clue to his practice as a painter lies in his Paths to the Absolute (2000). This effectively stood as his credo, that abstract art was not simply decorative but, as he put it in the preface, was &quot;heavily imbued with meaning [and] with content&quot;, a case he argued with studies of seven abstract artists, beginning with the early 20th-century Europeans Piet Mondrian, Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky and ending with the post-second-world-war Americans Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. The book was essentially a transcript of his AW Mellon lectures of 1997, the famous series of talks that also produced such celebrated studies of art history as EH Gombrich&apos;s Art and Illusion and Kenneth Clark&apos;s The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form. Golding&apos;s rigorous but approachable work comfortably takes its place among them, and in the year of its publication it won the Mitchell prize, the principal annual US award for art history. Although he was born in Hastings, East Sussex, Golding&apos;s parents brought him up from early childhood in Mexico. During the second world war, he came to know the maverick English surrealist Leonora Carrington, who had made her home in Mexico, and in her eclectic circle Golding met the film-maker Luis Bu\u00f1uel and the poet Octavio Paz, as\u00a0well as emigre surrealists such as the French poet Benjamin P\u00e9ret and the Austrian artist Wolfgang Paalen. But it was the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera, Juan O&apos;Gorman and especially Jos\u00e9 Orozco who really interested him. He\u00a0was especially impressed by the boldly schematic figures of Orozco that aimed at the grand simplicity of early Italian masters in the circle of Giotto, and it was these that he remembered after the war when he himself began to paint. First though, Golding took a degree at\u00a0Toronto University. He made frequent visits during this time to the Museum of\u00a0Modern Art and worked for a period as a stage designer. He returned to London to take an MA at the Courtauld. In 1953 he saw the major show of cubism in Paris at the Mus\u00e9e d&apos;Art Moderne and decided to write his doctoral thesis at\u00a0the Courtauld on the formative years of the movement, from 1907, when Picasso painted Les Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon, until the outbreak of war in 1914. The resulting book won the approval of both Braque and Picasso and became a keystone in Golding&apos;s life. Although he had decided while he\u00a0was studying that he would work as an artist as well as a historian, inevitably the acclaim for his book drew Golding deeper into academic life. He started to teach at the Courtauld in 1959. He was a reader in art history by\u00a01981, at which point the Royal College of Art made him the siren offer of senior tutor in the painting school. Golding took it, in the knowledge that at the RCA he could immerse himself full time in the practice of painting, his own as well as his students&apos;. &quot;I am not interested in art as self-discovery or therapy,&quot; he said. He wanted to be a full-time professional, committed to pushing painting forward in the exploration of colour and light. His painting was already gaining recognition, notably when he was included in the 1974 Hayward Annual, British Painting, selected by Andrew Forge. In the 1980s he had a run of one-man shows in top galleries, including Juda Rowan in London and the Oxford Museum of Modern Art, as well as in Tokyo, Sydney and at the Yale Centre for British Art in Connecticut, where the catalogue for his show was written by\u00a0Forge, who, like Golding, was a\u00a0painter and deeply sensitive critic. Golding&apos;s knowledge of Renaissance painting, especially the great Venetians and particularly their rendering of the fall of light on to bodies, the way it breaks up outlines and dissolves form and mass, informed his own work as he moved out of figuration and into abstract canvases in which light was the subject. He painted vertical streaks of\u00a0colour down his canvases like pleated light (as he put it) and occasionally on, say, a misty blue, he would scatter clusters of gold pigment to reflect the actual light. After the end of the 20th century, he started to structure his paintings so that they appeared to be based on photographs from thousands of feet above the Earth, with &quot;roads&quot; and &quot;bridges&quot; and &quot;canals&quot;. He even called one of these canvases Mappa Mundi. In retrospect, though, it seems to have been inevitable that Golding&apos;s own painting should be overshadowed by his reputation as a historian. As a teacher, he was popular with his students. In\u00a0person he looked a little like Picasso, but his voice was soft and his delivery almost contemplative, as though he was thinking his way forward, trying his ideas out on his audience as he formulated them, even on subjects he\u00a0knew well. The historian James Joll, with whom he shared his life for many years, died in 1994. He is survived by two nephews, Michael and Richard. \u2022 Harold John Golding, artist, art historian and curator, born 10 September 1929; died 9 April 2012 \u2022 This article was amended on 12 April 2012.

A military band struck up the British national anthem as the prime minister stood to attention on a podium overlooking a beautifully manicured lawn in front of a white stuccoed presidential palace. Britain&apos;s globe-trotting prime minister, who is racing round Asia this week at a pace to rival Tony Blair at his most frantic, could have thought for a moment he was eleven time zones away in Washington. It is just a month since Cameron was given the full stars and stripes treatment, with military bands and national anthems, by Barack Obama on the south lawn of the White House. The welcome ceremony in Indonesia was one of the grandest elements in Cameron&apos;s trip around Asia in which he is visiting five countries in as many days. His recent travels, which will have taken him from Ground Zero in New York to the crumbling colonial splendour of Rangoon in a month, will now reach a high point when the prime minister becomes the first western leader to meet Aung San Suu Kyi since her landslide victory in Burma&apos;s parliamentary byelections. Cameron, who has a mischievous sense of humour in private, loves the thought that the two trips could not have been better designed to upset Gordon Brown. The former prime minister regarded himself as something of a spiritual guide to Obama but was never given the red carpet treatment. He also regards himself as one of Britain&apos;s greatest champions of Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 he devoted a chapter in his book on courage to the Nobel laureate. &quot;The certainty of Gordon&apos;s sofa-destroying anger is satisfying,&quot; one Cameron ally said. The fawning attention on a high-profile overseas visit is a perk that normally arrives late during a prime minister&apos;s term in office, by which time they are established on the world stage. But Cameron has become a notable figure internationally \u2013 though without the star pulling power of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair \u2013 relatively early in his premiership after the success of the Anglo-French mission in Libya. Barely two years into his term in office, Cameron is now encountering the twin imposters feared and welcomed by any established prime minister \u2013 praise abroad and opprobrium back home. The prime minister flew out of Heathrow on Monday afternoon on his chartered Boeing 747 \u2013 owned by the Angolan state oil company, much to the embarrassment of No 10 \u2013 amid criticism that his grip on the government is somewhat short of firm. A series of bumps, ranging from the scrapping of the 50p tax rate to the &quot;granny tax&quot;, the &quot;pasty tax&quot; and the row over donations to the Conservative party, have prompted criticism that Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street have lost their famed political antennae. Anthony King, the veteran political academic, lambasted Cameron in a searing critique in the FT on Monday. Cameron is Britain&apos;s first &quot;dilettante&quot; prime minister since Herbert Asquith, King wrote in an FT article, citing a series of mistakes on party funding and the NHS bill. The prime minister has not looked troubled during his Asian trip. But he has acknowledged that his government has experienced a less than glorious couple of weeks. &quot;There isn&apos;t a day of doing this job where you don&apos;t learn lessons, you don&apos;t learn important lessons,&quot; he said in Jakarta. But the usually unflappable prime minister did momentarily let his guard drop during a briefing on his flight from London to Tokyo on Monday. After talking about the importance of his trade mission to Asia the prime minister made some pointed remarks about the Liberal Democrats&apos; unease about plans to monitor emails and to create so called &quot;secret&quot; courts. &quot;Why would we be doing this in a cabinet of Conservatives, including quite a lot of liberal Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats, if there wasn&apos;t a problem?&quot; he asked, in remarks which highlighted the deep frustration in No 10 that the Lib Dems are complaining about plans they accepted in cabinet committee discussions. The domestic rows followed the prime minister to the ornate reception room in the presidential palace in Jakarta. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the leader of the world&apos;s largest Muslim country who had discussed the crisis in Syria with the prime minister, looked on politely as Cameron was asked about the fine details of last month&apos;s budget thanks to the row back home over the cap on philanthropic giving. The prime minister said he would listen &quot;sympathetically&quot; to the concerns raised by charities. The press conference in the palace came as Downing Street aides wondered nervously whether yet another overseas trip would be disrupted. An hour earlier news had reached Jakarta of a tsunami warning after a large earthquake struck off the coast of Aceh, prompting tsunami warnings. The president put paid to any changes in the prime minister&apos;s plans when he said he hoped he would remain in Indonesia. Mercifully, the earthquake was downgraded and fears of a large tsunami proved unfounded. Throughout the five day trip \u2013 as he inspected the honour guard at the palace in Jakarta, walked along its gilded corridors with his customary confident poise and as he breezily faced students at the Malaysian campus of Nottingham University on Thursday \u2013 Cameron has displayed his greatest strengths as a prime minister. His stamina and clear mind mean he has little trouble in remaining easily on top of his brief as officials flag. But the ease with which Cameron has moved from one country to another this week \u2013 and from one complex international or economic brief to another \u2013 also shows his greatest weakness as prime minister. With a strong Oxford first in PPE, he knows he has a formidable technical brain and walks into every meeting utterly confident he will command the room. Anthony King identified an &quot;insouciance&quot;. Where Blair used to fret about the direction of his government, prompting him to fax pained handwritten notes to staff on Sunday nights, Cameron watches television. One senior broadcasting figure was astonished by the prime minister&apos;s knowledge of an array of television programmes during a recent meeting. Cameron used this knowledge to good effect on Thursday when Najib Razak, his Malaysian counterpart, said he was a fan of Yes Prime Minister. Cameron recalled how he had concluded, in an essay as an Oxford undergraduate, that the comedy abbot how Whitehall civil servants run Britain was not true to life. &quot;I can tell you, as prime minister, it is true to life,&quot; he said, to laughter. In his appearance with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak, the prime minister spoke about extremism and his impending visit to Burma. He also said Najib was right to say that Britain, which has not sent a prime minister to Malaysia since John Major in 1993, is guilty of &quot;benign neglect&quot; towards an old friend in the most booming region of the world. The exchanges at Nottingham University&apos;s plush Malaysian campus, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, encapsulated much of the prime minister&apos;s approach to foreign policy. His determination to re-establish relations with the country, one of south east Asia&apos;s booming economies which hopes to take its GDP from $8,400 per head to $15,000 by 2020, shows he remains firmly attached to one of the planks of his original foreign policy blueprint \u2013 cutting Britain&apos;s record fiscal deficit by improving trade. Shortly after becoming prime minister Cameron told a special conference of every British ambassador that they should be &quot;economic ambassadors for Britain&quot;. David Miliband reflected the scepticism of many in the foreign policy establishment when he described Cameron&apos;s focus on trade as &quot;low-grade mercantilism&quot;. Foreign policy grandees said the focus on trade would not last because political realities \u2013 extremism and changes in Burma debated at the Nottingham campus \u2013 would rear up. This happened most spectacularly in Libya when Cameron, who famously described himself as &quot;not a naive neocon&quot; shortly before Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s regime imploded, embarked on an intervention in the tradition of Tony Blair&apos;s liberal interventionism. This came as a surprise to Blair who remembered how Cameron offended the US by declaring in a speech on the fifth anniversary of 9/11 in 2006 that democracy &quot;cannot be dropped from the air by an unmanned drone&quot;. Downing Street sources insist that the prime minister has been consistent. &quot;There has been no volte-face,&quot; one source said. &quot;There are three planks to the prime minister&apos;s foreign policy \u2013 trade, a willingness to celebrate democracy and a fundamental pragmatism to his approach. People say that Libya showed that the prime minister had turned into a Tony Blair liberal interventionist. That is wrong. Libya actually sat with the second and third pillars \u2013 celebrating democracy and pragmatism. Britain looked at the weapons in its armoury and made a decision about what it could do.&quot; Cameron will no doubt walk tall in Burma when he becomes the first sitting British prime minister to visit the country. But by next week he will come back to earth as he returns to the humdrum life of proving he is no dilettante."}, {"sentences": ["This app may be more efficient, and throws in extra features too like To-Do lists, weather forecasts and photo-notes.iPhone / iPad Tokyo in Hipix Photographer Tomoyuki Uchida has taken a series of 24 huge-resolution images of Tokyo, which have been turned into a glossy book-app with built-in sound, animation and links."], "tags": ["Apps", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "iPhone", "iPad", "Android", "Windows Phone", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Media", "Tetris", "William Shakespeare", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-13T09:25:21Z", "title": "Apps Rush: Shakespeare's The Tempest, LoveThis, Tetris, 7digital, Punch!

Not much, except a loathing of the Bauhaus and the style of design it inspired. Ulbricht called it &quot;an expression of cosmopolitan building&quot; that was &quot;hostile to the people&quot; and to &quot;the national architectural heritage&quot;. Wolfe called it &quot;an architecture whose tenets prohibit every manifestation of exuberance, power, empire, grandeur or even high spirits and playfulness&quot;. For Ulbricht it was alien to Germany, for Wolfe it was alien to America. Both agreed that it was placeless, soulless and indifferent to ordinary people&apos;s needs. And if the Bauhaus attracted such consistent forms of hostility, that is due to the power and coherence of the image it presented to the world, of disciplined and monochrome modernist simplicity, usually involving steel and glass. Given that it was actually a short-lived and semi-nomadic school of design and art with the usual riot of individualists, visionaries, eccentrics, schemers and geniuses that such places attract, this appearance of unity was an achievement. From May the Barbican is staging an exhibition of 400 of the Bauhaus&apos;s works, the first in Britain on this scale for 44 years. It will stress the breadth of its output, including paintings by Paul Klee and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, furniture by Marcel Breuer, textiles by Gunta St\u00f6lzl, architecture by Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, photography, film, ceramics, theatre, graphics and product design. It promises to portray the central ideal of the Bauhaus, &quot;to change society in the aftermath of the first world war&quot;, as the Barbican puts it, and &quot;to find a new way of living&quot;. When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1919 it was with these aspirations for a new life, and for a multiplicity of creative disciplines, together with a stress on the importance of making things as opposed to just theorising about them. But there was not yet a distinct form or direction to these ideas, and almost anything could be considered as a route to a better future, including new spiritualist religions and a strict vegetarian diet which had to be livened up with plenty of garlic. According to Gropius&apos;s spectacular wife Alma, whose other husbands and lovers included Gustav Mahler, Oskar Kokoschka and the writer Franz Werfel, the most distinctive feature of the Bauhaus in its early days was garlic on the breath. Certain questions were unresolved and intensely debated. Was craft or mass production more important? Could art and manufacturing be reconciled? Did individual expression impede service to society? In 1925 the school moved to Dessau, between Berlin and Leipzig. At the time it was an industrial boom town, the base of the Junkers aeroplane company. The harder-edged, more technocratic arguments started to prevail. The young Marcel Breuer started collaborating with Junkers on making tubular steel furniture of a kind that would eventually become commonplace in boardrooms and forward-thinking homes. Greater attention was paid to the commercial development and marketing of Bauhaus-designed objects. In Dessau they built, in the extraordinarily short time of one year, the Gropius-designed building that became as famous as the institution it served. With its glass curtain walls and spare rectilinear forms, it crystallised what would become the dominant type of modernist architecture. It was one of the most prodigiously influential buildings of all time, a prototype that would be followed by office buildings, hotels, schools and hospitals in almost any country you can think of. In Dessau, Gropius and his followers could also try out other architectural ideas on the row of houses built for Bauhaus masters, and on 300 low-cost houses built for industrial workers on the Dessau-Torten estate. In 1932, however, the school moved on again, to Berlin. The next year it fell victim to the National Socialists \u2013 another movement that, after the catastrophic trauma of the first world war, sought a new order and expressed itself through memorable visual imagery. Junkers started making Stuka divebombers, not Breuer chairs, and Dessau was all but flattened by bombing in 1945. The Bauhaus building was severely damaged, and only recently has been fully restored. But its influence spread. The Bauhausler diaspora, of ex-students and teachers building in the style they had learned, extended to Tel Aviv and Tokyo. Gropius migrated via London to the United States, where he became a professor at Harvard and designed the Pan Am building above New York&apos;s Grand Central station, much disliked for the way it imposed on the view down Park Avenue. He also designed the Playboy Club in London, prompting a new generation of radicals to denounce him for selling out. To visit the Bauhaus building now is to be struck again by the extraordinary way in which a single construction in a provincial town could have had so much effect. It is also to see nuances that, inevitably, imitators lost. For years the Bauhaus building was known to the wider world mostly through a few black-and-white photographs that stress its more easily copied details, but miss the point that it was a framework for the creative energy of the school. Its stairs, workshops and balconies were places of display as well as function, and its glass walls made a spectacle of its internal activities. One of the key spaces was an auditorium whose stage is connected to the communal canteen, thereby bringing together performance and life. It also has a subtle colour scheme, contrary to Wolfe&apos;s assertions that the Bauhaus was only interested in black, white and grey. If it looked like a factory it also had properties of a commune, a cult centre and a theatre. Although it was founded by Gropius, architecture was not at first the main point of the Bauhaus, and its vast legacy extends from graphics through product design to art. But architecture came to dominate the public image of the place, and the style of the building proved easier to record than the events that happened there. What Wolfe and Ulbricht railed against was its impact on the built environment. Which, if you only look at its form and not at its content, does indeed look sterile. Hopefully, the Barbican show will put this misconception right. As for Alma, she tired of the work ethic of her husband and his school. At least if Tom Lehrer is to believed. As &quot;Alma&quot;, his tribute to her, has it: But he would work late at the Bauhaus, And only came home now and then. She said, &quot;What am I running? A chow house? It&apos;s time to change partners again.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Frankland worked for the paper from 1962 to 1992, including spells in Washington and Tokyo.", "He later worked in Tokyo and then Washington, the latter assignment being accepted reluctantly in view of Frankland&apos;s disgust at America&apos;s conduct during the Vietnam war, though he later fell in love with the US."], "tags": ["UK news", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Russia", "Vietnam", "MI6"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-14T23:06:42Z", "title": "Mark Frankland, Observer writer of distinction, dies aged 77", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/15/newspapers-pressandpublishing", "article": "Mark Frankland, one of the Observer&apos;s most distinguished foreign correspondents, died last week. He was 77. Frankland worked for the paper from 1962 to 1992, including spells in Washington and Tokyo. He also served two stints as the Observer&apos;s Moscow correspondent, the latter from 1982 to 1985, when he was expelled by the Soviet government. &quot;Mark Frankland was one of the most illuminating commentators on Russia and eastern Europe, especially in the period when the Soviet empire was breaking up,&quot; said Donald Trelford, who edited the Observer from 1975 to 1993. &quot;Mark also wrote shrewdly about Japan and the United States. &quot;Wherever he went, he immersed himself in the history and culture of the country, which gave his journalism a serious academic quality without ever losing the interest of the reader. He was a gentle man with cultivated tastes in music and art and a bright-eyed curiosity about everything.&quot; His former colleague William Keegan added: &quot;In addition to covering the diplomacy, the politics and wars (hot and cold), he was a master of feeling the texture of what life was really like beneath the surface.&quot; Frankland was also the author of a number of books, including Child of My Time, in which he relates, in painful but gripping detail, his grim, upper-class English upbringing, describing his alcoholic mother&apos;s marriage as that of a &quot;drowning woman relying for salvation on a man who could scarcely swim himself&quot;. In ladylike fashion, his mother would buy only half bottles of gin, Frankland related, but from a variety of off-licences. After Cambridge, Frankland joined MI6 but left after a year, having experienced training that he later described in caustic, mocking terms. His brief background in espionage was to haunt him, however. In Russia, he was thought to be a British spy, in Vietnam a Soviet one, while in Britain he was often regarded as still being involved as &quot;a spook&quot;. In 1962 Frankland, who never married, served his first stint as the Observer&apos;s Moscow correspondent where he met the spies Burgess, Maclean and Philby before being sent to Indochina, where he covered the Vietnam war from 1967 to 1973. He later worked in Tokyo and then Washington, the latter assignment being accepted reluctantly in view of Frankland&apos;s disgust at America&apos;s conduct during the Vietnam war, though he later fell in love with the US. He had a second stint in Moscow, which ended in 1985 with his expulsion as an alleged spy by the Soviet government in a tit-for-tat move after Britain expelled several Russian officials. His demeanour in the office was always courteous, but reserved. Peter Beaumont, the Observer&apos;s foreign affairs editor, who worked with Frankland, described him as &quot;one of those rare combinations, an intelligent, observant, charming and unflappable man who would always find the time to help and advise younger reporters&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["From Dar es Salaam to Marrakech, Los Angeles to Tokyo and Beijing \u2013 I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever witnessed that level of excitement, particularly among the elite competitors,&quot; claims Coe from Locog&apos;s offices on the 23rd floor of a Canary Wharf tower overlooking the Olympic Park."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Lord Coe", "London", "UK news", "Olympic Stadium", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-16T20:10:00Z", "title": "London Olympics chief remains confident with 100 days to go", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/16/london-olympics-chief-confident-100-days", "article": "With 100 days until the opening ceremony, the man indelibly linked with delivering the London 2012 Olympics will be fretting nervously, desperately hoping for the best while at the same time fearing the worst. But once his beloved Chelsea&apos;s clash with Barcelona on Wednesday is out of the way, Lord Coe will go back to attempting to project an air of intense confidence in his team&apos;s ability to deliver the biggest sporting show on earth. &quot;One hundred days has got that ring of &apos;it&apos;s here&apos;. It is a big moment,&quot; says Coe, chair of the London 2012 organising committee, Locog. &quot;The really important facet of all this is that it&apos;s 100 days before we welcome the world. Of course, there has been interest in other Games. But I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever witnessed a level of excitement at this level in so many different countries for what we&apos;re doing.&quot; In the face of a towering in-tray, from final preparations for the torch relay to the completion of the controversial ticket sales process and mounting fears of protests, Coe claims the London Olympics is the most anticipated since the modern Games began in 1896. The double Olympic gold medallist and former Tory MP fishes out a spread of international newspaper cuttings, saying he has had an epiphany in recent months as he has travelled the world. He is just back from updating the Association of National Olympic Committees on final preparations in Moscow on Sunday. &quot;It&apos;s really occurred to me in the last few weeks. From Dar es Salaam to Marrakech, Los Angeles to Tokyo and Beijing \u2013 I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever witnessed that level of excitement, particularly among the elite competitors,&quot; claims Coe from Locog&apos;s offices on the 23rd floor of a Canary Wharf tower overlooking the Olympic Park. &quot;It was a really good wake-up call. We are delivering for 200 countries and many of them have never been as excited about coming to an Olympic Games.&quot; There are longstanding fears that the conditions to which host cities must sign up will stifle the atmosphere \u2013 from\u00a0obsessive control of the Olympic brand to the huge security operation and the &quot;Zil&quot; lanes for transporting competitors, the media and VIPs around the\u00a0capital. But Coe promises that the party won&apos;t be dampened, even with the 35,000 security guards and police on duty inside and outside the venues and the array of military hardware including a warship on the river Thames and rocket launchers on Blackheath. &quot;I&apos;m a proud Londoner. I want to show London at its best, the UK as well. I want London to be seen at ease with itself. That&apos;s the city I recognise. It&apos;s a relaxed city, a great place to be, a great place to celebrate, a great place to be educated,&quot; he says. To that end, he is insistent that organisers will take a relatively relaxed attitude to protests that will inevitably accompany the torch relay, which starts its 70-day tour of the UK in Land&apos;s End on 19 May, and to the Games itself. Protesters claiming that sponsors such as Rio Tinto, Dow and BP are using the Games to &quot;greenwash&quot; their image, and offshoots of the Occupy movement who may use the event as a backdrop to anti-capitalism protests, do not leave Coe unduly worried. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s inevitable, but we should be realistic. We live in a democracy; we do have a long tradition of peaceful protest,&quot; he says. &quot;As long as that protest doesn&apos;t disrupt or become a public order issue or endanger the safety of our competitors or the public, I&apos;m not going to sit here fulminating or becoming completely paranoid about it.&quot; While he was &quot;profoundly depressed&quot; by the antics of the &quot;completely self-indulgent&quot; Trenton Oldfield, who secured blanket media coverage by successfully stopping the Boat Race, he said it was important not to get the threat out of proportion. &quot;From time to time, you will get people who will use whatever platform is available to them to get their message across. I&apos;m not being cavalier or sanguine about it. It comes with the territory. That is the nature of the country we live in and, on balance, I&apos;d rather live here than anywhere else.&quot; With the 100-day countdown beginning on Wednesday, one of the biggest challenges facing organisers is a simple logistical one. The vision expounded by Coe in 2005 \u2013 of a &quot;compact&quot; Games that would not leave any white elephants and use temporary venues in famous central London locations \u2013 has left Locog with a big construction task in the\u00a0final 100 days. &quot;We are absolutely on the right time lines. But the vision has loaded more work for an organising committee at the back end. We always recognised that, which is why we were keen to get out of the traps quickly,&quot; says Coe. &quot;I&apos;d have rather put more pressure on to deliver at the end of the project than be asked what I&apos;m going to do with my permanent water polo venue after the Games.&quot; The other pressing task for organisers is to get the country on board. Much will depend on the reaction to the final tranche of ticket sales. The final batch of 1.2m tickets, aside from 1.5m remaining football tickets, go on sale next month. Coe accepts it is vital that the sale does not fall victim to the technical issues that dogged earlier sales rounds if public confidence is to be maintained. He insists that organisers are on target to keep a promise that two-thirds of the 1 million who missed out in the opening round of the ballot will get a ticket. One lingering fear is that the crowds within the venues will be more SW19 (mostly white, middle class and middle aged) than E20 (the new postcode given to the Olympic Park in Stratford). But Coe says the test events attracted a mixture of fans, and Olympics-linked cultural and community projects have had an encouraging response. &quot;I do spend a lot of time travelling around the country,&quot; he says. &quot;The story is there, I see it every day of the week. I was in Becontree and 1,000 new members had joined the leisure centre in January; the diving club 50 yards to the left had tripled its numbers since Beijing because they all want to be Tom Daley. I know it&apos;s happening out there. &quot;I go 10 minutes down the road to Hornchurch and I&apos;m talking to a 16-year-old rock band who have written an Olympic anthem.&quot; He says he has not come face-to-face with Olympic cynics who believe the whole thing is a waste of money in a time of austerity: &quot;I come in on the tube, I&apos;m on public transport. I&apos;ve been an MP. Anyone who went through the 1992 to 1997 parliament \u2013 people were not slow in telling you what they thought. Overwhelmingly, in the cold conversations I have with people on the train, I don&apos;t for one minute think people will sit this dance out. I think it will be an extraordinary few weeks. &quot;I&apos;m quintessentially British. It doesn&apos;t feel instinctively right to force-feed people into a funnel of excitement. I just don&apos;t think you can do that.&quot; But he remains supremely confident that public excitement will begin to bubble around the torch relay and come to the boil with Danny Boyle&apos;s opening ceremony on 27 July. Coe insists, too, that the most contentious aspect of the 2012 story \u2013 the legacy promises made to secure the Games in the first place \u2013 are on track to be delivered. &quot;There is a political consensus that a good sports policy is a good health policy is a good education policy. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any question about that. I think we&apos;ve shifted that dial a long way. It would be quite hard to turn that dial back,&quot; he says. Others are altogether less sure whether momentum can be maintained once the circus has left town and political focus has dulled. But, before he can look to the future, Coe invokes his experience as a competitor to illustrate the need to focus obsessively on the detail of 100 days that he accepts will make or break the Games. &quot;It&apos;s not at risk of unravelling. But there is not a single person, including me, that doesn&apos;t think we&apos;ve got to do the best work of our lives. This is our time. There are no tomorrows here. We have got to nail this now.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["However, quite apart from other achievements such as winning a gold medal at the 1967 World Student Games in Tokyo, she did what tennis players always dream of doing \u2013 hit a winner there that really mattered."], "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-17T17:41:09Z", "title": "Nell Truman obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/17/nell-truman", "article": "Nell Truman Robinson, who has died aged 66 after a series of strokes, may not have been the most celebrated tennis player ever to compete on Wimbledon&apos;s grass. However, quite apart from other achievements such as winning a gold medal at the 1967 World Student Games in Tokyo, she did what tennis players always dream of doing \u2013 hit a winner there that really mattered. It won Britain the Wightman Cup \u2013 an\u00a0annual US v UK women&apos;s event that came to an end in 1989 \u2013 when she and her sister, Christine Truman, reached match point in the decisive seventh match against the US at Wimbledon in 1968. The odds would have been on her taller, older, more experienced sibling playing the shot that gave Britain its first victory over the Americans in eight years. However, Nell got the job done with a low backhand volley \u2013 a memorable moment for a fine player destined never to be the best in her family. But Nell did rise to become Britain&apos;s sixth-ranked player and went on to enjoy a solid career, especially in doubles. With Christine, she had already reached the quarter finals of the ladies doubles at Wimbledon in 1965, and did so again in 1969. Then, partnered by Roger Taylor, she reached the semi-final of the mixed doubles at the US Open in 1970 and, a year later, alongside Scotland&apos;s Winnie Shaw, made it to the final of the French Open doubles. She also won an indoor singles title in Germany in 1971 before joining the fledgling women&apos;s pro circuit that was just getting under way in the US, sponsored by Virginia Slims cigarettes and led by Billie Jean King. Frances Ellen Truman was born in Loughton, Essex, the youngest of Stanley and Aimee Truman&apos;s six children. There was very little chance of\u00a0the baby everyone called Nell failing\u00a0to follow her siblings as a serious athlete. Christine became one of the nation&apos;s sporting darlings, winning the French Open and reaching the Wimbledon final; Elizabeth captained the Lancashire tennis team; Humphrey not only played in the All\u00a0England Championships but was the RAF champion; and Isabel played at\u00a0junior Wimbledon. While Stanley Truman provided the wherewithal for all this sporting activity through a successful career as a chartered accountant, Mrs Truman kept everyone&apos;s focus firmly on a fuzzy ball that, in those days, was white. A sensible \u2013 some would have said austere \u2013 hat placed firmly on her head no matter what the weather, Nell&apos;s mother would be at courtside offering energising, and often not uncritical, support. The Trumans were a sporting clan and Mrs Truman their leader. Having attended Queen Anne&apos;s school, in Caversham, Berkshire, Nell gained tennis and squash blues during her time studying geography at St\u00a0Anne&apos;s College, Oxford. She seemed quite content to leave the tennis scene after marrying Christopher Robinson, a London solicitor, in 1972. A keen gardener and golfer, she chaired the governors of Dame Bradbury&apos;s school in Saffron Walden, Essex, for six years, and was president of the Saffron Walden branch of the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies.

Steve Redgrave famously tried and failed to curtail his magnificent obsession and Greg Searle is now following in his wake. To mark his 40th birthday last month the oarsman known as &quot;Grandad&quot; to the rest of his crew could easily have grown a pony-tail, hired a motorbike and taken his mid-life crisis for a spin. Instead GB rowing&apos;s answer to Old Man River is still rolling along, determined to recapture his lost, golden youth in a summer haze of retro Olympic joy. It is already an epic quest with 100 days still left until the London Games. Everyone of a certain vintage remembers the fabulously tearful, lip-quivering GB cox Garry Herbert from Barcelona in 1992, up on the podium with Searle and his brother Jonny following their gold medal victory in the coxed pair. Imagine the reaction, 20 years on, if Searle were to triumph again, this time as a member of the men&apos;s eight? The outpouring of emotion around Eton Dorney would resonate with every middle-aged man who has ever wondered if he might have one last glorious victory left in him. For that is precisely what has driven Searle through the recurring pain of top-level training and testing. Having retired from international rowing in the wake of the Sydney Olympics in 2000, when he finished fourth, he found himself browsing the dates for the 2012 Games and realised the rowing schedule in London would be similar to the race programme in Barcelona. &quot;I realised I could win a gold medal virtually 20 years to the day since I won the first one on 2 August. That made me excited. It felt like now or never. Was I going to go to my grave having not tried or was I going to take the risk?&quot; As part of his day job advising companies on how to plan ahead \u2013 he is a partner in the performance development consultancy Lane4 founded by the former Olympic swimmer Adrian Moorhouse \u2013 he subsequently held a coaching workshop with a group of Honda car dealers during which the conversation drifted towards 2012. &quot;They asked me what I&apos;d like to do at the London Olympics. Coaching? A management job? Working for sponsors? I thought about it and decided the best thing of all would be to be an athlete. From there it started to take shape more and more \u2026&quot; The first step was to approach the stern figure of J\u00fcrgen Grobler, the GB men&apos;s coach, to find out what chance he had of being considered. &quot;I trust J\u00fcrgen, as I have done since the first day I came down in 2009 and said I wanted to get involved again. He was very clear no one was too young or too old if they were good enough.&quot; Searle, possibly encouraged by Redgrave&apos;s extraordinary fifth gold medal-winning effort in Sydney at the age of 38, duly set out to test the truth of Grobler&apos;s words. It has not been an entirely smooth ride. Searle had stayed pretty fit, working as a grinder for the British sailing team in the 2002 America&apos;s Cup Challenger Series, running the London Marathon and completing a London Triathlon. Even his resilient body, though, has been protesting. A bad back ruled him out of a post-Christmas training camp in South Africa and the family sacrifices have been significant. His all-consuming mission has even extended to resting on the sofa while his wife, Jenny, selflessly mows the lawn. &quot;You&apos;ve got say to yourself: &apos;Every day matters.&apos; Each day I&apos;ve chosen I will get eight hours sleep, I will go to bed at 10pm, I&apos;ll drink water and decaff tea instead of anything else. I still haven&apos;t had an alcoholic drink since my birthday and I don&apos;t plan to. &quot;The most difficult choices are the ones around my kids. Adam wants to play football in the garden but I don&apos;t want to hurt my back, or break my finger catching a cricket ball. He says: &apos;I want you to be like a normal dad.&apos; It&apos;s difficult not to be that.&quot; Will it all be worth it? Searle has already done enough to nail down the No6 seat in the men&apos;s eight for the forthcoming World Cup regattas in Belgrade and Lucerne, with the GB Olympic squad due to be confirmed on 6 June. There is sufficient talent fore and aft to supply a definite medal opportunity and Searle&apos;s experience offers a nice counter-balance to the youthful power of Constantine Louloudis, just 20. &quot;Greg isn&apos;t as young as he was but he still has the exceptional ability he had at 20,&quot; said David Tanner, GB rowing&apos;s performance director. &quot;He adds a certain weight to the crew because of what he&apos;s done and his confidence. He has always had charisma and he brings that to the boat.&quot; Searle is also a relic, in the nicest possible way, of an evocative era in British sport. Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, Linford Christie are just three of his former team-mates. Steve Ovett wrote him &quot;a nice letter&quot; after the 1992 Games and the Barcelona experience is still vivid. &quot;I remember being impressed by the enormity of it and how many diverse people there were there. I suppose I thought all athletes were 6ft 5in and built like us. Suddenly you&apos;re there among pocket-sized gymnasts and different people from around the world. I also remember thinking there were people with a bit of attitude about themselves. You imagine going to the Olympics will be really friendly but, actually, no. Everyone is psyching themselves up and getting ready to race. There&apos;s quite a lot of ego flying around. It&apos;s as if they&apos;re preparing to go to war, albeit a friendly one. That&apos;s the environment you&apos;re putting yourself in.&quot; He also tells an entertaining story about meeting the swimmer Sharron Davies at the opening ceremony. &quot;I was quite excited and had my photo taken with her. I messaged her to wish her good luck and she replied saying she might come and watch my rowing races. I boasted about this to my mates, one of whom logged on to the computer as me and sent her an email which accelerated any relationship there might have been way beyond appropriate levels. That was more or less it on that front.&quot; On 2 August every year, nevertheless, Searle still embraces that colourful period of his life by swapping celebratory texts with his brother and the lachrymose Herbert. The oldest men&apos;s rower in Olympic history is Oscar Rompani of Argentina, who was 60 when he rowed in the coxed pairs at the 1964 Games in Tokyo, but Searle will deserve genuine worldwide acclaim if he strikes gold again. &quot;There are a lot of things I&apos;ve been putting off,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven&apos;t been properly on holiday with my family, for example, for two and a half years. That&apos;s why winning would mean even more this time, because it&apos;s more challenging. It&apos;s so hard to do this at 40.&quot; His &quot;incredible pride&quot; will be greater still if he can transform the entire nation into towpath fanatics once again. &quot;The difference with the Olympics is that a lot of other people care too. Even those car dealers still cared 15 years on. That&apos;s what&apos;s special about it.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, has angered China after announcing plans to buy a group of islands at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute.", "&quot;Tokyo will protect the Senkaku Islands,&quot; he said in a speech to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank.", "He did not reveal how much the Tokyo metropolitan government would pay the Japanese owner for three of five main islands, saying only: &quot;It&apos;s not that much.&quot; Central government pays \u00a524.5m (\u00a3187,400) a year in rent to the owners of the three of the five main islands in the Senkaku group, which are administered by Okinawa prefecture."], "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Senkaku Islands"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T13:11:00Z", "title": "Tokyo's rightwing governor plans to buy disputed Senkaku Islands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/tokyo-governor-senkaku-islands-china", "article": "The governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, has angered China after announcing plans to buy a group of islands at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute. Both countries claim sovereignty over the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, which are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potentially large natural gas deposits. Ishihara, a rightwing populist who has never shied away from provoking the Chinese, raised the idea of buying the islands from their private owners during a trip to Washington this week. &quot;Tokyo will protect the Senkaku Islands,&quot; he said in a speech to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank. &quot;Why would any country have a problem with that?&quot; He said the presence of Chinese fishery patrol boats in the area was tantamount to a &quot;declaration of war&quot; against Japan. He did not reveal how much the Tokyo metropolitan government would pay the Japanese owner for three of five main islands, saying only: &quot;It&apos;s not that much.&quot; Central government pays \u00a524.5m (\u00a3187,400) a year in rent to the owners of the three of the five main islands in the Senkaku group, which are administered by Okinawa prefecture.     Location of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands    The uninhabited islands are extremely important to Japan&apos;s development of energy sources and fisheries, Ishihara&apos;s metropolitan government said in a statement. China condemned the move, having previously warned it would take &quot;all necessary steps&quot; to protect the islands. &quot;Any unilateral action taken by Japan on the Diaoyu and nearby islands is illegal and invalid, and cannot change the reality of China&apos;s ownership,&quot; Liu Weimin, a foreign ministry spokesman, said. &quot;We do not wish statements in Japan to encroach on China&apos;s sovereignty and harm China-Japan ties. I believe they not only damage the overall state of China-Japan relations, but also harm Japan&apos;s international image.&quot; A foreign ministry spokesman in Taiwan, which also claims the islands, said Ishihara&apos;s plan was totally unacceptable. Sovereignty over the island has long been a source of friction between China and Japan, where concern is rising over Beijing&apos;s increasingly robust naval presence in the East China Sea. A 2008 agreement to jointly develop gas fields in the area has made little headway and Japan has accused China of drilling unilaterally. Relations reached their lowest point in years in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the islands. The trawler&apos;s captain was released after a short detention, angering Japanese hawks who believe he should have been prosecuted. Ishihara&apos;s gesture is also directed at Japan&apos;s centrist prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whom he has accused of failing to protect the country&apos;s territorial interests for fear of upsetting China. Noda has since indicated that the state is considering buying the islands, a move that would further enrage China. &quot;We would like to keep all options open,&quot; he said in parliament. Conservative online commenters applauded Ishihara&apos;s audacity, but the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun accused him of jeopardising Japan&apos;s relations with a vital trading partner. &quot;Even though Ishihara is the governor of the capital of Japan, he is in no position to settle an international territorial dispute,&quot; the paper said in an editorial. &quot;We can only call him irresponsible for talking big, fully knowing its negative impact on Japan&apos;s diplomacy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Now, Steidl are about to publish Photo Express: Tokyo by Keizo Kitajima, another intriguing photobook albeit of a more raw, confrontational kind.", "Born in 1954, Kitajima studied photography in a class run by Moriyama in 1975 at Tokyo&apos;s Workshop school.", "The following year, he was one of a group of photographers, including Moriyama and Seiji Kurata, who formed CAMP, an independent photography gallery in Tokyo&apos;s Shinjuku district.", "(Later, in 2001, Kitajima founded the Photographers&apos; Gallery in Tokyo).", "This new version of Photo Express: Tokyo is a facsimile of a series of 12 booklets he published to tie in with a year-long exhibition of his work at CAMP in 1979.", "An image from Photo Express: Tokyo by Keizo Kitajima.", "He photographed at night, wandering around Tokyo, shooting on the streets, in bars and clubs, capturing the buzzing after-hours energy of the city.", "This is wilfully impressionistic street photography that adds up to a blurred portrait of night-time Tokyo, as well as suggesting Kitajima&apos;s state of mind at that time.", "Image from Photo Express: Tokyo by Keizo Kitajima.", "Photograph: Keizo Kitajima/Steidl    In many ways, Photo Express: Tokyo is at odds with the tradition of the Japanese photobook as art object: it is almost too energetic, too DIY to stand comparison with art books designed by the likes of Sugiura.", "All the same, it is an exciting and historically relevant artefact: 12 booklets inside a cardboard cover that hint at the creativity of a true iconoclast of photography who caught the Tokyo night in all its mystery and momentum."], "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture", "Books"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-20T15:42:57Z", "title": "Grainy glory: how Keizo Kitajima tore up the Japanese photobook", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/20/keizo-kitajima-photo-express-tokyo", "article": "The Japanese photobook is often an art object in itself, merging text, image and design into a unified whole that is often breathtaking in its ambition. Perhaps the most celebrated example is Chizu (The Map) by Kikuji Kawada, an incredibly rare and complex artefact designed by the great Kohei Sugiura. First published in 1965 (on the 20th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima) and reprinted by the art publishers, Nasrali, in 2005, The Map is perhaps the ultimate example of photobook as art. At an auction of rare photobooks at Christie&apos;s in 2010, a first edition went for over \u00a311,000. Kawada&apos;s photographs of walls, floors and objects scorched by the atomic blast are abstract and grainy, while Sugiura&apos;s design is a complex balancing of text and image. The reader must enter and engage with it in a tactile way, opening out the photo spreads as you would a large-scale map, and engaging with every layer of design and meaning. (You can glimpse the complexity of the book here.) I have already written about another great Japanese photobook, Ravens by Masahisa Fukase, when it was voted the best photobook of the previous 25 years in the British Journal of Photography in 2010. This year, in Tate Modern&apos;s big exhibition contrasting the work of William Klein and Daido Moriyama, the latter&apos;s prodigious output of photobooks will no doubt form a central part of the show. Now, Steidl are about to publish Photo Express: Tokyo by Keizo Kitajima, another intriguing photobook albeit of a more raw, confrontational kind. Born in 1954, Kitajima studied photography in a class run by Moriyama in 1975 at Tokyo&apos;s Workshop school. The following year, he was one of a group of photographers, including Moriyama and Seiji Kurata, who formed CAMP, an independent photography gallery in Tokyo&apos;s Shinjuku district. (Later, in 2001, Kitajima founded the Photographers&apos; Gallery in Tokyo). This new version of Photo Express: Tokyo is a facsimile of a series of 12 booklets he published to tie in with a year-long exhibition of his work at CAMP in 1979.     An image from Photo Express: Tokyo by Keizo Kitajima. Photograph: Keizo Kitajima /Steidl    On the evidence of these photographs, and his approach to exhibiting his work back in 1979, Kitajima applied a punk attitude to the making and disseminating of his work. Back then, he created a new exhibition of his photographs each month, covering every inch of the gallery walls with images, often in grids, of his work from the previous few weeks. He photographed at night, wandering around Tokyo, shooting on the streets, in bars and clubs, capturing the buzzing after-hours energy of the city. His images are grainy and dark in the manner of Moriyama or Anders Petersen, but even more extreme in their use of contrast and saturation. Sometimes, you have to look hard to see what exactly he has caught, particularly with his super-grainy close-ups of faces and figures: real people blend into billboard figures; others turn away or go about their business oblivious to his camera. There is constant movement. This is wilfully impressionistic street photography that adds up to a blurred portrait of night-time Tokyo, as well as suggesting Kitajima&apos;s state of mind at that time. Each of Kitajima&apos;s monthly shows was accompanied by a 16-page booklet, all 12 of which have been reproduced here in all their harsh, grainy glory. They give some sense of the energy and innovation that went into each show, which often included projections and prints pasted on to the gallery walls just hours after the photographs were taken. Sometimes, Kitajima would make the gallery his darkroom, attaching sheets of bromide paper to the walls, projecting images on to them, then applying developer and fixer with a sponge. His methodology was fast, haphazard and alert to all the possibilities of the accidental. The making and showing of the work became a kind of monthly art happening with Kitajima as the restless spirit at its centre.     Image from Photo Express: Tokyo by Keizo Kitajima.  Photograph: Keizo Kitajima/Steidl    In many ways, Photo Express: Tokyo is at odds with the tradition of the Japanese photobook as art object: it is almost too energetic, too DIY to stand comparison with art books designed by the likes of Sugiura. All the same, it is an exciting and historically relevant artefact: 12 booklets inside a cardboard cover that hint at the creativity of a true iconoclast of photography who caught the Tokyo night in all its mystery and momentum. Now see this Following on from the recent reprinting of the classic book, Les Amies de Place Blanche by the great Swedish photographer Christer Str\u00f6mholm, Michael Hoppen has a show devoted to the series. These often glamorous portraits of Pigalle&apos;s transsexual community in the early 1960s is also a glimpse of often harsh lives lived on the periphery of De Gaulle&apos;s conservative society. Beautifully composed and always sympathetic, they remain affecting to this day."}, {"sentences": ["For on the boat are not just trendy young Filipinos but kids from all over east Asia \u2013 from Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore."], "tags": ["Festivals", "Philippines holidays", "Travel", "Asia", "Festivals", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-20T21:45:00Z", "title": "Malasimbo music festival, the Philippines", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/apr/20/malasimbo-music-festival-philippines", "article": "It&apos;s two in the morning, or maybe it&apos;s three, and I am conducting a Filipino dub orchestra. The group is called Junior Kilat and it&apos;s fair to say they aren&apos;t responding effusively to my direction. Indeed it could be suggested that they aren&apos;t paying any attention to me at all. When I try to catch the eye of singer Errol &quot;Budoy&quot; Marabiles, he pretends there&apos;s something very interesting happening in the middle distance. But never mind \u2013 I persevere. Before heading to the Philippines, I had never imagined I would take to live dub with such enthusiasm. Perhaps it had something to do with the local brew, the cheap-as-chips \u2013 but far more potent \u2013 Tanduay Rhum. Or maybe it was the surroundings, the palm-filled hills of Puerto Galera. By a tranquil, azure bay on the north side of Mindoro island, 120km south of Manila, it earned its name in the 16th century as a port in a storm for Spanish galleons. Today it&apos;s a Unesco-designated reserve, and instead of colonial merchants, young travellers from around Asia, and further afield, are washing up on its shores.     Bay at Puerto Galera, Philippines Photograph: Paul MacInnes    A motley crew of British hacks and DJs, we&apos;re on the island for the Malasimbo Festival, and none of us is quite sure what to expect. We arrive on a Friday afternoon after a dusty drive from Manila and a crowded catamaran crossing to Mindoro. After a few restorative San Miguels, we&apos;re whisked into the hills towards Mount Malasimbo. It&apos;s a steep climb and a rocky road, not the ideal terrain for a jeepney (the local transport, an unfortunate combination of retired military vehicle and cattle truck). But after a few stalls and a couple of worrying moments of slippage we arrive at the entrance to the festival site, 250m above sea level. Complimentary Tanduays in hand, we head down a fairy light-lined path. Turning the corner into the festival, my mouth forms an involuntary &quot;wow&quot;. To the left of us an emerald slope rolls down into a broad clearing lined with palm trees. Lights installed among the fronds cast kaleidoscopic rays across the tree line and pieces of sculpture scattered beneath. The festival&apos;s single stage stands in the middle of the clearing where a band of percussionists are hammering out a series of complex, syncopated rhythms. We charge down the hill. It&apos;s only the second year of the Malasimbo Festival but in 12 months, attendance has more than doubled, to 5,000 people. Its aim is simple: rather than flying in acts from around the globe, Malasimbo concentrates on showcasing Filipino music (headliner Joe Bataan is a US citizen but of Filipino extraction, so he kind of counts). That means all strands of Filipino music, from soul to jazz, hip-hop to beat music, psych rock and as many permutations of dub reggae as you can imagine. Not everything is of the highest quality but there is a real sense of celebration to every performance and to be exposed to such a range of new music in one place is a rare occurrence \u2013 it feels a privilege to be there. That Friday night we stay on until the DJs among us, Dave Harvey and Steve Nickolls of Bristol-based Futureboogie, have played their mix of cutting-edge house and electro to a crowd which, by this hour, is anything but cutting-edge. We scramble for the last jeepney home and by the time the sun has come up we have descended the hill and are dozing by the pool of our hotel (there&apos;s no camping at Malasimbo, which might detract from the authentic festival experience, but does have its consolations).     Malasimbo Festival dancers Photograph: Paul Macinnes    A few hours later we&apos;re up again for day two, helped by a tosilog, the Filipino fry-up. Garlicky rice and fried eggs are served with tocino, thick slices of bacon marinated in anise wine and sugar. It&apos;s sweet, it&apos;s sour, it&apos;s full of fat and, with a side order of Jazz Chutney, it&apos;s the perfect way to start this particular day. From the hotel we head to the boat. Boat parties are what the Brits have brought to Malasimbo. The idea is that dancing all night on land is not enough; you need to dance all afternoon and throw yourself in the sea, too. So, anchored out in the bay, looking a bit like a floating climbing frame, is our venue, the Liki Tiki. Futureboogie, as fresh as the morning dew, are on the decks again and I offer moral support by imbibing more rum and hurling myself off the top deck. Nick Colgan, our host for the trip, is watching the crowd. A broad, bald Brummie who spent 25 years as tour manager for UB40, he now presides over a series of festivals that have helped make Croatia a clubbing destination. For his Garden Festival he took a scenic stretch of coast with friendly weather and created a different kind of festival, built around daytime boat parties. He&apos;s hoping to do the same in the Philippines, launching the Tropical Garden festival in spring 2012 on the same site. On this trip he veers between avuncular and hard-nosed, keeping an eye on everything from our wellbeing to the sound systems to the state of the jeepneys&apos; suspension. But while on the Liki Tiki, however, he could be forgiven for checking out the clientele and allowing a few bells to ring in his head. For on the boat are not just trendy young Filipinos but kids from all over east Asia \u2013 from Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore. These are kids who are used to clubbing but less familiar with being able to do it in wide-open spaces. They are well aware of the European festival habit and are keen to have one of their own \u2013 perhaps without the muddy fields, but that&apos;s not too difficult to achieve in this part of the world.     Percussionists, Malasimbo Festival    That said, when we head back up the hill that Saturday night a tropical shower becomes a persistent downpour \u2013 not that it stops the crowd, or the increasingly redoubtable Futureboogie boys. The next morning, the skies are blue once more and I&apos;m standing at the prow of a catamaran heading away from Mindoro. I&apos;ve got muddy shoes, a mangled wristband and a mysterious bruise on my buttock. And I&apos;m happy. \u2022 The trip was provided by The Garden Festival (thegardenfestival.eu) which will host The Tropical Garden Festival next spring and the Malasimbo Festival (malasimbofestival.com, dates for 2013&apos;s festival tbc).

The most successful of these was Child of My Time: An Englishman&apos;s Journey in a Divided World (1999), a frank and literary memoir that won Frankland, who has died aged 77, the PEN/Ackerley prize for autobiography. As a correspondent in Moscow, Saigon and Washington, Frankland was able to view this divided world from both sides. During his 30 years with the Observer (1962-92), he reported on the two great pivotal events of the last quarter of the 20th century. In the spring of 1975, he witnessed the fall of Saigon and was on one of the last US Marine Corps helicopters to leave the South Vietnamese capital. Then, in 1989, he covered the uprisings in eastern Europe that marked the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war. His reportage of the disintegrating Warsaw Pact became the basis of The Patriots&apos; Revolution \u2013 How Eastern Europe Toppled Communism and Won Its Freedom (1990). The book received accolades on both sides of the Atlantic. But when, nine years later, he published his tightly written and often elegiac memoir, the atmospheric detail supplied in his vignettes of life in Moscow and Saigon, particularly the louche underworld of Soviet Russia, was recognised as an absorbing and often iconoclastic read that went far beyond most contributions to the historiography of the cold war. &quot;Frankland has a particular sympathy with outsiders and the betrayed. As a gay man in intolerant times and places, he knew he would never be on the side of the powerful, would always feel for underdogs,&quot; wrote the transgender author Roz Kaveney. Frankland was a direct descendant of the British diplomat, travel writer and expert on the Orthodox monasteries of the Levant, Robert Curzon, 14th Baron Zouche, whose granddaughter married the Yorkshire baronet Sir\u00a0Frederick Frankland. Family tradition saw to it that, a century later, young Frankland followed Curzon of the Levant to Charterhouse from where, in 1952, he obtained a major scholarship to study history at Pembroke College, Cambridge. But he did not go there immediately. University entrants could apply to have their two years&apos; national service in one of the armed services deferred, but the more adventurous seized the chance of a break between classroom and campus. Frankland volunteered for the Royal Navy, where there was an appetite to train people with proven academic ability as Russian translators. He liked learning Russian, rapidly acquiring a working knowledge. And, as he revealed in his memoir, the navy provided the 18-year-old Frankland with a newfound opportunity for gay sex. This section rather startled some old friends. It was not that anybody doubted his sexuality, but he had always been discreet about it; neither proud nor ashamed to be gay. Just was. After Cambridge and a postgraduate year in the US, he joined the Secret Intelligence Service, another family tradition. During the second world war, his father, Wing Commander Roger Frankland, a\u00a0radio expert, had been attached to SIS&apos;s crucial codebreaking unit at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire. Basic training included a pistol-shooting course with Browning automatics: no fancy two-handed grips, but swivel on your left heel, point your weapon and give the target two bullets. Frankland soon concluded that the real point of all this was to engender a sense of mission and apartness. Reality was the commute to St James&apos;s Park underground and his desk at Broadway Buildings, MI6&apos;s headquarters until 1964, and it rapidly began to pall. He found the work tedious: he was given little opportunity to use his Russian, and the company was uninspiring. He began to pity the agents whose lives were in their hands. After a year, he quit. He had decided to become a journalist and found employment on Time &amp; Tide, an ailing but respectable political weekly whose contributors had included George Orwell. By 1962, he was on David Astor&apos;s Observer and bound for Moscow. Unfortunately, so was another of Astor&apos;s journalists. A KGB defector had at last provided all the necessary evidence to hang Kim Philby, who had fled Beirut, where, with MI6&apos;s blessing, he had become Middle East correspondent for the Observer and the Economist. Frankland had met Philby in the Broadway Buildings and he always suspected that Philby had identified him to the Russians, who would have probably shown him photographs of all the British residents in Moscow who might conceivably be working for MI6. There was a certain amount of harassment, but they did not throw him out. That happened in 1985 when, during his second and last stint in Moscow, he was expelled in retaliation for Britain&apos;s expulsion of several alleged KGB residents in London. In 1967, Frankland was transferred to Saigon. To his amazement, the\u00a0SIS man at the British embassy there soon indicated that his old masters suspected that his five years in Moscow had resulted in him being turned by the KGB. Otherwise, they would have kicked him out, wouldn&apos;t they? Nor did it help when, shortly after his arrival, Frankland scooped the resident press corps by interviewing a Viet\u00a0Cong unit in a hamlet a risky hour&apos;s drive away from the city. How could he have done it without special contacts provided by Hanoi&apos;s Russian patrons? Answer: because the new correspondent had discovered that Mister Loc, the Observer&apos;s office manager, was VC himself and understood the value of publicity. MI6 was hopelessly wrong. Frankland had no sympathy for Moscow&apos;s clients in Hanoi, and respected the fear and loathing so many South Vietnamese held for them. There were moments when he was disgusted by American behaviour. But by the time the war ended, he believed that by far the worst thing they had done was betray their Vietnamese allies by abandoning them to their fate. Frankland went with them. The helicopter evacuation was a story in itself and another Observer reporter was staying behind to cover whatever followed. But there was another reason for his departure. He knew the men from the Soviet embassy in Hanoi would arrive shortly after the first North Vietnamese tanks and they would certainly have a file on him. One of the last things he did before he left was give his Observer colleague most of his remaining US dollars. In later life, his conviction that the American withdrawal had been a great betrayal, the cause of thousands of unnecessary deaths as Vietnamese asylum seekers tried to flee Communist rule across the South China Sea, remained as firm as ever. He entered into a civil partnership in 2006 with his long-time partner, Thuong Nguyen. He is survived by Thuong; his older brother, Timothy; his cousin, Diana Demarco; and three nephews, Nick, Mathew and Adam. Jonathan Fryer writes: Unlike most foreign correspondents \u2013 and indeed spies \u2013 Mark Frankland was the opposite of gregarious. He loathed big parties, and the idea of joining a London gentleman&apos;s club, to which his pedigree and interests would have made him eminently suited, was anathema. The only &quot;club&quot; he ever felt comfortable in was the pub near the Observer&apos;s old HQ known affectionately as &quot;Auntie&apos;s&quot;. I met Mark in the summer of 1972 in Tokyo, where I was studying Japanese and he was briefly posted; we were introduced by a young Japanese bartender who believed, correctly, that the dashing but eminently sensible British journalist could be a stabilising influence on his somewhat wild younger compatriot. Mark and I had a lot in common, not least spells covering the Vietnam war \u2013 to which he would later return \u2013 and he quickly assumed the role of honorary elder brother, which he would maintain faithfully for the next 40 years. He had settled back in Britain by the time I moved to London in 1982 and he immediately arranged an entr\u00e9e for me into the BBC. We would meet every few months for lunch, usually at a French restaurant, where we discussed politics, the media and world affairs, and he debriefed me about everything I had been getting up to in my personal life. He meanwhile arranged, with some difficulty, for his long-term Vietnamese partner, Thuong, to come to England, and the two of them were essentially home-birds. In May 2006, Mark and Thuong entered into a civil partnership at a ceremony at Fulham registry office. The bubbly female registrar was surprised that there were only two other people invited, namely the two witnesses: the businessman Robin Hope, who had studied Russian with Mark in the navy, and me. This was typical of Mark&apos;s sense of privacy and modesty, and, after the ceremony, the four of us walked down the road to a Thai restaurant for lunch.  \u2022 Frederick Mark Frankland, journalist and author, born 18 April 1934; died 12 April 2012"}, {"sentences": ["But arriving in Tokyo last week, I had more on my mind than stray oranges.", "campaign organized by the British Council, and in partnership with friends and colleagues at De Montfort University and the British embassy in Tokyo.", "Today, 23 April, is assumed to be Shakespeare&apos;s birthday \u2013 and to celebrate, we&apos;ll be hosting a number of special events at the British embassy in Tokyo \u2013 located next to the imperial palace, and one of the most impressive embassies in the city (and, I suspect, the world)."], "tags": ["Books", "William Shakespeare", "Theatre", "Japan", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-23T08:53:40Z", "title": "Taking Shakespeare to Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/23/shakespeare-japan-first-folio", "article": "I sometimes struggle with the intricacies of airport customs, especially after mind-crushing 11-hour flights.

Definitely no fruit, plants, or cats; but value of objects being imported? Um \u2026 what&apos;s the Japanese for &quot;priceless&quot;? I am head of English and drama at the British Library, and came to Japan last week as part of the Great! campaign organized by the British Council, and in partnership with friends and colleagues at De Montfort University and the British embassy in Tokyo. Tagging along for the ride with me are travelling companions of the highest order: a handwritten Sherlock Holmes manuscript of The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter and an original First Folio of 1623, the first collected edition of Shakespeare&apos;s plays. Our press release talks, not unjustly, of the arrival of two great British literary icons in Japan (three, if you include me, I optimistically suggested to our press officer), and if you&apos;re thinking of the ways literary artefacts can embody a national sensibility, you&apos;d be hard pushed to find better examples. Today, 23 April, is assumed to be Shakespeare&apos;s birthday \u2013 and to celebrate, we&apos;ll be hosting a number of special events at the British embassy in Tokyo \u2013 located next to the imperial palace, and one of the most impressive embassies in the city (and, I suspect, the world). In the morning, we&apos;ll be running workshops for local junior high school children. Last night, eating with friends who teach at universities in Kyoto, I asked them how much knowledge of Shakespeare I might expect from the kids. They were unsure and thought that while young people know Shakespeare &quot;the brand&quot;, fewer today had much sense of the narratives of the plays. One colleague, who teaches Shakespeare to undergraduates, reports an increasing fascination, almost obsession, among her students with the authorship debate, perhaps only encouraged by the recent release in Japan of the film Anonymous. In fact, in the local Twittersphere, Conan Doyle appears to be outshining his compatriot so far. When I tweeted that Sherlock and Shakespeare were on their way, we were overwhelmed by the response, and decided to open up the embassy later in the week to allow enthusiastic local Sherlockians to have a glimpse of their master&apos;s manuscript. Although Japanese enthusiasm for Holmes is longstanding (he first appeared in a Japanese magazine in 1894), friends suggest the success of Guy Richie&apos;s franchise may have re-ignited interest in the detective. Perhaps Ritchie should tackle the Bard next: &quot;Oi! Tybalt! Yer farckin ratcatcher!&quot; After the schools workshops, later that evening, we&apos;ll be hosting a reception for key local leaders, from presidents of major Japanese multinationals to cabinet ministers, and a range of ambassadors. But the guest of honour, of course, will be the First Folio. Gathered besides these literary treasures, I&apos;ll be talking about some of the Shakespeare work we are leading at the British Library \u2013 including our recent CD of Shakespeare performed in the original pronunciation (OP) that his early audiences would have experienced. After that, Dominic Shellard, vice chancellor at De Montfort \u2013 who says that he can still remember his primary school teacher first impressing upon him the importance of the First Folio as the only record of Shakespeare&apos;s work (half of his plays appeared for the first time in the Folio) \u2013 will lecture on Shakespeare as part of a double-act with the UK ambassador to Japan, David Warren. Warren, in his time a member of the Oxford University Drama Society, is a keen theatre scholar, and will give an ambassador&apos;s personal view of Shakespeare. As courier, and guarantor, of the First Folio, I am however mindful of the diplomatic hot water that the RSC got into in 1964, when they took their own Folio to the Vatican for the Pope to bless. Something got lost in translation, and the pope understood he was being given the Folio as a gift. What could they do? It may not have been meant that way \u2013 but isn&apos;t the pope infallible? And so I won&apos;t be resting on my laurels in having successfully got the Folio out here \u2013 I have a feeling my CEO would like it back as well. I hope all those who come to see the Folio this week appreciate this greatest of literary treasures \u2026 but I also hope they let me have it back."}, {"sentences": ["However, Thein Sein told reporters in Tokyo, where he is on a state visit, that he was open to discussing changes to the oath."], "tags": ["European Union", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "South and Central Asia", "Europe", "World news", "Politics", "Myanmar"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-23T12:53:45Z", "title": "EU lifts Burma sanctions for one year", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/23/eu-lifts-burma-sanctions", "article": "The European Union has decided to suspend its sanctions against Burma for one year, retaining only its embargo on arms sales.

The move is sure to please the government in Burma, and foreign businesses eager to operate there. The decision will be reviewed in October, and is expected to lift sanctions targeting more than 800 companies in the logging, timber and mining sectors to allow investment in about 50 companies close to the government, and to end visa restrictions and travel bans affecting nearly 500 people. It follows similar moves by the US and Australia, and was taken on the same day Burma&apos;s newly elected parliament convened, without any members of Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s party. Her National League for Democracy (NLD) won 43 of 45 open seats in the 1 April byelection, a victory hailed as proof of the changing face of Burma. But the party is boycotting attendance because of a dispute over one word in the parliamentary oath. The oath currently requires all parliamentarians to &quot;safeguard the constitution&quot;, a phrase Suu Kyi&apos;s party dislikes as the constitution reserves 25% of all parliamentary seats for unelected military officers, and was drafted during an era of army rule. The NLD has vowed to amend the 25% regulation once it takes its parliamentary seats. For now, it wants the word safeguard to be replaced with &quot;respect&quot;. The row risks setting off tensions between Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s opposition party and the military-ruled Union Solidarity and Development party, which maintains about 80% of the seats in parliament, and is staffed by former generals, who some analysts worry are not entirely behind the reforms the president, Thein Sein, has instigated since taking office in 2010. These range from freeing political prisoners to signing ceasefires with ethnic rebels to allowing trade unions. However, Thein Sein told reporters in Tokyo, where he is on a state visit, that he was open to discussing changes to the oath. &quot;It is possible to make a revision if it serves the public&apos;s interest,&quot; he said. He said Aung San Suu Kyi was welcome in parliament but added: &quot;She is the one who should decide whether to join.&quot; An NLD spokesman, Nyan Win, said he believed the dispute would be solved shortly and that other party officials in Thein Sein&apos;s government supported the NLD&apos;s request. &quot;We are co-operating with the government, so the problem will be overcome,&quot; he said. Changes to the constitution usually have to be approved by 75% of parliament, but as the oath is an appendix to the constitution, it is unclear what the next step will be. The request is seen even by NLD members as highly symbolic, but its importance cannot be overestimated, according to legislators. Phyo Min Thein, one of the NLD&apos;s newly elected parliamentarians, said: &quot;We want them to change the wording because it will show the people that the 2008 constitution can be changed.&quot; Some have questioned the EU&apos;s decision, taken on the very day the 66-year-old Nobel laureate should have been taking her parliamentary seat along with 42 other members of the NLD. &quot;The timing does highlight the fact that the EU seems to want to move faster than the pace of reforms in Burma,&quot; said Mark Farmaner of Burma Campaign UK. &quot;Not one repressive law has been repealed, human rights abuses have increased in the past year and hundreds of political prisoners are still in jail. &quot;So the growing suspicion is that the EU is talking up all this &apos;positive change&apos; in Burma to allow European companies to go in and get there ahead of their competitors. The business delegation that went to Burma [with David Cameron last week] and entered on tourist visas shows just the extent of the gold rush into the country.&quot; Cameron welcomed Brussels&apos;s decision in a statement, saying Burma had taken &quot;important steps toward reform\u00a0\u2026 and it is right for the world to respond to them&quot;. He added: &quot;But those changes are not yet irreversible, which is why it is right to suspend rather than lift sanctions for good.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["If Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is allowed to open its store on Savile Row, others will follow: eventually, the Row will become like any other street in the world, full of chain stores selling clothes that can be bought in Madrid, Dubai or Tokyo."], "tags": ["Retail industry", "Fashion", "Men's fashion", "Business", "Life and style", "London", "UK news", "Children's clothes"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-24T14:49:30Z", "title": "Sorry chaps, Abercrombie & Fitch simply doesn't fit Savile Row | Gustav Temple", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/24/abercrombie-fitch-doesnt-fit-savile-row", "article": "A modest band of immaculately dressed chaps and chapettes descended upon Savile Row on Monday to protest against the opening of a children&apos;s store by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. We felt rather strongly that Savile Row is not the right sort of street for the sale of T-shirts, cargo pants and thongs with suggestive slogans on them. The Row is the heartland of English bespoke tailoring, source of the most beautifully crafted suits in the world. It was here that tailors made the uniform worn by Horatio Nelson when he was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar; it was here that Edward VII invented the dinner jacket. Savile Row is where the 20th century&apos;s most iconic fashion moments were dreamt up: production on Hollywood movies would be halted while actors from Rudolph Valentino to Frank Sinatra were flown over to the Row to have a waistcoat cut properly. Anderson &amp; Sheppard made Fred Astaire&apos;s tailcoats, and kept a section of carpet loose, to be peeled back during his fitting so he could ensure the tailcoat flowed around his body correctly by dancing a few steps. Savile Row has maintained its excellent reputation for over two centuries, surviving hard times and boom times and even occasionally moving with the times. In the 1960s, Tommy Nutter opened a shop on Savile Row and made flashy flared tweed suits for Mick Jagger and Elton John; but he made them with as much care and professionalism as he would have made a morning coat for the Prince of Wales. You can go to practically any street in any city in Britain and buy the sorts of clothes peddled by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. You cannot, however, go to any street in the country to get a bespoke suit, and this is why the trade should remain where it is \u2013 so that when the time eventually comes that we can afford Savile Row&apos;s prices, we know where to go. The opening of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store could well sound the death knell for the Row. The Kooples, another trendy clothes chain not offering a bespoke service, has already lodged an application to open a store at No 5, Savile Row. Within 20 years, the Row could easily become just another London street full of the sorts of global brands that have branches in every major European city. It isn&apos;t as if bespoke tailoring is in decline. There has been a recent regeneration of the trade and many Savile Row tailors are doing very well. Richard James and Ozwald Boateng both moved into the Row in the last decade, and their arrival was greeted with suspicion by the established tailors. Yet they have both proved that Savile Row can be modernised in keeping with its ancient traditions and that bespoke tailoring can continue to flourish as a trade. The cost of a bespoke suit is high \u2013 as much as \u00a33,500 on Savile Row \u2013 but there are many luxury stores on Bond Street that will charge you similar amounts for an off-the-peg number. One of the few connections between Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Savile Row is the huge mark-up. In traditional tailoring houses, this is because a bespoke suit takes up to 10 weeks to construct, over 60 hours of labour and numerous fittings. In the case of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, it is because it has used aggressive marketing campaigns to attach a high premium to the letters A and F, especially when cut from frayed bits of denim and glued to a T-shirt. What reverence has Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for the tradition or heritage of Savile Row? It is only interested in the street&apos;s iconic status on the tourist map. Its flagship store on Burlington Gardens, which abuts the Row, has already spoiled the ambience of old-world gentlemanly charm. Endless queues of teenagers spill along Savile Row, blocking the entrances to tailors and giving traffic on the Row even less room to manoeuvre. In a deeply ironic twist, a source in the tailoring trade has revealed that Mike Jeffries, CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, has his suits made on Savile Row. So the man whose company wants to desecrate the Row clearly values its product much more highly than he values its origin. If you had enjoyed a fine lunch at Le Gavroche, would your response be to open up a McDonald&apos;s next door? If Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is allowed to open its store on Savile Row, others will follow: eventually, the Row will become like any other street in the world, full of chain stores selling clothes that can be bought in Madrid, Dubai or Tokyo. Where will Jeffries get his suits made then? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["Six weeks before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Bikila was taken ill with appendicitis and underwent surgery."], "tags": ["Athletics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-25T09:01:00Z", "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No24: Abebe Bikila runs barefoot into history", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/apr/25/50-olympic-moments-abebe-bikila", "article": "Few could have predicted when Italy hosted the 1960 Olympic Games that come the opening ceremony Rome would be cavorting in the midst of an economic boom.

Here, settled at the back of the leading pack, Bikila glided past the Obelisk of Axum that had been plundered from Abyssinia. Continuing south and exiting the city, a breakaway pack began to materialise: \u201cWith the English Kiley, there\u2019s the Irishman Messipy [Messitt], the Belgian Van der Blicher, the Morrocans Rhadi and Saudy, and there\u2019s that unknown Ethiopian we saw earlier,\u201d announced the commentator. \u201cHe\u2019s called Abebe Bikila. He\u2019s barefoot.\u201d At the 32km mark, in Rome\u2019s peripheral countryside, with the sun disappearing behind the city, the runners turned from a somewhat bizarre section of the capital\u2019s orbital road and on to the Appian Way that used to connect the ancient city with Brindisi, on Italy\u2019s south-eastern coast. Breaking with the tradition of daytime Olympic marathons that concluded in the stadium, the early evening start maximized the spectacle as the athletes negotiated 8km of the cypress-tree-lined Appian Way, in darkness. As Bikila\u2019s bare feet rhythmically kissed the uneven stones, the half moonlight, the illuminated ancient Roman monuments and hundreds of torch-bearing soldiers intensified the atmosphere and added to the drama. As Alberto Cavallari wrote in his Corriere della Sera report: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a marathon it was \u2018Aida\u2019, with the Romans roadside making up the chorus.\u201d Re-entering the city at the Porta San Sebastiano, with impeccable timing Bikila left his sole pursuer, the Moroccan Rhadi Ben Abdesselam, just as he repassed the Axum obelisk. Finishing in 2hr 15min 16sec, Bikila shattered the Olympic record and set a new world best, before dancing a jig of joy beneath the Arch of Constantine where many of his rivals simply collapsed. Coming less than 25 years after Mussolini\u2019s forces had conquered his capital at the end of a cruel colonial war, it was the significance of his victory as much as the ease with which he had consumed the capital\u2019s kilometres that fascinated. Marking the rise and future dominance of East African middle- and long-distance runners, in the presence of the all-white South African team that the International Olympic Committee chose not to challenge, and against the vastly better funded and better equipped Soviet, US and European athletes, Bikila ran his name and that of his country into history. But his victory was not simply that of Ethiopia, it was also a triumph for Rome and the Games. Transcending his lack of shoes, for which he is most fondly remembered, he dramatically closed the final event under the lights and arch of a long-departed emperor while, at the same time, eclipsing the memory of a more recent wannabe. Following the fierce parliamentary debates over the negative image presented by the Fascist-built venues to the outside world, and the retaliatory neo-Fascist graffiti that marked the city in the buildup the Games, there was no better, more apt or powerful demonstration of Italy\u2019s break from the past than this glorious, individual victory by an ex-colonial subject. As the editor of the British Olympic Association\u2019s magazine World Sports condescendingly concurred, in his report from Rome: \u201cIt is a scene to remember \u2013 a moment of theatrical drama; a moment so unusual in modern world athletics, when a virtual unknown from an insignificant country crosses the seas and conquers the heroes. It is a fine, unsophisticated, illogical victory [\u2026] This [\u2026] was an historic Olympic marathon both in terms of performance and backcloth [\u2026] its drama was in its setting, presentation and outcome.\u201d Despite the years of preparation, the Games\u2019 greatest and most enduring moment was not only completely unplanned, it was totally unimaginable. Bikila, this tiny, barefoot former colonial subject, mixed the unexpected with drama to create a scriptwriter\u2019s dream and become the greatest symbol of the new, rejuvenated, post-Fascist country. What the Observer said The Observer: Sunday 11 September 1960 Bikila Abebe, a 28-year-old member of Emperor Haile Selassie\u2019s bodyguard, won the marathon gold medal in the last big event of the Olympics last night. Abedisiem Rhadi of Morocco was second and B. Magee, of New Zealand. Third. Abebe\u2019s time was 2hr 15min 16.2sec, which was 7min 47sec better than Emil Zatopek\u2019s Olympic record. In fact, the first 15 all improved on the old record. Prowess in big international cross-country races on the Continent had made Rhadi one of the more fancied competitors, but none outside East Africa had heard of Abebe, who won the greatest marathon in the 64 years of Olympic history. What happened next? Six weeks before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Bikila was taken ill with appendicitis and underwent surgery. Still recovering when he arrived in Japan, he went on to become the first athlete to retain the Olympic marathon title. In 1968, a car accident in the city of Sheno, 76km from Addis Ababa, left Bikila confined to a wheelchair. His competitive spirit undiminished, he won gold in a 25km cross-country sledge competition in Norway in 1970. Suffering complications from his paralysis, he died in October 1973 and was buried in the presence of Selassie.   Related: Why Olympians shine under the spotlight    On the 50th anniversary of his win, the 2010 Rome marathon was dedicated to Bikila\u2019s memory and, appropriately, Ethiopia claimed a male and female double. The women took first, second and third places, and the men\u2019s winner, Siraj Gena, picked up a \u20ac5,000 bonus, offered by the race organiser, for completing the final 300m barefoot. Although few visitors to Rome could have noticed the small plaque mounted on the wall of the Foro dei Imperiali dedicated to Bikila, he remains a local hero, the \u201cescaping Ethiopian\u201d who ran Italy into the democratic dawn.

TV networks broke into scheduled programming to report Ozawa&apos;s acquittal by a Tokyo court on Thursday morning. The decision has reignited speculation about a possible challenge to Noda&apos;s leadership over controversial plans to double consumption tax to 10% by 2015. Although he has never been prime minister, Ozawa is known as the &quot;shadow shogun&quot; for the influence he wields behind the scenes. He leads the largest faction inside the ruling Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) and is credited with orchestrating the party&apos;s historic victory in the 2009 general election. Opinion is divided over whether Ozawa, 69, will act on his vocal opposition to Noda&apos;s plans to reform the tax \u2013 Japan&apos;s equivalent of VAT or GST \u2013 or even challenge him for the leadership. Whoever is DPJ leader is assured of the prime ministership because of the party&apos;s large majority in the lower house. The prospect of an early general election may dissuade Ozawa&apos;s supporters from opposing the tax rise, which Noda has said is unavoidable if Japan is to tackle its huge public debt, now twice the size of its $5tn economy. Ozawa had pleaded not guilty to violating political funding laws over the purchase of land in 2004 by his management group, Rikuzan-kai. Prosecutors in Tokyo decided not to charge him owing to lack of evidence but he was brought to trial six months ago after a citizens&apos; panel twice called for him to be indicted. Court-appointed lawyers had demanded a three-year prison term for Ozawa. Three of his former aides were given suspended prison sentences last year. They have appealed. The public&apos;s fascination with Ozawa was in evidence again on Thursday, with more than 1,800 people queueing up for the 46 seats in the public gallery. Dozens of supporters cheered outside the court building, carrying placards with his picture on one side and &quot;innocent&quot; on the other. The acquittal marks yet another comeback for a deeply divisive politician who has yet to fulfil a lifetime ambition to lead Japan. Having helped the DPJ secure victory in 2009 by handpicking young candidates to contest key seats, he was beaten to the leadership a year later by Naoto Kan. Ozawa later failed to push through a no-confidence motion against Kan and saw his favoured candidate to lead the party defeated by Noda following Kan&apos;s resignation last year. Experts said Ozawa might be forced to watch from the sidelines given that his supporters, thought to comprise about a third of DPJ lower house MPs, have been marginalised in the party. Ozawa&apos;s influence would be further diminished if, as some analysts have suggested, Noda agrees to call an early election in exchange for opposition support for the sales tax increase. Opposition parties currently control the upper house, where they can block legislation. Kenji Yamaoka, a DPJ lawmaker and Ozawa supporter, ruled out any immediate challenge to the party leadership. &quot;We are not seeking blind confrontation,&quot; he told the TBS network. &quot;We are not thinking about a power struggle in the party.&quot; But at the very least his acquittal will fuel calls from Ozawa&apos;s supporters to reinstate his party membership, which was suspended after his indictment. That would give him the option of running for party leader in September, when Noda&apos;s term as DPJ president expires. &quot;He is not completely finished yet but I think his leadership role is over,&quot; Gerald Curtis, a professor at Columbia University, told Reuters just before the court ruling. Michael Cucek, a consultant who blogs about Japanese politics at Shisaku, said: &quot;Ozawa has been the most influential, hated and fascinating politician of the last 30 years. However, whatever happens today will not shake the political world to its roots. Its branches may shiver a bit \u2013 but that is all.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["I visit Nintendo&apos;s Tokyo EAD team every few weeks too, so I don&apos;t really feel detached from the game side of the business.&quot; Miyamoto&apos;s schedule may still be demanding, including a significant amount of foreign travel to promote Nintendo games as well as his monthly trips to Tokyo, but there is a sense that, as he approaches 60, he is winding down, stepping aside to allow others to carry the creative flame.", "Nintendo EAD has always had the air of myth about it, a Chocolate Factory for games \u2013 the handful of journalists who have visited the Kyoto or Tokyo premises rarely see anything more than the lobby and a meeting room separate from the machinery of game development \u2013 with Miyamoto a subdued Willy Wonka."], "tags": ["Nintendo", "Games", "Technology", "DS", "3DS", "The Legend of Zelda", "Mario", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-26T11:24:53Z", "title": "Is Shigeru Miyamoto's game over at Nintendo?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/26/shigeru-miyamotos-game-over-nintendo", "article": "&quot;Why do you still play video games?&quot; Shigeru Miyamoto is tired. Jetlag is partly to blame \u2013 the 11-hour flight from his hometown Kyoto to Paris, combined with a day&apos;s worth of interviews with journalists eager to pull headlines from his lips, accentuating the bags under his eyes. But it&apos;s more than that. This November, Super Mario&apos;s father turns 60. Having spent over half of his life working at Nintendo (his first and only job) on more than 100 games, a little vocational weariness is inevitable. But it&apos;s more than that. The pause before he answers is borne from somewhere deeper than the fug of travel exhaustion or the fatigued plod toward retirement. While his face remains composed, there&apos;s an internal scrabbling for an acceptable answer to the question. Eventually, a sharp intake of breath and a smile. &quot;I still play video games because I still make video games, of course,&quot; he says, before adding: &quot;Just playing the stuff I make myself keeps me very busy.&quot; He looks down. Miyamoto may not have fathered the video game medium, but perhaps more than anyone else, he has been responsible for raising it. From his first unexpected success with Donkey Kong, a game designed to shift 2000 Radardscope arcade cabinets sitting unsold in Nintendo warehouses in 1981, through the creation of multiple multi-million selling series based around characters of his own design, Miyamoto has stayed abreast of every generational leap in technology in a way not one of his contemporaries has managed. The iconography of Mario For more than 20 years his most famous work, Super Mario Bros. remained the best-selling video game, selling more than 40m copies worldwide and popularising a character who, by the 1990s, had become more recognisable among American schoolchildren than Mickey Mouse. Mario&apos;s iconography came to define the medium in popular culture: the red splash of his plumber&apos;s costume; the unfashionable cap and moustache; Koji Kondo&apos;s irrepressibly joyful theme tune; the squat, shifty-eyed Goombas; and the spike-backed kidnapper, Bowser. There was a rude surplus of ideas behind the pixels which, combined, continue to represent video-gameness to so much of the world. Beyond the recurring play myths he originated \u2013 Donkey Kong, Zelda, Mario \u2013 Miyamoto was the first to master not only the technological transition from 2D to 3D graphics with his seminal titles Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, but also the accompanying creative transition in game systems and mechanics this dimensional expansion brought with it.     Nintendo video game icon Mario Photograph: AP    Then, in more recent years, his hand on Nintendo&apos;s visionary tiller brought motion control to the masses by way of Wii Sports and Wii Fit, titles that broadened both the definition of games as well as the audience that consumes them. Miyamoto was honoured as the first inductee in to the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame in 1998 and is the only video game designer to have been knighted into France&apos;s Order of Arts and Letters. If the esteem in which he is still held in was in any doubt, just four years ago he placed first in the Time Magazine reader choice of the world&apos;s 100 most influential people. As such, to hear this visionary say that he only plays video games because he makes them is jarring. Surely his love for the medium he has spent a lifetime working to shape and define is more than just a job? Surely. &quot;Could it be that you might not play games if you didn&apos;t create them,&quot; I venture. Again, the long pause; a quiet search for an answer already sat on his tongue: &quot;It could be that \u2026 I might not be playing games.&quot; Could it be that Shigeru Miyamoto is tired with video games? More spokesman than creative genius? &quot;The thing with Shigeru Miyamoto is that you think you&apos;re meeting Walt Disney when, in reality, you&apos;re meeting Mickey Mouse.&quot; I had shrugged off my journalist friend&apos;s sharp warning that Mario&apos;s maker can be something of corporate mouthpiece in interviews these days. But now, sat opposite him in the plushest hotel room in Paris that yen can buy, this diminutive designer, producer and director appears more spokesman than creative genius. It&apos;s partly understandable. He&apos;s here to promote Nintendo&apos;s latest project, an interactive guidebook on 3DS for visitors to the Louvre museum \u2013 an app, if you will, not a game. Instead of a Walkman or iPod with spoken notes delivered as you strain to see the Mona Lisa, now visitors can rent Nintendo&apos;s latest handheld, offering 700 commentaries about the artworks and a real-time map to show your position in the museum. It&apos;s a gimmicky idea but a well-executed one, designed to show off some of the 3DS&apos;s lesser-known features to the general public and, no doubt, help drive sales for a handheld whose sales have been generally underwhelming. But my interest lies in Miyamoto&apos;s game work, not his promotional role in quirky tour guides. This doesn&apos;t stop him from working the Louvre guide into every other answer, with quietly cheeky stubbornness. Miyamoto&apos;s dedication to remain unflinchingly on-message reflects his unusual position in the company. Fusajiro Yamauchi may have established the Marufuku Company in 1889, the company that would shortly thereafter become the Nintendo Playing Card Company, but without Miyamoto the Nintendo of today would not exist. It&apos;s from his creative heart that Nintendo&apos;s brand, mascots and most valuable game series have sprouted. Miyamoto is inseparable from contemporary Nintendo and Nintendo is inseparable from contemporary Miyamoto. And whenever a creative becomes synonymous with a corporation, there&apos;s a danger that creative pursuit slips into corporate concern, especially when business falls upon tough times. Indeed, it&apos;s easy to forget that Miyamoto&apos;s current job title is &quot;general manager&quot;, a role that belies his expertise, inferring generalist, unspecified supervision. A day in the life So just how much input does the one-time artist and designer have in Nintendo&apos;s creative output? What does a day in the life of Miyamoto look like in 2012? &quot;My days all follow much the same pattern,&quot; he says. &quot;They are structured and typical. Roughly half of my time I spend checking new games that Nintendo&apos;s directors are working on. &quot;I sit at my desk, play their games and create checklists of comments and amends that I then send out to the directors. Then, the rest of my time is spent attending various meetings, talking about management decisions for the general business direction of Nintendo.&quot; This split of Miyamoto&apos;s time clearly reflects the split in his professional responsibility: half to the company&apos;s creative output and half to the company&apos;s corporate future. I wonder if he misses spending the majority of his time creating? &quot;Not at all; the decreased workload allows me to do new projects like the audio guide,&quot; he replies, with typical Japanese diplomacy. &quot;But I am still very close to the game development. Although I am not a director myself I do check all of our games and discuss them over email. I visit Nintendo&apos;s Tokyo EAD team every few weeks too, so I don&apos;t really feel detached from the game side of the business.&quot; Miyamoto&apos;s schedule may still be demanding, including a significant amount of foreign travel to promote Nintendo games as well as his monthly trips to Tokyo, but there is a sense that, as he approaches 60, he is winding down, stepping aside to allow others to carry the creative flame. The most recent Super Mario and Zelda titles have credited him as &quot;general producer&quot; with direction and design duties falling to others, most notably Koichi Hayashida, director of Super Mario Galaxy 2 and, more recently, Super Mario 3D Land. I ask him how he has been working to ensure that there are artists and designers to take his place when he retires, a question that is greeted with a gently frantic response. &quot;There have been numerous media reports that I am about to retire and I very much want to emphasise that this is not the case.&quot; This eagerness to dismiss his (inevitable) retirement plans is understandable. When a video game blog recently claimed he was looking to retire soon, Nintendo&apos;s stock price fell the same day \u2013 a further indication of just how closely Nintendo&apos;s fortunes are perceived to be dependent on his involvement. &quot;I believe that if I remain in the same position as a leader of the development teams within Nintendo, then the entire structure will grow or revolve around me,&quot; Miyamoto says. &quot;I&apos;ve certainly seen there are other people within EAD that have the potential to be leaders. &quot;I wanted to give these people a chance to lead their respective teams. When I said in the press that I would step back a little I was just saying I want to support the company from the side, rather than being front and centre all of the time.&quot; &apos;We don&apos;t usually hire game designers&apos; Despite this eagerness to push others to the fore, Nintendo&apos;s recent unwillingness to stray far from characters and series first developed by Miyamoto is worrying. Without risk-taking at a managerial level, surely there&apos;s little creative soil from which the next Miyamoto may emerge and flourish. Nintendo EAD has always had the air of myth about it, a Chocolate Factory for games \u2013 the handful of journalists who have visited the Kyoto or Tokyo premises rarely see anything more than the lobby and a meeting room separate from the machinery of game development \u2013 with Miyamoto a subdued Willy Wonka. With this in mind, I ask him how he spots new talent when hiring. &quot;We don&apos;t usually hire game designers,&quot; he says. &quot;We almost exclusively hire artists or programmers; people who have learnt a technique and have a basis that we start with. Recently we have hired a few game designers, but generally they have already had careers in other companies and then joined us. But we hire a lot of people out of university. They bring basic knowledge and we start from there.&quot; A love of discovery and adventure This was certainly Miyamoto&apos;s own route into the industry. Born and raised in the 1950s in the rural town of Sonebe, near Japan&apos;s ancient capital, Kyoto, Miyamoto was a short, unassuming boy. With no television in the family home he relied on the natural world outside for excitement, spending countless hours exploring the woods, caves and riverbanks near his house. It was here he fostered the love of discovery and these childhood adventures inspired his games, a local chained-up barking dog making an appearance as the Chain Chomp enemy in Super Mario Brothers 3 and his beloved caves appearing throughout the Zelda series, myths that appear to grow in the retelling. Graduating with a degree in industrial design in the mid-1970s, Miyamoto&apos;s father asked an old friend \u2013 Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of the toymaker Nintendo \u2013whether he had any jobs available for his son.     Donkey Kong    Miyamoto&apos;s first task at the company was to design art for the outside panels of some arcade cabinets Nintendo was working on: Radarscope and Sheriff. Two years later Yamauchi called Miyamoto into his office and asked him if he&apos;d like to design an arcade game. Miyamoto jumped at the chance, drawing the game&apos;s characters on square paper, each block representing a single pixel on the screen, calling the resulting game Donkey Kong: &quot;Donkey&quot;, as a synonym for &quot;stubborn&quot; and &quot;Kong&quot; for gorilla. Is there a difference between the kind of designer that started in art, like Miyamoto (who is ambidextrous \u2013 both Mario and Link were designed with his left-hand), to one who started in programming, I wonder? &quot;I don&apos;t think there is a big difference,&quot; he says. &quot;Obviously people from artist or programmer backgrounds have to work together soon enough. So I think there are two key characteristics: a positive attitude towards new things, and someone who doesn&apos;t easily give up in the face of problems or criticism. That&apos;s what I look for in a new hire.&quot; \u2022 In Part 2, Simon talks to Miyamoto about the troubled launch for the Nintendo 3DS and the future of the handheld market"}, {"sentences": ["By shifting a large number of the 19,000 marines on Okinawa, leaders in Tokyo and Washington said they hoped to reduce the US military footprint on the island while retaining a strong enough presence to deal with security emergencies in the region.", "The Futenma question remains unresolved, however, after the government in Tokyo failed to persuade people in Henoko \u2013 an ecologically important stretch of coastline \u2013 to agree to host the new offshore base."], "tags": ["US military", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-27T08:03:38Z", "title": "US to move marines out of Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/27/us-marines-out-of-japan", "article": "     Japan and the US have agreed to relocate thousands of US marines from Okinawa in a move aimed at reducing the island&apos;s military burden amid lingering anger among residents over pollution, accidents and crime. Under a deal reached in Washington late on Thursday, about 9,000 marines will move from the southern Japanese island to the US Pacific territory of Guam and other locations in the region, including Hawaii and Australia. By shifting a large number of the 19,000 marines on Okinawa, leaders in Tokyo and Washington said they hoped to reduce the US military footprint on the island while retaining a strong enough presence to deal with security emergencies in the region. In a joint statement, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, and the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said the agreement would honour Washington&apos;s commitment to defending Japan and maintaining stability in an &quot;increasingly uncertain security environment&quot;. &quot;Japan is not just a close ally, but also a close friend,&quot; Panetta said separately. &quot;And I look forward to deepening that friendship and strengthening our partnership as, together, we address security challenges in the region.&quot; No date has been given for the $8.6bn (\u00a35.3bn) move \u2013 of which Japan will pay $3.1 billion \u2013 and questions remain over the fate of Futenma, a sprawling marine base located in Ginowan, an Okinawan city of 95,000 people. Earlier this year, President Obama signalled a shift in US military priorities towards the Asia-Pacific region, after a decade of prioritising expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The potential for volatility in east Asia was underlined by North Korea&apos;s recent rocket launch and the prospect of a third nuclear test by the regime. There is concern, too, over Beijing&apos;s military spending and long-standing disputes between China and Japan over territory and energy resources. &quot;I think we have made some progress and this plan offers specific and forward-looking action,&quot; said Japan&apos;s foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, adding that Japan wanted to &quot;reduce the burden on Okinawa&quot;. But the agreement, made days before the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, meets Obama in Washington, is unlikely to satisfy residents living near Futenma, a cause of friction between successive US and Japanese administrations. Local opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa reached a high point in 1995 after three servicemen abducted and raped a 12-year-old girl. The crime prompted the US and Japan to look for ways to reduce the military presence on Okinawa, which comprises less than 1% of Japan&apos;s total area, yet hosts three-quarters of all US bases and just under half its 47,000 troops. The talks led to a 2006 agreement under which Futenma was to be relocated to Henoko in a less populated part of Okinawa, and 8,000 troops moved off the island by 2014. The Futenma question remains unresolved, however, after the government in Tokyo failed to persuade people in Henoko \u2013 an ecologically important stretch of coastline \u2013 to agree to host the new offshore base. Most residents of Okinawa want the base moved off their island altogether, but the government has failed to find a new host community. Up to 5,000 troops \u2013 about 3,000 fewer than envisaged in the original 2006 agreement \u2013 will be sent to Guam, according to a US defence official quoted by Associated Press in Washington. The remainder will move to Hawaii or rotate between Australia and other parts of the region. Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, said the deal should satisfy congressional critics who had denounced the original plan as confused and expensive. &quot;We think it breaks a very long stalemate that has plagued our politics, that has clogged both of our systems,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["Hemery and Sherwood were taken to the stadium two hours before the race in case of traffic congestion and took refuge in the British team\u2019s medical room, lying on the cot beds under grey blankets for warmth as the national coach, Denis Watts, and Great Britain\u2019s silver medallist at Tokyo, John Cooper, chain-smoked.", "Something to rank along with Herb Elliott\u2019s 1,500 metres win in the Rome Olympics and with the two medal-winning performances of Peter Snell in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Sport", "Athletics", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-27T09:04:36Z", "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No25: David Hemery storms to gold in Mexico", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/apr/27/stunning-olympic-moments-david-hemery", "article": "On 15 October 1968 in Mexico City\u2019s Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Universitario, David Hemery inspired the BBC\u2019s incomparable David Coleman to the zenith of his facility for conveying his exhilaration at British success in the sport he cherished above all others \u2013 and in that elation also to commit a faux pas for which he quickly apologised but nonetheless spawned a tradition for ruthlessly lampooning commentary gaffes that reached its peak the following decade when Private Eye launched Colemanballs.   Related: 16 October 1968: David Hemery hurdles into history in Mexico    As the tall, blond 400m hurdler extended his fluent, graceful stride up the home straight, Coleman\u2019s excitement was palpable and infectious but any analysis of the words he used indicates that the delivery at immortal moments such as these is far more significant than the content. \u201cAnd it\u2019s David Hemery in the lead for Great Britain,\u201d Coleman said, his voice rapidly increasing in tone and speed like a plane hurtling down the runway beyond the point of no return before take-off. \u201cIt\u2019s Hemery Great Britain, it\u2019s Hemery Great Britain, it\u2019s Hemery with one barrier to go,\u201d he continued.

In a felicitous coincidence Cecil, who by then had succeeded his father to become the sixth Marquess of Exeter, led the official party and honoured Hemery by hanging the gold medal around his neck. In 1936 Burghley, in full evening dress, had completed a 400-yard lap of the Queen Mary in 57 seconds and from 1943-45 served as the Governor of Bermuda. How Hemery, the man with the sixth fastest personal best among the eight finalists, came to be on top of the podium, also owed a debt to a visit to Bermuda and to a happy transatlantic accordance, this one between two extraordinary and complementary coaches who, though they were based more than 3,000 miles apart and who were to meet only once \u2013 on the eve of the 1972 Games \u2013 moulded a champion and one of the greatest performances in Olympic history. Hemery was brought up in Frinton on Sea on the Essex coast in the late 1940s and early 50s. His father had been the New South Wales schoolboy long jump champion but his membership of what his son called \u201ca narrow religious sect\u201d proscribed continuing with athletics and on his return to Britain, which he had left at the age of two, he established himself in private practice as a chartered accountant. From Hemery\u2019s descriptions, he and his three siblings enjoyed an idyllically sporty childhood, his father building goals, cricket nets and high jump stands in the family\u2019s back garden. There were also, he wrote in his autobiography, \u201coccasional swims in the freezing North Sea, long walks on the high sea wall and standing long jumps from it to the beach below [which] provided considerable physical activity\u201d. The defining moment in his life came when he was 12 in 1957 and his father was offered a job in Colorado Springs. The Hemery children were consulted about the move and, after deciding to go, stayed there for six months before his father accepted another position in Boston. The four children \u2013 Judy, David, John and Anthea \u2013 were enrolled at Thayer Academy in Braintree, Massachusetts and the boys excelled in sport, David becoming an accomplished miler, half-miler and prolific centre-forward in the soccer team. \u201cIn 1961,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy father decided that the school should have hurdles. Without too much thought of whether he could afford such generosity, he donated a complete set. He had no idea what this gift was to reap. Perhaps because of my time at Frinton, where I had hurdled over breakwaters on the beach at five, I took to hurdling like a duck to water.\u201d When he graduated from Thayer in 1962 he was awarded a prize for being the school\u2019s best all-round sportsman but in his only year as a high hurdler felt that he never mastered the discipline, recording 16.5sec as his personal best. In June that year the family returned to England, moving to Moor Park in Hertfordshire where David joined Ruislip &amp; Northwood Athletics Club (which became Hillingdon AC in 1966 when it merged with Finchley Harriers). When Hemery\u2019s father inquired about a hurdles coach, David was sent to Hurlingham Park track in Putney to meet Fred Housden. Housden had been a scrum-half for Blackheath, an international pole vaulter and high hurdler before the 1914-18 war and after Cambridge had taught mathematics at Harrow until his retirement in the early 1950s. When Hemery met him, the coach was 70 and immediately began to address the athlete\u2019s flaw, \u201cfloating in space\u201d over hurdles instead of maintaining his forward momentum. They worked for three evenings a week over the summer of 1962 while Hemery spent the weekdays employed by the National Westminster Bank. He spent hours practicing starts, adjusted his technique and built up leg-strength. His times for the 120-yard high hurdles began to demonstrate a dramatic improvement, falling from 15.6sec over 3ft 3in barriers to 14.7sec over 3ft 6in hurdles. In the AAA Indoor Championships at Wembley he won the Wall\u2019s Trophy for the best performance for an athlete aged 21 or under but towards the end of the year the family had decided to return to the United States. \u201cNeither John nor Anthea could settle in England at that time,\u201d he wrote of his two younger siblings. \u201cThey had picked up American accents and were told \u2018go home Yank\u2019 and made to feel distinctly unwanted. Their American friends and the informal student-teacher relationships in the States made them long for that side of the pond.\u201d But when they arrived back in Boston, the job his father had understood to be guaranteed fell through and the family received a further setback when they were scammed into investing in \u201cphony\u201d scheme. David worked for the next 18 months in the computer department of the National Shawmut Bank, chipping his income into the family pool while his father built up a new private practice from scratch. A year later he took a holiday with his brother to Bermuda during \u201ccollege week\u201d and found the contrast between the students\u2019 outlook and his own a shock. He felt \u201calmost like a 40-year-old banker\u201d, he said, and it made him consider his future. His propensity for hard work, study and his determination to better himself had already led to evening courses in banking, now he decided to catch up on his lost two years by applying to Boston University, where he was accepted on an engineering degree course and found Billy Smith, the coach of the university\u2019s track team who was a friend of his high school coach. At college he made swift progress as a member of the one-mile relay team and over a varying hurdles distances from 50 to 600 yards. With Housden focusing on technique, Smith worked on strength and stamina in a regime that often included 30 100-yard dashes, a seven-mile run and ended with seven 220-yard sprints. He amassed victories throughout his freshman and sophomore years and during his senior year gave this snapshot of Smith\u2019s dedication and philosophy. \u201cOne day a blizzard started at about noon. By 3pm quite a lot of snow had fallen and it was still coming down. I asked [Billy] what he thought I should do \u2013 weight training and/or a few exercises or should I take the day off? He paused, then pushing the door open, said: \u2018Out there is the road to Mexico.\u2019\u201d So Hemery went outside and pounded out a series of half-miles on the boards while Smith stood at the side of the track, ankle-deep in snow. In the summer of 1966 he returned to England to compete and train under Housden, running 14.3sec to win the inter-counties championship high hurdles. Picked for Great Britain he won the same race in a meet against the USSR and became Commonwealth Games champion over the 3ft 6in barriers in Jamaica. Later that year he decided to focus on the 440-yard discipline, running a variety of 600- and 500-yard races at indoor meets during the winter season but tore his left hamstring on his return to the high hurdles in February 1967. He attempted comebacks every couple of weeks but repeatedly broke down when lengthening his jog to a stride. In the end Smith told him to rest until August to allow it to heal properly and he had to sit out the European summer season. In August he resumed training on the sand bar at Powder Point, beginning slowly but gaining in confidence as his leg withstood gradual accelerations of pace. Over the winter he concentrated on stamina work in cross country races, indoors over 600 yards in the hurdles and anchoring the mile-relay on the flat. On 10 April 1968 in his first outdoors meeting of the season Hemery equalled his personal best 51.8sec in the 440-yard hurdles and nine days later set a new British record of 50.7. In May he won the 120-yard and 440-yard hurdles at the New England Championships and in June the longer race at the National Collegiates in Berkeley, California breaking the tape from lane one in his best yet, 49.8. \u201cUnbeaten and in first-class condition,\u201d Hemery wrote, \u201cBilly Smith handed me on to Fred Housden.\u201d Back in England and based at his brother\u2019s flat near Crystal Palace, Hemery began further technical work at the athletics stadium to iron out the remaining glitch with his stride pattern. \u201c I take 13 strides between the intermediate hurdles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo one can run at full speed for long, no matter how fit he is. As a consequence of slowing down one\u2019s stride length becomes shorter. In order to clear a hurdle fast and smoothly, an athlete must take off an exact distance from the barrier. At some point in the race therefore an extra stride or two must go in between each set of hurdles. One extra, and the hurdler must take off from his other leg; two extra and he will be leaping from the same leg. My hurdling was less than adequate from my left leg. I therefore had to go for two extra, that is, 15 strides from about halfway through the race.\u201d With the refinement underway Hemery won the AAA Championships over 440 yards at White City to qualify for the Olympic Games and moved on to hill work. Four weeks before the Games opened he flew to Mexico City with the other members of the British team selected for the 400m and longer distances to acclimatize to the altitude and was there when the Mexican army massacred protestors in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas 10 days before the opening ceremony. Despite numerous protests that the Games should not go ahead, the International Olympic Committee refused to bow to pressure. In the athletes village and on the practice tracks, Hemery\u2019s body slowly began to get used to the paucity of oxygen. In the dormitory, he devoted himself to study, poring over his training diary, drawing pictures of the track and writing down exactly what he wanted to accomplish in the heats, semi-final and final. In the run-up to competing, Hemery received letters from both Housden and Smith. The former, as was his custom, wrote in verse, referencing the two USA runners, Geoff Vanderstock and Ron Whitney, who were ranked No1 and 2 in the world, and the work they had done in mastering the change down to 15 strides between hurdles: \u201cWhen others quail And Geoff looks pale And Ronnie\u2019s knees are quaking. Then is the time To heed my rhyme And take to record making. You know the point Where out of joint Your chopping may go wonky, So don\u2019t lose speed But keep the lead, Each clearance honky-tonky.\u201d Smith was equally positive, accurately predicting: \u201cYou\u2019ll run 48.1sec or 48.2 and no one else can do that. The others are 1,000 hills and sand dunes behind you and it is too late to catch up. Your preparation has been perfect. It seems like we\u2019ve been through and over this whole thing 100 times \u2013 but we know we\u2019re right. We might be the only two people in the world to know it but it is true.\u201d His plan for the heat was merely to qualify for the semi-final and relax into the groove of 15 strides between hurdles after 200m. This he did, but not without a scare when he looked behind him after clearing the last hurdle to see three competitors closing in on him. He finished second in 50.3sec. In one of the other heats Whitney ran 49sec dead and tried to psyche out everyone else in the competition with his nonchalance, barely exhaling with any conspicuous strenuous effort and waving to the crowd. Hemery was drawn in lane six in his semi, with Whitney in the lane outside him, and the American again came home first with Gerhrad Hennige second and the Briton third. In the other race Sherwood set a new Commonwealth record of 49.3sec, also to finish third. The day of the final was wet and cold. Hemery and Sherwood were taken to the stadium two hours before the race in case of traffic congestion and took refuge in the British team\u2019s medical room, lying on the cot beds under grey blankets for warmth as the national coach, Denis Watts, and Great Britain\u2019s silver medallist at Tokyo, John Cooper, chain-smoked. They tried to crack jokes but Hemery recalled the tension \u2013 and the blanket \u2013 brought him out into a cold sweat. The natural inclination was to start their warm-ups, just to allow them the comfort of something to take their minds off the race, but knew that they had to conserve their energy until as late as possible. \u201cMy fingers and feet were damp and freezing cold,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI felt weak, my breath was short and I felt a slight constriction in my throat. The back of my neck ached a bit and my prevailing thoughts were of impending unpleasantness.\u201d With 50 minutes to go they headed to the warm-up track and Hemery took off his shoes to jog on the grass. The feeling of the wet surface conjured up a mental picture of his training on the sand at Powder Point and the enthusiasm and vigour he experienced there when he was returning from injury the year before. When they finally made their way into the stadium to register their vest numbers, they were made to wait in the pen for 10 minutes. As the other finalists began to shake their limbs and jog the eight-yard length of the cage to warm up, Hemery laid down on a bench. Finally they were allowed on to the track, checked their blocks, practised a start, hyperventilated to draw as much oxygen as they could into their lungs, stripped off their tracksuits and waited for the starter to whistle. In lane six again, Hemery took a few strides out of his blocks on the command of \u201cstand-up, please\u201d after a false-start outside him. They waited for the gun the second time and Hemery found his rhythm from the start. \u201cFirst hurdle came spot on,\u201d he remembered. \u201cFast and relaxed.\u201d By the third hurdle he had passed Whitney in lane seven and only Sherwood in lane eight remained in his vision. After the sixth hurdle, when he changed to 15 strides, he lost sight of his compatriot so for the last 190m he was running blind. \u201cI started to question whether it would be possible to maintain so much effort and not die before the end,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one step my pace eased but instantly a flash came through my mind, \u2018this is the Olympic final \u2013 you can\u2019t let up now\u2019.\u201d On he went, panicking when he heard a foot splash, which he estimated to be very close to him on his left. Smith had told him to \u201cgo at the last hurdle as if it were the first of a 110m spring hurdle race\u201d but only remembered the advice after he had cleared it. Even so he managed to change gear into a sprint for the final 45m. He dipped at the line but because he had not looked to his left over the last metres was not wholly convinced that someone had not passed him on the inside. It was only when he saw a BBC camera crew racing towards him that he became convinced that he had won. And not just won, but thrashed the field in 48.12sec, to take the world record by eight-tenths of a second. \u201cI believe,\u201d wrote the Times\u2019s correspondent Neil Allen the next day, \u201cthis was the outstanding British athletics performance of all time.\u201d Afterwards Hemery said that he had \u201crun scared\u201d for 48.1sec. Among all his other achievements that day was that never for a second did his demeanour betray anything other than supreme talent, confidence and judgment. What the Guardian said The Guardian, October 16 1968 Dave Hemery, aged 24, brought Britain her first gold medal of the Olympics here this evening with a performance that staggered the crowd and left his rivals shattered. He won the 400 metres hurdles in 41.8sec, slicing the phenomenal amount of seven-tenths of a second off the world record by Geoff Vanderstock (America) one of those left in the wake. Hemery won the race by 12 yards and one of the first men to congratulate him was Lord Exeter who last won this Olympic title for Britain in Amsterdam in 1928.   Related: Kendra Harrison sets 100m hurdles world record at Anniversary Games    Hemery, out of the American mould of hurdlers \u2013 he has been studying at Boston University \u2013 led all the way. He went into the second flight just ahead, pushed hard down the back straight and for a few moments just before he had to change from 13 strides between hurdles to 15 strides, I feared he had overdone things. But rather than lose ground he gained it and along the straight Hemery, perfection at every obstacle, was out on his own while the rest panted and struggled for minor prizes. At the finish Hemery was in no way distressed. He nodded and raised his hand to salute the crowd as though he knew it was going to happen. The evening was chill and damp \u2013 it was the weather for the British not the Americans nor the Italians. And the performance of Hemery showed too how much he has been keeping secret during the early rounds of the competition. It was a barely credible performance. Something to rank along with Herb Elliott\u2019s 1,500 metres win in the Rome Olympics and with the two medal-winning performances of Peter Snell in Tokyo. No words are too great in praise of this performance. What happened next Hemery never quite reached the heights of Mexico 68 again, although he did win silver in the 4x400m relay and bronze in the 400m hurdles in the Munich Games four years later. The following year he won the first ever British Superstars competition, a title he won again in 1976."}, {"sentences": ["In October, Tate Modern will devote a big retrospective show to Klein and the Japanese photographer, Daido Moriyama, exploring the often similar ways in which they each depicted New York and Tokyo.", "Klein burst on to the photography scene in the early 60s with a series of books about cities \u2013 New York, Rome, Moscow and Tokyo \u2013 filled with raw, grainy, black-and-white photographs that caught the energy and movement of modern urban life with scant regard for traditional composition.", "Between 1960 and 1964, he published three others, Rome, Moscow and Tokyo."], "tags": ["William Klein", "Photography", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Film"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-28T20:31:25Z", "title": "William Klein: 'I was an outsider, following my instincts'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/28/william-klein-interview-sony-photography", "article": "&apos;People were terrified of him, as though it was the lion&apos;s den,&quot; the Vogue model, Dorothy McGowan, said of working with William Klein back in the 60s. At\u00a084, Klein has mellowed somewhat, though he still tells it like it is. &quot;People ask me why I never went back home to America,&quot; he says, when I meet him in his apartment overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. &quot;Have you seen those crazy right-wing assholes who want to be president? The place is so reactionary it just makes me angry. If I lived there, you wouldn&apos;t be interviewing me, I&apos;d be dead from a heart attack by now.&quot; Wearing patched, faded denim jeans and a baggy jumper, his mane of white hair thinner now, Klein moves slowly and unsteadily around his spacious but cluttered living room, still stiff from a recent knee operation. His eyes are bright and mischievous, though, and there are glimpses of the confident-to-the-point-of-arrogant young man who ranks as one of the great iconoclasts of postwar American photography. &quot;I&apos;m an outsider, I guess,&quot; he says of his groundbreaking early work. &quot;I wasn&apos;t part of any movement. I was working alone, following my instinct. I had no real respect for good technique because I didn&apos;t know what it was. I was self-taught, so that stuff didn&apos;t matter to me.&quot; Having fallen in and out of fashion with galleries over the years, Klein is finally having a moment. Last week, he was given the outstanding contribution to photography award at the 2012 Sony World Photography Awards \u2013 work by award winners, including Klein, is on show at Somerset House. In October, Tate Modern will devote a big retrospective show to Klein and the Japanese photographer, Daido Moriyama, exploring the often similar ways in which they each depicted New York and Tokyo. &quot;I think it&apos;s kind of stupid,&quot; he says, shrugging, when I mention how intriguing the show sounds, &quot;but a lot of things happen without me really being involved. There&apos;s a connection all right, but\u2026&quot; He trails off and shrugs some more. One senses that he would have preferred a big London show all to himself, but does not have the energy to kick up the kind of fuss about it that his younger self would have done. Klein burst on to the photography scene in the early 60s with a series of books about cities \u2013 New York, Rome, Moscow and Tokyo \u2013 filled with raw, grainy, black-and-white photographs that caught the energy and movement of modern urban life with scant regard for traditional composition. The\u00a0first, Life Is Good &amp; Good For You in New York (1956), once it got published, earned him the opprobrium of both critics and other photographers alike. &quot;They just didn&apos;t get it,&quot; he says. &quot;They thought it should not have been published, that it was vulgar and somehow sinned against the great sacred tradition of the photography book. They were annoyed for sure.&quot; The book has long since been recognised as a classic that, alongside Robert Frank&apos;s The Americans, broke with the tradition of brilliant but understated observation, as exemplified by Henri Cartier-Bresson. Then, in 1965, just as suddenly as he had picked up his stills camera, Klein discarded it to become a film-maker, making fictional satires of the fashion industry (Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?) and the America right (Mr Freedom) and documentaries on the likes of Muhammad Ali and Little Richard. He did not return to photography until the early 80s. &quot;I thought I had done what I could with it. I wanted a new challenge and film was certainly that, mainly because they never gave me big budgets.&quot; He shakes his head as if still baffled by the very notion. &quot;I guess I wasn&apos;t really Hollywood material,&quot; he says finally, grinning his mischievous big grin. Instead, he has always been an artist who follows his instincts, whatever the costs. Apart from a stint in New York from the mid-50s to the mid-60s, Klein has lived in Paris since 1948, when, having served in the US army in Germany and France, he received an ex-serviceman&apos;s grant to study art at the Sorbonne. On his first day in the city, the Red Cross gave him a bicycle and a map. As he was cycling around, &quot;trying to find all these places I&apos;d read about in books&quot;, he saw a woman who literally stopped him in his tracks. &quot;She was the most beautiful girl I ever saw,&quot; he says, his eyes lighting up, &quot;I just had to go over and chat her up. She was all smiles, so I asked her out.&quot; She said yes, and they were together for more than 50 years. His wife, Jeanne Florin, died in 2005. &quot;Everything I did, I did for her,&quot; he told a recent interviewer. Despite his street-tough exterior, a residue of childhood as a Jewish boy marooned in a tough Irish neighbourhood in Brooklyn, he is, at heart, a romantic, something his long self-exile has deepened. At the Sorbonne, one of his tutors was Fernand L\u00e9ger, a mischief maker who was at war with the bourgeois values of the university. &quot;He told us not to worry about galleries and collectors, but to go out onto the city streets and paint murals.&quot; It was while photographing some interior murals he had made on movable panels \u2013 &quot;big hard-edged geometrical paintings&quot; \u2013 that Klein had the epiphany that made him a photographer. &quot;Somebody turned one of the panels when I was shooting on a long exposure, and when I developed the photographs this already abstract shape was a beautiful blur. That blur was a revelation. I thought, here&apos;s a way of talking about life. Through photography, you can really talk about what you see around you. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been doing ever since.&quot; Klein&apos;s big commercial break came when Alexander Liberman, the legendary art director of Vogue, saw a small exhibition of his early abstract photographs in 1955 and offered him a job. &quot;Those guys spotted raw talent and encouraged it. They were all Russian Jews in exile: Liberman at Vogue, Alexey Brodovitch at Harper&apos;s Bazaar. They had a knowledge of avant garde art and design that the Americans didn&apos;t have.&quot; Klein returned to New York and worked for Vogue for 10 years as a fashion photographer, shooting models in the hustle and bustle of the New York streets. It was the first glimpse of his iconoclastic style, photographs full of blur, movement and grainy high contrast. He used long-focus and wide-angle lenses as well as flash, less interested in the clothes than the atmosphere. &quot;They were probably the most unpopular fashion photographs Vogue ever published,&quot; he says proudly. Sensing his restlessness, Liberman offered to finance a bigger, more ambitious project. Klein told him that he wanted to shoot New York in a radical new way, maybe even try to make a kind of impressionistic diary of his wanderings on the streets. Vogue financed the project and provided him with a dark room and a budget for materials. The New York book grew out of this experiment. Klein was, he said later, &quot;in search of the rawest snapshot, the zero degree of photography&quot;. He also described himself as &quot;a make-believe ethnographer, treating New Yorkers like an explorer would treat Zulus&quot;. Given his approach, was he surprised that people were shocked by Life is Good &amp; Good For You in New York, which was first published in France in 1956? &quot;Not really. I was showing what they didn&apos;t want to see. I was reacting against this romantic idea of New York \u2013 the Big Apple and all that. See, for me, New York was like a big shithouse.&quot; I look surprised and he grins widely. &quot;Of course, New Yorkers think it&apos;s the centre of the earth. My father was like that. He used to go on about how it was the greatest city on earth, the land of opportunity, even though he had a lousy job and never really made it. [His father&apos;s clothing business went bust in the financial crash of 1928.] He was like the guy in Death of a Salesman, but all he could talk about was the land of opportunity. I didn&apos;t buy that crap.&quot; Klein&apos;s New York book did not find an American publisher for several decades. Between 1960 and 1964, he published three others, Rome, Moscow and Tokyo. Then, bored and restless once more, he started to make films. Klein had worked as an assistant on Federico Fellini&apos;s Nights of Cabiria in 1956 \u2013 &quot;I just called his hotel and said, &apos;I want to speak to Mr Fellini&apos; and they put me through&quot; \u2013 and as artistic consultant on Louis Malle&apos;s Zazie dans le Metro in 1960. Inspired by the French new wave and the films of Chris Marker, he set about biting the hand that had fed him, making Who Are You, Polly Maggoo?, a wacky satire on the fashion industry. It starred his favourite model, Dorothy McGowan. &quot;She was a tough little Irish girl from Brooklyn. Learned French and then learned her lines. She was like Alice in Wonderland in Paris, they loved her, but she wanted Hollywood.&quot; What happened to her, I ask. &quot;She got married to a prick,&quot; he says, grimacing. He went on to make some great documentaries, including Muhammad Ali: the Greatest (1969), Eldridge Cleaver: Black Panther (1970) and The Little Richard Story (1980). Was he, I ask, a radical? &quot;I was left\u00a0wing, for sure.&quot; he says &quot;But I had no agenda with the films. I took it as it came. I was drawn to great characters and those guys fitted the bill, though Little Richard was a little bit different.&quot; I put it to him that the film should really have been called In Search of Little Richard. &quot;Yeah, he disappeared on us. He was crazy like that. We organised a Little Richard day in his home town, Macon, Georgia, and he didn&apos;t show up.&quot; Did you fall out? &quot;No. I got on well with him, but he was managed by these white hustlers who were like a mafia. They wanted him to endorse a bible for black people. They said: &apos;We&apos;re gonna organise your big comeback, but no crazy hairdos and no wild costumes.&apos; The thing is, without that stuff, there was no Little Richard. He knew that, so he just disappeared. It was a crazy scene, but I had fun.&quot; This, you suspect, is the real story of William Klein&apos;s life: work as fun, with a little bit of confrontation thrown in. He returned to photography in the 80s, when he was finally recognised as a pioneer \u2013 his early books influencing generations of photographers in Europe, America and especially Japan. He has since been garlanded with awards, and is also recognised as an iconoclast of graphic design, mainly through the use of the bold red and black swipes of paint he often applied to his enlarged contact sheets. Alongside his Tate Modern show in October, his London gallery, HackelBury, will host an exhibition of his art, William Klein: Paintings Etc. &quot;It&apos;s a lot of stuff that no one has seen before,&quot; he says. &quot;So, who knows, I might surprise people all over again.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The resulting annular, or ring eclipse, is visible along a 300 km wide path that sweeps across the N Pacific (and the Date Line) from Hong Kong and Tokyo on the morning of the 21st local time to the W USA where it ends on the evening of the 20th."], "tags": ["Astronomy", "Space", "Science", "Venus"], "publicationDate": "2012-04-29T21:30:01Z", "title": "Starwatch: The May night sky", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/29/starwatch-venus-may-sky-planets", "article": "Venus concludes its spell as a brilliant evening star by diving into our evening twilight during May.

The resulting annular, or ring eclipse, is visible along a 300 km wide path that sweeps across the N Pacific (and the Date Line) from Hong Kong and Tokyo on the morning of the 21st local time to the W USA where it ends on the evening of the 20th. Surrounding areas, but not Europe, see a partial solar eclipse.

One cannot miss the hundreds of thousands of people with cloth of the colour pinned to their coats and satchels; the stickers pasted on street poles and storefront mannequins; and the sheets fluttering from balconies and windows. The red squares \u2013 punning visually on a French expression to be squarely in the red, or in debt \u2013 are a gesture of solidarity with university and college students on a massive general strike against government tuition fee hikes. They have also become a symbol of the most powerful challenge to neoliberalism on the continent. Canadian students have been furiously mobilizing for a freeze on tuition fees since last spring, when the Liberal provincial government announced hikes of 75% over five years. A general strike launched this February shuttered most of the province&apos;s colleges and universities. In Montreal, family-friendly street-theatre and marches peaked with a historic rally of 200,000 on 22 March; business-unfriendly blockades of banks, bridges and government ministries have often paralyzed the downtown core. And over the last week, tens of thousands have joined a nightly protest ritual, marching through Montreal past the midnight hour. Tuition in Quebec remains the lowest in North America, because of generations of student protest \u2013 but the militant coalition CLASSE, representing half the striking students, has always included in its program free and universal post-secondary education. The government&apos;s response has been to wage a war on the students&apos; right to collectively negotiate the conditions of their studies. It has mocked and vilified students in the corporate media; sought legal injunctions to dismantle picket lines and force teachers to class; and unleashed vicious police crackdowns and mass arrests against peaceful protesters as young as 15 and 16. Some students now wear red eye-patches after one was shot at close range by a flash-bang grenade and lost his vision.  In the painful tumult of daily protests, an entire generation of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois youth is learning a political lesson no class would ever teach: violence underlies all of society&apos;s inequalities, and power doesn&apos;t yield an inch without a fight. The students&apos; courage and creativity in the face of such brutality has lit a fire under Quebec. Their achievement has been to begin to clarify for a broad swath of society that a tuition hike is not a matter of isolated accounting, but the goal of a neoliberal austerity agenda the world over. Forcing students to pay more for education is part of a transfer of wealth from the poor and middle-class to the rich \u2013 as with privatization and the state&apos;s withdrawal from service-provision, tax breaks for corporations and deep cuts to social programs.  The fault-lines of the struggle over education \u2013 dividing those who preach it must be a commodity purchased by &quot;consumers&quot; for self-advancement, and those who would protect it as a right funded by the state for the collective good \u2013 has thus sparked a fundamental debate about the entire society&apos;s future. Quebec is, in some ways, uniquely disposed for such a debate. During the long struggle to maintain a French identity under pressure of English Canadian domination and the homogenizing force of the market, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have developed a strong sense of social solidarity. While neoliberalism has captured the two main political parties and incrementally encroached on the economy, its cultural victory \u2013 instilling values of rampant individualism and competition \u2013 has only been partial.  The ideal of free post secondary education \u2013 recommended in the 1960s by a famous state-commissioned inquiry, but long since snuffed out among the economic elite \u2013 has been kept alive for decades by the student unions. And as the federal Conservative government, increasingly indifferent to Quebec, shifts economic and political power westward to Alberta, such progressive yearnings could deepen. Little wonder students&apos; imagination was stirred by the past year of world rebellion. That inspiration has been distilled in the movement&apos;s main slogan, &quot;Printemps \u00e9rable,&quot; a clever play on words that literally means Maple Spring but sounds like Arab Spring.  The Occupy movement has also been a game-changer, here as elsewhere. Its spirit of direct democracy has clicked with the Quebec student union&apos;s history of grassroots organizing through decentralized general assemblies. And it has given students a fresh language with which to understand the 1%&apos;s attempt to pass the buck to students: the emerging consensus of the neoliberal elite \u2013 whether in Quebec, Chile, England or the US \u2013 is that they would prefer their labor force pay for its own education and training, and then simply exploit them.  If students have brought the spirit of global unrest to Quebec, what the government fears most is that they may now spread it permanently to wider society. Students are deepening ties with laid-off and locked-out workers across the province. They have joined civic groups in criticizing a multibillion-dollar scheme to open up indigenous peoples&apos; lands in Quebec&apos;s north to a frenzy of mining, oil and forestry operations, which the premier has shopped to investors in London, Tokyo and Rio De Janeiro. And the movement gave an electrifying jolt to an Earth Day mobilization on 22 April, helping to bring nearly 300,000 onto the streets. It is hardly a coincidence that, the same day, the Quebec government agreed finally to negotiations. The government has delayed in the hope that the student movement will sputter out, succumb to division, or marginalize itself through street-fighting and property damage. They have badly miscalculated. Cracks are indeed appearing, but among the ruling Liberal party and their business allies. Policing costs will soon exceed the value of the tuition increase. Montreal&apos;s tourist reputation could take a hit. And students are beginning to garner international press and support.  The feeling taking root among students and others is that this is the chance to turn the tide of a generation. In the words of the French chant resounding daily in the streets, &quot;On ne l\u00e2che pas&quot; \u2013 we&apos;re not backing down."}, {"sentences": ["After a spell in Tokyo, enjoying the city&apos;s experimental music venues, the pair decided to set up something similar in London."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Jazz", "Electronic music", "Classical music"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-02T17:18:29Z", "title": "Why east London's Cafe Oto is Britain's coolest venue", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/02/cafe-oto-italian-vogue", "article": "It&apos;s a Thursday night at Cafe Oto and emotions are running high. A hushed crowd has just spent two hours listening to leftfield legend Robert Wyatt play tracks from his back catalogue. The huge windows in this converted warehouse are steamed up and one audience member is close to tears, having just been telling Wyatt how much his music means to him. He is cheered warmly. &quot;Blimey,&quot; says Wyatt. Cafe Oto, founded by Hamish Dunbar and his partner Keiko Yamamoto, claims to be the only UK venue exclusively foregrounding experimental music. When Japan&apos;s Otomo Yoshihide performed there in 2010, they had to switch off the bar fridges as their hum was louder than the show, which featured Yoshihide &quot;playing&quot; the edge of a credit card on an unamplified turntable. Having survived without funding since its opening, Cafe Oto has just celebrated its fourth anniversary \u2013 and a double windfall. Not only has Arts Council England given it a \u00a320,000 grant, it has also won the new \u00a325,000 Genesis prize for its work as an arts mentor. Cafe Oto has also been acclaimed further afield, with Italian Vogue recently calling it the coolest venue in Britain. However, even though it&apos;s situated in the hipster centre of Dalston in east London, the crowd watching Wyatt are hardly high fashion, even if there is a pop star, Hot Chip singer Alexis Taylor, present. It&apos;s mostly the kind of earnest young men you see scrutinising the racks of independent record shops throughout the country. &quot;The vibe is functional and no-frills,&quot; says the comedian Stewart Lee, a regular, &quot;rather than the ersatz no-frills vibe that tossers with too much money aim for in trendy spaces. It&apos;s what Yanks tell you downtown NY is like but actually isn&apos;t. It&apos;s what I dreamed London would be like, and what it was a bit like in the 80s.&quot; Cafe Oto is not the sort of place where you stand around chatting while the bands play. &quot;You&apos;d have to be socially inept to talk when there are 200 people totally silent,&quot; says Dunbar. &quot;But it&apos;s very rare that I have to tap someone on the shoulder. It becomes self-policing. It&apos;s the least hip place in Dalston in many respects. We have people in our audience in their 80s down to 18. Sometimes they&apos;re obsessive, nerdy characters. People don&apos;t come because they think it&apos;s a cool place to hang out, but because they want to hear stuff.&quot; This summer, the cafe will create the opening event for the Serpentine Pavilion in Hyde Park, which is being designed by Ai Weiwei. Dunbar promises a &quot;weird opera&quot; with a turn by a musician who is &quot;quite famous \u2013 in the avant-garde world&quot;. Dunbar, 32, grew up in Devon listening to Captain Beefheart and his father&apos;s jazz records. He met Yamamoto at Central Saint Martins art college in London, where he was studying painting and she fine art. After a spell in Tokyo, enjoying the city&apos;s experimental music venues, the pair decided to set up something similar in London. Every bank turned them down for a loan; but, says Dunbar, &quot;there was this thing in Hackney where the council would give you loans to start a business if you got refused by a bank.&quot; They were awarded \u00a325,000, which they recently paid back. In 2008, Cafe Oto (the word means both &quot;noise&quot; and &quot;music&quot; in Japanese) opened amid rubble and mess with a concert by their friend Saya, singer with Japanese band Tenniscoats. She played to 80 people. For the first two years, Dunbar and Yamamoto worked 17-hour days, seven days a week. &quot;Just a couple of hours of sleep,&quot; says Yamamoto. &quot;Just me and Hamish from morning to night, making coffee and booking bands from a laptop behind the counter. We didn&apos;t have any money.&quot; Acts haven&apos;t all been near-inaudible. Germany&apos;s Caspar Br\u00f6tzmann Massacre, who don&apos;t so much play instruments as attack them, were &quot;brutally loud&quot;, says Dunbar, while the Korean collective Balloon &amp; Needle took their amplifiers on to the fire escape and orchestrated their sound by opening and shutting the door. When Sean Lennon played, his mother, Yoko Ono, came out of the audience to perform two numbers. &quot;My mum dined out on that for weeks,&quot; says Dunbar. Dunbar describes Cafe Oto&apos;s choice of acts as &quot;underground music&quot;: Thurston Moore, the Sonic Youth founder who has played the venue several times, is as mainstream as it gets. &quot;We turn down huge amounts of stuff,&quot; says Dunbar. &quot;If\u00a0it&apos;s bland and boring and being done in other places, why do it here?&quot; Dunbar also refuses to allow &quot;big external promoters&quot; to hire the space. &quot;You know you&apos;ll make some money behind the bar, but we try to say no. If we compromise too much, all those hours of slog are worth nothing.&quot; Nevertheless, flying musicians in from Japan does not come cheap, still less putting up the 13 members of the Sun Ra Arkestra (Philadelphia-based jazz mystics whose founder claimed to be\u00a0from Saturn) for a three-night residency. Tickets are usually around \u00a38 for an international musician, \u00a36 for a local one; the Arkestra cost \u00a322. The Genesis money will be used to support five local musicians, setting up collaborations with acts from abroad and getting them onto the bills of European festivals, where Dunbar says avant-garde music is better funded. Lee worries that Dunbar &quot;is clearly on to something and will presumably be immediately neutered by the establishment, and put in an office to think for two years and then not have any of his ideas developed, before splitting to get back to doing whatever he was doing so well before.&quot; Yet Dunbar seems unshakeably committed. &quot;Sometimes I think, &apos;God, this is too much work.&apos; But we&apos;re stubborn and that&apos;s really important. To do something like this you have to be dogged.&quot; Wyatt ends his night sitting outside as fans come to congratulate him. &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful place,&quot; he says. &quot;My wife and I haven&apos;t lived in London for nearly 25 years. But we&apos;d have worked out a way to stay longer if we&apos;d known there was stuff like this going on.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2012.

Valiant attempts have been made to popularise the sport outside Japan, but to little avail. James Bond pops into a sumo stadium in You Only Live Twice, but predictably only spends a few seconds watching the action before his attention span&apos;s dick squirms toward a beautiful female spy situated nearby. In the 1990s, Channel 4 optimistically dangled televised sumo tournaments in front of its audience, like a waiter making a cheery-yet-doomed attempt\u00a0to interest a diner in the kangaroo-and-lemon pie instead of cod and chips. It didn&apos;t catch on. The problem is this: to a Westerner, sumo looks inherently silly. Fat men in nappies: that&apos;s our gut reaction. Skim a languid eye over it and it scarcely resembles a sport at all. At first\u00a0glance it&apos;s an excuse to show off the participants&apos; bodies, with particular emphasis on the buttocks \u2013 a bit like beach volleyball with diabetic coach drivers. At second glance, all that pushing and shoving looks less like a martial art and more like a fight in a pub doorway. There is, of course, rather more to it than that, but you have to sit down and pay attention for\u00a0some time before you unlock it. Despite a string of recent match-fixing scandals denting its popularity, sumo remains Japan&apos;s national sport, so when visiting Tokyo during one of the professional sumo tournaments, it would be churlish not to at least try to get a seat. The national \u00a0stadium, or Kokugikan, is situated in the Ryogoku district: you can&apos;t miss it during a tournament thanks to the hundreds of brightly coloured nobori flags outside. During a tournament, the various bouts and interspersed ceremonies go on all day, and if you&apos;re a tourist rather than a committed sumo fan, things only really get interesting in the final few hours, so plan your day\u00a0accordingly. Our seats were located up in the gods, which meant upon entering I was treated to an impressive view of the entire arena. Being largely allergic to sport of any kind, it&apos;s easy for me to forget just how popular it is, and since I have only been to a few live sporting events in my life, I&apos;m always surprised and impressed by their sheer scale. The sumo tournament was no exception to the rule \u2013 I had to catch my breath as I walked in \u2013 but the surrounding air of ancient ritual gave it an additional unreal tinge. The combination of crowds, costumes and ceremony made it feel like a cross between a cricket ground, a theatre, and a cathedral. I was determined to try to enjoy the sport itself. But first I had to get to my seat. I figured I would saunter in suavely, like James Bond had. But there were three crucial differences between me and James Bond. Firstly, he was visiting a different stadium (the\u00a0current one opened in 1985). Second, Bond arrived during the summer, so he didn&apos;t walk in wearing\u00a0an absurdly huge parka coat that rendered him slightly less manoeuvrable than a dead hovercraft. Many of the ground-floor seats are actually tatami mats the spectators sit upon, cross-legged. Up in the circle, you clamber along an insanely narrow row into a tiny seat with an arm table attached to it \u2013 handy for resting a bento box and a beer on (it even has a bottle opener attached), but infuriating when you&apos;re trying to squeeze into position while wearing a coat the size of a dinghy. I&apos;ve never tried to carry a bouncy castle on the London Underground, but I imagine it can&apos;t be much trickier. What I&apos;m saying is this: in winter, use the cloakroom. Still, once you&apos;re sitting down, you can concentrate on the action itself. At first, the ceremony-to-sport ratio in sumo seems maddening, but that&apos;s partly because an outsider will find it hard to separate ritual from\u00a0universal sporting admin. For instance,\u00a0several matches were preceded by a small parade of men clutching brightly coloured banners with mysterious text printed all over them: it was only when I noticed one banner had a photo of a biscuit on it that I realised these were adverts from commercial sponsors. Which isn&apos;t to say there isn&apos;t a lot of ceremonial faffing: there is. The wrestlers spend several minutes slowly adjusting their belts, stretching, slapping their thighs, squatting, stomping, and tossing purifying salt into the ring before launching themselves at one another for a battle that often lasts mere seconds. Once you get over the initial novelty value, the bouts feel completely underwhelming \u2013 until, that is, you witness your first surprise victory. A\u00a0wrestler teetering on the brink of the\u00a0ring, on the verge of an apparently inevitable loss, somehow regains his balance, deftly lolls to the side, pushes back, and sends his bewildered opponent tumbling to the ground. The crowd roars and you&apos;re roaring too. From this point on, the protracted ceremonial buildup to each fight actively adds to the tension. What&apos;s more, the fights seem to slow down in your head and make sense. The climax of the final bout on the day we visited was a major upset: the crowd went wild, hurling seat cushions into the air in a display of surprised delight. Many retired sumo wrestlers open restaurants serving chankonabe \u2013 the\u00a0meal they cook on a daily basis at the stables; a one-pot dish consisting of\u00a0meat, tofu, vegetables and stock. Our guide in Tokyo, Tyler Palma, took us to Kotogaume, a chankonabe restaurant run by a retired sumo wrestler of the same name. Kotogaume\u00a0means &quot;harp plum&quot;, apparently, which goes to show that even after translation, some phrases stubbornly refuse to make sense. The chankonabe bubbles away in the centre of the table while you sit cross-legged on the tatami floor. I say &quot;sitting&quot;: in my case, I mean shifting awkwardly in a vain attempt to get comfortable. James Bond I am not. Fortunately the chankonabe makes up for the loss of blood to the thighs. Once you&apos;ve eaten most of the meat and veg, noodles are added to the stock for a second helping. It&apos;s simple, tasty fare, and until the noodles enter the fray it feels surprisingly healthy, too, which makes it hard to believe this is the stuff sumo wrestlers are built from \u2013 although they do tend to guzzle it in huge quantities, washed down with beer and followed by a long doze. You know. Like darts players probably do. As we leave, Kotogaume himself appears, and bids us farewell. We thank him and hop in a cab (in Japan, cab doors open automatically as you approach). The Japanese have a peculiar custom when saying goodbye:\u00a0it&apos;s polite for them to stand rooted to the spot, watching you vanish into the distance until you&apos;re a dot on the horizon. I snuck glances back at Kotogaume as the car drove off. Being a sumo, you can see him from quite a distance. Sure enough he stood there; a content, overgrown cherub, smiling at our cab until eventually we turned a corner. \u2022 Charlie&apos;s trip was provided by Inside Japan (insidejapantours.com).

On Saturday, when the Hokkaido electric power company shuts down the No3 reactor at its Tomari plant for maintenance, the world&apos;s third-largest economy will be without a single working nuclear reactor for the first time for almost 50 years. The closure of the last of Japan&apos;s 54 reactors marks a dramatic shift in energy policy, but while campaigners prepare to celebrate, the nationwide nuclear blackout comes with significant economic and environmental risks attached. The crisis at Fukushima sparked by last year&apos;s deadly earthquake and tsunami forced Japan into a fundamental rethink of its relationship with nuclear power. The Tomari shutdown come as the Japan braces itself for a long, humid summer that will have tens of millions of people reaching for the controls of their air conditioners, raising the risk of power cuts and yet more disruption for the country&apos;s ailing manufacturers. In a report released this week, the government&apos;s national policy unit projected a 5% power shortage for Tokyo, while power companies predict a 16% power shortfall in western Japan, which includes the major industrial city of Osaka. &quot;I have to say we are facing the risk of a very severe electricity shortage,&quot; the economy, trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said, adding that the extra cost of importing fuel for use in thermal power stations could be passed on to individual consumers though higher electricity bills. Before the 11 March disaster, Japan relied on nuclear power for about 30% of its electricity, and there were plans to increase its share to more than 50% by 2030 with the construction of new reactors. The release of huge quantities of radiation into the air and sea, the contamination of the food and water supply and the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents mean that vision of a nuclear-dominant, low-carbon future lies in ruins. Over the past 14 months, dozens of nuclear reactors not directly affected by the tsunami have gone offline to undergo regular maintenance and safety checks, while utilities have turned to coal, oil and gas-fired power plants to keep industry and households supplied with electricity \u2013 imports that contribute to Japan&apos;s first trade deficit for more than 30 years last year. Japan, already the world&apos;s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, bought record amounts of LNG last year to replace nuclear. The international energy agency estimates the closure of all nuclear plants will increase Japanese demand for oil to 4.5m barrels a day, at an additional cost of about US$100m a day. Last-ditch attempts by the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to win support for the early restart of two reactors at Oi power plant in western Japan have failed amid a hardening of public opposition to nuclear power. None of Japan&apos;s idle reactors will be permitted to go back online until they pass stringent &quot;stress tests&quot; \u2013 simulations designed to test their ability to withstand catastrophic events such as the 14-metre tsunami that knocked out Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s backup power supply, and sparked the world&apos;s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. While some experts have criticised the two-stage stress tests as inadequate, an immediate return to even a limited amount of nuclear power now seems impossible. Residents&apos; approval isn&apos;t legally required for restarts, but Noda is unlikely to risk the possible political fallout from ignoring local opinion: in a recent poll by Kyodo News, 59.5% are opposed to restarting the Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture, while 26.7% support it. Leading the push to restart the reactors is Keidanren, Japan&apos;s influential business lobby. In a recent survey, 71% of manufacturers said power shortages could force them to cut production, while 96% said that the additional spectre of higher electricity bills would hit earnings. The Japan Institute for Energy Economics has warned that keeping nuclear reactors mothballed could limit GDP growth to just 0.1% this year, as manufacturers cut back production while paying higher prices for crude. Critics of the nuclear shutdown have also highlighted the impact more fossil fuel power generation will have on Japan&apos;s climate change commitments. Even big investors in renewables, such as the Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son, concede it will take time for them to have any real impact on the country&apos;s energy mix. They will be buoyed by a new environment ministry panel&apos;s assertion that Japan can still reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 from 1990 levels without nuclear, through energy saving and the quicker adoption of renewables, which it hopes will account for between 25% and 35% of total power generation by 2030. &quot;If Japan has the motivation, it can do this, too,&quot; said Sei Kato, deputy director of the environment ministry&apos;s low carbon society promotion office. &quot;We have the technological know-how.&quot; Short-term risks aside, environmental groups say Saturday&apos;s shutdown is an unprecedented opportunity for Japan to wean itself off nuclear power. &quot;This is a turning point for Japan, and a huge opportunity for it to move towards the sustainable energy future its people demand,&quot; Greenpeace said in its advanced energy revolution report. &quot;With an abundance of renewable energy resources and top-class technology, Japan can easily become a renewable energy leader, while simultaneously ending its reliance on risky and expensive nuclear technology.&quot; On Tuesday, office workers made their contribution with the start, one month earlier than usual, of the annual &quot;cool biz&quot; drive to reduce energy use. But swapping suits and ties for short-sleeved shirts, and turning down air conditioners will be easy for as long as Japan enjoys mild spring temperatures. The biggest test of their post-Fukushima resolve has yet to come."}, {"sentences": ["The efficiency measures are delivering major changes in the targeted areas, such as in Tokyo, with reductions of 18% in peak demand in August and the actions of people at home leading to an 17% reduction in consumption."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "World news", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-03T15:07:40Z", "title": "Japanese energy policy stands at a crossroads | Comment", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-post-fukushima", "article": "Japan will close its last nuclear power plant on Saturday, at least temporarily. Before the Fukushima disaster in 2011, there were 54 reactors providing one-third of the country&apos;s electricity. The unprecedented speed and extent of Japan&apos;s current denuclearisation offers an important lesson: society is a powerful force for implementing policies it supports, but also for blocking unwanted policies. What stands out when comparing the response of the UK, Germany and Japan to Fukushima is Germany&apos;s responsive governance, which translates its citizens&apos; concerns into opportunities for Germany PLC. The opposite is the case in Britain, where governance tends to strangle innovation and continues to push an increasingly untenable nuclear strategy, despite the preference for renewable energy of most of its citizens. Japan itself is at an energy crossroads. Over the past 14 months, Japan&apos;s reactors have been closed one-by-one after routine refuelling and maintenance checks. This has occurred partly because new safety tests put in place since Fukishima have neither been agreed nor approved, but also because local opposition means the consent of local government can no longer be assured. Japanese policy is now stuck between public opinion, which is increasingly opposed to nuclear power, and the energy industry, which remains in the hands of the large centralised utilities who want a continued role for nuclear power. Unsurprisingly, the loss of one-third of electricity generation in Japan is leading to massive changes in energy supply and demand, including the weekend and night operation of factories to spread the electricity load, much less use of air conditioning and the greater use of fossil fuel plants. The efficiency measures are delivering major changes in the targeted areas, such as in Tokyo, with reductions of 18% in peak demand in August and the actions of people at home leading to an 17% reduction in consumption. Japan also installed 1,000MW of solar photovoltaics in 2011 and is introducing new legislation to double the use of renewables and introduce German-style feed-in tariffs. Analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance suggests that 20GW of solar and wind could be in place by 2014. So one upside of the tragedy is a much greater public engagement with their energy use \u2013 something which seems to be a central but elusive requirement in achieving a successful energy transformation. Another implication is that for the first time, Japanese consumers are making their energy views known. It is unclear whether, even if it wanted to, the Japanese government could restart a supportive post-Fukishima nuclear policy. The response to the Fukushima disaster by Germany and Britain were starkly different from each other. Germany permanently closed eight reactors in the summer of 2011, with the gradual phase out of the rest expected by 2022. This was adopted by all major parties \u2013 the only party who objected thought 2022 was too slow \u2013 giving political stability and consensus. Critics who argued that carbon dioxide emissions would rise, that Germany would have to import electricity, and that there would be a negative impact on energy prices have been proven wrong. Germany remains a net electricity exporter and CO2 fell by 2.4% in 2011, with public opinion remaining supportive of the phase-out. However, it is the decision to turn the nuclear phase-out into an opportunity for German manufacturing and employment which is so bold. This includes a significant increase in renewable energy deployment: 35% of electricity by 2020 and 50% by 2030, as well as significant new investment in energy efficiency, infrastructure and energy storage systems and the construction of highly efficient fossil fuel plants. This represents a national response of far greater depth and breadth than a narrow decision to support nuclear power or not. It reflects a country commitment to staying at the forefront of technological development and innovation. This requires flexibility not just in technology use and in valuing the wider benefits technology can bring to society, but also in its governance process which enables a quick but legitimate policy response. On the other hand, the British government response to Fukushima incident was a rapid public reassurance that no such nuclear accident could occur in Britain, followed by a statement of support for its ongoing policy to build a new generation of nuclear power plants, now stuttering as companies cancel their planned reactors. What are the lessons which can be extracted from these three separate histories? One obviously is that if there is political consensus and will, incredible and rapid change can occur to a country&apos;s energy system which can not only be environmentally, but also financially, beneficial. Germany has built, step by step, an integrated but pragmatic energy system. It has transformed support for domestic renewable energy into a long-term strategic goal of society, avoiding destructive opposition along the way. One aspect of this has been to stop incumbent energy companies from controlling the development of the energy system, although it has allowed them to benefit from those changes. It has fused citizen aspirations for the long-term goal of society with legitimacy and technology policy, thereby enabling it to harness post-Fukishima opportunities. Britain on the other hand has focussed on short-term economic, technology options that are beneficial to incumbent companies, with minimal consideration of societal or consumer concerns for either the short or long term. This means it neither has the imagination nor the ability to be opportunistic for the benefit of Britain. Back to Japan and its crossroads. Its response to the 1970s oil shock was both technology-led and centralised through a world-leading programme of industrial energy efficiency and solar panel development, and the development of a huge nuclear sector. Today&apos;s energy crisis offers new challenges and new solutions. On the one hand technology must play a fundamental role and once again Japan can be on the forefront of research, development and deployment. However, the new energy future will also require much greater societal support and involvement \u2013 which is what Japan now has as a result of Fukushima. Working with this, rather than against it, could well be the opportunity needed to deliver a secure energy future. \u2022 Catherine Mitchell is professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter.

Related: Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes    \u201cYou\u2019ve lifted the country,\u201d said Ann Packer via a BBC One feed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have asked more of yourself physically and tactically \u2013 we\u2019re all very proud of you.\u201d By edging past the reigning champion, Maria Mutola, to take gold following an epic duel between the pair over the last 80m of the final, Holmes had become the first British woman to win the 800m Olympic title since Packer did the same exactly four decades earlier. Indeed, up to that point, only seven women from these shores had claimed a gold medal in track and field events of any kind, with Christine Ohuruogu becoming the eighth when she won the 400m final in Beijing four years later. It is an exclusive club and, with Packer\u2019s message, Holmes had just been anointed by one of the founding mothers. But Packer\u2019s place in the annals of British sporting triumph is not based purely on her being a trendsetter (she was, in fact, the second British female athlete to win gold in an Olympic track and field event following Mary Rand\u2019s success in the 1964 long-jump final). Her story goes beyond that, reaching a level of startling achievement that marks her out as one of this country\u2019s standout post-war performers. Packer won gold in Tokyo having never previously run an international 800m race, and with the final itself only her eighth ever two-lap run. Her real focus was the 400m, with Packer arriving in Japan as the favourite to win the event having run the fastest time in the world that year. As it was, she took silver, finishing behind Australia\u2019s Betty Cuthbert in a European record time of 52.20sec. Going one better in the 800m never even registered with the 22-year-old PE teacher from Reading, who had only begun running the longer distance shortly before the Olympics as a way of improving her stamina, and took the third spot in Great Britain\u2019s team at the last minute after less than impressive displays in the buildup. Packer clocked 2:11.1 in her debut race in the May before running three even slower times. A finishing time of 2:05.3 at London\u2019s White City Stadium in her final race before boarding the plane for Tokyo marked an improvement but still gave no indication of the blistering run that was to come. For Packer not only won gold, she did so in a world record time of 2:01.1, leaving France\u2019s Maryvonne Dupureur, who had run faster than her in the heats and semi-final, in second place and looking on in a state of utter bafflement. \u201cMiddle-distance running for women was still in its infancy and the 800m had only been run in Rome four years earlier for the first time,\u201d Packer said, reflecting on her victory. \u201cI knew nothing about the event but being so naive was probably to my advantage; it meant I did not have any limitations in my head regarding what I should or could do. Ignorance proved to be bliss.\u201d Ann Elizabeth Packer was born in Moulsford, Oxfordshire, on 2 March 1942. Something of a natural athlete, she showed signs of becoming a top-class high jumper in her teens before moving on to the track in 1959, when she won the English Schools 100m title before coming second in the 200m final the following year. That same year, Packer won the WAAA long-jump title and in 1962 competed at her first major tournaments \u2013 the European Championships, in Belgrade, and the British Empire and Commonwealth Games, in Perth, ending the year with a bronze medal in the 4x100m at the first event and a silver in the 4x110m in the second. This success came as Packer carried out her day-job duties as a PE teacher. In recent years she has admitted that combining working at a school while also trying to develop her talents as a top-level athlete was \u201cpretty difficult.\u201d She persevered, however, and in 1963, having decided to focus her attention on the 400m, she ran a world-class time of 53.3. The following year, she won the WAAA title in the same event and headed to Tokyo with an Olympic gold medal firmly in her sights. Losing out to Cuthbert hit Packer hard and, in the aftermath, she gave serious though to not even bothering with the 800m. Seeing her friend and Olympic village room-mate Rand win gold proved an inspiration, however, and she decided to give the 800m a shot, one final chance of landing the ultimate prize at her debut Games. Before entering the heats, Packer took in the advice of her coach Dennis Watts and her fiance Robbie Brightwell, the men\u2019s team captain who himself had missed out on a medal in the 400m prior to taking silver in the 4x400m relay. It was agreed Packer had slipped up in the 400m due to tiredness having gone full pelt in the semi-final and so she should conserve as much energy as possible in the buildup races to come. In her heat, Packer came fifth in a time of 2:12.6, almost eight seconds slower than Dupureur, while in her semi-final she ran 2:06.0, two seconds slower than her French rival. Few, then, gave the Brit a chance of triumphing in the final. Indeed, Packer began the race as the slowest of the eight contestants and as the pack passed the bell in 59.1, she was lying in sixth position, exactly two strides behind Dupureur, who had passed the half-way distance in 58.6. The leader began to pull away at the 600m mark, but inside the National Stadium spectators could see a lean figure with short, dark hair and dressed in an all-white kit that had a giant \u201c55\u201d stretched across the chest making strides on the outside. Packer had moved to third position and come the crown of the final bend, she was up yet another place. A gold still seemed out of reach, however, with Dupureur out in front by almost five metres. Packer would need to do something extraordinary to catch her and that is exactly what she did; switching styles and using the sprinting speed which five years earlier had seen her win the English Schools 100m title to make a late burst for the line. The gap with Dupureur closed in a blink of an eye and before the pre-race favourite could react she had been passed into second place in 2:01.09, with New Zealand\u2019s Marise Chamberlain finishing third in 2:02.8. \u201cWhen we were 100m from home I felt pretty good,\u201d said Packer. \u201cThe other girls seemed to be coming back to me and I realised then that they did not have the kick.\u201d   Related: Great Britain to send \u2018best-prepared athletics team\u2019 to Rio Olympics    The 22-year-old dedicated her gold to Brightwell \u2013 \u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous because I was thinking about him during the race, not myself\u201d \u2013 and the pair married soon after the Games, which were to be Packer\u2019s first and last. She decided to retire while on top and concentrate on family life, eventually giving birth to three sons. Gary Brightwell, who was born in October 1965, followed in his mother\u2019s footsteps by also becoming a 400m runner, while Ian, born in April 1968, and David, born in January 1971, both went on to play for Manchester City. All three enjoyed varying levels of success but nothing that came close to matching their mother\u2019s achievement. For Packer, who was awarded an MBE in 1965 and currently lives in Congleton, Cheshire, the gold medal she won in Tokyo 48 years ago was not only a personal triumph but one that should act as a source of inspiration for anyone and everyone. \u201cWe are as a human race limited by our expectations and by other people\u2019s expectations of what we may or may not do,\u201d the 70-year-old said recently. \u201cBut anyone who has got a talent, in whatever sphere, should set their sights on where they want to go and really go for it. Trust me, the rewards are fantastic.\u201d What the Guardian said John Rodda, 21 October 1964  Stunned disbelief wrapped every British spectator in the National Stadium here this afternoon as the slim form of Miss AE Packer took the sweet strides to an Olympic gold medal in the 800metres and the world record of 2min 1.1sec as well. It is the most startling result of these Games and one would have to search very hard through Olympic history to find one more surprising in any other Games. If Miss Packer found fairies at the bottom of her garden she could have looked no more startled than when she pressed the medal to her cheek after winning a race that she did not want to take part in at one time. The coaching that DCV Watts has planned for her during the past two years had been devised to win the gold medal in the 400m. Racing over two laps was an afterthought, a part of that training programme. By Monday morning she wanted to shut athletics out of her life and had decided to scratch from the final. A shopping expedition rather than another race was to be her afternoon\u2019s outing. \u201cBut at five past three after Rob [her fiance] had failed to win the 400 I decided I had to run,\u201d she told me.Miss Szabo, of Hungary, high stepping, led the field at a speed designed to scatter the weak. A gasp went up when the 400m time was announced, 58.6sec. Miss Packer was in the middle of the field, and Miss Smith, whose moment this ought to have been, already was beginning to tail off. Into the back straight the pace eased, the bodies closed up, and most eyes were on the easy flowing movement of Miss Dupureur and a tall girl in black \u2013 Miss Chamberlain of New Zealand. But at the crown of the bend the pattern of the strides was broken; Miss Packer had suddenly dislodged herself from the inside position and was moving faster than everyone else; Miss Chamberlain was passed, Miss Gletchfield, Miss Szabo. Still she was moving faster than the rest and with half the straight left she glided past the French girl. Every stride she moved away, every stride looked so much easier than the one before. \u201cOh you beaut,\u201d screamed a journalist behind me as she reached the tape. The world of athletics will dissect this performance for many years and the two theories that will be propounded are that of all the competitors Miss Packer was the most relaxed and that many athletes, particularly some in Britain, are not in their proper event. Few get Miss Packer\u2019s chance to experiment. Miss Packer began running over 200m, but was not fast enough, and so she moved up to 400m. Today she displayed both stamina and sprinting power to which the rest had to bow. It will remain a point of conjecture, but even Miss Sin Kim Dan, of North Korea, would have had her hands full coping with the finishing power that the British girl revealed. Miss Packer handled the world\u2019s press afterwards with a delightful humour in spite of her dazed feeling. \u201cGoing down the back straight a second time I looked up and there was the lap time, 58.6sec on the board and I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem that fast. In my heats I felt I was running too far back so I kept about the middle watching Marise [Miss Chamberlain] but when she didn\u2019t move after we reached the bend I stepped out and went off. No, it didn\u2019t hurt at any point. Of course Robbie losing made the difference. I knew I had to run then \u2013 I wasn\u2019t actually angry after his defeat and I still didn\u2019t believe I had the chance to win a medal.\u201d "}, {"sentences": ["Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo waving banners to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan.", "Until last year&apos;s earthquake and tsunami triggered radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power&apos;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Japan was the world&apos;s third-biggest user of atomic energy."], "tags": ["Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Energy", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-05T11:35:36Z", "title": "Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/05/japan-shuts-down-last-nuclear-reactor", "article": "Japan is shutting down its last working nuclear reactor as part of the safety drive imposed after the March 2011 tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.

St Nicholas Abbey won last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Turf and was arguably slumming it in the Group Three Mooresbridge Stakes but, despite making rapid late gains, was unable to reach the winner. Seemingly as planned, Windsor Palace took up the running from his stablemate Robin Hood with just under two furlongs left to run but, evidently not as planned, remained there to the line. This was a first victory since 2007 for Windsor Palace, deployed as a pacemaker for the likes of So You Think, Yeats and Henrythenavigator ever since it became apparent that he was not one of Ballydoyle&apos;s brightest stars. Camelot&apos;s victory in the 2,000 Guineas must have seemed like a distant memory for Joseph O&apos;Brien, the rider of the beaten favourite, although Johnny Murtagh hardly covered himself in glory aboard the third-placed Sharestan, both seeming to leave their challenges until too late. Comparisons between this freak outcome and Homecoming Queen&apos;s nine-length success are hardly fair, although both left O&apos;Brien Sr attempting to hide his disappointment. He said he was &quot;delighted&quot; with the horse&apos;s performance on Monday. &quot;We knew St Nicholas Abbey wasn&apos;t a heavy ground horse. Everyone knows that. Joseph just let him find himself there and it was his first run back after Dubai. He ran a lovely race.&quot; The stewards held an inquiry and noted connections&apos; explanation that St Nicholas Abbey was unsuited by the going. Fascinatingly, when interviewed on At The Races and asked how his Guineas winners had come out of their races, O&apos;Brien immediately confirmed the wellbeing of Camelot and Maybe, well-fancied but only third in the 1,000, and failed to mention Homecoming Queen at all. One theory to have emerged regarding the 1,000 Guineas is that Homecoming Queen and Starscope, first and second, were the only two fillies not to have entered the stalls first time around before the collapse in the stalls of Gray Pearl, which led to the other runners being taken out and the race delayed by half an hour. Interviewed during that delay, O&apos;Brien expressed concerns to Channel 4 viewers about whether the favourite Maybe would be at a disadvantage, saying that when horses entered the stalls they experienced an increase in adrenaline and performance that could not be repeated if taken out and re-inserted. But that hypothesis was questioned by the expert &apos;horse whisperer&apos; Gary Witheford, who had been at the start with Starscope. &quot;I can see why people are thinking there might be something to it, as they were the two not to go in the first time, but personally I think it&apos;s more likely that they were just the two that handled the ground best and were the most ready on the day. They were drawn together, too,&quot; he said. &quot;I was just putting Starscope in when Gray Pearl went down and she behaved identically when I led her in again half an hour later. But most horses are so used to going in and out of the stalls that they would do it without thinking about it.&quot; Ger Lyons, whose Lightening Pearl finished well down the field, was ready to draw a line through the contest. &quot;We had to stand behind the stalls for 25 minutes and it was just one of those races you have to put behind you and move on,&quot; he said. But Homecoming Queen found a supporter in Richard Hills, who said: &quot;Whatever you say about the race, she won the Guineas by nine lengths and will always have done so. She did some impressive fractions and she&apos;s very, very good.&quot; Hills, so many times successful in the colours of his longstanding patron Sheikh Hamdan, was at Kempton to welcome home the Sheikh&apos;s three winners, all partnered by the new stable jockey, Paul Hanagan. &quot;I like to do my bit for the firm,&quot; Hills said. Hanagan&apos;s final two victories were for the trainer William Haggas, whose stable strength will be buoyed from Tuesday by the return of last year&apos;s Oaks winner, Dancing Rain. She has undergone operations to remove bone chips from her legs since finishing well beaten in Tokyo last November. &quot;It will be good to have her back,&quot; said Haggas&apos; wife and assistant, Maureen. &quot;I don&apos;t know where we&apos;ll be looking to come back but I certainly can&apos;t see her being ready to run until the end of the summer at the earliest.&quot; Haggas added that the well-touted Diala had returned home none the worse, despite finishing well beaten in the 1,000 Guineas. &quot;Once it became obvious that she wasn&apos;t going to get involved, Eddie [Ahern] wasn&apos;t hard on her at all and it just wasn&apos;t her day,&quot; she said. &quot;At least we can now go down a few grades and start again with her because she didn&apos;t have a hard time. &quot;It was the first time she&apos;d had horses all around her and I think she will have learned a lot from the experience, even if it wasn&apos;t the result we wanted.&quot; Meanwhile, Richard Hannon Jr said that the Irish and French 2,000 Guineas were under consideration for Trumpet Major and Coupe De Ville, respectively fourth and fifth behind Camelot at Newmarket on Saturday. &quot;They&apos;ve come out of the race fine, but we&apos;ll see what the lie of the land is,&quot; he said. &quot;We might wait for Royal Ascot and the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes with Trumpet Major but there&apos;s no decision yet.&quot; The Hannon team endured a disappointing weekend, with Royal Ascot hopeful Tassel finishing lame at odds-on at Salisbury on Sunday.

Nuclear engineer and former power company executive Arnie Gunderson compared the prime minister&apos;s statement to President George Bush declaring &quot;mission accomplished&quot; on the deck of the USS Lincoln in 2003. Gunderson calls the situation at Fukushima &quot;a long battle, far from over.&quot;\u00a0 Even Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which owns the Fukushima facility, says that it will take another 40 years to fully decommission the reactors there, a project which poses unprecedented engineering challenges. But the company&apos;s own tests disclose a more immediate danger. Rising radiation levels within one of the reactors, the highest recorded so far, and evidence of a leak in the critical cooling system demonstrate that the situation is still far from stable. Tepco revealed at the end of March that protective water levels in the containment vessel of Reactor No 2, were far shallower than they had expected, which might mean that the uranium fuel rods there are no longer completely submerged, and are heating up. The Japan Times reported on 29 March that radiation inside the vessel has reached 73 sieverts per hour \u2013 high enough to administer a lethal dose to a human in a matter of minutes, even to disable the robotic devices which are sent regularly into the reactor to monitor what is happening there. Conditions elsewhere in the plant are more difficult to assess. Reactors 1 and 3, both of which melted down after the earthquake and tsunami last year, are currently sealed and impossible to enter, even by robots. So we don&apos;t know what is going on inside those crippled structures. But nuclear experts say that their biggest concern involves Reactor 4, which sustained severe structural damage during the earthquake and subsequent hydrogen explosions which collapsed its roof. This is where hundreds of tons of spent fuel\u00a0sits perched 100 feet above the ground in a cooling pool exposed to the open sky. A report released in February by the Independent Investigation Commission on the nuclear accident called this pool &quot;the weakest link&quot; at Fukushima. Robert Alvarez, former senior policy adviser at the US department of energy said: &quot;If an earthquake or other event were to cause this pool to drain it could result in a catastrophic radiological fire involving nearly 10 times the amount of Cs-137 released by the Chernobyl accident.&quot; How likely is this? While the structure of Reactor 4 is stable for the moment, the Dai-ichi plant lies miles from a big earthquake fault \u2013 as large as the one that caused last year&apos;s quake, but much closer to Fukushima. According to a study published in February (pdf) in the European Geosciences Union&apos;s journal Solid Earth, that fault is now overdue for a quake.\u00a0 Whether or not the critical pool at Reactor 4 would survive another major quake intact, Edwin Lyman, a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me in a phone interview that a failure of the jury-rigged inadequate piping installed after the disaster could knock the cooling system out of commission. After visiting Fukushima on a fact finding mission recently, Senator Ron Wyden wrote to Japan&apos;s ambassador to the US warning that, &quot;loss of containment in any of these pools could result in an even greater release than the initial accident. &quot;Wyden urged Japanese authorities to remove the spent fuel rods from the vulnerable pools to far safer &quot;dry cask storage&quot;, which would protect them from potential earthquake release. Yet, the technological challenges of such a transfer of highly dangerous materials are formidable. These risks have led two former Japanese diplomats on a crusade to avert what they see as a disaster waiting to happen. UN veteran Akio Matsumura and former Japanese ambassador to Switzerland Mitsuhei Murata attended a conference in Seoul at the end of March &quot;to inform the participants from 54 nations of the potential global catastrophe of reactor unit 4.&quot; They called on the international community to set up an independent assessment team of structural engineers and nuclear scientists to study conditions at Reactor 4 and recommend a course of action. What lessons can the nuclear industry in the US draw from the Fukushima accident and its still unresolved aftermath? Edwin Lyman describes it as a wake-up call that we have not yet heeded. He told me in a phone interview that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has failed to fully implement the recommendations of its own post-Fukushima task force.\u00a0 Lyman says that several nuclear plants in the midwest, south and west are located near earthquake faults, including two plants in California \u2013 Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo county, and San Onofre between Los Angeles and San Diego.\u00a0 Both of the California facilities suffered what the NRC terms\u00a0 &quot;near misses&quot; within the last year. At Diablo Canyon, the plant&apos;s engineers inadvertently locked a series of emergency valves in the reactor cooling system, an error which was not noticed for 18 months and could have led to a meltdown in the case of an emergency. The problem at San Onofre involved a leak of radioactive steam from a worn generator tube in January. The plant has been shut down indefinitely and is currently undergoing extensive testing.\u00a0 While a Fukushima-type disaster could happen here in the US, Edwin Lyman insists that it doesn&apos;t need to. But he says that we have to act now to require new safeguards, demand higher performance standards and expand the roster of accidents that nuclear power plants will need to protect against. Let&apos;s hope the NRC is listening."}, {"sentences": ["The most crafted work here is Sohei Nishino&apos;s series of city dioramas \u2013 New York, Tokyo, Paris \u2013 made up of thousands of small photographs combined to create a surreal whole."], "tags": ["Saatchi gallery", "Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-09T10:45:56Z", "title": "Saatchi captures the confusion of contemporary photography", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/09/saatchi-photography-out-of-focus", "article": "I have visited Out of Focus: Photography, the Saatchi Gallery&apos;s big contemporary photography show twice now. The second time around, it seemed, if anything, even more of a messy sprawl of styles, strategies and conceptual conceits. The title, Out of Focus, may have been meant ironically, but it takes on a more pointed meaning if you approach the show as a mirror of the fractured world of contemporary practice. For me, the most coherent thing about the show is William A Ewing&apos;s catalogue essay, which begins by stating the obvious \u2013 &quot;Photography is a very strange place to be right now, either inside looking out (the producer) or outside looking in (the public)&quot; \u2013 then takes us on a humorous journey though the various continents that currently make up &quot;the entire World of Photography&quot;: Commercia, Documentaria, Amateuria, Artistica and Artcontemporanea. As Ewing rightly points out, these continents view each other across vast oceans of mutual disdain. Many commercial photographers, for instance, think documentary photographers are hopelessly old-fashioned, while the latter view the former as corporate whores in thrall to the filthy lucre of advertising. Both watch the continent of Amateuria, &quot;a continent so vast it has never been properly mapped, never mind explored&quot;, with a mixture of pity and contempt that cannot quite conceal their nervousness.     Conceptual pranksterism ... detail from Culture 3 Sheet 72 (2010) by Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin.  Photograph: Saatchi Gallery, London    Artistica too, the realm of conceptualism and fine art, is currently under threat from the Artcontemporanea arrivistes \u2013 artists who use photography having once looked down on it as an inferior form. At the Saatchi Gallery, this &quot;disunited nation&quot; jostles for space, though the majority of the world on display comes from the continents of Artistica and Contemporanea. Mikhael Subotzky is the token documentary photographer, for instance, his large format pictures of the grim small town of Beaufort West in South Africa hanging desolately next to the conceptual pranksterism of Broomberg and Chanarin. This is as political it gets on planet Saatchi, a rarified place where the main thrust is towards the conceptual. There is a lot of photography about photography: Jennifer West&apos;s enlarged strips of film of surfers, all gaudy pinks and blues, point towards both psychedelia and Eadweard Muybridge&apos;s photographs of movement. Mat Collishaw&apos;s big mosaics, made of ceramic, cement, wood and paint, suggest pixellated computer images. John Stezaker&apos;s photographic collages bring new life to old photographs found in film and theatre archives, postcards and catalogues.     Hard painterly studies ... detail from Anonymous, San Francisco, Boulevard 15 (2010) by Katy Grannan.  Photograph: Saatchi Gallery, London    There is contemporary portraiture and landscape aplenty, too. In the first big room, there are perhaps too many of Katy Grannan&apos;s hard painterly studies of old people caught in unforgiving sunlight on the sidewalks of Los Angeles and San Francisco, just as, upstairs, there are too few \u2013 just one, in fact \u2013 of Elina Brotherus&apos;s stark studies of human alienation. In both instances, the power of the work is undercut. It was good to see Hannah Starkey&apos;s mixture of street photography and participatory portraiture again, which seemed quite humble in intent (she finds an intriguing spot then asks passers-by to become part of the picture) in comparison to the work around it. The most crafted work here is Sohei Nishino&apos;s series of city dioramas \u2013 New York, Tokyo, Paris \u2013 made up of thousands of small photographs combined to create a surreal whole. They are mind-boggling in their obsessiveness and recall those wonderful wrong medieval maps of unexplored territories. Too much of the work on display is too self-consciously arty or referential, and seems already peculiarly dated. More problematic still, there is simply too much on show to make the whole seem in any way formally unified. This is Saatchiland, though, so that was probably never the point.     Self-consciously arty ... detail from Octopus Portrait (2009) by Yumiko Utsu. Photograph: Saatchi Gallery, London    What we are looking at is a collection parading as an exhibition. It shouts and screams and sometimes whispers for your attention, but you may, like me, find your mind constantly wandering \u2013 and wondering at the sheer size and range of it all. It is a glimpse at some of the continents that make up the world of contemporary photography, but the choices often seem random and the staging haphazard. A big mess of a show, then, but one worth seeing \u2013 if only to have your confusion about the current state of photography confirmed. Now see this At Gallery One and a Half, Laura Pannack is showing her \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 revealing photographs of Young British Naturists. As always, it is the casual, everyday nature of the nudity that is most surreal.

But in the town made infamous for its annual slaughter of hundreds of dolphins, tourists will now be able to swim and play with the mammals in a zoo near where the cull takes place. Taiji, featured in the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove, is to build a whale zoo. Yet despite the move, officials say the cull will continue. Local media reports say the picturesque town on Japan&apos;s Pacific coast plans to populate the proposed 69-acre marine mammal park with bottlenose dolphins and pilot and other small whales caught nearby. The town, in the Higashimuro district of Wakayama, has been the target of international criticism for almost a decade over the hunt, in which up to 2,000 animals are killed for their meat or sold to aquariums and marine parks. The meat from a single animal can fetch up to 50,000 yen (\u00a3390), but aquariums have paid more than 10m yen for certain types. Pressure to end the cull intensified after the 2009 release of The Cove. In order to make the film, directed by Louie Psihoyos, the crew broke into the fenced-off bay and installed hidden cameras to capture footage of the hunt. Taiji is one of four Japanese towns that hunts small cetaceans in coastal waters, but has been the focus of criticism because of the way fishermen capture and kill their prey. Hunters confuse the animals by banging metal poles on the side of their boats and then herd them into a cove before attacking them with spears and knives. Many of the residents who proposed the whale park realise the mammals are more valuable to the town&apos;s economy alive than dead, and only a handful of fishermen in Taiji, a town of 3,500, are involved in the slaughter. During the most recent cull season, which ran from September to March, 928 dolphins were caught, according to the local fisheries authorities. Outside a small number of coastal communities, few Japanese people eat dolphin meat, which tests have shown contains high levels of mercury.The government, which allows about 20,000 dolphins to be killed each year, acknowledges that the meat is contaminated but says it is not dangerous unless consumed in large quantities. Construction of the zoo is not expected to begin for three to five years while authorities try to secure funding and settle rights issues with fishermen who cultivate pearls and other marine products in the area. The zoo will feature beaches and mudflats, with its oceanside entrance in Moriura Bay closed off by a 430-metre net. &quot;We want to send out the message that the town is living together with whales,&quot; Jiji Press quoted Taiji&apos;s mayor, Kazutaka Sangen, as saying. He said the construction of the zoo would not coincide with an end to the dolphin hunt. &quot;We will continue hunting dolphins and establish Taiji as a town of whales, however much criticism we get from abroad,&quot; he told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. While The Cove drew international praise for its daring attempt to expose the bloody reality of Taiji&apos;s dolphin hunt, fishermen and officials said the film was deliberately misleading and ignored the town&apos;s historical and cultural attachment to whaling. The movie made its Japanese debut at the 2011 Tokyo international film festival before going on general release. Several cinemas in Japan decided not to show it, however, after ultra-nationalists threatened to disrupt screenings. Psihoyos later sent Japanese-language copies of the movie to every household in Taiji with the help of a local ocean conservation group. The American director said the film was intended as a &quot;love letter to the people of Taiji&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["That was not the case for the Greek gymnastics team, stopped from travelling to Tokyo for the Olympic qualifiers because of money problems."], "tags": ["Greece", "Olympic Games 2012", "Europe", "World news", "London", "UK news", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-09T13:25:00Z", "title": "London 2012: Olympic pole vaulter battles Greek financial crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/09/greek-pole-vaulter-kyriakopoulou-olympics", "article": "Nicole Kyriakopoulou, Greece&apos;s record-breaking pole vaulter, is counting the days to the London Olympics. Pride is what Greeks are good at, and the athlete is determined to give the games her best. &quot;Sport has given me so many experiences, it has made me a much better person in very many ways,&quot; she says sitting cross-legged in an indoor stadium after a four-hour training session. &quot;It is a great thing to represent your country at an event like the Olympics.&quot; Besides, she loves England. It was there that she scored her best performance, clearing 4.71 metres at the London Diamond Link in August. But since then Kyriakopoulou has had to clear other hurdles \u2013 and in ways she might not have imagined. The economic crisis engulfing Greece has had a disastrous effect on the debt-choked country&apos;s Olympic preparations, with Kyriakopoulou among many world-class athletes hit by unprecedented cutbacks. Several coaches and suppliers have not been paid in months. &quot;Expenses barely cover vitamins and food,&quot; the 26-year-old lamented. &quot;Athletes have dietary needs. They can&apos;t eat fast food, but over the past two years all the allowances and incentives the state gave us have just disappeared.&quot; Massive budget cuts recently led to the national athletics federation, Segas, suspend all track and field competitions in the country. Kyriakopoulou, who is trying to get major sports outfitters to sponsor her, missed three major international competitions last year. &quot;At least they weren&apos;t qualifiers,&quot; she says. That was not the case for the Greek gymnastics team, stopped from travelling to Tokyo for the Olympic qualifiers because of money problems. The International Olympic Committee has had to step in with emergency funding to help other squads, including the women&apos;s water polo team, the 2011 world champions, prepare for the Games. As a result, when the Greek delegation files into the Olympic stadium on 27 July \u2013 in honour of Greece&apos;s role in creating the Games it always leads opening and closing ceremonies \u2013 it will be noticeably smaller. Fewer than 100 Greek competitors are being sent to London, compared with the 151 dispatched to Beijing four years ago and 431 athletes who participated in the 2004 Athens games. &quot;The cuts have destroyed us,&quot; said the soft-spoken vault jumper who has been training intensively since she was 16. &quot;I&apos;m not the only one. I&apos;m actually lucky. The Hellenic Postbank began sponsoring me in December,&quot; she says, pointing to the logo on her shirt. &quot;They&apos;ve helped me buy new poles, which the [field and track] federation can&apos;t do.&quot; But Kyriakopoulou, like other top athletes, trains in facilities that, once the pride of Greece, have sunk into decay and disrepair. Olympic swimmers were forced to use unheated pools last winter; athletes training in one of the capital&apos;s indoor Olympic facilities, purpose-built for the Athens games, had to contend with a leaky roof. &quot;Because there is no money for maintenance costs, in the winter you freeze and in the summer you boil. Athletes have strained tendons as a result,&quot; she says, pointing to the broken mat in the landing area beneath the high jump she uses herself. &quot;We haven&apos;t got a water dispenser or hot water in the showers, and our housing is, well, pretty basic. There are no cleaners. We have to do that ourselves. I spent time painting mine recently.&quot; Although the stadium in which elite athletes train is supposed to be guarded, it is not. &quot;There have been times when I&apos;m training and someone just crosses the track in front of me,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve had to serve to stop bumping into them. It&apos;s terrifying. I can&apos;t afford to be injured.&quot; But that is almost secondary, she says. What really riles Kyriakopoulou, and dozens like her, is that in the financial storm that has hit Greece the government has failed to act on promises to help athletes prepare for the Games. Less than three months before the London Olympics, Kyriakopoulou is still pushing papers at the local municipality where she works as an administrator in the low-income neighbourhood of Egaleo. &quot;I shouldn&apos;t be going to work but focusing on training up to seven to eight hours a day,&quot; she says. &quot;I miss out on morning sessions because I still have to show up at the office, even though the government voted in a law back in February that said athletes preparing for the Olympics wouldn&apos;t have to work.&quot; There were, she said, about 40 top-flight athletes in her position. &quot;If we take time off it has to be unpaid leave \u2013 and none of us can afford that. Apparently it&apos;s a matter of bureaucracy, but it&apos;s shocking when you think that we&apos;re representing our country,&quot; she says. Vasilios Sevastis, a former Balkan decathlon champion who presides over Segas, says the cuts have had a terrible effect, not just on facilities but also on the mindset of athletes. &quot;Psychologically, it&apos;s been very hard on athletes. How can they prepare for the games when every day they face such problems?&quot; he asks, surrounded by portraits of Olympic champions including Spyros Louis, who won the marathon when the modern Games were reintroduced in Athens in 1896. &quot;Our budget has been slashed by 40% since 2010. This year we have \u20ac6.5m to cover operating costs and basic needs. It&apos;s absolutely catastrophic and makes no sense at all when our country&apos;s debt is hundreds of billion of euro.&quot; The London Olympics is likely to be a watershed. &quot;Nicole Kyriakopoulou should not be facing such obstacles but she is one of many,&quot; Sevastis says. &quot;They are incredible people who are doing what they do because they want to excel. &quot;I worry that the younger generation of athletes who see how they are being treated will give up when they understand that even if you are the best there are no rewards.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company at the centre of Japan&apos;s worst-ever nuclear accident, has been saved from collapse after the government in effect nationalised the firm by agreeing to inject 1 trillion yen ($12.5bn) in fresh capital.", "The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said the capital injection was needed to ensure the utility company could continue to supply electricity to 45 million people, including residents of Tokyo."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-09T14:58:26Z", "title": "Fukushima owner saved from collapse by Japanese government", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/09/fukushima-owner-saved-japanese-government", "article": "Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company at the centre of Japan&apos;s worst-ever nuclear accident, has been saved from collapse after the government in effect nationalised the firm by agreeing to inject 1 trillion yen ($12.5bn) in fresh capital.

The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said the capital injection was needed to ensure the utility company could continue to supply electricity to 45 million people, including residents of Tokyo. &quot;Without the state funds, [Tepco] cannot provide a stable supply of electricity and pay for compensation and decommissioning costs,&quot; Edano said after approving what amounts to a state takeover of the firm. The total cost of the disaster, which last weekend led to the closure of the country&apos;s last working nuclear reactor, is estimated at $100bn. Tepco faces compensation claims totalling 5tn yen from the tens of thousands of people who have been driven from their homes by radiation leaks. The task of decontaminating the area affected by radiation and decommissioning the plant is expected to take decades. Under the 10-year restructuring plan, the government will acquire more than half of Tepco&apos;s shares, with the option of increasing its stake to more than two-thirds if the company fails to reach its restructuring targets. In return for the taxpayer bailout, Tepco plans to reduce costs by 3.7tn yen over the next 10 years and cut a 10th of its workforce. It will also need government approval to increase household electricity bills and restart nuclear reactors that pass stress tests introduced in the wake of the disaster. The plan has already prompted personnel changes amid criticism of Tepco&apos;s handling of the disaster and evidence that it played down the risk posed by earthquakes and tsunamis. The current chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, will be replaced by Kazuhiko Shimokobe, a lawyer selected by the bailout fund.

Even in an age of widescreen mass-consumption, moments of sporting greatness tend to retain their distinct texture and tone, a quality of individual character that sails above the groping televisual superlatives and escapes through the cracks of the sponsorial glaze. So it is with great sprinters: experts in a discipline that is, in effect, a business of placing one foot in front of the other; that has no real balletic or responsive element and can exist only within a narrow chalk-lined tunnel; but that still appears, to the spectator, to be an expression not just of will but of pure personality.   Related: Michael Johnson: 'It's all about the execution \u2013 and I like that'    It has almost been a bit of a disappointment to discover via his appearances on the BBC discussing athletics that Michael Johnson is simply an intelligent man who likes colourful shirts and who shares the standard American gift for talking with unstoppable, albeit not necessarily enlightening, fluency in front of a TV camera. This is perhaps a little unfair, but any sense of disappointment in Johnson the talking head springs solely from the brutal, exhilarating purity of Johnson the sprinter, a man whose performances between 1994 and 1996 seemed to provide a high-water mark in shark-like athletic focus. Johnson\u2019s was a very distinct track personality. Where Carl Lewis was all about unsnagged athletic grace, victory delivered with effortless hair-gelled efficiency, and Maurice Greene seemed to express undiluted warrior spirit, Johnson was something more austere. Here was a furious sprinting roundhead, a runner who in his taciturnity, his focus, his very gait \u2013 the straight back, that censorious piston-stride \u2013 seemed to be expressing a pure, and almost puritanical will to win. Which is something Johnson did a lot of. Even beyond his defining race at the 1996 Atlanta Games, his achievements are titanic. Johnson retired in 2000 with four Olympic gold medals and eight world championship golds. He still holds world records in the 400m and 4x400m relay (Usain Bolt having taken his 200m mark 12 years after Atlanta) and a world\u2019s best in the 300m. But come what may in the record books, Johnson will forever have Georgia and those 10 days when he became the only male athlete ever to win both the 200 metres and 400 metres at the same Olympics. The 200m was the second instalment, a performance of generational greatness metered out in that unstoppable chugging stride, sui generis but still repetitively perfect right up until the moment 10 metres past the finish line when Johnson seemed almost to come out of character and erupt into a capering dance of joy at the magnitude of his own achievement. Not only had he broken his own world record time, he had broken it by more than three tenths of a second, the largest ever trimming of the 200m world record. It was a fist through the ceiling, a shifting of what had been thought possible, compared at the time to Bob Beamon\u2019s Mexico City long jump, and subsequently to the assorted stampeding impossibilities of the Bolt era. Bolt is of course the natural modern comparison: both men are in their separate ways athletes with a slightly freakish physicality. Bolt is the impossible combination: a man of his height who still has the explosive muscular power to accelerate out of a bend. Johnson was a miracle of apparent stiffness: a short, unconventionally upright runner, with a power-packed outsize backside, a long torso and short, low-slung steps that defied received wisdom on achieving maximum speed. As one commentator at Atlanta 96 put it, watching Johnson\u2019s feet batter the track was like seeing \u201ca boxer working the speed bag\u201d. Unlike Bolt, who was sprinting\u2019s worst kept secret aged 16, Johnson was not a prodigy. Born and raised in Dallas, he had a successful rather than stratospheric college athletics career, winning several indoor and outdoor NCAA titles, without ever quite suggesting the outright historical ascendancy to come. A stress fracture of the left leg meant he missed the chance to quality for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and it wasn\u2019t until 1990 and graduation from Baylor University that Johnson began to emerge as a phenomenon. The following year he won the world 200m title in Tokyo by an absolute mile from Frankie Fredericks (whom he would also lead home in his greatest moment in Atlanta five years later). The 1992 Olympics were another letdown, though, as food poisoning contracted at a local restaurant destroyed Johnson\u2019s chances: the favourite for the 200m before the Games, he could finish only sixth in his semi-final. It is often overlooked in retrospect, but five years after his major championship debut, and without an individual medal at Olympic level, there was pressure on Johnson in Atlanta to justify the suggestions of hall-of-famer greatness that were confirmed by his breaking Pietro Mennea\u2019s 17-year-old world 200m record at the US Olympic trials. This was dissipated in grand style in the first week of the games as Johnson romped home in the 400m final a second ahead of second-placed Roger Black, leaving him free to concentrate his energies on peak-devastation in the 200m. Victory was by no means a shoo-in. Johnson had lost to Fredericks in Oslo before the Games. But this was Atlanta: not just a lightning fast surface, but a de facto home track. Trackside before the race Johnson looked a little strained, albeit still glistening with quietly concentrated power, from the custom-made gold Nike running shoes \u2013 different sizes to accommodate his shorter left foot, and between them weighing little more than sheet of gold wrapping paper \u2013 to the regal gold chain around his neck. From the gun, though, it is pure unstoppable motion. Watched again from the track-level camera, Johnson\u2019s stride seems effortless as he straightens up and almost immediately munches up the distance between himself and the outside lanes. Fredericks starts quickly too, but from about a third of the way into the race it is already clear who\u2019s going to win. Johnson comes out of the curve like a slingshot and is simply unrelenting down the straight. It has become commonplace to say he took care of winning the race in the first 100m, and then attended to the world record in the second, but his split times bear repeating: in the second half of the race Johnson ran 100m in 9.2 seconds. He went from 50m to 150m in 8.76 seconds. Pre-Bolt, it seems pretty much a certainty that no human being had ever clocked a faster running speed. Plus, this isn\u2019t the 100m, which is effectively a blurt of technical mastery, the search for 30 perfect strides. There are other variables in the 200m: a bend in the track, a sense of race-management and also physical pain. Johnson called the 200 metres \u201cthe danger zone\u201d, a race where, like the hundred, one mistake can be decisive; but where there is a significantly broader scope for mistakes to be made. In Atlanta, Johnson almost \u2013 but perhaps not quite \u2013 seemed to be easing up as he crossed the line, even as David Coleman on the British commentary blurted out \u201che\u2019s going to win by miiiles\u201d. And then he was off, bouncing, pointing, capering from side to side, holding a flag, as the stadium remained in uproar for minutes afterwards, stunned by what seemed at the time, and for years afterwards, a statement of sprinting ultimacy. Of course, that time has since been bettered: just five years after Johnson\u2019s run was voted greatest track and field moment of the previous 25 years, Usain Bolt bettered it, running 19.19 in Berlin. Is it necessary to choose between the two men as Greatest of All Time contenders? Bolt is a genuinely charismatic athlete, able to clown on the start line and still emerge with absolute precision at the gun. In some ways his talent is easily understood: he is taller, faster, looser, a more advanced human specimen than those around him. Huge amounts of hard work have gone into his preparation, but the raw materials of those great bounding tendons are simply waiting to be utilised. Johnson, on the other hand, was an unlikely champion, a mouse that roared: power-packed and physically prodigious in his foot and leg speed, but also nerdishly dedicated, a triumph in part of highly effective personal mechanics and technical streamlining. There are two extremes of exceptionalism here, and two contrasting characters to boot. As such, Johnson\u2019s 200m stands alone as a uniquely flavoured feat; even, perhaps, one that a normal-spec, averagely engineered human might be wowed by a little more, or at least in ways that are more recognisable. Johnson competed at one more Olympic games, winning the 400m gold medal in 2000 after injuring himself before the 200m trials final and missing out on the chance to defend his title against the ascendant Greene. Atlanta would remain his only Olympic final at that distance over a nine-year elite career. It produced an unforgettable 20-second high: a perfect storm of talent, conditions and the peak-career pomp of a true athletic great. What the Guardian saidSaturday 3 August 1996Frank Keating A year before I was born there was Jesse-Owens-at-Berlin. For obvious and retold reasons that hyphenated resonance of man and place will be twined and twinned in the log for ever. In my lifetime, Blankers-Koen and London go together, and so do Zatopek and Helsinki in 1952. Spitz equals Munich, and Daley-Coe-Ovett certainly go with Moscow like a horse and carriage. There was LA and Carl Lewis, and Ben Johnson, notoriously, at Seoul. Another Johnson is garlanded with sport\u2019s laurel wreath in 1996. Ever remembered. The upright, sobersided Texan has taken Georgia by storm. Victor ludorum, and a phenomenal one at that. A man\u2019s gotta do \u2026 and he did just that. And that is the word. It is not the over-used one, \u201cgreat\u201d, the word is \u201cphenomenal\u201d. In italics, and underlined to boot. Consider first that Johnson laid to waste in his laid-back manner in this 200 metres such fancied dandies as Frankie Fredericks and Ato Boldon in shattering his own world record with an astounding 19.32sec. And that, had Johnson entered the 100m, he would more than likely on Saturday have slapped the world-record winner Donovan Bailey into second place. The first man to win gold medals in both 200m and 400m at the same Games was to attempt to add another in the 4x400m relay but yesterday withdrew with a hamstring injury. He had won 54 races on the trot in the 400m and had never lost an outdoor final at that distance. Before a minor glitch last month he had reeled off 21 consecutive victories in the 200m and has been ranked No1 in the world at both events for four years, unprecedented. He was world champion in each event singly \u2013 the 200m at Tokyo five years ago and the 400m at Stuttgart in 1993 \u2013 and won them both in Sweden last year. There was a nice tribute from Derek Mills, the world\u2019s third-ranked 400m runner: \u201cI keep trying to remember that Michael is just a man.\u201d A friend, arriving back from the stadium on Thursday, genuinely elated, said much the same. \u201cI\u2019m going to frame that night and that performance. I\u2019m going to hang it on a wall at home, or better still try and sell it to an art gallery or museum.\u201d Johnson afterwards actually bothered to smile. \u201cThe world record is a bonus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important thing to me was making history. A lot of people hold a world record, and I did too before I arrived here. But nobody else can say they made history, the first man to win the 200 and 400. I told myself before I got in the blocks that this was the one I wanted. I didn\u2019t make it in Barcelona because of food poisoning and I have been four years since just looking for this one.   Related: Why US women are likely to outperform the men again at the Olympics    \u201cI stumbled \u2013 did you notice? Around my fourth step from the blocks, but then I got into gear pretty fast. By a dozen strides or so I was just relaxed. I sat back in the armchair. I was feeling good and honestly felt I couldn\u2019t go any faster than I was already going. After about 80-90 metres, I felt totally in control and at that point I just went to my endurance and gave it all I had. I knew the time was faster than 19.66 but I didn\u2019t know how fast. To run 19.32 is unbelievable. \u201cIf you want an analogy of the incredible thrill I felt, well, go out and get a go-kart, find a hill, a very steep one, and let it go, and you\u2019ll know how it feels. Pretty good, eh? \u201cAfter winning the 400 I was under a lot of pressure to do the double but this is how I perform when I am under that kind of pressure.\u201d Boldon won his second bronze medal of the Games. He shook his head in genuine awe. \u201cI had always thought the man who wins the hundred is the fastest man alive. Not any more. Michael is the fastest human now with all respect to my friend Bailey. Phenomenon is the only word for it.\u201d Quite so. Before the race Jesse Owens\u2019s wife Ruth sent a fax to Johnson simply saying \u201cMichael \u2013 deliver\u201d. He did. With knobs on. Just like Jesse Owens had that day when Adolf Hitler petulantly walked out on him in Berlin a lifetime ago in 1936. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2012 because the original said Usain Bolt ran the 200m in 19.19 seconds in Beijing, when it was in Berlin.

In one of the least-understood global conservation crises, spawning rates for the world&apos;s three major eel populations have crashed in the last three decades by as much as 99%, raising fears they could become extinct across the far east, Europe and north America. Biologists in Japan, where eels are an iconic part of the country&apos;s cuisine and culture, are on the brink of farming eels from birth to fork on an industrial scale for the first time, potentially in the same way as salmon is farmed worldwide. That breakthrough \u2013 being sought too by scientists in Korea and the United States \u2013 could dramatically relieve pressure on wild eel populations, and greatly increase the prospects of rebuilding their stocks worldwide. Yet the goal of producing wholly captive farmed eels, using larvae produced in captivity rather than wild-caught baby eels, is being thwarted by a very significant obstacle: reproducing the larvae&apos;s unique natural diet, which is known to scientists as &quot;marine snow&quot;. That foodstuff, which is essential to an eel&apos;s growth cycle as they develop and mature from larvae to glass eels, is a mixture of marine detritus, organic waste matter suspended in diffuse clouds, which is proving extremely hard to reproduce on an industrial scale. Eels are being farmed commercially around the world but only by using baby eels trapped in the wild, adding even greater pressure to the last surviving wild populations. In the UK, young eel or elver numbers are now at 5% of their levels in the 1980s. Scientists have considered the most unlikely ingredients to help create that peculiar food, including the yolk from shark&apos;s eggs. To exacerbate the feeding problem, eels stay in a larval stage for three to four months, compared with only a few days for cod, and are extremely sensitive at that stage. Prof Katsumi Tsukamoto, a pioneer in eel conservation in the Pacific who was first discover the Pacific eels spawning grounds, told marine scientists in Edinburgh this week that this obstacle meant it cost \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3803) to produce a single captive seedling in the laboratory; their goal is to get that cost down to \u20ac1. Speaking after a keynote address to the World Fisheries Congress, Tsukamoto, from the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at Tokyo University, said the focus on devising a wholly self-sufficient domestic eel farming programme, while very expensive, was being driven by the need to preserve remaining wild eels. &quot;We&apos;re now trying to establish a special strain, completely cut off from wild stocks,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to improve the many different characteristics, for example growth rate, metamorphosis rates and disease resistance. It&apos;s a process of domestication, like sheep, pigs, cows or horses.&quot; Pressure to produce wholly captive eels is being driven by the continuing heavy demand from consumers: eels are the main ingredient in kabayaki, one of three most culturally important styles of Japanese cuisine along with sushi and tempura. David Righton, from the Cefas marine laboratory in Lowestoft, and a leading figure in the Eeliad project on saving the European eel, said the quest to find a substitute food stuff is one of the most competitive areas in eel conservation. &quot;Whoever gets there first has made a tremendous discovery; you&apos;re recovering a cultural tradition. Whoever does this is culturally important as well as becoming very rich,&quot; Righton said."}, {"sentences": ["Rotterdam-based Connecting Delta Cities (CDC), an offshoot of the C40 climate leadership group backed by a charity of former US president Bill Clinton, has been set up for cities such as London, New York and Tokyo to swap notes on water management and climate adaptation."], "tags": ["Flooding", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "Climate change", "Water", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Sea level", "Oceans", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-11T09:58:44Z", "title": "Car parks and playgrounds to help make Rotterdam 'climate proof'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/11/water-rotterdam-climate-proof", "article": "Windmills that feature in the landscapes painted by the Dutch old masters are a reminder that the low-landers of this nation are past masters at keeping the tide at bay. Along with dykes, the first of which were built about 1,000 years ago, drainage mills have been effective at keeping water out of a land where 60% of its inhabitants live below sea level. But new ways of dealing with water need to be found as climate change brings with it heavier rains and rising tides, said Arnoud Molenaar, manager of the Rotterdam climate-proof programme. Rotterdam is the Netherlands&apos; second-biggest city, located in a delta of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Around 90% of it is below sea level, making it particularly vulnerable. &quot;We&apos;ve always invested in prevention, wanting to keep the water out, but now we are trying to find solutions to live with the water. Keeping on with traditional techniques like raising the dykes is coming to an end because it&apos;s not possible to raise them higher and higher,&quot; said Molenaar, an adviser to mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb. Although rightwing Dutch politicians question the reality of climate change, Rotterdam is facing increasingly frequent small-scale flooding. The key to coming up with politically palatable solutions, said Molenaar, is to present them as &quot;opportunities&quot;. That means devising double-purpose measures, including: \u2022 A parking garage built last year that incorporates a 10,000 cubic metre underground rainwater store. Expensive underground structures aren&apos;t generally favoured in the flood-prone city but several million euros were saved by combining the car park and water store; \u2022 &quot;Water plazas&quot; that under normal conditions are playgrounds but that temporarily hold water during heavy rain, then slowly release it to the drainage system; \u2022 An Olympic rowing course that doubles as a water store; \u2022 Rooftop gardens that absorb rain and CO2 and reduce the urban island temperature effect, being built at a rate of 40,000 square metres a year with a 50% subsidy; \u2022 Premium-priced floating communities on waterside sites vacated as facilities of Europe&apos;s biggest port are moved nearer the coast. The climate-proofing effort, that is costing about \u20ac100m, is mapped out in a long-term plan called Rotterdam Water City 2035, sometimes referred to as the city&apos;s &quot;wet dream&quot;, said Molenaar. It&apos;s a dream that other river cities are able to share. Rotterdam-based Connecting Delta Cities (CDC), an offshoot of the C40 climate leadership group backed by a charity of former US president Bill Clinton, has been set up for cities such as London, New York and Tokyo to swap notes on water management and climate adaptation. Molenaar said they were also mindful of the economic spin-offs as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank begin to pour &quot;billions of euros&quot; into making vulnerable low-lying delta cities climate-proof. &quot;Who is going to do this? The Dutch want to be involved.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["In action: a goshawk catches a pigeon in far-away Tokyo, where the birds' appeal is just as strong    John Lomas of the national park authority, who chairs the initiative, says:   I&apos;ve been advised that the police have indicated that the destruction of the nest was not due to natural causes."], "tags": ["Peak District holidays", "Birds", "Rabat", "RSPB", "Environment", "Crime", "The National Trust", "Police"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-11T10:02:20Z", "title": "Goshawk's nest destroyed in Peak District grouse-shooting area", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/may/11/goshawk-nest-peake-district-derwent-valley-crime-rspb", "article": "The long and largely successful battle to persuade shooting interests and landlords to tolerate raptors in the Peak District has suffered a cruel setback. A goshawks&apos; nest has been wrecked deliberately and the birds&apos; eggs smashed, an attack which leaves only one active nest of the breed in the Derwent Valley which has had a small but stable population for 30 years and last year was home to six pairs. Derbyshire police are investigating and together with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, they have a good record of monitoring suspected targeters of birds of prey. The RSPB is offering a reward of \u00a31000 for information leading to a conviction, backed by the Peak District national park authority, the oldest in the UK. The attack has also been condemned by the Moorland Association which represents grouse moor owners and has worked hard with the RSPB and national park, as well as the National Trust and Natural England, to rid the area of misleading tales about raptors&apos; effects on grouse numbers. The five organisations launched a Birds of Prey Initiative only last year, with agreed breeding targets for other previously persecuted species, including the merlin, peregrine and short-eared owl.     In action: a goshawk catches a pigeon in far-away Tokyo, where the birds' appeal is just as strong    John Lomas of the national park authority, who chairs the initiative, says:   I&apos;ve been advised that the police have indicated that the destruction of the nest was not due to natural causes. We strongly condemn any wilful destruction of nests and eggs. We have been making good progress working closely with bird groups, landowners and gamekeepers to secure the right protection for rare species, and the destruction of this nest is a setback.Nevertheless we will continue to work with all those who are co-operating with us. We should not let the bad behaviour of a few individuals stop the improving relations between the different interests.   The RSPB says:  The Peak District Nestwatch partnerships employs a variety of intelligence and surveillance techniques on vulnerable nests, and has enabled thousands of people to watch peregrines, goshawks and other upland birds in the valley, through guided walks, observation points and a CCTV nestwatch.\u00a0 Direct evidence of human interference is difficult to come by, and finding culprits even harder. But the consistent and high failure rate which led to the establishment of Nestwatch cannot be explained by natural causes.\u00a0Further, it is no coincidence that the nests which suffer from unexplained failures, mysterious disappearances, and definite persecution are all in, or adjacent to grouse-shooting areas.It is also significant that goshawks and peregrines are faring successfully in the Peak District away from grouse-shooting areas.  The group&apos;s investigations officer Mark Thomas, adds:  Once again we&apos;re faced with the destruction of birds of prey in Britain&apos;s most visited national park. The sight of goshawk eggs smashed, only days from hatching, lying on the forest floor is a heart-breaking sight and proves that this bird is being systematically wiped out in the north of the Peak District.  And Hazel Earnshaw, of Severn Trent Water which owns the moor where the nest was wrecked, is also disgusted:  We are sickened that this protected species has once again been subject to persecution, despite extensive efforts to protect it. The Goshawk should form a natural part of the ecosystem here in the Upper Derwent Valley. We are working closely with the RSPB to protect these birds and to identify the guilty parties.  Darren Belfield, a sergeant with the Derbyshire Constabulary, says:  This is a further instance of senseless destruction and persecution of a protected species. The individuals responsible show no regard for the law or for the conservation of bird of prey species within the Peak District national park.

The class in question was canceled in April and Dempsey noted the instructor responsible for the course, army lieutenant colonel Matthew A Dooley, is &quot;no longer in a teaching status&quot;. Dooley, however, is still employed at the Joint Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. Linda Sarsour, executive director at the Arab American Association of New York, said the course is merely the latest example in a proliferation of anti-Muslim teaching materials in law-enforcement agencies. &quot;It&apos;s part of a much larger problem,&quot; Sarsour said, pointing to similar controversies involving the FBI and the New York police department. On Thursday, Danger Room \u2013 a national security blog at Wired.com \u2013 published a series of documents revealing that a defense department class for US military officers urged soldiers to prepare for a &quot;total war&quot; against the world&apos;s 1.4 billion Muslims. In this battle for supremacy, Geneva Convention standards for armed conflict would be irrelevant and the historical precedents of Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be applied to civilian populations &quot;wherever necessary&quot;. Hundreds of pages of teaching material and reference documents obtained by Danger Room show the course \u2013 which was open to US military commanders, lieutenant colonels, captains and colonels \u2013 argued that the real threat to US national security stemmed not from radical militants, but from Islam itself. In a July presentation, Dooley claimed: &quot;We have now come to understand that there is no such thing as &apos;moderate Islam&apos;. It is therefore time for the United States to make our true intentions clear. This barbaric ideology will no longer be tolerated. Islam must change or we will facilitate its self-destruction.&quot; He proposed a four-stage solution that included the possibility of reducing Islam to &quot;a cult status&quot; and threatening Saudi Arabia with starvation. Dooley brought in several ideological allies to support his conclusion, including Shireen Burki, who in 2008 told future military decision makers that &quot;Obama is bin Laden&apos;s dream candidate&quot;. John Guandolo, a former FBI employee, presented students with an array of materials including a paper in which he argued: &quot;It is a permanent command in Islam for Muslims to hate and despise Jews and Christians.&quot; The course echoes a curriculum presented to FBI agents. In September, FBI whistleblowers provided Danger Room with a trove of the agency&apos;s training materials in which counter-terrorism agents were taught that &quot;main stream&quot; [sic] American Muslims are likely to be terrorist sympathizers; that the Prophet Mohammed was a &apos;cult leader&apos;; and that the Islamic practice of giving charity is no more than a &quot;funding mechanism for combat&quot;. The influence of anti-Islamic rhetoric has also found its way into municipal police departments. The New York police department has been the subject of increasing scrutiny amid a series of reports from the Associated Press revealing the existence of the department&apos;s so-called &quot;Demographics Unit&quot;, which has been used to map out ethnic communities. The unit focused on a list of 28 &quot;ancestries of interest&quot;, all of which are predominantly Muslim. In the course of over two dozen articles, the AP laid out how the NYPD \u2013 with the help of CIA advisers \u2013 infiltrated mosques, Muslim community centers and local colleges. In January the New York Times revealed the department had played the Third Jihad \u2013 a film which claims that American Muslims of all stripes are in the midst of an effort to seize control of the country \u2013 for 1,489 police officers. The NYPD initially denied that any officers had seen the film and that it was not involved in its production, but was eventually forced to admit that police commissioner Ray Kelly participated in an interview for the film. Sarsour said the latest revelations showed the problem was widespread. &quot;It&apos;s not just the department of defense. It&apos;s not just the military.

Anyone who actually manages to gain access to see Django Django can tell you what the fuss is about: their dense, reverb-laden, harmony-drenched psychedelia sounds fantastic live, and a second, marginally less oversubscribed show on Friday turns out to be one of the weekend&apos;s highlights. The shows in the daytime are less mobbed and offer up intriguing choices: on Thursday, you could find both the hazy psychedelia of Porcelain Raft and College&apos;s lush, 80s teen-movie-soundtrack electronics gamely attempting to transcend the surroundings of a pub&apos;s upstairs room in the middle of the afternoon. Meanwhile, the sense that you&apos;ve ventured appealingly off-piste is palpable when watching Tokyo&apos;s Trippple Nippples: three female vocalists in facepaint and body-stockings adorned with the kind of crudely drawn penises that usually appear on posters in the London Underground. The music is fittingly berserk, lurching from something vaguely analogous to electronic chart pop to something vaguely analogous to South Africa&apos;s shangaan electro. Considerably less eye-popping is the spectacle presented by Jam City, from the post-dubstep label Night Slugs. In the grand tradition of live dance music, it&apos;s a non-descript bloke frowning at a computer, but what&apos;s coming out of his laptop is incredible: a constantly shifting kaleidoscope of electronics, disembodied R&amp;B samples, rhythms that clatter and lurch unexpectedly. At a festival where one heavily-tipped name, Savages, turn out to sound remarkably like an 80s goth band \u2013 albeit a good 80s goth band \u2013 there&apos;s something bracing about hearing music that could only really have been made in 2012. You get the same sensation off AlunaGeorge&apos;s impressively inventive and expansive take on pop R&amp;B, with frontwoman Aluna Francis so obviously a star in waiting \u2013 and Kwes, a singer-songwriter whose music never settles. One minute his rich voice is backed by laidback electric piano flecked soul, the next by hammering, distorted beats. Elsewhere, the increasingly frantic search for a big, new guitar band throws up Palma Violets \u2013 glowering atmospherics with definite hint of Wu Lyf in the pained vocals \u2013 and California&apos;s Haim, who, live at least, sound no more like their advance billing of folk-meets-R&amp;B than they do the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass Band, but they clearly have decent songs to spare."}, {"sentences": ["Musician Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, the pioneering bass player whose grooves drove Booker T and the MGs and hits including Otis Redding&apos;s Respect has died in Tokyo, age 70.", "Dunn was in Tokyo for a series of shows.", "Miho Harasawa, a spokeswoman for Tokyo Blue Note, the last venue Dunn played, confirmed he died alone early Sunday."], "tags": ["Blues", "Music", "Soul", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-13T13:15:00Z", "title": "Legendary bass player Donald 'Duck' Dunn found dead in Tokyo at age 70", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/13/donald-duck-dunn-dead-tokyo", "article": "Musician Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, the pioneering bass player whose grooves drove Booker T and the MGs and hits including Otis Redding&apos;s Respect has died in Tokyo, age 70. Dunn was in Tokyo for a series of shows. News of his death was posted on the Facebook site of his friend and fellow musician Steve Cropper, who was on the same tour. Cropper said Dunn died in his sleep. &quot;Today I lost my best friend, the world has lost the best guy and bass player to ever live,&quot; wrote Cropper. Miho Harasawa, a spokeswoman for Tokyo Blue Note, the last venue Dunn played, confirmed he died alone early Sunday. She had no further details. Dunn, who was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1941, performed on recordings with Eric Clapton, Neil Young and many others, and specialized in blues, gospel and soul. He played himself in the 1980 hit movie &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. Dunn was given his nickname by his father as the two watched a Donald Duck cartoon on TV. &quot;It was just one of those things that stuck,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of my school friends and even a few of my teachers called me Duck.&quot; Dunn and Cropper met at high school and formed their first band, The Royal Spades. It was Cropper who gave Dunn his first big break, calling him in 1962 to join famed record label Stax&apos;s house band Booker T and the MGs. Stax had a tightly knit, racially mixed band of musicians and Dunn played with stars including Isaac Hayes and Wilson Pickett as they began to break down musical barriers to reach a wider audience. Dunn added the famous bass lines to hits including Albert King&apos;s Born Under a Bad Sign and Sam and Dave&apos;s Hold On, I&apos;m Coming. He toured the world playing with Stax&apos;s stars and was on stage with Otis Redding in 1967 at the Monterey Pop Festival, which was seen as instrumental in introducing the black star to white audiences. Despite all the hits, Dunn made relatively little money from his Stax years. &quot;I always look back and say I should have made more,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;It should have been more lucrative, but it wasn&apos;t. &quot;We were cheated a little bit. But with the music and what I learned, it doesn&apos;t matter. I have no regrets.&quot; In the 1970s Dunn became a session musician, playing for stars including Rod Stewart, Tom Petty, Robert Palmer and others. The bass player received the most publicity in his career when Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi picked him to play in The Blues Brothers. He also appeared in the sequel Blues Brother 2000. He received a lifetime achievement Grammy award in 2007 for his work with Booker T and the Mgs. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2012 because the original misspelled Steve Cropper&apos;s name as Crooper, and Dan Aykroyd&apos;s as Ackroyd.

The magisterial and hypnotic bass-guitar lines on hits by Booker T &amp; the MGs, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes and many others were created by Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, who has died aged 70. Dunn died in his sleep at a hotel in Tokyo, where he was on tour with the MGs guitarist Steve Cropper. Dunn and Cropper also immortalised the Stax sound on screen, as members of the Blues Brothers band in the 1980 hit film starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Dunn made a vital contribution to the hits Hip Hug-Her (1967), Time Is Tight and Hang &apos;Em High (both 1969) and many other recordings by Booker T &amp; the MGs, a rare example of an integrated group, made up of himself and Cropper and the African Americans Booker T Jones (on organ and piano) and Al Jackson (on drums). One of their most enduring tracks is Soul Limbo, for many years the theme of the BBC&apos;s Test cricket coverage. Cropper said of his colleague&apos;s playing that its uniqueness sprang from the fact that he was mainly self-taught, rather than learning from tutor books. Dunn also used flat wound strings that created a thudding timbre which matched Jackson&apos;s kick-drum sound. Dunn was born in Memphis, the son of a confectionery manufacturer, and gained the nickname &quot;Duck&quot; from the Disney cartoon character. Although his was not a musical family, Dunn took up the ukulele at the age of 10, soon graduating to the guitar. He grew up on the same housing precinct as Cropper, and at Messick high school the friends decided to form a band. It was then that Dunn began his lifelong relationship with the bass guitar. He said self-deprecatingly that he was unable to match Cropper&apos;s skill with the six-stringed instrument, so he settled for a four-stringed one. The high school band evolved into the Royal Spades, a group of white kids trying to emulate their rhythm &amp; blues heroes such as Ray Charles and BB King. &quot;We played for five dollars and a few beers,&quot; Dunn said later. One band member, Packy Axton, was the son and nephew of the owners of Stax Records, Estelle Axton and her brother Jim Stewart, for whom the group recorded as the Mar-Keys, scoring a big hit in 1961 with Last Night. Cropper was soon hired by Stewart as a session musician and a founder member of Booker T &amp; the MGs. After that group&apos;s first hit, Green Onions, the bass player Lewis Steinberg was replaced by Dunn, at Cropper&apos;s insistence. Between 1964 and 1969 Dunn was the first-choice bassist not only for the MGs but for most of the recordings made at the Stax studios on McLemore Avenue. Dunn can be heard on Redding&apos;s I&apos;ve Been Loving You Too Long (1965) and (Sittin&apos; on) The Dock of the Bay (1967), Eddie Floyd&apos;s Knock on Wood (1966), Albert King&apos;s Born Under a Bad Sign (1967) and In the Midnight Hour (1965) by Pickett. Booker T &amp; the MGs took part in the Stax tour of Europe in 1967, and backed Redding at the Monterey pop festival. Dunn recalled that, at Monterey, &quot;we were in our green mohair suits and everyone else in their flower power&quot; and in 1969 the group missed the chance to play at the Woodstock festival because Jackson refused to travel to the site by helicopter. While in Britain, Dunn was impressed by the fact that the police were unarmed, something that made him a fervent advocate of gun control after Jackson was shot and killed in 1975. By the early 1970s, Stax was in corporate and financial turmoil and Dunn increasingly took on freelance session work, accompanying a wide variety of singers from Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis to Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Rod Stewart. There were occasional reunions of Booker T &amp; the MGs, but his career took an unexpected turn with the global success of the Blues Brothers film. Dunn also appeared in the 1998 sequel, Blues Brothers 2000. In 2007, Dunn and the other members of Booker T &amp; the MGs were given a lifetime achievement award at the Grammys ceremony in Los Angeles. His fame as a bass player led to the creation of signature instruments by the Fender and Lakland companies. He is survived by his wife, June, a son, Jeff, and one grandson. \u2022 Donald Dunn, musician, born 24 November 1941; died 13 May 2012 "}, {"sentences": ["The end of the second world war unleashed a second wave, starting with the international military tribunal at Nuremberg and Tokyo and the creation of human rights courts in Europe and elsewhere."], "tags": ["International criminal justice", "International criminal court", "Special court for Sierra Leone", "International criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia", "European court of human rights", "Law", "Charles Taylor", "Ratko Mladic"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-16T19:25:14Z", "title": "International justice is needed \u2013 even if it takes 100 more years to perfect it | Philippe Sands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/16/international-justice-needed-expert-view", "article": "It sometimes feels like a week doesn&apos;t pass without some former head of state or other alleged outlaw on the front page as a new international trial opens. This week alone there&apos;s Charles Taylor&apos;s sentencing hearing at the special court for Sierra Leone, the opening of Ratko Mladic&apos;s trial at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and Khaled el-Masri&apos;s extraordinary rendition case at the European court of\u00a0human rights. These and other cases are the product of a century-long effort towards the creation of an international judiciary. A first wave began in the 1920s, with the creation of an international court in The Hague to hear disputes between states. Many early cases involved allegations of the mistreatment of minority groups in various parts of Europe. The end of the second world war unleashed a second wave, starting with the international military tribunal at Nuremberg and Tokyo and the creation of human rights courts in Europe and elsewhere. A third wave came in the 1990s, following atrocities in the Balkans and Rwanda, the catalyst for creating the Yugoslav and Rwanda tribunals and \u2013 after five decades of effort \u2013 the Rome statute of the international criminal court. This was also the moment for the House of Lords&apos; ruling that Augusto Pinochet was not entitled to claim immunity for international crimes alleged to have occurred while he was head of state, a reminder of the enduring and predominant role of national courts. Two developments are under way, distinct but proceeding hand in hand. The first is that the new international institutions are necessary appendages to police the global rules that most people agree are needed for the proper functioning of our embryonic international order. International courts are not limited to human rights and crime: others function in the economic sphere, to enforce free trade rules, intellectual property rights and foreign investments. Ironically, many of those who are on the front lines criticising human rights and criminal courts for excessive interference in sovereign affairs are leading defenders of international courts that protect economic rights. The second trend is the recognition of the growing place of the individual in the new order. In this way, the individual is both a holder of rights that can be enforced against the state that is said to have done wrong \u2013 the Masri case \u2013 and obligated to avoid international crimes. A century ago this was unthinkable; only in the last decade does it approach normality. As recently as the 1930s, sovereignty was seen as being nigh on absolute: sovereignty meant a state could do pretty much whatever it wanted to its own nationals, including torturing and killing them on a mass scale. The post-second world war settlement changed that: sovereignty was seen as limited, not absolute, as individuals got rights and international bodies protected those\u00a0rights. It&apos;s not quite a linear relationship, but the direction is clear. These developments are not free from criticism, one of globalisation&apos;s discontents. Sovereigntists worry about outside interference by unaccountable, unknown international judges. Internationalists worry about delay and cost. Certain international judgments are not to everyone&apos;s liking, going too far or not far enough. But there is no court in the world that is free from such critique. The more serious concern is the danger of lopsided international justice, a world of laws that are &quot;spider webs through which the big flies pass and the little ones get caught&quot;, as Balzac put it. Look on the website of the ICC and see who is in the dock. Every one of the faces and names is African. Yet Africa plainly does not have a monopoly on international crime, and this unhappy and lopsided picture tends to give force to the critique that international justice is pro-western and controlled by the victors. One wonders quite what it will take, for example, for a proper international investigation of the well-documented allegations of torture and other abuse at Bagram and elsewhere in Afghanistan, a country that has been a party to the ICC statute since 2003. Hopefully these will come to be seen as teething problems. Today&apos;s international courts, and this week&apos;s news stories, are the product of ideas generated long ago, in the 1940s and even before. It took centuries to create the system of English courts. Warts and all, our international courts do a good job in difficult circumstances. They won&apos;t end international crime or wrongdoing any more than local courts can make national crime disappear. They do make a difference, however, and it&apos;s difficult to see a better alternative. They are here to stay. They will be better, stronger and even more legitimate when the playing field is more level. Philippe Sands QC is professor of law at University College London.

The first Hague convention of 1899 tried to formulate laws prohibiting war crimes. The international criminal court, founded in 2002, is the latest embodiment of the determination to outlaw genocide and crimes against humanity. Before the ICC was established, specialised courts to deal with the aftermath of particular conflicts were set up. The pioneers were the postwar Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials. In the 1990s, the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), was created in The Hague to deal with crimes in the Balkans. The ICTY, as well as prosecuting the former Serb commander Ratko Mladic, tried the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. He died in 2006 before the verdict could be delivered. The international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, based in Arusha, Tanzania, dealt with the 1994 genocide. The Hague is also home to the special tribunal for Lebanon, which is investigating the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri in Beirut in 2005. The special court for Sierra Leone was established in 2002 to bring to justice those responsible for atrocities perpetrated during the country&apos;s country&apos;s civil war in 1996. The ICC is expected to supersede regional temporary, region-focused war crimes tribunals and assume the role of a permanent court to &quot;end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community&quot;. The USA, a generous backer of the regional tribunals, is not a signatory to the ICC. Critics accuse Washington of wanting to ensure US citizens have effective international immunity from prosecution. The case of Khaled el-Masri, a German national who accuses the CIA of sending him to a secret prison in Afghanistan, was heard at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The court, used by the 47 member states of the Council of Europe including the UK, deals with appeals beyond national jurisdictions on issues in relation to the European convention on human rights. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2012 because the original referred to The Hague as the Dutch capital.

Tokyo Disneyland said this week it would allow gay couples to hold ceremonies on its grounds, although same-sex weddings have no legal status in Japan. Disneyland&apos;s decision came to light after Koyuki Higashi, a 27-year-old woman, inquired about marrying her female partner Hiroko at the resort. Higashi was initially told she would be able to marry her partner provided they were dressed &quot;like a man and a woman&quot;, she wrote on her blog. Staff at Disneyland, which attracts about 14 million visitors a year, were apparently concerned about how other visitors would react to the sight of couples both dressed in wedding dresses or tuxedos. A spokeswoman for Milial Resort Hotels, a subsidiary of Tokyo Disney Resort, later said there had been a misunderstanding, telling Higashi and her partner they could dress how they pleased, although they would not be able to exchange vows in the chapel due to &quot;Christian teachings&quot;. The park said it would accept all applications for same-sex wedding ceremonies. The only obstacle now appears to be financial: a full wedding ceremony in Cinderella&apos;s castle, with Disney characters included on the guest list, costs 7.5m yen (\u00a360,000). Disneyland&apos;s stance was a rare sign of progress in a country still uncertain about its attitude towards homosexuality. There are no laws against homosexuality, and Tokyo is home to a large lesbian gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) population, many of whom took part in a rainbow pride event in the capital last month. Gay and transgender celebrities are regulars on TV variety shows, while Taiga Ishikawa became one of Japan&apos;s few openly gay politicians when he won a seat in Tokyo&apos;s Toshima ward assembly in April 2011. Ishikawa welcomed Disneyland&apos;s decision, which apparently came after officials in Tokyo contacted the company&apos;s US headquarters. &quot;I wrote 10 years ago that I looked forward to the day when gay and lesbian couples could hold hands and go to Tokyo Disneyland, so I&apos;m very happy,&quot; he told the Guardian.

But now that gay marriages are in the news overseas, there is better awareness here, at least.&quot; Obama&apos;s endorsement of gay marriages was the cue for an outburst from Takeshi Kitano, the internationally acclaimed filmmaker, who caused dismay in the LGBT community when he ridiculed the US president&apos;s stance during an appearance on a TV news programme. Kitano suggested permitting gay marriages would lead to unions between humans and animals, and questioned the ability of gay couples to raise children. &quot;The child will be bullied,&quot; he said. &quot;People will say, &apos;But your mum is actually your dad.&apos;&quot; His homophobic comments were not the first by a high-profile public figure in Japan. In late 20101, Shintaro Ishihara, the outspoken governor of Tokyo, suggested gay people were &quot;deficient&quot; after watching same-sex couples take part in a parade in San Francisco. &quot;We have even got homosexuals casually appearing even on television,&quot; he said. &quot;Japan has become far too untamed.&quot; Higashi and her partner have visited Disneyland to break their good news to Mickey Mouse, but have yet to set a date for the wedding. &quot;Mickey first looked surprised to hear that we are a couple of girls,&quot; she said on her blog. &quot;But we said we were there to thank him\u00a0\u2026 and he celebrated with us.&quot; But, she added, taboos surrounding sexuality had forced many gay and lesbian couples to keep their relationships secret. &quot;There is still a lot of prejudice at work and in people&apos;s homes to prevent a lot of us from coming out,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;Also, when the only public gays you see are the comedians on television who are the butt of public ridicule, it&apos;s hard to find a good reason to come out.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Japan&apos;s precipitous exit from nuclear power generation \u2013 the day I arrived in Tokyo was the first non-nuclear day in Japan for 42 years \u2013 has pushed the country&apos;s fossil fuel demand through the roof, with imports of oil and gas up by more than 100% since last year, their ballooning cost driving a record trade deficit of $32bn."], "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Environment", "South Korea", "Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "Energy", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-17T15:29:40Z", "title": "While Japan turns away from nuclear power, South Korea sticks to its path", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/17/japan-nuclear-south-korea", "article": "The traffic lights are still blinking in Odaka town, north-western Japan, but few cars pass through these deserted intersections. Frozen in time after being hit by the triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and meltdowns in the nearby Fukushima Dai&apos;ichi nuclear plant, tables are still laid in partially-collapsed restaurants and cars are stacked up against railings where they were deposited by the retreating wave. When I visited last week, a deathly silence reigned, the only noise the chirruping of frogs in uncultivated rice paddies on the edge of town, and the bleeping of my dosimeter. Radiation readings in Odaka are well below anything that could be considered a health risk, but people are still not coming back. Indeed, the long shadow cast by Fukushima has extended over a much wider area than any scientific assessment of radiological hazard would argue is necessary. In Minamisoma, 20km north of the stricken reactor, a community centre above the town is decked out for indoor play because no one wants to let their children venture out of doors. The parents refuse to believe that radiation readings are low enough \u2013 barely above normal background, on my dosimeter \u2013 that their children&apos;s health would be improved by letting them play outside in the fresh air. Watching the kids cooped up in a big wooden hall, I could only conclude that unnecessary fear of radiation is just as much a hazard as the real thing. On a wider scale still, unnecessary fear of radiation now presents a serious hazard to the world&apos;s climate. Japan&apos;s precipitous exit from nuclear power generation \u2013 the day I arrived in Tokyo was the first non-nuclear day in Japan for 42 years \u2013 has pushed the country&apos;s fossil fuel demand through the roof, with imports of oil and gas up by more than 100% since last year, their ballooning cost driving a record trade deficit of $32bn. As carbon emissions rise in lockstep, Japan&apos;s leaders are now backing off from their international climate change commitments, which the country has no chance of meeting. Given that wind, solar and geothermal account for less than 1% of Japan&apos;s electricity generation, the country will be massively dependent on fossil fuels for decades to come if the reactors stay switched off. The only alternative is blackout. Given the trauma of the March 2011 tsunami disaster, Japan&apos;s nuclear shutdown is understandable \u2013 if regrettable from a global warming perspective. But a flight across the Sea of Japan to its neighbour South Korea shows a very different model in evidence. In the same week that Japan mothballed its very last reactor, Korea broke ground on two new-build nuclear power stations \u2013 a pair of APR-1400 units now being constructed at Shin Ulchin, on the east coast. They are two of eight new stations planned to add to the country&apos;s existing nuclear fleet of 23, currently supplying 45% of the nation&apos;s electricity. To mark the occasion the country&apos;s president, Lee Myung-bak, paid a visit to the site, praising a &quot;huge milestone&quot; for South Korea&apos;s engineers, who had helped the country achieve &quot;the dream of independent nuclear technology&quot;. It is not that South Korea is not green. In fact the mantra of &quot;green growth&quot; has been a central component of President Lee&apos;s policy platform since 2008, and this month \u2013 even as Japan backed away from its own climate commitments \u2013 Korea&apos;s legislature unanimously passed a new climate act which will enforce carbon caps and an emissions trading scheme among its heavy industry and electricity sector. The country&apos;s international carbon emissions target is for a 30% cut below &quot;business as usual&quot; emissions by 2020, a commitment its leaders say they intend to deliver on. It also spent a higher proportion of its post-economic crash stimulus package on environmental initiatives than any other country. South Korea is anxious to export its green growth model to other countries. Last week President Lee spoke at a landmark summit held by the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute, reiterating his view that there need be no automatic trade-off between rapid economic growth and environmental sustainability. In respect of Japanese sensitivities, he refrained from addressing the centrality of nuclear to Korea&apos;s green growth plans, but tension between the competing visions for what counts as &quot;green&quot; were evident throughout the two-day meeting. The president was immediately followed by the Japanese telecoms billionaire Masayoshi Son, who \u2013 having reinvented himself as head of the new Japan Renewable Energy Foundation \u2013 dramatically declared that there should be &quot;no nuclear for mankind anywhere in the world, for the sake of the future, for the sake of our children, for the Earth&quot;. The Korean hosts clapped politely, but did not appear convinced \u2013 hardly surprising given that Masayoshi Son&apos;s only proposed alternative to nuclear generation was a scheme for a pan-Asian supergrid linking Japanese cities with thousands of solar and wind plants supposedly to be built across the Gobi desert in faraway Mongolia. The plan would cost trillions and take decades to implement \u2013 and would leave Japan dependent on power lines crossing its energy-hungry and often less-than-friendly neighbour China. Koreans know that their economic miracle has been built on practical engineering success, not magical thinking. The chair of the Green Growth Institute, Dr Han Seung-soo, himself a former prime minister of Korea, told me later: &quot;Once the safety aspect is guaranteed there is no cleaner source than nuclear. It is clean energy because the amount of emissions created is almost nil.&quot; When I asked if Korea had a target for wind and solar deployment, he shook his head. Looking out of the window, from the centre of an Asian megacity with impressive skyscrapers in every direction as far as the eye could see, the idea of powering Seoul with renewables did seem nonsensical. The truth is that, as in Japan, the proportion of solar and wind on the Korean grid is tiny, about 0.25% \u2013 most of the country&apos;s power comes from coal, and the only way to reduce its carbon emissions significantly is to continue to replace coal plants with nuclear. Yet as the post-Fukushima anti-nuclear hysteria continues to drag many countries \u2013 from Japan to Germany to Switzerland \u2013 back towards the fossil fuels age, South Korea is quietly getting on with reducing its carbon emissions while continuing its growth miracle."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo will also be concerned about the value of the yen, which tends to strengthen when there is turmoil in other parts of the global economy: it has periodically intervened in recent months to cap the currency&apos;s appreciation."], "tags": ["G8", "World news", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Financial crisis", "Economics", "Financial sector", "Business", "US news", "Russia", "Germany", "European Union", "Italy", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-17T18:25:30Z", "title": "G8 at Camp David: what the world wants to achieve", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/17/g8-at-camp-david-world-wants-to-achieve", "article": "Germany Briefing the German parliament last week on expectations of Camp David, Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasised less what she wanted than what she did not want. &quot;There can be no growth through borrowing,&quot; she declared, in a statement delivered on the issue of the global economy, but which seemed more directed at Europe. &quot;That would just take us back to the start of the crisis.&quot; If the euro crisis hijacks the G8, as looks inevitable, Merkel may herself come under a triple-whammy attack, from France, Britain and the US. She will resist all talk of fiscal stimulus as a response to the latest stage of the currency crisis, argue that piling up more debt to generate growth and jobs is a fool&apos;s counsel, while perhaps signalling a little more flexibility towards Greece. David Cameron&apos;s lectures from the sidelines of Europe&apos;s crisis, if listened to at all, are heard only with irritation on what Sir Mervyn King detachedly referred to as &quot;the continent&quot; on Wednesday. The PM, who vetoed Merkel&apos;s euro fiscal pact in December, is not involved in the bailouts nor the decision-taking and is not a player in Europe&apos;s worst moment. France is different. Merkel has to listen to president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and needs a good working relationship with him if there is to be any chance of charting a way out of the extreme turbulence. And then there is Barack Obama, worried about the knock-on effects if the dangerous game of bluff between Berlin and Athens goes wrong, forcing Greece to quit the euro and unleashing an unpredictable tsunami of failing banks and distressed sovereigns. All in a US election year. Merkel, therefore, may find herself in the spotlight at Camp David, a lonely place. United States Barack Obama will kick off the weekend with a speech in Washington setting out plans for helping developing countries, an issue to be discussed further at Camp David. Unlike other G8 meetings such as Gleneagles, there will be no major spending pledges, instead a promise to build on the $22bn (\u00a314bn) agreed at a previous G8 meeting to lift 50 million people out of hunger. With the G8 countries engaged in belt-tightening at home, Obama will talk up the role of the private sector in tackling hunger. The main topic at Camp David will be the eurozone, with Obama pushing Merkel to shift the balance from austerity to growth. But Obama has little leverage because the US has opted against helping to bale out Europe. Nato will announce it will meet its target of raising $4.1bn a year to fund a 228,000-strong Afghan army for 10 years from 2014. But there will be no detailed timetable of the phased withdrawal of US and other international forces from Afghanistan ahead of the 2014 deadline. As part of the window dressing, there will be an announcement that the first phase of the European defence system is in place, able to block any missiles from Iran or North Korea. This sounds impressive but amounts to little more than what existed before: radar stations in Turkey, US ships in the Mediterranean and, the one fresh element, a new command team, though still at the embryonic stage. Russia Russia&apos;s new-old president Vladimir Putin last week announced he would not be at the G8 summit. Instead, he said, he was sending his new prime minster Dmitry Medvedev. The move was a deliberate snub to Obama. Putin is displeased with Washington for two reasons: he believes the US has incited the recent pro-democracy demonstrations against him and is also unhappy with Obama&apos;s missile defence plans in central Europe. The Kremlin believes they pose a direct threat to Russia&apos;s strategic nuclear arsenal. The US disputes this. Putin&apos;s absence will also make it harder for G8 leaders to make any meaningful progress on Syria. Since the Syrian uprising began, Putin has staunchly supported Syria&apos;s president Bashar al-Assad. His reasons for doing so are various: primarily, to defend Russia&apos;s historical interests in the region, but also to frustrate US attempts \u2013 as Moscow sees it \u2013 to engineer regime change in Damascus. With demonstrators taking to the streets and squares of Moscow, Putin is doing what comes naturally: showing solidarity with a fellow authoritarian leader facing down an uprising and who is shunned by the west. Russia, meanwhile, has survived the eurozone crisis better than many other major economies. The country&apos;s two biggest trading partners are the EU and China. Demand for Siberian oil and gas has gone down somewhat, but the Russian economy has proved to be surprisingly resilient. Growth this year is forecast to hit 4%. Russia is less directly exposed to the debt crisis than its European neighbours and it remains the world&apos;s biggest exporter of oil and gas. But if the turmoil in the eurozone spreads, it could trigger a slump in oil prices \u2013 with consequences for Russia&apos;s budget, for ordinary citizens, and for the Kremlin&apos;s ability to keep a lid on popular discontent. Italy Italian prime minister Mario Monti will use the G8 to talk up growth policies which he believes can counter excessive doses of austerity. It&apos;s a rallying cry he has issued in Italy, even if Italians continue to see him as the dark prince of tax hikes and spending cuts. That&apos;s a reputation set to be reinforced this summer when his much feared property tax is introduced. But in a press conference held with IMF inspectors on the eve of the G8, he was adamant that he had never used the word austerity, claiming his work on spurring growth in Italy has gone hand in hand with balancing the books since he took office in November. Now he is set to take the same message to the G8, after pointing out last week that the need for economic growth policies was not limited to Europe and that the issue would be on the agenda at Camp David. On the phone this week, ahead of the meeting, Monti and President Obama talked job creation. &quot;Monti is saying we will continue on the road to a balanced budget, but we also need good growth in the short term,&quot; said a spokeswoman. &quot;If austerity means just losing jobs, then it becomes a vicious circle, and we are talking about genuine policies, not just digging up roads then laying them again.&quot; Monti, the former EU commissioner, will feel at ease among world leaders, just as he appears to be feeling increasingly uneasy mixing it up at home with party leaders who have lent him grudging support to push through his reforms. On Wednesday, he was huddled in talks with Silvio Berlusconi, who has pledged loyalty to Monti, even as his MPs sabotage Monti&apos;s bill to clamp down on corruption, and while his family newspaper Il Giornale, keeps up a bitter campaign against the government. Japan Japan, like America, has a powerful interest in seeing Europe resolve its sovereign debt crisis, and prime minister Yoshihiko Noda will be urging Germany in particular to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent a euro meltdown. Scarred by their own so-called &quot;lost decade&quot; of recession and deflation, senior Japanese politicians have repeatedly warned their counterparts in Europe and the US since 2008 of the consequences of failing to act decisively to contain the crisis. Japan achieved a robust growth rate of 1% in the first quarter of the year, helped by a surge of investment as the economy is rebuilt after last year&apos;s tsunami. But its export-led growth model is highly vulnerable to slowing demand from Europe, as austerity and market panic take their toll. Tokyo will also be concerned about the value of the yen, which tends to strengthen when there is turmoil in other parts of the global economy: it has periodically intervened in recent months to cap the currency&apos;s appreciation. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy  The European Commission president and the president of the European Council travel to Camp David hoping for progress on a range of issues including food security and climate change. The pair will push for &quot;strong and urgent action&quot; to cut CO2 emissions in line with agreed targets, and for more support for initiatives to build stronger agricultural systems in developing countries, to cut hunger worldwide. They will also be lobbying against any moves towards protectionism, arguing that free trade, not trade wars, remains the key to global growth. But with the euro crisis likely to dominate, the event would be a great success if Barack Obama could succeed where Brussels has failed and convince Merkel that the eurozone should embrace eurobonds, now. Barroso has consistently struggled to persuade her of the delights of collective borrowing. With an election looming in November, the US president may make a more forceful case. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2012. The original mentioned &quot;President Yoshihiko Noda&quot;.

But in a country where apolitical fantasy dress-up is a national pastime, a fake wedding in an imported land of make-believe is hardly a victory for LGBT rights. At Tokyo Rainbow Pride last month, I asked dozens of individuals of varying ages, political persuasions and non-straight identities about the one thing the Japanese government could do to improve their lives. &quot;Give us civil partnership&quot; was the resounding answer. Currently, gay couples living in Japan often resort to adopting one another as a means of full legal protection, and while the country signed a UN protocol last year promising to protect its LGBT citizens, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is yet to be outlawed. Meanwhile, the campaign for civil partnership championed by Taiga Ishikawa, one of only two openly gay Japanese politicians who has been in office just a year, is embryonic. The decision to allow Koyuki Higashi and her partner Horoko to spend fanciful amounts of yen on their symbolic union is understandably significant to them. But will the commercially-blessed ceremony, played out in a culture where recreational costumery is but a socially-acceptable respite from conservative daily life, be anything more than gay cosplay? Part of the answer lies in Disney&apos;s initial refusal to allow the ceremony. It would trouble others, the couple were told, not to see the pair dressed in a complementary morning suit and meringue; they could have the ceremony provided they dress &quot;like a man and a woman.&quot; Tradition in Japan prevails, particularly when the overwhelming expectations on women to present as hyper-feminine means Japanese lesbians are predominantly femme, hence increasing the likelihood of the troubling two-frock spectacle. While the Japanese love of camp gameshow hosts and drag queens favours gay male representation, Disney&apos;s concession is actually a strike of sorts for lesbian visibility, currently confined to cartoon porn and the spectacle of popular girl group AKB48 passing sweets to one another by way of their nubile teen mouths in a recent TV commercial \u2013 which, incidentally, received 116 viewers&apos; complaints for what Japan&apos;s broadcasting ethics and programme improvement organisation described as encouraging homosexuality. But with a distinct dearth of genuine lesbian and bi women in the public eye, let alone in the entertainment world, it&apos;s hard to believe that the sight of two grown females committing to one another in an artificial arena created to indulge childhood fantasies will have any real political significance. In fact, Disney&apos;s decision probably says less about shifting Japanese attitudes to gay partnership and more about how a western corporation&apos;s diversity duty can be commandeered by an Asian company anxious not to offend national sentiment. The Tokyo Disney Resort is actually run by a Japanese entity called The Oriental Land Company, which licenses the name and characters from the Disney corporation. Notably, international companies of Japanese origin that sponsor Pride events in the rest of the world have often refrained from doing so within Japan. Japanese morals, traditionally informed by Shinto, Buddhist and Confucian teachings, may not be burdened by a concept of homosexual sin, but public sexual display, whatever the orientation, is still generally perceived as shameful, hence the reluctance to publicly support LGBT events. In the case of Tokyo Disneyworld, the Oriental Land Company is able to lean on the west&apos;s increasingly open tolerance towards homosexuality without necessarily affronting traditional Japanese social mores. But all cultures bring with them their own prejudices, in this case, a Christian anxiety about same-sex coupling in the house of God. Despite Tokyo Disney&apos;s green light, Koyuki and Hiroko will not be able to exchange symbolic vows in the park&apos;s chapel due to &quot;Christian teachings&quot;. The hope of course is that Koyuki and Hiroko&apos;s campaign can be used as an opportunity to openly discuss the need for civil partnership, in a society where workplace promotions are frequently dependent on marital status. But while the Japanese clearly seek workaday respite in the fanciest of dress-up games, a new subculture of playing wives in Disneyworld is unlikely to be a fairytale flight to equal marriage. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["Donna Summer Donna Summer dies of cancer aged 63 Donna Summer obituary Five classic Donna Summer songs Stars pay tribute to disco diva \u2013 video  Donna Summer&apos;s disco was as radical as punk A classic interview with Donna Summer, first published in Rolling Stone in 1976 In other news Adele, PJ Harvey and Ed Sheeran triumph at Ivor Novello awards Chuck Brown, &quot;Godfather of go-go&quot;, dies aged 75 Legendary bass player Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn found dead in Tokyo at age 70 PJ Harvey contributes two new songs to Mark Cousins documentary Lady Gaga denied permit for Indonesia concert after religious protests Jay-Z to headline and curate his own Made in America festival On the blog Multiculturalism is what makes British music great Pop&apos;s long players: sometimes extra length makes all the difference What do you think of David Cameron&apos;s taste in music?"], "tags": ["Donna Summer", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-18T13:28:36Z", "title": "Sleeve notes: Farewell to Donna Summer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/18/sleeve-notes-donna-summer", "article": "Donna Summer Donna Summer dies of cancer aged 63 Donna Summer obituary Five classic Donna Summer songs Stars pay tribute to disco diva \u2013 video  Donna Summer&apos;s disco was as radical as punk A classic interview with Donna Summer, first published in Rolling Stone in 1976 In other news Adele, PJ Harvey and Ed Sheeran triumph at Ivor Novello awards Chuck Brown, &quot;Godfather of go-go&quot;, dies aged 75 Legendary bass player Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn found dead in Tokyo at age 70 PJ Harvey contributes two new songs to Mark Cousins documentary Lady Gaga denied permit for Indonesia concert after religious protests Jay-Z to headline and curate his own Made in America festival On the blog Multiculturalism is what makes British music great Pop&apos;s long players: sometimes extra length makes all the difference What do you think of David Cameron&apos;s taste in music?

The massive impact of the global population&apos;s growing need for water on rising sea levels is revealed in a comprehensive assessment of all the ways in which people use water. Trillions of tonnes of water have been pumped up from deep underground reservoirs in every part of the world and then channelled into fields and pipes to keep communities fed and watered. The water then flows into the oceans, but far more quickly than the ancient aquifers are replenished by rains. The global tide would be rising even more quickly but for the fact that man-made reservoirs have, until now, held back the flow by storing huge amounts of water on land. &quot;The water being taken from deep wells is geologically old \u2013 there is no replenishment and so it is a one way transfer into the ocean,&quot; said sea level expert Prof Robert Nicholls, at the University of Southampton. &quot;In the long run, I would still be more concerned about the impact of climate change, but this work shows that even if we stabilise the climate, we might still get sea level rise due to how we use water.&quot; He said the sea level would rise 10 metres or more if all the world&apos;s groundwater was pumped out, though he said removing every drop was unlikely because some aquifers contain salt water. The sea level is predicted to rise by 30-100cm by 2100, putting many coasts at risk, by increasing the number of storm surges that swamp cities. The new research was led by Yadu Pokhrel, at the University of Tokyo, and published in Nature Geoscience. &quot;Our study is based on a state-of-the-art model which we have extensively validated in our previous works,&quot; he said. &quot;It suggests groundwater is a major contributor to the observed sea level rise.&quot; The team&apos;s results also neatly fill a gap scientists had identified between the rise in sea level observed by tide gauges and the contribution calculated to come from melting ice. The drawing of water from deep wells has caused the sea to rise by an average of a millimetre every year since 1961, the researchers concluded. The storing of freshwater in reservoirs has offset about 40% of that, but the scientists warn that this effect is diminishing. &quot;Reservoir water storage has levelled off in recent years,&quot; they write. &quot;By contrast, the contribution of groundwater depletion has been increasing and may continue to do so in the future, which will heighten the concerns regarding the potential sea level rise in the 21st century.&quot; Nicholls, who was not part of the research team, said there are a wide range of projections of future sea level. &quot;But this work makes one worry about the uncertainty at the high end more,&quot; he said. The researchers compared the contribution of groundwater withdrawal and reservoir storage to the more familiar causes of rising sea level: ice melted by global warming and the expansion of the ocean as it warms. The pumping out of groundwater is five times bigger in scale than the melting of the planet&apos;s two great ice caps, in Greenland and Antarctica, and twice as great as both the melting of all other glaciers and ice or the thermal expansion of seawater. The scale of groundwater use is as vast as it is unsustainable: over the past half century 18 trillion tonnes of water has been removed from underground aquifers without being replaced. In some parts of the world, the stores of water have now been exhausted. Saudi Arabia, for example, was self-sufficient in wheat, grown in the desert using water from deep, fossil aquifers. Now, many of the aquifers have run dry and most wheat is imported, with all growing expected to end in 2016. In northern India, the level of the water table is dropping by 4cm every year. Pokhrel&apos;s team also investigated the effect of rising temperatures on other ways in which water is stored on land. They found that the drying of soils and loss of snow added almost a tenth of a millimetre per year to sea level rise. Prof Jonathan Bamber, of the University of Bristol, said the washing of vast volumes of groundwater into the sea was a large factor, but did not appear to have accelerated over the past 50 years, despite the world population more than doubling in that time. In contrast, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers as global temperatures rise has accelerated over the past 20 years, he said: &quot;So it is pretty clear to me that this will be the dominant contributor in the future.&quot; The new work reveals the surprisingly large effect of deep water wells on the oceans, said Martin Vermeer, at Aalto University in Finland, but would not radically alter overall estimates of sea level rise by 2100. &quot;It&apos;s an incremental change, nothing revolutionary, assuming the result of this paper holds up. Science is never built upon a single result.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["But just as Hurricane Katrina seemed to catch the city of New Orleans by surprise, the scale of the destruction in and around the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the coastal settlements also bewildered the Tokyo government and stunned the surviving communities."], "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Canada", "Americas", "World news", "Italy", "Europe", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-20T21:14:24Z", "title": "Natural hazard: sleepwalking into tragedy | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/20/natural-hazard-sleepwalking-tragedy-editorial", "article": "Citizens of British Columbia have just completed Zombie Preparedness Week. This interlude of low-cost, deadpan merriment had a serious purpose: a community ready for assault from the living dead would also be primed to survive earthquake, wildfire, catastrophic flood, windstorm or lethal pandemic. No society is free from natural hazard \u2013 the magnitude 6 earthquake in northern Italy on Sunday is a sharp reminder of that. What separates hazard from disaster is a mix of factors, but common to them all are civic readiness and citizen education. Any investment in preparedness is a bargain in financial terms. That is because, since the turn of the millennium, worldwide economic losses from disaster have reached almost $1.4 trillion. In the last five years alone, costs have topped $800bn; 2011, with losses of more than $350bn, was the most expensive in history \u2013 according to the insurance industry. Last year was marked by the Great East Japan earthquake, a shock so violent it shifted the planet slightly on its axis, shortened the day by more than a microsecond, shunted parts of Japan 12 feet closer to America, triggered a catastrophic tsunami and tipped the nuclear industry into crisis. Japan, like Canada and the US, is a wealthy country with a lively insurance market and a citizenry prepared for natural hazard. But just as Hurricane Katrina seemed to catch the city of New Orleans by surprise, the scale of the destruction in and around the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the coastal settlements also bewildered the Tokyo government and stunned the surviving communities. The Japanese earthquake was just about as violent as an earthquake could be: the numbers at risk, however, were relatively low. One day, a disaster of similar magnitude will hit a modern megalopolis and the loss of life will be inconceivably worse. That is because the fastest population growth is in the developing world, and more than half of all humanity is now concentrated into cities, many of them at hazard from windstorm, flood and seismic wave. That is why the international disaster agencies have been pushing the theme of civic preparedness; have been arguing for cyclone shelters; for schools and hospitals that withstand shock; and for public education. In any disaster, the wealthy stand to lose money but the poorest risk everything: their homes, their livelihoods and all too often their lives. It makes sense to prepare a community for a disaster that may never happen, because if you prepare efficiently enough, then indeed it may never happen. Zombie attack is not a high-probability hazard, but the Canadians are right to be alert for the day the dead awaken.

As in his previous film Certified Copy, Kiarostami shows interest in social norms, persona and role play. The movie also shows the classic Kiarostami mannerism of extended conversations in cars: that interesting and intimate space which is neither entirely public nor private.

These are the sorts of spirits I like, but he didn&apos;t pass the bottle. For a moment, nothing discernible happened. No voodoo, no who-do. The sorcerer from Togo who concocted the altar goes by the name of Az\u00e9 Kokovivina, Sorcerer of the Giggles. Maybe that&apos;s where the gin comes in. Suddenly I wasn&apos;t laughing, but plunged into a world of spirits, demons and creatures from the netherworld. Annette Messager&apos;s clothes flew about the room, powered by electric fans. A tiny carved Peruvian shaman, part baby, part boxer, and no bigger than my hand, took up a fighting stance. A medieval St Michael slew a demon, Joseph Beuys gave a lecture to a dead hare and Picasso transformed himself into a faun. A figure with a head like a dunce&apos;s cap gave me the eye, and what looked like a sock turned into a cuttlefish. Ancient beings of remarkable ferocity stalked my way and Sri Lankan masks gurned and yowled.     Spirits and demons ... Motion/Emotion (2012), by Annette Messager, at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    In the Garden of Addiction, Christophe Berdaguer and Marie P\u00e9jus&apos;s tangle of glass tubes, like so many evil flowers, proffered the scents of opium, cocaine, skunk and booze. Various modern-day witches and healers discussed their craft on a tower of TV screens. It was like watching a dozen cookery channels at once. Cultures, eons, continents flew by. We were among the forces of chaos and disorder: healers and tricksters, shape-shifters and spirit guides, transgressors and transvestites. Housed in a mock-up cave of aluminium struts, wallboard and plaster-soaked scrim, the exhibition Les Ma\u00eetres du D\u00e9sordre (Masters of Chaos) is an exercise in wild curating at the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly in Paris. De Loisy has always been a bit of a maverick curator. Here, he has brought together a bewildering selection of artefacts, sculptures, costumes, masks and objects from past and present, and from every continent. Beautiful, tender objects collide with the monstrous and the devilish. Much of it has extraordinary power and vitality. Among it all are a number of more modern, western artworks \u2013 from Picasso to Paul McCarthy \u2013 as if to show the persistence of the transgressive and the search for hidden meaning in the world. Beuys, a latter-day shaman, thought he could heal the postwar world with his art. Randy old goat Picasso was a shape-shifter and trickster. Other recent artists \u2013 Jonathan Meese, the Chapman Brothers, Russia&apos;s Oleg Kulik being led around on a chain and behaving like a mad dog \u2013 are just tricky. But if you want to be an artist, you&apos;ve got to believe in something. The trouble with most contemporary art in this context is that little of it, if any, is the product of a shared belief system that glues the world, and the self, together. If there are no rules, there&apos;s nothing to transgress. The exhibition&apos;s title is taken from Bertrand Hell&apos;s book Possession and Shamanism, yet to be translated into English. Masters of Chaos is also the culmination of De Loisy&apos;s own 20-year obsession with the subject. His previous curatorial projects have included exhibitions on beauty, on the face, and, in 2008, Traces of the Sacred, a tour of the persistence of the sacred in 20th- and 21st-century art. He also collaborated with Anish Kapoor and James Turrell and, after working at the Centre Pompidou, went sailing around the world for a number of years. He is a man in search of something. He has also recently been appointed director of the newly renovated Palais de Tokyo, just across the Seine, where the Paris Triennale is currently on view \u2013 the launch show in the expanded, renovated building.     Wild ... Jean-Michel Basquiat (1988) at Les Ma\u00eetres du D\u00e9sordre (Masters of Chaos). Photograph: The estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat/ADAGP    The two exhibitions share an interest in the ethnographic, in cultural difference and transcultural proximity, but could not be more different in approach. De Loisy is passionate about objects. The Triennale, which goes by the title Intense Proximity, is much more cautious about the readings we might make of the vast corpus of paintings and sculpture, films and video installations, photographs and drawings brought together by guest curator Okwui Enwezor. De Loisy&apos;s show is a thematic romp. Enwezor&apos;s triennale admits to the difficulties of finding order and meaning in the world. The triennale is a trial for any spectator. I wandered like a lost tourist. One minute, you&apos;re in the Venezuelan jungle, the next at a mixed-race wedding in the new South Africa. One minute, I&apos;m staring at the most intimate body parts of an Amsterdam sex-worker, the next watching a TV documentary about a talent contest for migrant Filipinos in Tel Aviv. I twirl along to north African beats and stare at a group of closed and silent grand pianos. Here are Claude Levi-Strauss&apos;s notebook drawings and a great new painting by Chris Ofili; over there are some gorgeous black-and-white photographs of Bahia&apos;s Afro-Brazilian dock life in the 1940s. On a screen, blacked-up (now that really does seem transgressive), the young French artist Lili Reynaud-Dewar dances among a group of her own sculptures, in homage to Josephine Baker. The day before my shimmy with the shamans, I&apos;d spent almost five hours here and was still reeling. Enwezor, who directed Documenta 11 in 2002 and is now running the Haus der Kunst in Munich, has a very different take on art and ethnography to De Loisy. He sees a link between the ethnographer and the artist, ethnography and curating.     La Chor\u00e9graphie des Tr\u00e9sors de Guerre (2011) and La Frise Tr\u00e9sors de Guerre (1976-2012), by Sarkis, at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    Intense Proximity focuses on this: the link between the close and the distant, the near and the far. It confronts us with the world&apos;s disjunctions. With so many cultural differences and competing interests in an ever-shrinking world, how do we even begin to make sense of it all? Is art a kind of news from elsewhere (whether a geographical place or a somewhere in the artist&apos;s mind), or a report from the close-to-home? Both exhibition catalogues quote the ironic opening phrase of Levi-Strauss&apos;s marvellous 1955 book Tristes Tropiques: &quot;I hate travelling and explorers&quot;. The idea of exploration has changed immeasurably since the days of 19th-century colonial empire, and as much again since Levi-Strauss&apos;s first trip to Brazil in 1935. Bertrand Hell told me how little travelling French ethnographers and anthropologists undertake nowadays. On the other hand, today&apos;s curators, and even critics, are always on the move. Enwezor admits to a kind of intellectual vertigo and spatial disorientation. Descending into the bowels of the Palais de Tokyo, I knew what he meant. It has hidden depths, basements leading to sub-basements, subterranean mezzanines and floors, traversed by ramps and open, curving staircases. Films are screened in rediscovered auditoria that had been walled up for decades, and in side rooms branching from dizzying Piranesian shafts. The place seems to go on for ever, and so does the triennale. When I described my journey through the triennale to De Loisy, he said he likes the idea of people getting lost in these basements. I like being lost, too. But this journey is accompanied by growing panic.     'How can anyone deal with all this stuff?' ... La Porte: Derri\u00e8re la Porte...! Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019il y a Derri\u00e8re la Porte..?, by Georges Ad\u00e9agbo (2012), at Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012. Photograph: Andre Morin    I&apos;m bought up short by a sign that reads: &quot;I am not exotic I am exhausted.&quot; How can anyone deal with all this stuff? The urge to see everything leads to the frustration of not seeing anything, of always being driven on to the next thing without absorbing the last. It is a flight that becomes ever more urgent, ever more futile. If it is an encounter with anything, it is with competing urges: the voice on the shoulder jockeying me on, and a desire for it all to stop. It is an encounter with the chaos of the world. \u2022 Masters of Chaos is at the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly, Paris, until 29 July \u2022 Intense Proximity: La Triennale 2012 is at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 26 August"}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo in 1964, she finished in a respectable fourth place; in Mexico in 1968, a disappointing ninth \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think I was as committed as I should have been at that stage in my career\u201d.", "She was fourth in this event in Tokyo and ninth in Mexico and she is Britain\u2019s leading shot putter."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: modern pentathlon", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-22T08:00:00Z", "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No32: Mary Peters wins gold in 1972", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/may/22/olympic-moments-mary-peters-1972", "article": "\u201cMary Peters is a protestant and has won a medal for Britain. An attempt will be made on her life and it will be blamed on the IRA ... Her home will be going up in the near future.\u201d The death threat came just after her victory, phoned into the BBC in Munich by a man with an Irish accent. Most people would heed such a threat to their life. Peters was different. \u201cBollocks,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m going straight to Belfast.\u201d   Related: Why Olympians shine under the spotlight    The Olympics in Munich had been billed as \u201cthe Games of peace and joy\u201d but neither of these were to be found in abundance in Belfast in 1972. Just 44 days before Peters\u2019 performance in the pentathlon at Munich, the Provisional IRA detonated 22 bombs in 75 terror-filled minutes that shook Belfast and Northern Ireland to its core. \u201cPeople walking in the streets around 2.30pm seemed to hear a bomb a minute and in the city centre some women became shocked and hysterical and had to be treated ... Few events in the past awful year have so appalled people,\u201d reported the Irish Times. On the day that came to be known as Bloody Friday, nine people were killed but many more were mutilated, injured or scarred, mentally and physically. This was Belfast in 1972; this was Northern Ireland in 1972. This was where Peters was so desperate to return to. Peters was born in Liverpool in 1939 but moved to Ballymena and then Belfast when her father\u2019s job was relocated to Northern Ireland. When she was first told of the move she reacted with tears. \u201cOne day he came back and I remember sitting on the stairs and hearing him tell my mother that we were all going to live in Northern Ireland. I went to bed and sobbed my heart out,\u201d she said. But it was in Northern Ireland that Peters\u2019 journey towards Olympic gold first took shape. Her first family holiday in her new home was spent at the seaside resort of Portrush, country Antrim and there, among the reeds and the rushes, Peters, racing her brother John up and down the dunes, discovered her love for athletics. The family holidays came to an end when her mother died of cancer a few years later. After that, athletics became Peters\u2019 escape, and she began to see it as more than just a hobby. To help her on her way, her ambitious father gave her two tonnes of sand as a 16th birthday present and built a pit in a neighbouring field for her to practise long jump. Her next birthday present was a lorry load of cement to make a shot put circle. Peters qualified first as a teacher and then as an Olympian. In Tokyo in 1964, she finished in a respectable fourth place; in Mexico in 1968, a disappointing ninth \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think I was as committed as I should have been at that stage in my career\u201d. But that all changed with the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in 1970. Peters won the shot put and the pentathlon and discovered that she liked the feeling of success: \u201cFor the first time in my career I wanted to win. I\u2019d always had the fear that if I was successful people would be jealous and their attitude to me would change. I never felt I really gave 100%. This time I did and ... I realised it was wonderful to be an achiever.\u201d At 33 years of age, Peters was all too aware that the Games in Munich would be her last shot at Olympic glory but her initial preparations were far from ideal. Despite working full-time, she didn\u2019t have a car and so had to drag her shot and starting blocks through a two-bus journey to reach the dilapidated running track at Queen\u2019s University, \u201coften having to turn back because there were bombs going off\u201d. Luckily, her success in Edinburgh meant she won a scholarship to train for six weeks in California. A new climate and a new environment paid immediate dividends and she soon believed that \u201cif everything went right in Munich\u201d she could win. Conscious of events back home, Peters was motivated by the desire \u201cto make people at home happy in some small way\u201d and once there, she became even more bullish about her medal prospects: \u201cI was so focused on winning. No way was I going home without a gold medal.\u201d With some civilized preparation and her aversion to winning conquered, the last thing standing between Peters and gold was the competition. Her main rival was a 26-year-old local woman and hotly tipped favourite, Heide Rosendahl. The women\u2019s pentathlon was divided into two days and Peters had the perfect opening. She was drawn in lane seven for the 100m hurdles but still managed to equal her personal best. Spurred on by the attention of the large crowd at the Olympic Stadium \u2013 \u201cit was the first time in my life and career I had a real audience and I performed for them\u201d \u2013 she repeated the feat in both the shot put and high jump. By the end of the first day, she had an impressive 300-point lead over the West German. That night, she could not sleep. \u201cEvery time I looked at my watch it seemed the hands had moved backwards.\u201d She was anxious and had every right to be. The second day consisted of Rosendahl\u2019s two strongest events and Peters\u2019 two weakest events \u2013 the long jump and the 200m. The West German, who had already been crowned Olympic long jump champion, leapt 6.83m to land within a single centimetre of her then world record. Peters could not even get past the 6m barrier, landing at 5.95m. Her lead had been cut to just 47 points and there was still one event to go. If Peters wanted gold, she would have to run faster than she had ever done before. Both athletes started well in the 200m, and after the first bend, Peters was still within touching distance of Rosendahl. She was urged on by the BBC commentator \u2013 \u201cCome on Mary, you need the run of your life now\u201d \u2013 but could not match the West German for pace. In the final 80m, Rosendahl accelerated to finish in a time of 22.96sec. Peters finished fourth, 10m and 1.12sec behind her. It looked like she had blown it. After the race, the athletes, crowded by photographers, stared anxiously at the scoreboard, waiting for the results. Arms were folded, lips were bitten. Rosendahl, head bowed, paced nervously up and down; Peters stood behind another competitor and peeked out from behind her hands. It was not until the West German came over and shook her hand that Peters realised she had won the gold medal \u2013 by 10 points \u2013 setting a new world record in the process. When the death threat was made in the wake of her victory, Peters\u2019 father \u2013 now living in Australia and who had made a surprise visit to see her in action \u2013 wanted her to return to Australia with him. But she refused: \u201cMy home was in Belfast, my life was there and the people I loved were there.\u201d She was greeted at the barbwire-wrapped Belfast airport with fans carrying flowers, a gold Rolls-Royce, a band playing Congratulations and an open-top lorry that ferried her through the thronged streets of Belfast, those same streets that had been ripped to shreds by the IRA bombs just two months previously. \u201cIt was the first time people were on the streets with happy faces for a long while,\u201d Peters said. Those smiling faces belonged to both sides of the great divide and for a short time, during the bloodiest year the Troubles would serve up, the two communities of Northern Ireland rejoiced as one, celebrating their 33-year-old hero who had conquered age and a home favourite to win Olympic gold. After her success, Peters was offered jobs in the US and Australia but she refused: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been happy. My family is the Northern Ireland people\u201d. What happened next? Peters was not allowed back in her flat for three months. She was appointed an MBE that year, a CBE in 1990 and made a Dame in 2000. She set up the Mary Peters Trust to help young people with sport throughout Northern Ireland, and the running track on the outskirts of Belfast is called the Mary Peters track. She is the current Lord Lieutenant of Belfast and lives in Lisburn, country Antrim. What the Guardian said Everything seemed to move at world record pace in the Olympic Stadium here yesterday. Lasse Viren put Finland back again at the top of the 10,000 metre running when he beat Ron Clarke\u2019s world record by 1sec, with a time of 27min 38.4sec. The Bavarians cramming the stadium fell in love with Mary Peters who won the gold medal in the pentathlon and set a world record points score of 4,801 points; and Hildegard Falck, another attractive blonde, broke the Olympic record for the 800 metres with 1min. 58.6sec, a bare tenth of a second outside her own world record. Miss Peters has been delighting the crowd for the past two days. She began her pentathlon as one of those within reach of a medal. She started with 100 metres hurdles performance in 13.29sec for 960 points. She then put the shot 53ft 1\u00bdin and, as the stadium lights went up on Saturday evening, she went higher and higher in the high jump, finishing with a personal best of 5ft 10\u00bdin. Every time she Fosbury-flopped over the bar to a new height she leapt from the landing area to acknowledge immediately the cheers of the crowd. They began a soccer-like chant of her name and she finished the day with a points score of 2,969 which was 97 more than Burglinde Pollack of East Germany. But the real danger was Heide Rosendahl, of West Germany, who was 300 points behind but who is the gold medal holder in the long jump and an excellent sprinter, which were the last two events. Miss Peters achieved personal best performances in four out of the five events and in the long jump she was only 2in short of her best marks. She told me afterwards that she had no intention of retiring and hopes to compete in this event at the Commonwealth Games in two years\u2019 time.   Related: Rory McIlroy pulls out of Rio Olympics due to fears over Zika virus    Miss Peters went to bed realising that, while the Bavarians have a striking nationalistic fervour, she had won their hearts and when she competed this morning there were shouts of \u201cMary Mary\u201d all over the stadium. Miss Rosendahl gave quick notice that she was not content with one gold medal at the Games, for she long-jumped 22ft 5in \u2013 half an inch behind her own world record. Miss Peters managed a jump of 19ft 7\u00bdin and so the points score had been whittled away. There was some lunchtime juggling with times and pentathlon table scores and, for the final event, the balance was such that if Miss Rosendahl achieved her best performance of 23.1sec and Miss Peters was up to the same level (24.2sec in her case) the gold medal would go to Britain. They were drawn in the same heat which Miss Rosendahl won in 22.9, but Miss Peters went faster than was needed, 24.08sec, this bringing her a total of 4,081 points. Miss Peters has made a long and valuable contribution to British Athletics. She was fourth in this event in Tokyo and ninth in Mexico and she is Britain\u2019s leading shot putter. But while these are achievements of the arena her personality, her effervescence, her delightful smile and her attitude of genuine warmth and friendliness has many times raised the spirits of athletic team members and those who travel with them. This has been her most difficult year for she lives in the Antrim Road, Belfast, amid the explosions and strife of that city."}, {"sentences": ["The birthplace of more than one great Olympian, Wells has a permanent marker plaque in the market square to remind everyone of the first: Mary (Bignal) Rand, whose triple medal winning feat at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, included gold for a world record breaking 6.76-metre long jump."], "tags": ["Olympic torch", "UK news", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-22T12:47:26Z", "title": "Olympic torch route, day 4: a taste of Glastonbury festival fever", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/22/olympic-torch-guardian-relay-emily-eavis", "article": "The sun&apos;s out and all the children have the morning off school.

From the earliest days of my childhood, the festival has had much the same rhythm. First, all the stress of the licence and the booking, pretty much from the end of the event right through the autumn and winter. Then it gets a bit warmer and the first workers begin to move on to the farm, all the familiar faces. After that it gets quite a lot warmer and everyone starts arriving \u2026 But this time, instead of packed cars and trains streaming into Glastonbury and Castle Cary for a week-long revel, Glastonbury and nearby Wells are all-too-brief hosts to the Olympic flame on the fourth day of the marathon torch relay. I do like the way festival culture has added something to these big, very British, public celebrations (some of our top creative talents at the festival are working on great shows in London for the Olympics and the Paralympics). There is a bit of rebellion and humour in the air to line up against all the sponsorship and branding.

And we also decided a long time ago to leave the path clear for the Olympics this summer. The building excitement is all-too evident on my doorstep in Wells. I can see yellow roadblock signs, while police vans and ambulances are discreetly parked in side streets. Outside broadcast vans are filling the waiting time in our sunny market place by blasting out dedications, traffic updates and requests.

Another day, another bit of history. The birthplace of more than one great Olympian, Wells has a permanent marker plaque in the market square to remind everyone of the first: Mary (Bignal) Rand, whose triple medal winning feat at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, included gold for a world record breaking 6.76-metre long jump. A year later, at Buckingham Palace to receive her MBE, Mary was nominated by Mick Jagger in one newspaper as the woman he would most like to date. In the time it takes my son to toddle the full 22ft 2.1in of Mary&apos;s trailblazing jump marked out in the square, the torch and its cavalcade has passed down Sadler Street and on down the High Street, bound for the open countryside. Mary will finally be back in Wells in July to receive the freedom of the city, alongside fellow Olympic gold medallist from 1976, the modern pentathlete Danny Nightingale.

Roman Polanski&apos;s 1979 epic drifts on a summer breeze of hay wains and dairy farms, bumps for a spell in the frozen mud of the potato field and then fetches up at Stonehenge, where our fugitive heroine has fled with her milksop husband, Angel Clare (Peter Firth). The bobbies come to arrest Tess but it turns out that they must wait their turn. &quot;She&apos;s still sleeping,&quot; Angel whispers. &quot;Just a little longer.&quot; Somewhere, very distantly, alarm bells start ringing. Screenings in Cannes run to an immaculate clockwork precision. Interviews, however, are something else entirely; like confetti tossed to the wind, blown this way and that by changing schedules, shifting schedules and the whims of the talent. Sometimes you find yourself sat down with a subject and simply left there for hours on end (thanks for your patience, William Hurt). Sometimes (only sometimes) you don&apos;t get sat down at all. The Kinski meeting is set for noon, in a beach-front pavilion further up the Croisette. At 11.30 the publicist calls to say it&apos;s running late, &quot;she&apos;s still asleep&quot;. At 2pm I&apos;m chewing my knuckles, cooling my heels, ready to go at a moment&apos;s notice. Half an hour later, the meeting is cancelled. It rains and rains and rains some more. Small wonder that Kinski would prefer to stay indoors with the duvet pulled up. Outside, everyone is sopping, squelching, poised to erupt. They turn mutinous in the lines outside the Kiarostami screening where the umbrellas clash and scratch like some garish armada. Inside it&apos;s dry and the screenings keep coming. Killing Them Softly is a lean, supple and sure-footed American noir. Brad Pitt headlines as a discreet, leather-coated assassin called in to clean up a mess in a recession-hot America, while Andrew Dominik makes great play (perhaps too much play) of the weedy vacant lots, overlooked by brightly hopeful campaign posters from the 2008 presidential election. James Gandolfini co-stars as a fellow hit-man at the end of his tether, while Ray Liotta&apos;s fall-guy is first beaten to a pulp and then shot in slow-motion, the bullets razing him through the car window as he waits at the lights. &quot;This country is fucked,&quot; Pitt says at one stage. &quot;There&apos;s a plague coming.&quot; Elsewhere, the delegates indulge You Ain&apos;t Seen Nothing Yet, a play-within-a-play-within-a-film from 88-year-old Alain Resnais, though his celebration of the wonderful business of acting turns a shade irksome after a while; a heaped plate of meta-cheese. Abbas Kiarostami&apos;s Like Someone In Love comes in for a rougher ride. The viewers find it baffling and obtuse and they boo at the end. And yet Kiarostami&apos;s tale of play-actors and contrived-intimacies in Tokyo casts a definite spell. One danger of Cannes (aided and abetted by Twitter) is that it forces the critics to make snap judgments. But some films take longer to settle and confound the knee-jerk response. Already, 36-hours after it played, I have a sense that people are slowly coming round to the Kiarostami. Back in the flat, I find the Tess DVD is still stuck in my laptop. I pour some wine and idly flick the time-bar through to that final scene on Salisbury plain. Kinski is sleeping amid the stones but she has to wake sometime and, when she does, the cops are waiting. Her dress is muddy, her eyes are fearful. The policemen haul her up and march her brusquely away down the rutted path, while the closing caption explains that Tess was later &quot;hanged in the city of Wintoncester&quot;.

Location Based on the campus of Warwick University, on the outskirts of Coventry, the Warwick Arts Centre offers a cheerier option to the drab multiplexes that can be found in their usual haunts of the city centre and out-of-town business parks. Building  The building has recently had an update adding neon lights and a new open space to the rear. The inside offers a lot of glass, white walls and high ceilings to give it a modern, contemporary feel. However, this coupled with breeze block walls can come across as a little cold and sterile, and reminiscent of a school sports hall. There are a few seating areas (with sofas), which are ideal if meeting up with people or waiting for a screening, but these are often taken up by students with laptops who are tellingly trying to get away from the distraction of their halls during exam time. Clientele Being smack bang in the middle of a university campus means that a lot of the attendees are students. However, no need to fear them as they are normally well behaved.

Children are not forgotten, with the latest and seasonal (ie Christmas) films being shown earlier in the day at weekends. Each film is normally shown over two or three days, so if you do miss a screening you can often catch the film again.     'A lot of the attendees are students' ...  Warwick Arts Centre.  Photograph: Norman Walton    Further comments If you want to make a night of it, the arts centre does boast its own restaurant Gusto, as well as having a cafe (serving great cake) and two bars. Although the screenings are often &quot;dry&quot; it is not uncommon for drinks to be allowed into the cinema. The cinema auditorium is quite modern \u2013 however, it also doubles for lectures, something which is clear by the restricted leg room offered by the seating (if you are tall, you will be uncomfortable). Every two years the arts centre hosts the AyaCon, an event that revolves around Japanese pop culture. I caught its screening of Akira, which was made all the more interesting by members of the audience decked out in their own neo-Tokyo gang outfits. The arts centre is competing with the big chain cinemas and now offers a membership scheme which comes with a number of benefits that include discounted tickets for all events. I&apos;ve always enjoyed the being &quot;guided to your seat with torches&quot; experience, which the arts centre has continued. Polite and knowledgeable staff who offer assistance and recommendations on forthcoming films rounds out an enjoyable viewing experience. The Twitter view \u200f@thefailedcritic  Great collection of venues with a lively atmosphere that benefits from being in the heart of a student campus.  \u200f@scannertemp  Intimate, theatrical and a great stage to rest your feet on if you are in the front row!  \u200f@inmanicputer  Pleasant venue with cafe inside, the theatre itself is small and quiet, much like many a independent venue.  @TomxDoyle  I recall it being somewhat cold but a good selection of movies and friendly staff.  \u200f@el_villano  One of my favourite venues for both film &amp; performance. The setting is ideal \u2013 very 70s (in a good way).   Is there a cinema you love (or hate) that you think our readers should know about?

Four years in the making and topping out at 2,080ft, the giant observation tower and broadcasting mast opened on Tuesday as the world&apos;s second largest structure, with as many as 8,000 tourists expected on its first day. Only Dubai, that other great purveyor of very big things, can boast bigger \u2013 the vast Burj Khalifa tower would peer over the Skytree by almost 700ft, if they stood back to back. The pursuit of the huge is a long-standing tourism obsession. While the Skytree and the Burj have been executed with laudable style, other attempts at large-scale tourist-aimed projects demonstrate that bigger doesn&apos;t always mean better. Here are five reminders: The Ryugyong hotel, North Korea     Photograph: Reuters    Scheduled to be unveiled in time for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989, the Ryugyong hotel in North Korea was to be the tallest hotel on earth, mocking the vertically inferior efforts of the South&apos;s Olympic efforts the year before. There were to be seven restaurants at its 100ft peak, and they would spin in tandem over the Pyongyang skyline. Sadly, its fate mirrored its graph-like profile, rocketing upwards before plummeting into decline. After several delays, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1992 fatally ruptured North Korea&apos;s raw-material supply lines and the hotel remained derelict until 2008, when an Egyptian telecoms company agreed to give it another go. New glass panels have plastered over the holes, but the planned April 2012 deadline for re-unveiling, to coincide with Kim Il-Sung&apos;s 100th birthday, was missed. The Mecca Clock Tower, Saudi Arabia     Photograph: Fayez Nureldine/AFP/Getty Images    Architects have been licking their lips at the prospect of redeveloping visitor-rich, infrastructure-poor Mecca for years. King Abdullah has long sought a dramatic overhaul of the city that welcomes more than 12 million hajj pilgrims each year, and has entertained a series of radical propositions \u2013 from building a high-speed &quot;Pilgrim Express&quot; train line connecting Mecca and Medina to replacing the Ottoman section of the Haram mosque with a multistorey prayer hall. The Mecca Royal Clock Tower is the grandest construction yet, looming over the Haram mosque at a height of 1,900ft, with a five-star hotel, a five-floor shopping mall, two heliports and a conference centre within it&apos;s bulk. Mecca authorities flattened a mountain, and destroyed an Ottoma-era fortress to accommodate its construction, but its appearance has drawn revulsion from locals and critics as an &quot;architectural absurdity&quot; and a &quot;kitsch rendition of Big Ben.&quot; The San Alfonso del Mar swimming pool, Chile     Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    The Humboldt Current, carrying cold water from South America&apos;s antarctic tip along its entire western seaboard, is a serious pain in the arse for Chile&apos;s hoteliers. With more than 4,300km of coast, the northernmost stretches of which are closer to the equator than Rio de Janeiro on the other side of the continent, Chile would be a ripe prospect for mass tourist development if the sea wasn&apos;t so bloody cold. But fear not: in 2006 the San Alfonso del Mar resort unveiled the world&apos;s largest swimming pool containing more than 66m gallons of temperate water stretching over 3,300ft, directly adjacent to the sea. Take that, nature! Green-eyed glances have been cast from hoteliers far and wide, and a new swimming pool arms race has begun \u2013 Sharm el-Sheikh is currently building an even bigger one. Not that Sharm has a warm water problem, of course. But as one of the fastest-proliferating beach resorts in the world, they&apos;ve started to run out of space. The Dubai coastline     Photograph: Jorge Ferrari/EPA    No roundup of tourist-aimed monstrosities would be complete without a nod to the daddy: Dubai. But where to start? Well, there&apos;s the Atlantis Hotel, slated as &quot;an unholy architectural amalgam of Arabian Nights, 1980s TV soap Dynasty and a classic pink Durex&quot;. And then, of course, there&apos;s the quintet of man-made coastal outcrops made from gazillions of tons of sand dredged from the bottom of the Persian Gulf to solve the city&apos;s &quot;beach shortage&quot; \u2013 The World, The Universe and the Palm Islands. The Palm Deira, another in the line of the artificial archipelagos, is currently on hold, but is intended to hold more than a million people, and will be bigger than Paris. Up the road in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World deserves an honorary mention too, as the largest indoor amusement park on earth with an enormous red dome pinned by a giant Ferrari logo. If you pull it up on Google Earth and squint, it looks a bit like a bikini bottom. Valle de la Prehistoria, Cuba     Photograph: Alamy    Cuba&apos;s Valle de la Prehistoria, built in the 1980s and sprawling across 11 hectares of national park on the outskirts of Santiago, must have seemed a very good idea at the time. The park intended to faithfully recreate the prehistoric period \u2013 liberally sprinkled with 227 vast concrete imaginings of fearsome dinosaurs and snarling cavemen. Sadly, dinosaurs as imagined in 1980 don&apos;t date particularly well and, in a post Jurassic Park world, look like long-forgotten grubby toys plonked in the middle of a field surrounded by man-made water features. The T-Rex resembles a barely updated version of the 1954 Godzilla, and a 30ft neanderthal cracking a rock with a homemade axe (why?) looks remarkably like a beefed-up Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. There&apos;s a political metaphor in there somewhere, I&apos;m sure of it. So, those casting jealous upward stares at the Skytree: take heed. Weigh up your resources, re-check the budget, and try to ensure your megastructure won&apos;t be out of date as soon as the last brick is laid. And if all else fails, nature-built attractions can bring in the tourist bucks, too. Few things can match the endless tapestry of the Great Barrier Reef, the spectral beauty of the aurora of northern Scandinavia, or the monumental scale of the Grand Canyon. Especially since they built that glass-bottomed horseshoe thing to hover over it, as part of a 9,000 acre redevelopment project, including a 6,000sqft visitor centre and restaurant.

Then there were weeks on the run, in which the fugitive eluded capture and at times appeared to taunt his pursuers with carefree frolics in the sea. But now, Japan&apos;s most-wanted escapee is back behind bars. More than two months after it slipped out of an aquarium in Tokyo, Japan&apos;s fugitive penguin is back in captivity following its capture in the capital on Thursday night. Two keepers picked up the Humboldt penguin after receiving reports that it had been seen swimming in a river earlier the same day day. The capture ended 82 days of freedom, during which it briefly achieved celebrity status around the world. The keepers, who seized the penguin after it ventured on to the riverbank, said the animal did not appear to have been harmed and had been eating enough to keep its weight stable. Officials at the sea park had feared that the animal \u2013 known simply as Penguin 337 \u2013 would struggle to survive outside the aquarium&apos;s confines. But their fears proved unfounded after it was filmed swimming in Tokyo Bay, apparently content in its unfamiliar surroundings. The park&apos;s deputy director, Kazuhiro Sakamoto, said at the time that the penguin &quot;looks like it&apos;s been living quite happily in the middle of Tokyo Bay&quot;. An angler who regularly fishes in the area believed that the 60cm penguin was taking advantage of the ample food supply in such a large stretch of water. &quot;For a penguin, its eat all you want,&quot; he said. The aquarium has received 30 confirmed sightings since the penguin disappeared in early March, as well as hundreds of speculative sightings from as far away as western Japan. Keepers were dispatched on daily searches throughout the Tokyo Bay area. The penguin is thought to have been startled into jumping over a rock twice its height before slipping through a gap in a 2 metre fence surrounding Tokyo Sea Life Park. It was captured more than 5 miles away. After realising that the penguin \u2013 one of 135 at the park \u2013 had vanished, officials launched a citywide appeal to help find it. It was spotted near estuaries feeding Tokyo Bay, and at one point eluded capture after being pursued by the Japanese coastguard. Sadly, the national obsession with choosing nicknames for celebrity animals foundered on the penguin&apos;s age \u2013 at one-year-old it is still too young to determine whether it&apos;s male or female. &quot;We are relieved to see the penguin come back alive,&quot; Sakamoto told the Kyodo news agency."}, {"sentences": ["What we learned this week How great your street photography is How a War Room and a phallic wooden screw are shedding new light on 1960s spirit That the Tokyo Skytree became a record breaker Why we should be more worried about the future of Italian art than parmesan production The logistics of moving some of Britain&apos;s most gigantic sculptures into a tiny gallery Lastly Have you seen the Guardian Art and Design Flickr page?"], "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "Exhibitions", "Painting", "Art", "Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio", "Jacob Zuma"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-25T12:00:17Z", "title": "Doris Salcedo, Caravaggio and Jacob Zuma exposed \u2013 the week in art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/25/doris-salcedo-jacob-zuma-week-art", "article": "Exhibition of the week: Doris Salcedo You can still see the traces of it if you look down at the concrete floor of Tate Modern&apos;s Turbine Hall.

If he is not fit for this French Open, it does not show. Ivan Lendl, who roamed these parts like a lion in his playing pomp, returns to take up his coaching duties on Sunday and, in his absence, the Australian &quot;Killer&quot; Cahill, still sprightly at 47, was happy to provide target practice for Murray as he tested back muscles that seem to have worried Boris Becker more than the man himself. Maybe one day the Scot will conquer Paris, although 2012 does not immediately appear to be his year for a variety of reasons. His form has flitted this year between the heroics of his marathon semi-final against Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open, as well as a nice interim high of revenge against the Serb in Dubai, all the way down to withdrawing from the Madrid tournament and tumbling out of Rome to Richard Gasquet in the third round. At least his problematic back seems to be holding up to the rigours of the crushed brick, not to mention the scrutiny of one critic whose penchant for straight-talking has led him before to wonder about Murray&apos;s chances of ever winning a major. It has the makings of a feud neither probably wants: former player and striving pro. This is far from the easiest of the grand slam events to win and Becker \u2013 who got as far as the semi-finals three times \u2013 saw fit this week to advise Murray to forget about trying to win a trophy he reckoned was physically beyond him at the moment. To prevail in seven rally-long matches against such men as Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer over two weeks on a surface that drains the muscles of oxygen and the mind of resolve, Murray needs to be at his absolute best. It is difficult to say that is so on the available evidence \u2013 although there can be no questioning Murray&apos;s mood. His smile was as bright as the afternoon sun during his workouton Friday. At the end he belted balls towards a smattering of fans gathered in the stadium and posed with others before retreating into the haven of cool in the locker room. Later he emerged to talk about why he might still defy the odds here. &quot;I have been here close to a week now, had some good practice and feel good,&quot; he said. Murray normally comes to Paris as soon as he can after Rome but said this was the earliest he had arrived to prepare for the second major of the year. Part of the attraction is the city itself, which provided a cornucopia of highs and lows last year, when he turned an ankle in the early rounds, broke a tooth on a baguette, got lost on the Metro, then went out in the semi-finals in straight sets to Nadal. &quot;As I have got older I&apos;ve learned to appreciate it more,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a very nice place for us to come to. I find the site very different to a lot of the other slams. It&apos;s pretty compact. There&apos;s obviously a lot to do [in Paris]. I stay pretty much on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, so it&apos;s always busy, with nice restaurants and cinemas, and stuff to do.&quot; Those distractions provide a calm backdrop to the serious business ahead of him in a season of familiar highs and lows. This year he eases into the tournament against Tatsuma Ito of Japan, on Monday at the earliest. &quot;I played him in doubles last year in Tokyo,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I have seen his game before and have hit against him. He&apos;s quite a flat hitter, pretty good ball striker. But I haven&apos;t seen him play loads.&quot; He will then \u2013 and only then, according to the superstitious mantra of the game \u2013 contemplate a match against either Jarkko Nieminen or Igor Andreev, with the draw opening up to provide opposition from either Bernard Tomic or Alexandr Dolgopolov, followed by, in all likelihood, the combative Spaniard David Ferrer. If he comes through those trials, it should be another semi-final against Nadal, unless all form is irrelevant. Life on the circuit must sometimes feel like a recurring examination with the same questions posed every time. Does Murray have the answers? He thinks so. And he is not intimidated by Nadal&apos;s record in Paris, with six titles from seven visits and everyone expecting him to pull clear of Bjorn Borg&apos;s tally over the next fortnight. &quot;There are some great records in tennis. That&apos;s one of them. The fact that he started at such a young age as well is what&apos;s most impressive. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll win the event a few more times before he finishes.&quot; As for Djokovic seeking to become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major titles simultaneously, Murray is similarly unfazed. &quot;It would be up there,&quot; he said. &quot;If he was able to do it \u2013 which I hope he&apos;s not \u2013 it would be an unbelievable effort.&quot; That is the enduring reality of Murray&apos;s task: living with legends."}, {"sentences": ["Womb in Tokyo is a massive dark room with minimal lighting and a huge sound system \u2013 it feels like a cocoon."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-25T21:59:25Z", "title": "Weekender: Smokin Jo, 45, DJ", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/may/25/smokin-jo-dj-weekender", "article": "I&apos;ve been a DJ for 21 years.

Back in the 1950s it was a typical mining village, a very small and warm community. There were no particular sporting facilities, just a rugby pitch and a football pitch. Most of my childhood was spent outdoors with my mates, roaming the Bwlch mountain. There were two mines within a mile of my home. My father left for work at 5.30 every morning, walked the mile to the Wyndham, then go underground, and walk the best part of it back again. He would end up working underneath the house he had left an hour earlier. I think it was the ambition of most of the mothers in the village to make sure their sons didn&apos;t end up following in their fathers&apos; footsteps. There was a big emphasis on making sure you passed the 11-plus exam. I loved rugby and football, although they wouldn&apos;t let a football anywhere near the grounds of Ogmore grammar school. We only did athletics on one day of the year, on sports day. We&apos;d wander up to The Planker, the local playing field, where there was a very rough and ready long-jump pit, which the council used to fill with two tons of sand each May. I jumped about 21ft on very raw natural ability, so my sports teacher, Royden Thomas, said: &quot;We&apos;ll have to enter you in the Glamorgan schools athletic championship.&quot; That was at Maindy stadium in Cardiff. It was a very big step up for me and on the day I was competing, Ron Pickering was there. He had just been appointed the national athletics coach for Wales, and he told me I could be a very good athlete if I started training properly. If I hadn&apos;t met Ron that day, I doubt very much I would have become an athlete at all. He was such an inspiring figure, he convinced me it was the right way to go, even if it meant giving up playing rugby and football. I was chosen to run the 100 yards, the 100-yard relay and the long jump in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. I went there thrilled to be selected but with no real expectation. My aim in the long jump was to get to the final and maybe get on to the podium if things went my way. On the day the weather was atrocious \u2013 wind, rain, very cold, not at all conducive to events like the long jump. Who knows, perhaps my upbringing in Nant-y-Moel and the wilds of the Bwlch mountain helped me through to win the gold medal? The family home was in Commercial Street, where my mother had a draper&apos;s shop. When I got back after Tokyo, the council had painted two red lines 26ft 5in apart on the pavement outside my house. It was quite funny watching people from the window trying to beat the jump. I don&apos;t know if the lines are still there. I no longer have any family ties in Nant-y-Moel, and I&apos;ll have already run my leg of the torch relay in Cardiff by the time it reaches the village. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, the land was scarred by decades of mining. But these days, looking through what we call the keyhole at the top of the Bwlch, it is a beautiful sight."}, {"sentences": ["His latest, Like\u00a0Someone in Love, takes a cab ride through Tokyo."], "tags": ["Abbas Kiarostami", "Film", "Culture", "Cannes 2012", "Iran"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-28T17:32:06Z", "title": "Cannes 2012: Abbas Kiarostami: 'The world is my workshop'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/28/cannes-abbas-kiarostami-interview", "article": "It&apos;s hard to spot Abbas Kiarostami amid the gloom of\u00a0the Cannes beachfront pavilion. There he is, behind the curtain, still as a millpond, his clothes dark and his glasses darker. &quot;I am not a creature of the red carpet,&quot; he explains, lest there be any doubt of that. Today he could pass for a fugitive from justice or a supergrass on witness protection, set to dish the dirt from his base in the shadows. Once, not so long ago, Kiarostami was the de facto leader of the Iranian new wave, the creator of soulful, enigmatic human stories rooted in his\u00a0home soil. Now the movement is defunct and the 71-year-old director in\u00a0effect stateless, flushed from his habitat by the Ahmadinejad regime and forced to film in foreign climes. The shoot for 2010&apos;s Certified Copy, about a British writer and a French antiques dealer whose relationship is transformed in the course of a day, tootled back and forth across the hill towns of Tuscany, with Juliette Binoche riding shotgun. His latest, Like\u00a0Someone in Love, takes a cab ride through Tokyo. Kiarostami opted for Japan because it felt far away, neither Muslim nor western; a fresh adventure with no baggage attached. &quot;Maybe sushi has something to do with it, as well.&quot; A Cheshire cat smile beams out from the murk. &quot;I do like eating sushi.&quot; Kiarostami comes to Cannes as a cherished old master, a former Palme d&apos;Or winner for Taste of Cherry, his 1997 film about a man looking for someone to bury him after his suicide. But when Like Someone in Love has its\u00a0premiere, it seems to misfire. Kiarostami&apos;s film is about the games we play and the roles we adopt. Akiko (Rin Takanashi) is a sociology student who funds her studies by working as an escort. Tadashi Okuno is the elderly professor who books her for the night, Ryo Kase the boyfriend who mistakes Akiko&apos;s client for her grandfather. Here\u00a0is a tale that&apos;s as much about withholding information as providing it. Kiarostami teases his public with a\u00a0perfect charade of eavesdropped conversations and unseen protagonists before bowing out with a crash-cut ending that leaves us dangling. The audience is dismayed and early reviews veer between the irked and the exasperated. It was only days after, once the dust had settled, that people start coming around to Like Someone in Love. Kiarostami shrugs. &quot;Happily, I can choose my viewers,&quot; he says. &quot;And I&apos;d rather not have the exasperated among them. Cinema seats make people lazy.\u00a0They expect to be given all the information. But for me, question marks are the punctuation of life. When it comes to showing human beings, complexity and concealment are a crucial part of the character. If I\u00a0show more than my character shows, it\u00a0doesn&apos;t make sense. And if the spectator doesn&apos;t accept that, there&apos;s not much I can do.&quot; And why all the surprise? Kiarostami&apos;s early films hardly ran scared of elusive meanings and hanging endings. The Wind Will Carry Us, from 1999, contained a milking scene that the Iranian censors agonised over for weeks, wondering whether it was a sexual metaphor. Through the Olive Trees, five years previously, had wrapped up with a proposal of\u00a0marriage and a subsequent conversation conducted in the distance, out of earshot. Taste of Cherry even ended by\u00a0breaking the fourth wall, showing Kiarostami shooting the film we&apos;d just been watching. If anything has changed, it&apos;s the setting and emphasis. Kiarostami&apos;s non-Iranian pictures seem overtly concerned with notions of fakery, with lies that become true. I&apos;m guessing this must reflect the director&apos;s own experience as a stranger in strange lands. Is he making a bonus of\u00a0his life in exile? &quot;Well maybe,&quot; he says. &quot;On an unconscious level. But the stories in my mind are still in Farsi. And the characters, as I\u00a0see them, have no nationality, no specific language; they are just my alter\u00a0egos.&quot; He chuckles. &quot;But the unconscious level is\u00a0called that for a reason. So you may well be correct.&quot; When most of his colleagues fled Iran in the wake of the 1979 revolution, Kiarostami stayed put, shooting his acclaimed neo-realist fables about rural life and human mysteries, and picking up prizes from the world at large. Now conditions have grown too tough, so he keeps a house in Tehran and shoots abroad. &quot;The world is my workshop,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not my home.&quot; When I\u00a0ask if he feared it would be a struggle adapting to other territories, he responds with an analogy: &quot;I have a friend who&apos;s a doctor. He worked in Iran and now he&apos;s in Paris. He does x-rays. Once I told him, &apos;We do the same thing. You take x-rays and I take inner photographs.&apos; In x-rays there is no nationality.&quot; Fair enough. But let&apos;s counter with another analogy. Kiarostami once claimed that you should never uproot a fruit tree. Transfer it to foreign soil and it probably won&apos;t bear fruit. Or, if it does, &quot;the fruit will not be as good as in the original place&quot;. The director smiles. &quot;Yes, but now something&apos;s different. I&apos;m like the tree that&apos;s in my garden back home in Tehran. When I leave my home, there is no one to water it for weeks on end. But the roots are so deep, they don&apos;t need to be watered. I&apos;m the same way. Leaving Iran would be very worrying for a younger artist. But I&apos;m not making films about now. I&apos;m making films about older times, bringing them up from deep in the\u00a0ground.&quot; Other film-makers have not been so\u00a0fortunate. Take Jafar Panahi, Kiarostami&apos;s friend and one-time protege, now under house arrest in Tehran after being convicted of making &quot;propaganda against the system&quot;. Slapped with a 20-year ban on making movies, Panahi recently collaborated on a quasi-documentary about his life in captivity, entitled This Is Not a Film. It\u00a0was smuggled out of Iran on a USB stick concealed in a cake. Kiarostami will not be drawn on the matter, perhaps wary that any ardent expressions of support risk landing Panahi in further hot water. &quot;People find their own ways. I have no advice for anyone on how to live. He chooses his own path.&quot; The director adds that he has yet to see This Is Not a Film, for the simple reason that it is not a film. &quot;[Panahi] invited me to see it. And I\u00a0said, &apos;If this is not a film, then I don&apos;t have to go. I will come with pleasure the day you make a film.&apos;&quot; What of Kiarostami himself? Ideally, he concedes, he would return to making pictures in Iran. &quot;I do hope I\u00a0can go back, because I have plenty of stories particular to Tehran that really cannot be made anywhere else. Of course, it is natural for me to work directly in Farsi, with an Iranian crew. And it is natural for me to tell stories in\u00a0my country.&quot; He gives a shrug from his place in the shadows. &quot;For the moment, that&apos;s not possible. But the only moment when my heart beats faster is when the\u00a0plane is landing back home in\u00a0Tehran.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Kan said he had feared further meltdowns that could result in the evacuation of Tokyo \u2013 a metropolitan area of more than 30 million people.", "Kan said he had decided to talk to the plant&apos;s manager, Masao Yoshida, directly because officials in Tokyo had provided only sketchy information."], "tags": ["Japan", "Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "World news", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T07:13:01Z", "title": "Fukushima inquiry: I felt helpless, says former PM", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/fukushima-inquiry-naoto-kan", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister at the height of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis has admitted he often felt &quot;helpless&quot; during the early days of the disaster, adding that the facility&apos;s triple meltdown had brought the country close to &quot;national collapse&quot;. Speaking at a parliamentary inquiry into the handling of the incident on Monday, Naoto Kan urged Japan to abandon nuclear power, as the industry attempts to bring closed reactors back into operation. Kan, who resigned last September amid criticism of his handling of the crisis, has become one of Japan&apos;s most vocal opponents of nuclear power. His successor, Yoshihiko Noda, has argued in favour of restarting reactors deemed safe to avoid electricity shortages this summer. In comments that were among the most eagerly awaited in the six-month public enquiry, Kan said inadequate explanations from nuclear officials drafted in to brief him on the situation at the plant had only increased his sense of fear. He reserved his harshest criticism for officials from the nuclear and industrial safety agency, the country&apos;s main regulatory body. &quot;I was frightened and felt helpless,&quot; he told the panel, set up after a previous government investigation was criticised as timid. &quot;You can&apos;t expect a nuclear expert to be prime minister or a cabinet minister, so we need top regulatory officials to provide expertise and help us. We didn&apos;t have those people.&quot; He pointed to fundamental weaknesses in Japan&apos;s readiness to deal with a disaster as serious as the 14-metre tsunami that caused three of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s reactors to go into meltdown. A law to improve the country&apos;s ability to address a nuclear disaster introduced after a fatal accident at a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura in 1999 was found wanting, he said. &quot;Everything anticipated in the law was inadequate, and we had to endure all kinds of trouble that we could have done without,&quot; he said. Assessments of the aftermath of Fukushima tell a story of confusion at the site, and a lack of communication between Tepco, safety officials and the government. The accident has fuelled criticism of the &quot;nuclear village&quot; \u2013 regulators, utilities, bureaucrats and pro-nuclear scientists \u2013 who, Kan said, were again working together to restart reactors despite local concerns over safety. Long-awaited reform of the safety agency has been held up by opposition parties, which have demanded that the new body be given more independence from the nuclear agency. Kan denounced close ties between power companies and their regulators as &quot;the root of the illness&quot; whose symptoms became most apparent during the Fukushima crisis. But he added: &quot;The nuclear accident was caused by a nuclear plant that operated as national policy, so I believe the biggest portion of blame lies with the state.&quot; His testimony shed light on the disarray at the heart of the small group of officials tasked with leading Japan&apos;s emergency response, but it failed to resolve accusations that Kan&apos;s actions in the immediate aftermath had worsened the situation. He said Tepco and the nuclear safety agency had hidden key details from him in the days after 11 March, adding that he had been as open as possible with the public based on the information he had been given. Kan said he had feared further meltdowns that could result in the evacuation of Tokyo \u2013 a metropolitan area of more than 30 million people. Deserting the capital, he added, would have brought the government to a standstill and led to &quot;a collapse of the nation&apos;s ability to function&quot;. He defended his demand that Tepco officials remain on duty after being told that the firm planned to evacuate its staff from the plant. The company has claimed that it never intended to abandon the facility, but would have retained a core of engineers to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Kan also defended his hastily arranged visit to the plant the day after the tsunami, dismissing accusations that his presence hindered the operation to prevent catastrophic meltdown during its most critical phase. Kan said he had decided to talk to the plant&apos;s manager, Masao Yoshida, directly because officials in Tokyo had provided only sketchy information. He disputed Tepco&apos;s claims that he had ordered the utility to stop injecting seawater into the stricken reactors to keep them cool. Yoshida, who took early retirement last year after being diagnosed with cancer, ignored the order and has been credited with preventing an even worse accident. Kan&apos;s opposition to nuclear power has not weakened since his resignation. Citing the risk of a &quot;national collapse&quot; from a similar accident in future, he said the Fukushima crisis had convinced him that &quot;the best way to make nuclear power plants safe is not to depend on them, but not to have them at all&quot;. Noda, meanwhile, is expected to decide soon whether to order the restart of two reactors in Oi, western Japan, amid fears of a power shortfall during the height of the summer."}, {"sentences": ["To swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing.&quot; The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power, estimates that 18,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials flowed into the Pacific after the accident, either in the form of fallout, or through mixing with water that leaked from the facility."], "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Fishing", "Marine life", "Wildlife", "Food", "Oceans", "Environment", "California", "US news", "World news", "Science", "Nuclear power", "Fukushima", "Fish"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T09:59:44Z", "title": "Tuna contaminated with Fukushima radiation found in California", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/29/tuna-contaminated-radiation-fukushima-california", "article": "     Bluefin tuna contaminated with radiation believed to be from Fukushima Daiichi turned up off the coast of California just five months after the Japanese nuclear plant suffered meltdown last March, US scientists said. Tiny amounts of caesium-137 and caesium-134 were detected in 15 bluefin caught near San Diego in August last year, according to a study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal. The levels were 10 times higher than those found in tuna in the same area in previous years, but still well below those that the Japanese and US governments consider a risk to health. Japan recently introduced a new safety limit of 100 becquerels per kilogram in food. The timing of the discovery suggests that the fish, a prized but dangerously overfished delicacy in Japan, had carried the radioactive materials across the Pacific ocean faster than those conveyed by wind or water. The researchers, led by Daniel Madigan at Stanford University, said they had found evidence that the fish had been contaminated at &quot;modestly elevated&quot; levels with caesium. The chemical was released into the ocean in the wake of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi on 11 March 2011. Madigan told Reuters: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t tell anyone what&apos;s safe to eat or what&apos;s not safe to eat. It&apos;s become clear that some people feel that any amount of radioactivity, in their minds, is bad and they&apos;d like to avoid it. But compared to what&apos;s there naturally ... and what&apos;s established as safety limits, it&apos;s not a large amount at all.&quot; The fish are thought to have been exposed to radiation for about a month before beginning their journey east across the Pacific. They were found to contain 4 becquerels per kilogram of caesium-134 and 6.3 becquerels per kilogram of caesium-137, the report said. A 2008 study of fish in the area found no evidence of caesium-134, which is produced only by nuclear power plants and weapons, and caesium-137 only at levels that naturally occur in the environment. The results &quot;are unequivocal. Fukushima was the source&quot;, said Ken Buesseler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who played no part in the research. Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, conceded that the findings suggested the monitoring of radiation levels in fish outside Japanese waters may have to be stepped up. The spawning and migratory patterns of bluefin tuna indicate that the issue of contaminated fish will be confined to Pacific coastlines. Bluefin spawn only in the western Pacific, off the coasts of Japan and the Philippines. Some juvenile or adolescent fish migrate east to the coast of California coast and remain there to fatten up. Scientists say they do not believe contamination will linger in large fish capable of swimming farther afield, as they are able to metabolise and excrete radioactive substances. The fish examined in the US study weighed an average of 15 pounds. They had shed some of the radionuclides during their journey but had been unable to flush them out altogether. &quot;We were frankly kind of startled,&quot; said Nicholas Fisher, an expert at Stony Brook University in New York who took part in the study. &quot;That&apos;s a big ocean. To swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing.&quot; The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power, estimates that 18,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials flowed into the Pacific after the accident, either in the form of fallout, or through mixing with water that leaked from the facility. A terabecquerel is equal to 1tn becquerels."}, {"sentences": ["Mark Schilling, writing in the Japan Times, points out that, far from being crass: &quot;This sharpens the film&apos;s comic slant (though Abe and company do not play the Romans as cartoons), as well as underlining its we-are-all-brothers-in-the-bath message.&quot; Lucius is inspired by the Mount Fuji murals in Tokyo bathhouses to paint the similarly graceful curves of Mount Vesuvius on the walls back home."], "tags": ["Film", "Action and adventure", "Comedy", "Culture", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T13:56:02Z", "title": "Thermae Romae: is Japanese film feeling the heat?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/may/29/thermae-romae-japan-cinema", "article": "     Viewed from nine time zones away, Japan&apos;s current No 1 film, Thermae Romae, seems to be yet another example of the scintillating oddities of the like only that country produces. Adapted from Mari Yamazaki&apos;s award-winning manga, it&apos;s about a browbeaten architect in ancient Rome who finds an unexpected source of ideas: his local steam bath conceals a time tunnel that leads to a modern-day Japanese bathhouse. He greets the scrawny patrons as &quot;flat-faced slaves&quot; \u2013 then the film sets out to ask what 21st-century society could ever do for this Roman. Well, fruit-flavoured milk and vibrating tummy toners, for starters. The film looks great. And, propelled by the country&apos;s undying obsession with outsiders, it&apos;s gone like the clappers at the Japanese box office, having become the top-grossing release of the year so far. But beyond the Nippon-curio value, Thermae Romae is just the latest instalment in a millennium-long exchange programme between east and west \u2013 from 14th-century Yuan-dynasty porcelain to Akira Kurosawa&apos;s love affair with John Ford to Hello Kitty. This one is definitely on the kooky end of the scale, with lead actor Hiroshi Abe doing what no western actor could pull off without flashbacks to Mickey Rooney-esque racelifting: he plays Lucius, the fish-out-of-water architect, with a stable of &quot;strong-faced&quot; Japanese actors tackling other Romans, including Emperor Hadrian. Mark Schilling, writing in the Japan Times, points out that, far from being crass: &quot;This sharpens the film&apos;s comic slant (though Abe and company do not play the Romans as cartoons), as well as underlining its we-are-all-brothers-in-the-bath message.&quot; Lucius is inspired by the Mount Fuji murals in Tokyo bathhouses to paint the similarly graceful curves of Mount Vesuvius on the walls back home. But what Thermae Romae \u2013 unlikely to get a release in the UK \u2013 inadvertently shows up is how little cinematic influence Japan has over the west at the moment. All of the talk is of how Chinese money is going to start to exert gravitational pull over Hollywood. It feels like quite a while since Japan had a similar sway on the mainstream fluxus: another release from the last couple of weeks, Sadako 3D \u2013 a comeback for the lank-haired hauntress from Ringu \u2013 reminds us it&apos;s been nearly 10 years since J-horror reconfigured the genre around the world. That surge of chill, ambient terror came to an abrupt end in a wave of cash-in English-language remakes in the mid-noughties. A decade before, it was anime&apos;s radical visual frontier, led by Akira, that drew in westerners. Its influence has arguably been even longer-ranging than J-horror&apos;s, from the shot of adrenalin it gave Hollywood action film-makers such as the Wachowski brothers and Quentin Tarantino, through to the continued presence of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Mizayaki as global ambassadors for Japanese film creativity. But they&apos;re virtually the only ones at that high level now: Takeshi Kitano seems to be a fading force; Hideo Nakata (Ringu; Dark Water) and Takashi Shimizu (The Grudge) have failed, like many Japanese directors before them, to break into Hollywood. Strangely, it&apos;s Takashi Miike (Audition; 13 Assassins), whose output once looked too erratic and idiosyncratic, who seems to have emerged as the live-action Japanese film-maker with the widest following abroad. (And, interestingly, he&apos;s the one who&apos;s kept the most distance from Hollywood.) There are precious few other high-status figures outside of the festival circuit, which is puzzling for a large nation with such a glittering history of stylish mavericks. Japan doesn&apos;t seem that phased by its lack of clout. Inside its borders, it&apos;s getting on perfectly fine: it&apos;s still (just) the second-largest film market in the world, buoyed by the teeming V-cinema circuit. The industry is in a far healthier state in the early 90s, when its own studio system, undermined by VHS and US imports, was teetering on the brink. It produces about 400-plus features a year now, well up from 270 in 1999, putting it third or fourth in the cinema-producing stakes (depending on whether you believe Chinese figures about their film output); it has a decent 54% share of its own box office. No reasons for panic, in other words \u2013 and profits have recovered after last year&apos;s post-tsunami slump. But I miss that injection of Japanese cool, the anticipation that the next big arrival might scramble your cinematic vocabulary. It gave me my first taste of how liberating foreign cinema could be \u2013 precisely because it was often so otherworldly. Weirdly, it was a western film about the country \u2013 Gaspar No\u00e9&apos;s Enter the Void \u2013 that last took me to that place. Perhaps it&apos;s a matter of waiting for the country&apos;s film-makers to recharge their creative energy. Perhaps the east-west influence works in cycles that require both parties to be synchronised in the right places, to give and to accept. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will look at some of the non-American faces who are starting to crop up in globalised blockbusters.

With so many firsts on the line for the men&apos;s top four over the next fortnight, this French Open could easily be billed as the History Boys. Just without the teenage angst, sexual confusion and inappropriate behaviour of a beloved teacher, it should be stressed. For Novak Djokovic, it&apos;s a chance to win his first French Open title, complete a career grand slam and, most significantly, match the feat of Rod Laver 43 years ago by holding all four majors at the same time. For Rafael Nadal, it&apos;s a chance to pull clear of Bjorn Borg and win a record seventh title in Paris, something that would surely cement his position as the greatest player to have graced the red dirt (just don&apos;t mention the blue clay of Madrid). For Roger Federer, it&apos;s a chance to convert his recent good form into a first grand slam success in over two years, and increase his unrivalled major haul to 17. And for Andy Murray \u2013 if he can be mentioned in the same breath as the three ahead of him right now (and it&apos;s a big if) \u2013 of course it&apos;s another chance to claim that first grand slam. Murray&apos;s form on clay this season has been indifferent. While Nadal has three titles to his name, Federer one and Djokovic two final appearances, Murray, with his back aching, has failed to get past the quarter-finals in the three events he&apos;s played. He revealed after his third-round exit in Rome that he&apos;s been struggling with the injury since December, and a look at the task facing him at Roland Garros is unlikely to provide any pain relief. He&apos;s lost every match on clay against the opponents he&apos;s seeded to meet from the quarter-finals to the final - David Ferrer, Nadal and Djokovic - with his combined head-to-head in those matches reading 9-0. Despite Murray&apos;s consistency in grand slams over the last couple of years, it&apos;s hard to see 2012 being his time in Paris. But conversely, with the pressure off, maybe, just maybe, he&apos;ll surprise us all.  First things first. What do we know about Tatsuma Ito? Well, apart from him being the Japanese world No68 and a French Open debutant at the age of 24, not a lot. Can Murray help? &quot;I don&apos;t know that much about him.&quot; Ah. But wait, there&apos;s a bit more. &quot;I played doubles against him last year in Tokyo. He&apos;s quite a flat hitter of the ball but I don&apos;t know him that well. I just need to make sure I&apos;m ready and what&apos;s happened in the last few weeks is not going to make a difference once the tournament starts.&quot;  Meanwhile, Ito claims he will be &quot;rich and famous&quot; back in Japan if he beats Murray, adding: &quot;He&apos;s a great tennis player. I&apos;ll try to do my best, be aggressive on every point. He has a good serve and is difficult to break. It&apos;s exciting for me. I will try 100% and fight hard on every point.&quot;  4.13pm: The players should be out very shortly, by the way, because France&apos;s Julien Benneteau has just completed a slightly convoluted 6-2, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 win over Germany&apos;s Mischa Zverev. Which should give you just enough time to read about Heather Watson&apos;s hugely impressive victory over Elena Vesnina earlier.  4.20pm: Tok, tok, tok, they&apos;re warming up, Murray clad in a grey top with fluorescent orange trim and orange shorts. Meanwhile, ITV4 interviews a rather excitable Japenese journalist, who reckons an upset could be on the cards. She talks very quickly, but the interview goes something like this: &quot;Ito is a very big Japanese boy and he&apos;s very good. His name means &apos;dragon&apos; and he has a famous dragon shot, a strong, heavy forehand. Andy Murray is very popular in Japan too but we want our national player to win.&quot;  First set: Murray 1-0 Ito* (*denotes next server)Murray wins the toss and opts to serve first. Ito is clearly in the mood to attack from the off, but a cross-court forehand goes wide. Another two unforced errors and a Murray winner later, and Murray opens up to love. It&apos;s another scorcher in the French capital today, it&apos;s around 24 degrees, there&apos;s only a slight breeze, so ideal conditions for a bit of tennis.  First set: *Murray 2-0 Ito (*denotes next server)At 15-all, Ito attempts to mix things up by drawing Murray into the net, but it&apos;s not short enough, and Murray swats it away, 15-30. Ito then throws in what could prove to be an expensive double fault, 15-40. Two break points. Murray goes long on the first, and long on the second. A more probing exhange at deuce, and this time it&apos;s Ito&apos;s turn to throw in the error. Advantage Murray.  Ito shanks a forehand so long it almost plops into the River Seine \u2013 and there&apos;s the break.  First set: Murray 3-0 Ito* (*denotes next server)15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game, almost quicker than the umpire can say &quot;Jeu Murray&quot;.  First set: *Murray 4-0 Ito (*denotes next server)This match is being played on Suzanne Lenglen, by the way, the equivalent of Wimbledon&apos;s No1 Court. Meanwhile, over on Philippe Chatrier, Nadal has just laid down a marker, beating Simone Bolelli for the loss of only five games, 6-2, 6-2, 6-1. This could be going the same way: Murray breaks to 15. He&apos;s not having to do too much at the moment: he&apos;s making a lot of balls, and Ito is forcing the issue too much.  First set: Murray 5-0 Ito* (*denotes next server)You can guess how this one goes, right? 15-0, 30-0, 40-0 and \u2013 with the whole court gaping \u2013 Ito somehow flunks a forehand smash into the net. And that&apos;ll be the game. Murray is yet to drop a point on serve. Ito must hold for the first time to stay in the set.  First set: *Murray 5-1 Ito (*denotes next server)And that the Japanese does, despite a crushing return winner down the line from Murray. Ito gets his name on the board by holding to 15. But it&apos;ll take a superhuman effort to prevent Murray from taking the opening set after only 20 minutes.  Murray wins the first set 6-1Ito&apos;s unforced errors have been the story of this set, and a few more \u2013 combined with some slicing and dicing from his opponent \u2013 get Murray to 40-15, two set points. But Murray nets on the first, and then Ito pulls out a brutal backhand winner on the second. Some resistance from the underdog, at last. But Ito can&apos;t sustain it, and on his second advantage, Murray takes the set.  Second set: *Murray 6-1, 1-0 Ito (*denotes next server)No signs that the second set will be any different to the first. 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 \u2013 and courtesy of a cross-court backhand winner \u2013 game. After all of Murray&apos;s troubles in the build-up to this tournament, this is the perfect start for the world No4. And with the back issue clearly a concern at the moment, he&apos;ll want to scamper though this match as quickly as he can.  Second set: Murray 6-1, 2-0 Ito* (*denotes next server)Is there any one out there by the way? Or are you as disinterested in this match as Ito currently appears to be? Murray again holds to love, finishing things off with a forehand winner deep into the corner which flies out of Ito&apos;s grasp.  Second set: *Murray 6-1, 2-1 Ito (*denotes next server)Ito gets on the board in the second set, bamboozling Murray with a body serve at 40-15 to take the game. Nick Mullins, meanwhile, not so helpfully adds on ITV4 that Ito once shaved off all his hair in an attempt to look like his hero, Andre Agassi. I imagine that&apos;s where the similarity started and ended.  Second set: Murray 6-1, 2-2 Ito* (*denotes next server)Things are suddenly getting a bit exciting. First an email \u2013 an email! \u2013 from Sean Matthews: &quot;Come come, we&apos;re disinterested, perhaps, but not lacking in interest, or even uninterested, Ms Murrells. But yes, we&apos;re here (in Kuala Lumpur, as it happens).&quot; And then Murray slips 0-40 down. And there&apos;s the game! Ito breaks for the first time and they&apos;re back on level terms. A very, very sloppy game from Mr Murray, including two double faults. And this from Jenny: &quot;It&apos;s hard to chime in with something when Murray is doing so well \u2013 pessimism comes so much more naturally. Also, I have to go back and attend to my experiment now. Come on Andy! etc etc I expect a win by the time I return.&quot;  Second set: *Murray 6-1, 2-3 Ito (*denotes next server)Jenny has clearly tempted fate, because the dragon suddenly has some fire in his belly. Winner after winner after winner, combined with an unreturned serve at 40-0, and that&apos;s the game. This is by far Ito&apos;s best spell of the match so far. Murray clutches his stomach. It&apos;s really clear at the moment whether it&apos;s anything significant. What is clear is that Ito&apos;s in the zone.  Second set: Murray 6-1, 3-3 Ito* (*denotes next server)A beautiful two-handed backhand from Ito and it&apos;s 0-15. But Murray shows lovely touch at the net to get back to 15-15 \u2013 his first point since the third game of this set. The winners are now flowing from Ito&apos;s racket, but Murray manages to repel the assault, coming through to 30.  Second set: *Murray 6-1, 3-4 Ito (*denotes next server)A venomous forehand from Ito whips the Suzanne Lenglen crowd into a bit of a frenzy, as they chant &quot;Ito, Ito, Ito&quot; rather boisterously. Or drunkenly. And for the second time in succession, he holds without Murray making any inroads at all. Ito skips to his chair, Murray looks a little grumpy. And talking of drunken behaviour: &quot;Sat on a balcony drinking cider,&quot; chirps Laurence Howles. &quot;This match is getting a little more exciting with each sip. I almost want to go inside to watch. Almost. Can&apos;t leave Ms Murrells&apos; coverage though. Wouldn&apos;t feel faithful.&quot;  Second set: Murray 6-1, 4-4 Ito* (*denotes next server)Some big hitting from Ito \u2013 combined with what Jim Courier describes as some &quot;lackadaisical&quot; shot-making from Murray \u2013 and it&apos;s 0-40. Three break points. Ivan Lendl grimaces from the stands. Murray manages to haul himself off the canvas, saving all three, though Ito doesn&apos;t do himself any favours with a few unforced errors. Cue a fist pump from Murray. He thinks he&apos;s taken the game with an ace down the T, but it&apos;s called out. No bother. Ito nets on the next rally and Murray survives.  Second set: *Murray 6-1, 4-5 Ito (*denotes next server)The disappointment of not breaking appears to be weighing on Ito&apos;s mind on the first point, but then he&apos;s straight back to his quick-fire brand of tennis, dispatching a forehand winner and burying a smash. Ito holds, and Murray must now do the same himself to stay in this second set. Meantime, Gary Naylor has a proposal (not of the indecent kind, I should add): &quot;I love the names of the French courts and their environs, don&apos;t you? So evocative of the musketeers, Mlle Lenglen and a raffish French version of Germany&apos;s Weimar Republic, too naughty, too fragile and too much bloody good fun to last. We should name Wimbledon&apos;s courts and stands in a similar vein. Centre Court could be the Roger Federer Arena (with stands named for Fred Perry and Virginia Wade); Court One the Martina Court (with stands named for John McEnroe and for Mr Nastase). Wouldn&apos;t that be lovely?&quot;  Second set: Murray 6-1, 5-5 Ito* (*denotes next server)Murray tries to take the initiative and charges into the net at 15-0 to put away a forehand volley with aplomb. A good tactic considering Ito is coming at him all guns blazing. Much as Ito does on the next point, with a fizzing forehand winner off Murray&apos;s second serve. 30-15. Ito thinks he&apos;s fired off another winner, but it&apos;s called out. 40-15. One of the longest rallies of the match so far, and it&apos;s Murray who blinks first, as he slices into the net. 40-30. But he takes the next point. Back to you, Ito ...  Second set: *Murray 6-1, 6-5 Ito (*denotes next server)Ito hits one of the worst drop shots you&apos;re ever likely to see on a professional tennis court, it almost drops over the service line it&apos;s that bad, and Murray whacks it away. That sets the tone for the game as Murray carves out three break points. But all three go begging, and Murray must do it all again from deuce. And that he does, courtesy of another mistake from Ito. A gift of a break that for Murray. He&apos;ll serve for a two sets to love lead.  Murray wins the second set 7-5Ito has a real opportunity to put the ball away at 15-0, but he slides to Murray&apos;s drop shot awkwardly and nets. 30-0. Seemingly on the back foot, Murray hoiks a wickedly spinning forehand cross-court winner, 40-0. And Murray rattles off the next point to win a set which was far more of a test of his character than the first. And Jenny is back: &quot;Just returned from an inconclusive experiment to see that normality has returned! I&apos;m glad things got exciting in my absence as it&apos;ll cheer up my graph drawing.&quot; Pleased we/Murray can be of help.  Third set: *Murray 6-1, 7-5 1-0 Ito (*denotes next server)From 30-all, Ito slaps a backhand into the net, and Murray gets his first chance of the third set, 30-40. It&apos;s deja vu on the next point as Ito again comes up short on his backhand side. Meanwhile, over on Chatrier, Serena Williams has taken the first set 6-4 against France&apos;s Virginie Razzano. Serena&apos;s been in excellent form on the clay this season, and after all she&apos;s been through over the past few years, it would be a wonderful story if she won another French Open title 10 years after her last.  Third set: Murray 6-1, 7-5 2-0 Ito* (*denotes next server)15-0, 30-0, 40-0, jeu Monsieur Murray.  Third set: *Murray 6-1, 7-5 3-0 Ito (*denotes next server)Murray&apos;s toying with Ito now, and has him scampering all over the shop before calmy dispatching the winner. 0-15. 0-30. 0-40. In the stands, Ito&apos;s coach looks like he&apos;s already thrown in the towel, and perhaps Ito has too, because he chucks in another error. It&apos;s all rather anti-climactic after his resistance in the second set.  Third set: Murray 6-1, 7-5 4-0 Ito* (*denotes next server)It&apos;s one-way traffic now. Murray goes 30-0 ahead, his 11th and 12th successive points I believe, before throwing in his third double fault of the day. No bother, though, he comes through to 15 as Ito balloons a forehand into the tramlines.  Third set: *Murray 6-1, 7-5 5-0 Ito (*denotes next server)Ito is going for broke, attempting shots that he really has no chance of making. That&apos;s 31 unforced errors for the match now. Murray races to 0-40 in the blink of an eye, Ito offers some brief resistance to take the next point, but then knocks himself out with a double fault. Murray will serve for the match. Meanwhile, with only one game probably remaining, Ashish Gujarat chooses to open up a whole can of worms: &quot;Is England the most under-achieving nation in sport? Be it the football World Cup or European Championships, or cricket World Cup or tennis? And I mean developed nation with rich history in each sport.&quot; English? Tsk. Murray will not be pleased with that.  Murray beats Ito 6-1, 7-5, 6-0As the shadows start to creep over Suzanne Lenglen, Murray finishes off the job with relative ease. At 30-15, one of the points of the match, if not the point of the match, as the two face off at the net, exchanging drop shots. Ito prevails. 30-all. But Murray brings up the match point, which he duly takes with a serve out wide that Ito can only prod into the tramlines. &quot;Tatsuma is satsuma&apos;d,&quot; parps commentator Nick Mullins. Murray advances with the minimum of fuss. Despite that lapse in the second set, it was a trouble-free win, and he was largely able to play within himself.  Mark Petchey quickly shoves a microphone in Murray&apos;s face: &quot;It was good. I just played one bad game on my serve, but everything else was pretty good. I&apos;ve got some niggles, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be fine. I&apos;m just trying to stay strong.&quot;  We&apos;ll have a report up on the site shortly from our man in Paris, Kevin Mitchell, while next up for Murray is a second-round match against Jarkko Nieminen on Thursday. The Finn should prove more of a test than the hit-and-miss Ito, but it&apos;s hard to see Murray stumbling against an opponent he&apos;s beaten in all three of their previous meetings. See you then, and thanks for your emails today.

Vince Cable and Ken Clarke are the coalition cabinet&apos;s Dr Chalk and Mr Cheese, a year either side of 70. But they have knocked around a bit and know their own well-stocked minds. A nicer class of witness, then, than Rupert Murdoch, who may be older (81), but not wiser. Of the two bus pass holders, Cable was the only one with some serious explaining to do at the high court in central London. How did he reconcile his private doubts about the Murdoch empire&apos;s bid for outstanding shares in BSkyB with his quasi-judicial duty to decide whether the bid should be referred to the Competition Commission? To be more precise, as Robert Jay QC eventually was at 11.43am, how did he square his lofty settlements of the previous hour&apos;s cross-examination \u2013 discipline, detachment, scrupulous neutrality \u2013 with his bilious &quot;I have declared war on Mr Murdoch&quot; remarks caught by a Daily Telegraph sting operation? In response, the business secretary came up with a rare admission of fallibility. At the time a near-riot of Lib Dem haters in his constituency surgery had only just been subdued by the police. &quot;I was struggling to keep my temper,&quot; he confessed, and he gave quasi-injudicious vent to his violent feelings to the hidden Torygraph mic. You could tell he felt an idiot about it. As a defence it was almost believable. Donnish and measured, Dr Chalk usually speaks as if the Tokyo stock exchange might tumble on a careless word from a Lib Dem. It is easy to imagine the sage of Twickenham saying, &quot;In my private opinion, Mrs Cable, this spaghetti bolognaise is far from your best and I hereby declare war on it. But in my quasi-judicial capacity, I will keep an open mind.&quot; For the ever patient Lord Justice Leveson, staggering into his 11th month of the phone hacking malarkey, reaching a judgment was further complicated by the fact that two Dr Chalks were on display on Thursday. There was the business secretary everyone knows, ascetic and agonising, and the recklessly garrulous chap portrayed in emails to his News Corp bosses by lobbyist Fred (&quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;) Michel, last week&apos;s expansive star witness in court 73. Who were these &quot;people very close to VC&quot;, his economic advisers and other key aides through whom Cable was communicating relentless optimism to Fred about the success of the BSkyB bid? Jay QC rattled off a list of candidates. But Dr Chalk ruled them all out. He was baffled too. What might have persuaded Leveson, had the email been unearthed, was the one in which Fearless Fred reported: &quot;Smoked some good stuff with VC last night before we both went clubbing. Six whiskey and blackcurrants at the Athenaeum, eight pints of Foster&apos;s at the Garrick \u2013 VC can certainly hold his booze! But he still managed a terrific salsa at Annabel&apos;s, on a table, too. Says you should chill out about the bid. It&apos;s a done deal.&quot; Alas, it has not yet been found. Cable let slip that he&apos;d been told he could expect to be worked over by Murdoch titles if he came up with the wrong answers and seemed to suggest that Michel was canvassing the views of Lib Dem peers and MPs so that he could claim the legal process had been &quot;politicised&quot; if things went pear-shaped. Yet again, a shadow fell on the court. The clouds rolled back when the justice secretary \u2013 a minister for 40 years, he kept reminding young Leveson \u2013 took the stand. Cheese to Cable&apos;s Chalk, the rumbustious Clarke looked, as usual, as if he had just fought lunch \u2013 and lost. He was casually rude about pusillanimous politicians, about the press (far too powerful) and those voters who want to lock up ever more criminals (fewer than the Daily Mail thinks, he added), even about judges and magistrates. They pander to redtop bullying as much as do MPs, Clarke breezily explained. He doesn&apos;t do it himself, he added, quite unnecessarily. It was all very good-natured, and ended with what amounted to a seminar in which Leveson exchanged learned views on the pitfalls of media regulation with a veteran fellow barrister who also happened to be his boss, the lord chancellor. Clarke was robust in defending press freedom, albeit with proper regulation that does not bankrupt newspapers or make lawyers rich. The trouble with Mr Cheese&apos;s testimony was that he couldn&apos;t make up his mind whether overbearing press tycoons and pushy reporters had always been an unavoidable problem (&quot;a love-hate relationship&quot;) in politics \u2013 or whether privacy and restraint were the norm in the good old days before New Labour ruined everything. Good Tory that he is, Clarke cheerfully had it both ways, admitting that attempts were made to hack his village bank in distant 1993. Yet in the 1960s, the entire political elite (even he, a Cambridge student) knew that the wife of prime minister Harold Macmillan, Dorothy, had been carrying on with an MP for decades, but no one reported a word of it, explained nostalgic Ken. Being old school, he did not identify the cad as Bob Boothby, whom SuperMac wittily made a life peer as an insult. By prurient modern standards, Macmillan and a third of the cabinet would have had to be fired. Today&apos;s politicians are too frightened. It was great, cavalier stuff \u2013 and answered the question that Leveson didn&apos;t ask: why Ken Clarke was the best recent PM we never had."}, {"sentences": ["It&apos;s a real shame because it&apos;s a really great game made by one of my favourite teams and some of my favourite people over at Valhalla in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "PC", "Wii", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-05-31T06:55:53Z", "title": "Danny Bilson on THQ: his last interview as the company's boss", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/may/31/danny-bilson-thq-interview", "article": "Last week, Danny Bilson, executive vice president of THQ, flew over to London to present a showcase of the company&apos;s current games. He was his usual affable, confident self; he gave a selection of interviews and then tweeted about what a good time he&apos;d had. A week later, he left the company. THQ has certainly had a challenging year. In May, the publisher reported a net loss over the last fiscal year of nearly $240m (\u00a3155m), despite strong sales for some of its titles \u2013 notably Saints Row: The Third. The bad news is becoming something of trend for THQ though \u2013 it has also announced that The Devil&apos;s Third, Valhalla&apos;s third-person fighter, has been dropped, while the forthcoming South Park RPG has been delayed until next year. In spite of this, the company has remained upbeat and declared it has a new focus for the rest of the year. We sat down with Bilson, in what was surely one of his last interviews at the company, to hear about THQ&apos;s strategy moving forward. Here&apos;s what he had to say. What happened to The Devil&apos;s Third?It&apos;s on hold. It&apos;s a real shame because it&apos;s a really great game made by one of my favourite teams and some of my favourite people over at Valhalla in Tokyo. Having to put that on hold and look for investment is part of our business.  It came down to having to reduce our spend. It&apos;s very important to me to make it clear that the issue with The Devil&apos;s Third wasn&apos;t anything to do with the quality of the game. The game is very high quality. I think it&apos;s phenomenal. I want to find a way \u2013 hopefully a partner \u2013 to help us finish it. It being on hold is absolutely a result of where it sits and how its sits in our portfolio in a business sense.  Again, I still have the same passion for that game as I did when we started it. I have even more respect for the team now than I did when they came in with their amazing track record in gaming. I still want to work with them, so this has been a really painful experience for me \u2013 and probably more so for Valhalla \u2013 and it&apos;s something we&apos;re working through right now. What would you say are the main lessons THQ have learned over the last year?The most important lesson is to do less things and do them better. It&apos;s a lesson we learned after Saints Row, which has been tremendously successful for us \u2013 both the packaged goods and the digital content. I think in the past we were trying to do too much without the resources and attention to every single detail. Everything needs to be done unbelievably well.  I think now that we&apos;ve right-sized ourselves to deliver the kind of quality you&apos;re seeing [in new titles such as Darksiders 2, Metro: Last Light and Company Of Heroes 2]. Not that this quality just came about in the last six months. It&apos;s been around for years. Transition became a little more accelerated and violent in the last few months, but where we wound up, is a place we wanted and needed to be: less products, better products and clearer focus.  Your digital products sales have gone up. Is there a new focus on that?Absolutely. But it&apos;s more of a focus on\u2026 we&apos;re making what I call live games now. I personally build everything out from the game itself into what would be great for the gamer. I often say that&apos;s who I work for \u2013 the gamer. You can throw revenue targets at me and I won&apos;t know what to do with them. But if you want to talk about games, and what more we could do with it that would be cool \u2013 then I can engage.  The shipped game in the box is an entry point. It has to have your full value for [the retail price] and not feel like anything was shaved off to exploit the gamer. If the game itself is good enough and if gamers love it they&apos;re going to want to engage with it more in ways that are customisable to their taste. Every game to me, now, is a live game. The first shipment is just the introduction \u2013 a complete introduction \u2013 but we want to keep it alive beyond that point for as long as possible. The only way we&apos;re going to do that is by selling more quality entertainment to people who love it. So looking from the game outward, I think we can do some really cool things. Does your strategy moving forward mean you&apos;re going to be developing less games for casual core gamers? And will you be making less licensed IPs? Absolutely. For years, this has been a long-range plan. I was brought in to develop original IPs when I first came to THQ. You see it today \u2013 Company Of Heroes is THQ-owned, Darksiders is THQ-owned. There&apos;s a Metro book and series of IP in Russia, but it&apos;s not a large license payment for THQ. The license is actually controlled by the studio that makes it. If you make something with a license it has to be something as special as what we&apos;re doing with South Park. We&apos;ll be talking more about that at a later date. Does this focus on current THQ-owned franchises mean that you won&apos;t be developing a lot of new IPs in the near future?No there&apos;s a lot more coming. You haven&apos;t seen inSANE, the Guillermo Del Toro game. There&apos;s one game that&apos;s fully playable right now that the guys at Turtle Rocks Studios \u2013 the guys who built Left 4 Dead \u2013 have made for us that we haven&apos;t even announced yet. That&apos;s a brand new IP right there. There&apos;s\u2026 (laughs) the answers is, yes, there&apos;s more new IP. I&apos;d love to tell you more, but then I&apos;d probably get into some serious trouble.  THQ&apos;s share price is currently sitting at 64c a share and if it doesn&apos;t go up to $1 by June, it&apos;ll be delisted on the Nasdaq. Are you prepared for this? What are you doing to get it back up? And would it be calamitous if THQ was de-listed?First of all, I think that the share price will go back up before that happens. I think that [THQ chief executive] Brian [Farrell] has addressed this publicly. There are a lot of ways to avoid the delisting. I&apos;m sure the board will recommend the best course with that. I don&apos;t se us being delisted and I don&apos;t see a calamity in our future at all. What I see instead, is a very stable year this year and the stuff we have for next year is pretty awesome!  I&apos;m working on 2014 and 2015 at the moment. There&apos;s stuff to sort out \u2013 such as which games are getting sequels and which aren&apos;t \u2013 but overall the portfolio bears no relationship to the current stock price. It doesn&apos;t make much sense based on the games we&apos;re making and selling. Stock price has a lot of factors involved\u2026 a lot of issues.

It has been suggested that Chelsea&apos;s prospective signing owes it all to his likeness to Lou Ferrigno, the bodybuilder/actor who played the Incredible Hulk in the American TV series. Or that the nickname was linked to his time in Japan, when his rippling physique carried the green shirt of Tokyo Verdy. The reality is a little disappointing. The 25-year-old&apos;s father, Djovan, was simply a massive fan of the Ferrigno series and he affectionately bestowed the moniker on his son. And it has stuck. It is pure gold, of course, for the headline writers. When the Porto forward became embroiled in a tunnel brawl against Benfica in December 2009 and was banned for four months by the Portuguese Primeira Liga, he became the &quot;Ineligible Hulk&quot;. The phrase &quot;Don&apos;t make him angry&quot; was virtually demanded in copy. Yet behind the muscles and the superhero schtick is a quiet and humble professional, who has put in the hard yards and the air-miles to stand on the brink of his dream move to Chelsea. The basic fee of \u00a338m has been agreed and his personal terms will not represent an obstacle. Why should they when his relatively modest Porto wage is set to rocket to \u00a3110,000 a week? The final stages of a transfer can be the most excruciating. Hulk just wants to hold the Chelsea shirt and smile for the cameras. His journey from Campina Grande in Brazil has taken in rejection by the biggest clubs in his country, a move to Europe at a youthful age, the machinations of agents who have controlled his economic rights and a trawl around unheralded Japanese clubs. But his career found its touchstone when Porto took him from Tokyo Verdy in 2008 \u2013 they paid \u20ac5.5m to his third-party owners for 50% of his rights \u2013 and he has become arguably the most loved player at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o since Jardel, another Brazilian who knew his way to goal. In his four seasons at the club, he has won three league titles and three Portuguese Cups, together with the Europa League in 2011, which represented the final leg of the treble under Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. The goals have poured in. Over the past two seasons, he scored 57 in 91 appearances. But he has also won hearts with the strength of his personality. After the Europa League triumph, when Villas-Boas was lured away by Chelsea and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid paid \u20ac40m to sign the striker Radamel Falcao, the team threatened to break up. But Hulk, the captain, kept his head down and he helped to keep things together. Porto finished as the champions. His captaincy is not of the tub-thumping, grand oration variety. He leads by example. Hulk had offers to leave last summer but he felt a debt to the Porto president Pinto da Costa, who had dealt sensitively with the great personal tragedy to affect the player. Hulk was shattered when his little niece was left unattended for a fatal moment at a family get-together in August 2010 at the house that he had bought for them in Campina Grande. She fell into the swimming pool and drowned. Hulk was not there but Da Costa told him to return home and take all the time that he needed. Hulk has subsequently celebrated goals with a look up at the heavens. He is all about family, and is extremely close to his sister and brother, the latter of whom could be expected to accompany him to London. Life was tough for Hulk as he grew up and he recalls how his father, who sold meat at the local market, would wake him in the small hours to take him along, even when he was a mere toddler. Upon their return, Hulk would play futsal for the rest of the day. Hulk was spotted by an agent playing for a team in Campina Grande and he was taken for a trial at Corinthians only to be passed over. The agent had a connection at Vilanovense in Portugal and he took Hulk there to begin his youth apprenticeship. At the age of 16, Hulk visited the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o and he declared that, one day, he would play for Porto. Everybody laughed. Vilanovense could not afford to buy out his rights and, back in Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo refused to pay a sum that amounted to \u20ac18,000 for his signature. He was taken to Vitoria, where he made his debut before, after one further appearance, he was whisked to Japan in 2005. He played for Kawasaki Frontale, Consadole Sapporo and Tokyo Verdy, which had to go down as an unusual grounding for a career at the top level in Europe. Hulk took the No12 shirt at Porto, in honour of the fans, the team&apos;s 12th man, and H12 has become a brand name, a little like Cristiano Ronaldo&apos;s CR7. Hulk has a football school in Campina Grande that he called H12 while he has dressed up his sports car with H12 logos. It would be a mistake, though, to construe him as flash or egotistical and he would also be largely exonerated by the Portuguese Football Federation for his red mist in the tunnel against Benfica, when CCTV footage showed him rucking with stewards. They effectively overruled the League&apos;s verdict when they said he had been provoked and should only have been suspended for four matches. The trouble was that when they reached the decision, he had already sat out three months of domestic football. Hulk felt persecuted after the incident and he has had his problems with referees, feeling that they do not offer him protection. Manchester City fans, though, took a dim view of what they saw as play acting from him during the Europa League meeting in February. &quot;You&apos;re not incredible,&quot; they sang to him. Hulk trades on his explosiveness when cutting in from the right, his power and his ability to make the difference in one-on-ones. His arrival at Chelsea would make a difference to Porto&apos;s accounts and it would provide yet another link between the clubs. Chelsea have taken Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira and Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa from Porto for a combined \u00a349.25m, and they paid a total of \u00a318m to secure the release of the managers Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Villas-Boas. Of the current squad, Raul Meireles and Henrique Hil\u00e1rio are also ex-Porto. Porto paid a further \u20ac13.5m last summer to buy another chunk of Hulk&apos;s economic rights \u2013 they now own 85% \u2013 and the remaining 15% will need to be squared before the Premier League signs off the transfer. Porto will simply purchase it and then sell. For Hulk, the excitement is tangible."}, {"sentences": ["A year before the Games, at the world championships in Tokyo, Christie finished fourth in the 100m final behind the double Olympic champion Carl Lewis, Leroy Burrell and Dennis Mitchell."], "tags": ["Athletics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Carl Lewis", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T11:20:25Z", "title": "50 stunning Olympic moments No36: Linford Christie wins gold in 1992 | Rob Bagchi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/linford-christie-barcelona-olympics-1992", "article": "The two pitfalls confronting considerations of Linford Christie\u2019s victory in the 100m at the Barcelona Games in 1992 are cynicism and naivety.

Related: Ten to watch: meet Team GB's sporting superheroes    He has always maintained his innocence of doping and last year insisted in an interview with the Independent on Sunday\u2019s Alan Hubbard that his sample had been contaminated. Yet whether you find his defence plausible or not \u2013 or similar arguments about tainted nutritional supplements a number of high-profile runners that year, including Merlene Ottey, Dieter Baumann, Mark Richardson and Dougie Walker, say they took in ignorance \u2013 it is impossible to overlook two facts: his urine sample was found to contain almost 100 times the legal limit of nandrolone metabolites and that the International Association of Athletics Federations overruled UK Athletics\u2019 not guilty verdict and suspended Christie. Suspicion, once raised, is inextinguishable. And because of what happened at the Seoul Games in 1988 \u2013 when he tested positive for pseudoephedrine after a 200m heat but was allowed to keep his 100m silver medal on an 11-10 vote by the disciplinary committee which gave him the benefit of the doubt that the substance had been unwittingly imbibed when drinking ginseng tea \u2013 his critics\u2019 mistrust will never be assuaged. But for all the conjecture, no one has the proof or right to revoke his Olympic gold nor any of the numerous other medals in European, Commonwealth and World competition. What cannot be denied either is that for anyone who witnessed his performance in Montju\u00efc that glorious August night in 1992, Christie\u2019s triumph truly was a stunning Olympic moment. A year before the Games, at the world championships in Tokyo, Christie finished fourth in the 100m final behind the double Olympic champion Carl Lewis, Leroy Burrell and Dennis Mitchell. Lewis broke the world record in 9.86sec, shaving 0.04 off the benchmark set by Burrell two months earlier and the men in second and third also established new personal bests. Christie\u2019s 9.92 was the fastest ever by a European but he was despondent when interviewed by the BBC\u2019s Brendan Foster after the race, saying that he had reached his peak at the age of 31 and there were no faster times in his ageing legs. Foster had to spend a good two minutes of compelling television persuading the Great Britain team captain why retirement after running his best time would be a profligate folly. Live on air, Foster\u2019s ardent and sympathetic campaigning changed the sprinter\u2019s mind. Since his breakthrough season in 1986, age had always been an issue. The slow starter, as the poet Louis MacNeice observed about himself, \u201ctook his time, and found his time and talent gone\u201d. Precisely that fear, that a lack of discipline and diligence during the early part of his career had fatally undermined his prospects of fulfilling his potential, was the spectre at almost all his feasts. Until 1992 there were at least as many what-ifs as well dones. Christie was brought up by his grandmother Anita in St Andrew, Jamaica, the parish that spreads north, west and east from Kingston up to the Blue Mountains. \u201cMy grandmother was strict and kept me on the straight and narrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Jamaica, before she sent me to the shops, she would spit on the ground and say: \u2018Don\u2019t let it dry before you come back.\u2019 You knew you had to run, even though, like most kids, I wanted to hang out with my friends. So I ran to the shop and back \u2013 it was my first experience of back-to-back training.\u201d At the age of seven he moved to Shepherd\u2019s Bush in west London to join his parents and took up athletics at Henry Compton school in Fulham in his teens. Living on Loftus Road, football was understandably his first love, taking inspiration from the maverick charm of QPR\u2019s Rodney Marsh and the exemplary style and verve of Manchester United\u2019s George Best. It was while playing the game at school that he was spotted and recruited for the athletics team but he did not commit himself to the sport, and even then not all that seriously, until he joined Thames Valley Harriers when he was 19. In 1979 he began to train with Ron Roddan, a silver-haired former sprinter who became his first and only coach, at the West London Stadium which lies in the shadow of Hammersmith hospital and HMP Wormwood Scrubs in Acton, barely a mile north of Christie\u2019s parental home. For years he partied as much as he trained and said that the culture of growing up in a first-generation immigrant West Indian family meant that his focus was elsewhere. \u201cYou helped around the home, you did your schoolwork and then you got a job, that was your priority,\u201d he told the Observer\u2019s Kevin Mitchell. \u201cNo one knew really you could make a career from sport.\u201d He made his contribution to the family as a cashier for the Co-op and later as an Inland Revenue clerk. He raced alongside Kermit Bentham and Mike McFarlane who called him \u201cHorse\u201d because they felt he galloped all over his lane. He got by on talent rather than technique and hard work \u2013 beating better-prepared athletes gave him a thrill. If you have ever had a teacher who trotted out the old line about how they would always take the side of the mediocre-minded who put the effort in rather than the clever but indolent, you can guess how the GB coaches felt about that. Success domestically at the inter-counties and other meets, however, convinced Christie he should be on the relay team for the 1984 Los Angeles Games. He was not picked and when he confronted the coach to ask the reason for his omission, Frank Dick said: \u201cBecause you\u2019re not good enough.\u201d Instead of mollycoddling him with sympathy, Roddan wrote to Christie saying he should knuckle down or walk away. Andy Norman, the former policeman turned promotions director of the British Athletic Federation, also sent him a letter, arguing that a sprinter who had a personal best of 10.5 without giving it his all had the capability of becoming Europe\u2019s best if he dedicated himself to the sport. He wasn\u2019t invited to the elite meetings, said Norman who controlled the purse-strings and much else in the sport, \u201cbecause you couldn\u2019t fill a phone box\u201d but suggested that could quickly be redressed if he changed his attitude. Christie was finally convinced by the arguments and committed himself to gambling all his energies on training. Out went the long afternoons playing dominoes, the rum-and-blackcurrants and the clubbing and partying that kept him out so late he often came home with the milk bottles. \u201cHe made up his mind that he was going to be the best and he did everything necessary to achieve that,\u201d Roddan said in 1993. \u201cA lot of people have said the same thing. But they don\u2019t do the work. Linford is a very receptive athlete.\u201d But was it too late? \u201cI was in a room with these guys from athletics and I said I wanted to be Olympic champion,\u201d he said after his first year of intensive training. \u201cThey all said, at 26, I was already too old. I said: \u2018They say that your sexual peak is at 19, but how many of you guys believe that?\u2019 They all laughed. But they knew I was right, too.\u201d In 1986 he won his first international championship, in the 200m at the European indoors and was runner-up to Ben Johnson in the 100m at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Four years on from his disappointment over Los Angeles, his third-place in the 100m final in Seoul was upgraded to silver behind Carl Lewis after Johnson\u2019s disqualification, and in 1990 he again won Commonwealth as well as European indoor and outdoor titles. As a black man in west London in the 1980s he was the victim of police violence, harassment and abuse when repeatedly stopped while driving through his home borough. On one occasion he was waved to a halt, provocatively questioned and arrested while the Metropolitan police investigated the ownership of a sponsored car he was driving. At court, after the charges were dropped, the police apologised and paid him damages. Despite that, his patriotism never wavered and the first thing he targeted after winning a medal was a union flag to drape around his shoulders on the victory lap. His motivation for gold in Barcelona was, he said, \u201cRoddan and the people\u201d. In general his relationship with the British newspapers was appalling. He felt they were too critical, damning even, while some of the athletics\u2019 press corps felt Christie was uncooperative, arrogantly antagonistic and rude. On the eve of Barcelona he told Hugh McIlvanney how he took strength from bigots\u2019 prejudices against him, his maltreatment by the police and what he perceived to be the hostility of disrespectful writers in memorable terms. \u201cEvery time they shit on my head, I wear a new hat,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the bad stuff has proved my mental strength.\u201d His first team-mates also called him \u201cHorse\u201d because of his long legs and the problems they caused him in picking up his stride. After he began to adopt a higher knee lift in 1985 and generate more power from his hips, he started to resemble his great rival Lewis in style but acknowledged before the Games that he still had to correct the problem that had hindered him. He may have coined that evocative phrase about always going \u201con the B of the Bang\u201d yet he was, in truth, an erratic starter. \u201cI have a habit of going side to side in the first two or three strides and that means vital fractions of seconds are being lost,\u201d he said. \u201cI must go on striving to gear everything so that I am driving straight forward. You must run as economically as possible, get the maximum miles per gallon.\u201d He honed his start during the winter in Australia and must have been heartened in July after a cat and mouse European outdoor season racing against Olapade Adeninken, Frankie Fredericks, Mitchell and Burrell when he heard the news that the defending champion, Lewis, had failed to make the USA team for the 100m at the trials in Louisiana. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn,\u201d said Christie. It proved to be his turn. The unofficial motto for those attempting to qualify for Barcelona, \u201cno pain, no Spain\u201d, seemed apt even after their arrival and the complaints about inadequate facilities, in particular the short beds, were rife. The GB team\u2019s focus was temporarily distracted when Jason Livingston, the reigning European indoor 60m champion, tested positive for the steroid methandienone and was sent home. Christie was said to have counselled his 21-year-old team-mate long into the night after his expulsion and before his own heat and quarter-final. Christie won both, the first after a lumbering start in 10.48, the second in a season equal-best 10.07 which pushed Burrell into second place. In the semi-final Burrell had his revenge, winning in 9.97 with Christie behind him in 10 dead. \u201cI was in control the whole way, whereas Leroy was running really hard,\u201d the GB captain said three years later. At the time, however, despite taking confidence from improving his time with each race, he maintained that Burrell and Mitchell were favourites. Even before he took his place at the start line shortly before 7pm BST on Saturday 1 August, he looked fully focused, lost in a zone of his own concerns. The BBC\u2019s commentary team elaborated on his tunnel vision and in Christie\u2019s case it was literally true. \u201cBarcelona was the first time I went to the blocks imagining my lane was a tunnel, with everything else on either side a blur,\u201d he wrote. The first time they crouched in their blocks, Burrell false-started, the second time Mitchell raised his hand and they were all told to stand up. At last they went off at the third attempt, Fredericks powering marginally ahead in the first 20m but Christie\u2019s opening strides were smooth and true. At 50m he edged ahead, pumping his arms and knees, his eyes fixed straight ahead, unblinking on the line and confident that his second-phase surge was the strongest in the field, and he knew he had won. He crossed it in 9.96, raised his arms to form a Y and smiled briefly before skipping towards the crowd. He took his customary lap with the union flag and received his medal with a lump in his throat but says he was too scared to cry in case the pictures were endlessly replayed and used to mock him. Six weeks before the Games he said his only aim was \u201cto get from one end of the track to the other as fast as possible for Queen and country\u201d. He was certainly cheered home by the latter to win, as David Coleman put it, \u201cthe greatest prize in sport\u201d. \u201cWhen I began to wind down, I felt mentally exhausted,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cIt may be 10 seconds but that had been 10 years to me. Mentally, physically and spiritually, it\u2019s tough because of the need to dig in, concentrate, avoid mistakes and get everything right. For those 10 seconds you are putting everything you\u2019ve got in your body into running 100m. People say 100m is not that far. They should try running it. It\u2019s a long, long way.\u201d However many more twists and turns that long journey still had to go, the abiding memory of that night is Britain\u2019s pride in its singular sprinter and his stunning Olympic moment. What the Observer said Hugh McIlvanney 2 August, 1992 Linford Christie turned the Olympic 100 metres final into a graceful slaughter as his long stride almost disdainfully overwhelmed the sprinting power of America and Africa to take the greatest gold medal victory ever achieved by a British athlete. The most satisfying 10 seconds of Christie\u2019s life (9.96 to be precise) did not permit the briefest flicker of serious threat from any of the seven outstanding sprinters from five nations lined up against him. When he had crossed the line a couple of relaxed strides ahead of Namibia\u2019s Frankie Fredericks it was hard to believe how unchallengable his supremacy has been on the way to becoming, at 32, the oldest 100 metres champion in Olympic history. It was, however, easy to accept his declaration that the whole of his athletic career \u2013 and especially the past decade of intense effort in alliance with his coach and trusted friend, Ron Roddan \u2013 had been a rehearsal for 7pm British time (and he was determined that it should be the most British of times) in the Montju\u00efc Stadium last night. \u201cNothing was going to distract me,\u201d he said later, echoing the theme of inviolable concentration he had articulated for me in the rather different surroundings of a rain-swept West London Stadium three weeks before. Now, in Spain, in the biggest test of all, he needed every vestige of the single-mindedness he had honed over long years of international competition and on countless glamorous nights at that simple training ground. First he had to cope with the unsettling effects of a false start but there was consolation in the knowledge that it was precipitated by Leroy Burrell, the former holder of the world record at 100 metres and the betting favourite to win last night. Burrell had beaten Christie in a good semi-final and his 9.97 was the fastest time ever recorded into a headwind, but after ruining one start the American had to be concerned about the risks of disqualification. There may have been a greater element of calculation involved when the second US contender, Dennis Mitchell, suddenly raised a hand after the field had settled down for another attempt at a getaway. Mitchell apparently wanted a few seconds to compose himself and no doubt would have welcomed the bonus of discomfiting one or two others. But if he had Christie in mind, his was a forlorn hope. The captain of the British men\u2019s athletics team had found himself handling far more distressing problems earlier in the week when his former training companion, Jason Livingston, failed a drug test and was packed off home. Christie was determined to lift his team\u2019s morale with a perfect run for the gold medal and once the starter had sent them away at last, that was pretty much what he produced. At 6ft 2\u00bdin and 14 stone, he is beautifully constructed for the job, both lithe and muscular. From the moment he launched himself smoothly from his blocks, avoiding the slightly lurching start that has often slowed him over the first 15 metres, he was in absolute command. Fredericks may have started fractionally better but the difference was minimal and almost immediately it was utterly irrelevant. By halfway, the large British contingent in the crowd could roar confidently and 25 metres short of the line he was plainly out of reach.   Related: Great Britain to send \u2018best-prepared athletics team\u2019 to Rio Olympics    At the finish he was six one-hundredths of a second in front of Fredericks, with Mitchell in third place and Burrell labouring back in fifth. The nearest the great American came to Christie was when they stood in the adjoining lanes, five and six, at the start. Fredericks was obviously a far happier man, having brought distinction to Namibia, a country competing at the Olympics for the first time. But no one was as happy as Christie when he carried an immense union flag on his lap of honour and blew kisses to his supporters. He was born in Jamaica but raised in West London and, in spite of having more than his fair share of racist maltreatment, he is impressively patriotic. Two other British sprinters have won this title but the Americans were absent because of a boycott when Alan Wells of Scotland took it in Moscow 12 years ago and it was in the Chariots of Fire era that Harold Abrahams claimed his gold at the 1924 Games. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to be emotional,\u201d Christie said at his victor\u2019s interview. \u201cI\u2019ve got other races to run. I must concentrate on my next job, the 200 metres. OK, there was no Carl Lewis, no Ben Johnson. It\u2019s a shame Carl wasn\u2019t there but today was my day.\u201d And one that will be remembered in Britain as long as foot-racing remains a sport."}, {"sentences": ["You see, Tokyo&apos;s world-famous Sony corporation, purveyor of Walkmen and PlayStations to all mankind, is going to the dogs."], "tags": ["Sony", "Business", "Technology sector", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T19:00:03Z", "title": "Pass notes No 3,188: Sony", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2012/jun/05/pass-notes-3188-sony", "article": "Age: 66 Appearance: Weary Ah yes, it&apos;s hard work being an all-conquering conglomerated behemoth.

As United&apos;s manager begins his annual summer holiday in the south of France he may reflect that calligraphy derives from the Greek words kallos and graphe. Meaning &quot;beautiful writing&quot;, it is a form of expression intended to address the heart as much as the eyes. Ferguson can only trust that Kagawa is capable of connecting his team&apos;s midfield and attack in similarly bewitching fashion. Although it would be an exaggeration to say that United&apos;s game turned one- or even two-dimensional last season their play undeniably lost some of the gloriously kaleidoscopic positional interchanging seen in the days when Cristiano Ronaldo was in his Old Trafford pomp and advancing age had not forced Paul Scholes to stay quite so deep. Too elusive and subtle a talent to be easily categorised, the fifth Japanese player to try his luck in the Premier League cannot be compartmentalised as either the new Ronaldo or the new Scholes. What the 23-year-old most certainly offers his teams is a refusal to think in straight lines. Blessed with a rare ability to exploit areas of vulnerability among opposition midfields and defences, Kagawa operates intelligently between those lines. Equally comfortable deployed wide on the left or right, centrally or invited to roam free, he has been described as a superior, more insidious and versatile version of Freddie Ljungberg in his Arsenal prime. Since Mario G\u00f6tze&apos;s hip injury partway through last season, Ferguson and his scouts have frequently seen a man invariably fielded wide on the left by Japan fulfil a playmaking role for Dortmund. While such flexibility evidently appeals, reports in Tokyo indicate that Kagawa was offered a brief as the central fulcrum behind Wayne Rooney in a 4-2-3-1 formation when he met United&apos;s manager to finalise his switch from the double Bundesliga\u00a0champions. &quot;Sir Alex Ferguson has done his homework again,&quot; tweeted Jan Aage Fjortoft, the former Middlesbrough and Norway striker, who is a leading pundit in Germany. &quot;Kagawa can be a hit at Manchester United.&quot; If Fjortoft envisages Kagawa providing United&apos;s strikers with a turbo-charged version of the service which a deep-lying Nick Barmby once offered him on Teesside, Rooney may seek to detect shades of his long standing hero, Jari Litmanen, in the new boy. Kagawa is quick, explosively dynamic and well versed in the high-intensity pressing game which brought Borussia Dortmund two titles during his two years in Germany. In reality, not a studied Litmanenesque playmaker but one that arguably appears better suited to English football. His vision, trickery and eye for goal \u2013 he scored 17 times for Dortmund in all competitions last season while creating several more \u2013 promise to bring out the best in not just Rooney but Ashley Young, Antonio Valencia and perhaps even Nani. Not to mention enhancing United&apos;s capacity for opponent confounding positional\u00a0rotation. It helps that an individual with a penchant for breaking up the one and two touch, pass-and-move stuff by sporadically running at massed opponents with the ball at his feet is about more much more than fancy footwork. &quot;I was born in 1989, the Japanese year of the snake,&quot; Kagawa once said. &quot;People born under the snake are very driven, hate failure and don&apos;t mind hardship.&quot; Despite failing to master German, Dortmund&apos;s creative catalyst was frequently praised for his intelligence, warmth and humility and coped well with the serious foot injury which disrupted his first Bundesliga campaign. Such qualities promise to serve him well in a less egalitarian, significantly higher paid, rather more precious, English habitat. Perhaps it helps that the boy from Kobe, whose father worked on the Kinki Nippon Railway, experienced a slow beginning to life as a professional footballer. Having arrived from Cerezo Osaka in J-League 2, his \u00a3294,000 move to Dortmund initially attracted dismissive headlines. Such opinions were swiftly revised when reporters started gushing about a man who played &quot;like an angel&quot; and was fast becoming &quot;the jewel in Borussia&apos;s crown&quot;. With United poised to deposit up to \u00a317m into their coffers few at Dortmund now admit to querying the wisdom of accepting Thomas Kroth&apos;s recommendation to recruit a worryingly slight figure from an unknown Japanese club. Kroth, a retired Dortmund player turned agent, spotted Kagawa at Osaka, signed him up and vowed to create not only a European household name but a world star.

But this week, the country succumbed to an outbreak of election fever focused on what, for many, was by far the most pressing issue of the day. Watched by millions on TV, the victors took to a stage in central Tokyo to deliver tearful acceptance speeches, as analysts offered interpretations of the vote&apos;s wider meaning. But this was not politics as usual. There was no place for greying, middle-aged men in dark suits - the candidates were dozens of teenagers and women in their early 20s, all vying for the title of president of the J-pop phenomenon AKB48. In a contest that has gripped Japan for weeks, Yuko Oshima \u2013 a relatively mature singer at the age of 23 \u2013 emerged as the most popular member of the band, whose sugar-coated refrains have rivalled their Korean counterparts for the affections of Asian pop fans. Japan&apos;s broadcasters spent weeks trailing the vote, culminating in three hours of live coverage from the Nippon Budokan venue in Tokyo on Wednesday night. Images of Oshima, who will lead the group for the next year, were plastered over the following day&apos;s newspapers and generated hours of analysis on daytime TV shows. Even the normally staid broadsheets recognised that her election, with 108,000 votes \u2013 putting her well ahead of her closest rival \u2013 was a significant moment in J-pop history. Likening herself to a flower bud about to come into full bloom, she told her fans: &quot;You have given me water and light. But flowers wither eventually. Please be my sunshine forever.&quot; Oshima and 15 other performers earned enough votes among the 1.4 million cast to guarantee them a place in the lineup for the group&apos;s 27th single, to be released in August. The group&apos;s 90 members appear in rotation depending on their popularity with the public. The marketing brilliance did not end there: the public could only secure votes by buying a copy of the group&apos;s latest single, a Japanese and English track about the joys of summer. Each copy came with a code number enabling consumers to cast their votes online. With the most devout snapping up multiple CDs to boost the prospects of their favourite singer, the single sold a record 1.62m copies in its first week. One fan reportedly spent US$6,700 to secure 2,700 votes in online auctions. Since their debut in 2005, AKB48 have built up a huge following among girls in Japan and, more recently, other parts of Asia, as well as salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands and exchange a few words with their idols. The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, have had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than US$200m in CD and DVD sales last year alone. Members appear in commercials for everything from chocolate to mobile phones, and they were recently enlisted in campaigns to sell Japanese government bonds and prevent teenage suicides. Their performances owe more to a heightened sense of kawaii cuteness than overt sexuality, but AKB48 members courted controversy over a recent confectionary commercial that some conservative commentators deemed inappropriate. But neither that, nor the arrest of one singer&apos;s mother for allegedly having sex with a minor, has slowed the group&apos;s rise to J-pop&apos;s apex. Together, the 48 stable has more than 230 members comprising four main groups and several smaller offshoots. Just as K-pop has outgrown its South Korean roots, sister groups have emerged in Jakarta, Taipei and Shanghai. This week&apos;s election fever has been attributed to discontent with conventional elections, with one expert even drawing an improbable comparison with the Arab spring. Hidetomi Tanaka, a professor at Jobu University, offered a more prosaic explanation. &quot;These girls start from the amateur level with few singing and dancing skills,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;But the thing is they grow up with their fans.&quot; While some heralded the election as a popular challenge to the authority of the AKB48 impresario Yasushi Akimoto, the vote left some fans feeling disillusioned. &quot;It&apos;s supposed to be a general election, but it&apos;s the people with money who determine the result,&quot; a 16-year-old high school pupil told the Asahi Shimbun. &quot;It&apos;s like shareholders who have a bigger say if they invest more.

Boutiques sell everything from frilly frocks to designer jeans, from nappies to organic nibbles, and smart &quot;doggie bags&quot; and buggies or pushchairs to transport them in. Japan has arguably the world&apos;s most pampered pooches. Tiny lapdogs such as miniature dachshunds, poodles and chihuahuas are particularly popular because most people in Tokyo \u2013 one of the most densely populated cities in the world \u2013 live in small apartments. And there&apos;s a growing market in services and treats for pets. The pet industry is estimated to be worth more than \u00a51tn a year (around \u00a38.2bn) and has expanded into gourmet dog food stores, hot spring resorts, yoga classes and restaurants where dogs sit on chairs to eat organic meals. In his one-room flat in a Tokyo suburb, Jiro Akiba feeds treats to his dog Kotaro, a miniature dachshund, weighing only 3.4kg. His name means &quot;first-born son&quot;. &quot;He&apos;s like a first baby for us, so that&apos;s why we decided to call him Kotaro,&quot; says Akiba. &quot;It&apos;s good to have a dog if you don&apos;t have a baby, because it is quite fun to take care of him like a baby.&quot;     Dog nappies on sale in Japan. Photograph: Ruth Evans    Akiba, a cameraman, would have liked children, but his partner (a freelance editor) wants to keep working. &quot;In Japanese society, it&apos;s really hard for women to have a baby and keep a job \u2026 so my girlfriend decided against having a baby, and that&apos;s why we have a dog instead.&quot; Akiba says he thinks this makes economic sense, given the cost of living in Tokyo, high taxes and static salaries following two decades of recession. Despite the economic stagnation, people seem happy to spend any spare money on photo sessions, massages and treats for their four-legged &quot;babies&quot;. The average fertility rate is now 1.39 children per woman \u2013 well below the number needed to keep the population stable. Japan has, in effect, a self-imposed one-child policy. Government projections show if current trends continue, today&apos;s population of 128 million will fall to 43 million over the next century. &quot;The most important reason for Japan&apos;s declining birthrate is less sex,&quot; says Dr Kunio Kitamara, director of Japan&apos;s Family Planning Research Centre. His annual surveys indicate that the nation&apos;s libido has been lagging in the last decade. The birthrate has declined, but fewer contraceptives are being used and there are fewer abortions and lower rate of sexually transmitted diseases. &quot;Why?&quot; asks Dr Kitamara: &quot;Less sex!&quot; His research shows that almost half of married couples have sex less than one a month, and &quot;young people dislike sexual intercourse&quot;. His latest data from 2010 showed that 32% of young men dislike sex because &quot;they are afraid of failure and rejection by women.&quot; Sixty percent of women in their mid- to late 20s are single, and 70% of unmarried women don&apos;t have a boyfriend. In Japan marriage is still more or less a prerequisite for having children \u2013 only 2% of children are born outside wedlock. One young man we spoke to had dressed his dog up in a white hoodie and jeans, shoes and sunglasses because, he said, he wanted his dog to look &quot;cute, cool and tough&quot;. His proud owner said he hoped his dog&apos;s look might attract young women, but so far he hadn&apos;t met anyone to share his life with. &quot;I wish I could meet someone like that,&quot; he said. Economic stagnation has hit young men particularly hard. More than 10 million people aged between 20 and 34 still live with their parents. They can&apos;t afford to get married and start a family, but for the odd luxury or treats for their dogs, they can \u2013 and do \u2013 splash out.     Designer clothes for dogs. Photograph: Ruth Evans    Smart buggies and designer doggie bags are essential for any self-respecting dog like Kotaro. &quot;My dog really hates to go out with his feet,&quot; says Akiba. &quot;Kotaro doesn&apos;t like walking at all.&quot; For dogs in urgent need of exercise after a lifetime being pushed or carried around, there are spas and onsens (hot springs), which look identical to the ones for humans. For $100 (\u00a365) a session, an attendant in a wetsuit will give Kotaro one-to-one swimming lessons, relaxing bubble baths, body massages using aromatherapy oils, deep-pore cleansing and mud packs, and even flossing or manicure services. Many dogs are &quot;regulars&quot; who come at least once a week \u2013 running up annual bills of $5,000 (\u00a33,200) or more. In Tokyo, it is easier for Horikoshi to find a canine daycare centre for Tinkerbell and Ginger than it would be to find a nursery place for a child. If Akiba and his partner decide to go on holiday, they can pay $100 a night to leave Kotaro in a dog hotel. When the unthinkable happens, there are even temples where dead dogs are laid to rest with full Buddhist rites: a deluxe funeral and cremation ceremony can cost $8,000 (\u00a35,000) or more. &quot;I find these days people grieve more for their pets than for parents or grandparents,&quot; says a monk at a 1,000-year-old temple in a Tokyo suburb. &quot;It is because pets are just like their child, so it is like losing a child.&quot; Japan&apos;s population fell by a record number last year and in the wake of the earthquake and nuclear disasters, the National Institute of Population Research is expecting there to be a further decline in births this year, says deputy director Ryuichi Kaneko. &quot;We realised that we are living in dangerous times,&quot; he says. &quot;Many young people are even more hesitant to have children now.&quot; Akiba says that although the government has tried to encourage young couples to have babies, many of the incentives, such as child benefit, are too inconsistent and subject to frequent political change. Japan&apos;s population has the longest life expectancy in the world, which \u2013 coupled with the falling birth rate \u2013 means a pensions timebomb looms. &quot;We all \u2013 companies, the government, people young and old - need to think seriously about this problem,&quot; says Kaneko, &quot;or Japan will have a very hard time.&quot; One thing is certain: everything Japan has tried so far \u2013 introducing maternity leave, increasing child beneft, providing nursery places \u2013 has failed to arrest its demographic decline. Fresh thinking will be needed to persuade more Japanese people that in the long-term, man&apos;s best friend can be no substitute for man himself. \u2022 It&apos;s a Dog&apos;s Life is on BBC World Service on Saturday 9 June at 12.05pm BST."}, {"sentences": ["She began piano tuition at two and was educated at a specialist music school as her family shuttled between New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Installation", "Art", "Art and design", "Cultural Olympiad", "Culture", "The Beatles", "John Lennon", "UK news", "US news", "Occupy movement", "Protest", "World news", "Yoko Ono"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-08T15:40:20Z", "title": "The Guardian profile: Yoko Ono", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/jun/08/yoko-ono-retrospective-serpentine-conceptual", "article": "The most famous thing anyone ever said about Yoko Ono was, inevitably, said by John Lennon, and for years it held true. He called her &quot;the world&apos;s most famous unknown artist, everyone knows her name, but no one knows what she actually does&quot;. As the artist, musician, film-maker and peace activist nears 80, that could be changing. After decades demonised as the witch who destroyed the Beatles she is emerging from the shadow of that complicated personal history. Since a groundbreaking exhibition in New York in 2001 re-established her reputation, she has come back into focus as a significant artist, winning the accolade of the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the 2009 Venice Biennale. New generations of artists have discovered her as an inspirational figure. Basement Jaxx, Flaming Lips and Lady Gaga have collaborated with her in recent years. Younger visual artists as different as Jeff Koons, Pipilotti Rist and Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster cite her as an influence; the photographer and film-maker Sam Taylor-Wood even jokingly calls herself an &quot;obsessed fan&quot;. This summer the artist \u2013 a tiny figure, usually to be seen wearing trademark sunglasses and hat \u2013 will be the focus of a retrospective at the Serpentine Gallery in London. According to Julia Peyton-Jones, co-director of the gallery, it is her prescience as an artist that makes her an intriguing figure for today. &quot;As her relationship with the Beatles fades into the past her own reputation is crystallising. What is so extraordinary is that her work chimes with the times we live in now. Her activism is immensely relevant for today, in the age of Occupy.&quot; Alexandra Munroe, senior curator of Asian art at the Guggenheim, organised the 2001 exhibition at New York&apos;s Japan Society. She says Ono&apos;s importance is only just being fully appreciated &quot;after 40 years of her being dismissed \u2013 either as a Japanese artist, or a woman artist&quot;. She adds: &quot;What makes her so slippery is that she is so wide-ranging. She is a musician and a poet, a peace activist and a performance artist, a maker of objects and a conceptual artist \u2013\u00a0and married to John Lennon.&quot; The sheer breadth of her output, says Munroe, has taxed curatorial and critical skills. But, she says, Ono&apos;s originality cannot be underestimated, even though it has often been unrecognised. &quot;She was the first artist, in 1964, to put language on the wall of the gallery and invite the viewer to complete the work. She was the first artist to cede authorial authority to the viewer in this way, making her work interactive and experimental. That was the radical move of art in the 1960s.&quot; Ono&apos;s energy remains undimmed and she continues to make new work and harness new technology. Her Twitter followers number 2.3 million. Recent works include her Imagine Peace tower (2007), a column of laser-light on an island near Reykjavik, and My Mummy Was Beautiful (2004), an image of breasts and vagina that was exhibited on posters around the city of Liverpool, causing controversy in some quarters. She was born in 1933 into a wealthy Japanese family firmly ensconced in the ruling classes; her father was a banker. She began piano tuition at two and was educated at a specialist music school as her family shuttled between New York and Tokyo. War brought unfamiliar deprivations to the aristocratic family. In 1945 she took charge of her siblings, at the age of 12, when they were evacuated to the countryside after the capital&apos;s fire bombing. They struggled to eat. Her father was imprisoned in a Saigon concentration camp. After the war Ono completed her education, becoming the first woman accepted to read philosophy at Gakushuin University. The family moved to New York, where she studied at Sarah Lawrence College, and, in 1956, she married the composer Toshi Ichiyanagi. By this time Ono was discovering a downtown scene of musicians, composers and artists, with John Cage and La Monte Young key figures. After the collapse of her relationship with Ichiyanagi she married the American producer and art promoter Anthony Cox, and they had a daughter, Kyoko. By the early 1960s Ono was working on the periphery of the neo-Dadaist Fluxus group, organising performances and happenings in her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca. A key work was her book Grapefruit, first published in 1964, which has artworks framed as sets of instructions, or &quot;event scores&quot;; as such it is an important early example of conceptual art. (One example, entitled Painting to Exist Only When It&apos;s Copied Or Photographed, runs: &quot;Let people copy or photograph your paintings. Destroy the originals.&quot;) Another significant work of this period was Cut Piece, a performance work in which Ono invited the audience to take scissors and snip away her clothes as she sat, silent and still. The critic Michael Bracewell notes: &quot;It is amazing how well that piece has lasted. When you see film of the piece done originally, she seems so vulnerable as a young woman, especially a young Asian woman. There are extraordinary undertones \u2013 submissiveness, the idea of the geisha. Enacted, it becomes incredibly tense.&quot; Bracewell saw the piece when it was re-done in Paris in 2003. &quot;The piece had automatically updated itself. It had become a piece about celebrity. The place was crammed to the gills, a couple of rows full of gilded young people, and absolutely no security. There she was, this elegant woman in her 70s and anyone could approach her with a bloody great pair of scissors.&quot; For Munroe, Cut Piece was &quot;absolutely revolutionary. &quot;The idea that the artist&apos;s body in time and space is itself a work of art was totally radical.&quot; In 1966 Ono held a show at the Indica Gallery, London. John Dunbar was the gallery&apos;s director. &quot;I introduced John and Yoko,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I was a friend of John and Paul, and suggested they come in; I thought John would enjoy it. Yoko had never heard of John. I had to explain that he was a rich person who might buy something \u2026 It wasn&apos;t immediately clear that anything was going to happen. She is a strong woman. John had never met anyone like her.&quot; After two years they got together. But the corollary was that Cox, after a custody battle for Kyoko that Ono won, effectively kidnapped the child, and Ono did not see her at all between the ages of eight and 31. Ono&apos;s union with Lennon of course represents the pivotal moment in her life. According to Bracewell an immediate effect was her artistic influence on Lennon \u2013 which also served to damage her, since she was &quot;regarded as the demon face of the avant-garde and, particularly in Britain, what she did was largely seen as unintelligible&quot;. Sean, Lennon and Ono&apos;s son, was born in 1975, five years before his father was gunned down on the street outside the Dakota Building in New York . Ono still lives there with her superb collection of art that includes Magrittes and Warhols. And mother and son have \u00a0collaborated on music projects in recent years. An often expressed doubt surrounding Ono is that the peace-and-love mantra she expresses through her art and through her activism can look like a relic of a lost time, a statement stuck in the era of the 1960s. For example, her Wish Tree, which she has instigated in various locations and will appear outside the Serpentine this summer, is a tree on which members of the public are invited to attach labels on which they have scribbled their wishes. Bracewell, who believes Ono has suffered from &quot;a sexist and racist response to her from people who regarded her as a giggling, inscrutable Japanese woman who had stolen one of our national treasures&quot;, argues that to regard such works as childish is unfair. &quot;Why would we have a problem with Yoko doing peace and love when we are quite happy for the Beatles to sing All You Need Is Love?&quot; he says. Perhaps Ono has, in the end, more right than most to tackle hatred and violence in her own way. She experienced war in Japan firsthand; her husband was shot down; her life was clearly soured by hatred directed at her from some Beatles fans. It is her resilience in the face of disaster that, for the musician Antony Hegarty \u2013\u00a0who has collaborated with her on performances \u2013 makes her a personal as well as an artistic model. &quot;She has \u00a0shown me, by her power of example, how to stand by one&apos;s values, even in the face of fear,&quot; he says. &quot;She \u00a0has endured brutal storms and never surrendered.&quot; Munroe agrees. The peace-and-love message, she says, is authentic. &quot;She really believes in love as the transformative energy in the world. That&apos;s her faith.&quot; Potted profile Born 13 February 1933 Age 79 Career Ono has worked in the avant garde of the art world since the 1950s, her practice taking in music, film, poetry and performance \u2013 including her two famous week-long &quot;bed-ins&quot; with her husband John Lennon, a twist on the sit-in.

His new novel, Catching the Sun, tells the story of a family who leave &quot;broken Britain&quot; for a seemingly idyllic life on the island of Phuket, Thailand. Your books have tended to be set in London. What was the inspiration for Catching the Sun? When I was 10, the age my daughter is now, my family were going to move to Australia. We were going to be &quot;Ten Pound Poms&quot;. It wasn&apos;t a vague dream \u2013 we&apos;d been down to Australia House, all the paperwork had been filled in, we were going to get the boat, six weeks or whatever it was to Sydney. Then a week before we were supposed to leave, my mum said, &quot;I&apos;ll never see my mum again.&quot; So we didn&apos;t go. Were you disappointed? My father would have loved to have left England. He was a bitter man after the war \u2013 most of his friends, his &quot;mob&quot;, had been killed \u2013 and I&apos;d mentally adjusted to the fact I was going to be a little Aussie. I hadn&apos;t thought about it for years, but I went to the northern coast of Phuket and I started to think: what if a family came to live\u00a0here? You&apos;ve been going to Thailand for 20 years. What is it you like about the country? Two million people go to Phuket each year, but no one goes to the north and I&apos;d never seen anywhere as beautiful as Hat Nai Yang beach, where Catching the Sun is set. And I just fell in love with the gibbons. You see these gibbons in bars and on beaches. Everything&apos;s fine when they&apos;re young but then they go buck wild when they reach sexual maturity and they either want to fight you or fuck you. They&apos;re like someone from\u00a0Essex. Martin Amis has explicitly said that his new novel, Lionel Asbo, State of England, is not a &quot;V-sign&quot; to England. But Catching the Sun is quite damning about modern life in\u00a0Britain. I can understand how my father felt. I don&apos;t feel that \u2013 I&apos;ve been lucky, and a lot of that is because of when I was born. I had a grammar-school education, free milk and a job at the NME when I was 22. But I can see how someone who&apos;s the age I was when I started at the NME would feel betrayed by this country and by the system. They&apos;ve done everything they were told to do, they&apos;ve studied hard, and yet they&apos;re one of the 1 million unemployed between 16 and 24. Are you making a political point? No, it&apos;s just hard for people now who obeyed the rules \u2013 like Tom in Catching in Sun. Because I didn&apos;t obey any of the rules: I threw away my education, I took drugs, I hung out with Iggy Pop. I did everything wrong but somehow my country still conspired to give me a good life. Where did it go wrong? You have to give kids from ordinary families a ladder. You have to show them there&apos;s a way out. If state schools were great in this country, you wouldn&apos;t have Cameron and Clegg at the top of the pile. These are political pygmies, they are absolute nobodies, even though they went to schools where my dog could get five A-levels. Have you thought about leaving Britain\u00a0yourself? My wife is from Japan and we were seriously talking about going there a few years ago. But we were in quite a bad earthquake in Tokyo: we were on the 38th floor of the Conrad hotel looking at the Rainbow suspension bridge to see if it was going to buckle like in a disaster movie. When it was over my wife said, &quot;We&apos;re never living in this bloody country!&quot; So it won&apos;t be in the near future, but I can imagine being 70 in my kimono on a tatami mat, being a venerable old git in Japan.

The arrest last weekend of Naoko Kikuchi brought the 17-year manhunt one step closer to completion, leaving at large just one member of Aum Supreme Truth, the doomsday cult behind Japan&apos;s worst terrorist incident. Police say Kikuchi helped make the sarin nerve gas that killed 13 people and injured 6,000 others. She has admitted involvement in sarin production, but claims she did not know it was a lethal nerve agent. Another cult member, Makoto Hirata, was arrested on New Year&apos;s Eve, and about 200 others have been convicted in the gas attack and dozens of other crimes. The group&apos;s founder, Shoko Asahara, and 12 others are awaiting execution. Emboldened by two high-profile arrests in six months, police say they believe they are closing in on the final suspect: Katsuya Takahashi, 54, who allegedly drove five cult members to the locations from which they launched co-ordinated attacks, using umbrellas with sharpened tips to puncture bags filled with liquid sarin and send the gas coursing through carriages packed with commuters. Thousands of police have flooded the streets of Tokyo to hand out a recent photo of Takahashi after a security camera caught him withdrawing more than 2m yen (\u00a316,000) from a bank in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, where he was thought to be working for a construction firm. It is believed that he is unlikely to move around with as much ease as Kikuchi who, it has emerged, found regular work and a long-term partner, and lived for years in locations only miles from the scene of the gas attacks. The ease with which members who escaped the initial police crackdown were able to evade arrest for so long has raised questions about the police investigation. Detectives reportedly failed to follow up reported sightings of Kikuchi, while Hirata was arrested after initially being turned away from one police station when he tried to hand himself in. The group once had 10,000 members in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. Now, with membership in the hundreds, the cult has renamed itself Aleph and renounced the teachings of its Asahara, but it remains under close police surveillance. In her years as one of Japan&apos;s most wanted people, Kikuchi, now a painfully thin, bespectacled 40-year-old with dyed hair, was able to slip into a relatively free and respectable life with remarkable ease. According to Japanese media reports, she invented a fake identity and found work as a bookkeeper and caregiver at a home for the elderly, for which she also obtained a nationally recognised qualification. Her private life was similarly unremarkable. She had spent the past six years living with Hiroto Takahashi (not related to Katsuya Takahashi) a 41-year-old carpenter who was arrested for allegedly harbouring a criminal. He reportedly recognised her by a telltale mole beneath her right eye, but had not informed police because, as one detective said, he &quot;was in love with her&quot;. Kikuchi moved around frequently and used several aliases before moving with Takahashi to an apartment in Sagamihara, a town 20 miles (30km) south-west of Tokyo, in 2010. She had been coached in the art of stealth by her fellow cult member Katsuya Takahashi, with whom she lived for a decade from 1996. He decided they should take advantage of the anonymity offered by towns and cities, avoid planes and bullet trains, and build up savings that reportedly totalled well over 10m yen by the time they separated. &quot;I had to hide my identity and used an alias all these years while I was on the run,&quot; Kikuchi was quoted as telling police. &quot;Now I&apos;m arrested and I don&apos;t have to do that any more. I feel relieved.&quot; The publicity surrounding Kikuchi&apos;s arrest may, however, have sabotaged Japan&apos;s best chance for years to close another chapter in the Aum saga.

If I&apos;m honest I&apos;ve sometimes feared I was guilty of hyperbole, but as more invitations to travel the world have arisen I&apos;ve become much more certain that we really are leading the way. Of course that&apos;s not to say that other countries aren&apos;t just as passionate for the economic reform and positive social change that social enterprise can bring. In March, I went to Tokyo to celebrate reaching a certain age. I discovered that the rise of Japan&apos;s social enterprise sector was driven by circumstance rather than ideology. After decades of state-led development, the Japanese economy faltered. A reduction of state funded third sector provision and a decrease in corporate philanthropy acted as a catalyst for the growth of Japanese social enterprises. Culturally, businesses in Japan have always had a strong social ethos evidenced by principles such as Nemawashi and a long tradition of collective success against a culture of individual reward. With a strong commitment made by Japanese corporates to society and a culture that upholds long-term shared value, the gap in which social enterprise could thrive was perhaps narrow. But more recently globalisation and an ebbing away of some of these principles has meant that there&apos;s a fightback occurring in which social enterprises are playing a part. From Tokyo to Istanbul, I attended a social enterprise conference with representatives from across Europe. I heard people from the Balkan States speak of communities trapped in poverty desperate to work and develop an economic base from which prosperity may flow. Supported with aid investment, primarily from the US, increasing numbers of agricultural social enterprises are offering flexible employment, particularly to women, and new opportunities for wealth creation and social change. People from Macedonia, Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria were united in recognising that the principles of social enterprise could help the growth and recovery of their nations, developing economic opportunity in a way that would ensure that their communities benefitted. I&apos;ve recently returned from a three-week speaker tour to China and New Zealand, organised by the British Council, which is quietly developing some brilliant programmes around social enterprise behind the scenes \u2013 and genuinely buying into the ethos too. I found the interest in (and appetite for) social enterprise in China varied against the enormous challenges the country faces. The People&apos;s Republic knows that expectations from its population are growing at a faster rate than the state can solve and that its demographic time bomb will need to be tackled quickly. There is every chance that China will become old before it becomes rich enough to provide the necessary health and social care infrastructure that will help avoid civil disquiet. Witnessing what has happened across the developed world, China is not keen on amassing a vast state infrastructure and (most likely) unsustainable provision. It&apos;s equally keen to avoid foreign private sector interests exploiting its welfare markets and rapidly growing wealth. But a number of China&apos;s corporates are interested in creating social value and the Republic&apos;s growing voluntary sector is also eager to develop its own resilience by moving towards social enterprise models. China needs to create such models \u2013 fertile soil to allow the social enterprise movement to really grow. People I met on the tour told me that there&apos;s a fear that its current limited options of state or private models of incorporation do little to protect against corruption and abuse. My arrival in New Zealand created hysteria, or so I thought. As I came out of the airport to a sea of screaming girls, I, for a jet lagged moment, thought I was some kind of social enterprise pin-up. Then I glanced back to see the members of the boy band One Direction walking behind me. Needless to say, while they hung out by the hotel pool, I attended events from dawn &apos;til dusk. While many of Europe&apos;s economic woes are not being felt as sharply in the southern hemisphere, there is a political shift occurring that is very similar to the UK experience. A sharp contraction in the role of the state has left many third sector organisations vulnerable and searching for new ways of generating income. Just like the UK, many traditional charities and community groups are already very entrepreneurial and diversifying their income generation. The people I met in New Zealand see the opportunity of social enterprise as one that provides liberation and independence from the state. Most who I spoke with are keen to build a similar profile and policy framework in which social enterprise can achieve the potential that its sector leaders believe it may have. After my recent travels, I can&apos;t help but think that we&apos;ve got a much bigger and wider responsibility. We have to continue to push social enterprise forward and to open doors, not just for the UK but for our friends across the world. People I met were genuinely impressed by the achievements of the UK&apos;s social enterprise sector and the progress we&apos;ve made in the last 10 years. SEUK will soon be hosting a visit from officials in Thailand, including their deputy prime minister, keen to find out more about social enterprise. We&apos;ll also be sharing our knowledge and learning at the Social Enterprise World Forum in Rio later this year, the largest ever with more than 40 countries attending, which surely goes to show that the movement is developing into a global force to be reckoned with.

So far, so familiar. But Chen Guangcheng is now living freely in the US. Feng Zhenghu remains under house arrest in his third-floor flat in central Shanghai. Since February, the 57-year-old scholar has been barred from leaving his home, except when escorted to the police station for 10-hour interrogations \u2013 as he was on Saturday. At one stage, unable even to shop for food, he resorted to lowering a basket from his window for well-wishers to fill with groceries every few days. &quot;What they have done to me is a breach of the law. It has no legal basis. I am very angry,&quot; said Feng, speaking to the Guardian by telephone. Wang Songlian, of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said: &quot;Maybe people think Chen Guangcheng&apos;s case was unique and that this has been won. Feng Zhenghu and Chen&apos;s cases are both extreme, but they are on a continuum of illegal punishment and detentions for activists that is very, very common in China.&quot; Chen and his family were subjected to an extraordinarily vicious and sustained regime of house arrest. The blind activist&apos;s wife was prevented from leaving home and the couple say they were beaten repeatedly. Even their six-year-old daughter was escorted to and from school by guards. But while Chen was being held in a remote village in eastern Shandong province, Feng is in the centre of arguably China&apos;s most developed city, across the road from a glossy shopping mall. &quot;It is not Shandong province here. It is Shanghai, a metropolis, but such things are still happening,&quot; said Feng. &quot;They know what they are doing is wrong, but they still keep doing it. I can take the pain; this incident is a good education for the public. It is difficult to establish an adequate system of law in China and requires more effort.&quot; Supporters believe the authorities see the parallel with Chen, too. They say officials installed the two rows of metal spikes below Feng&apos;s window, apparently to stop him escaping, shortly after Chen fled to the US embassy. On Thursday, a police car was parked beneath Feng&apos;s window and several men were watching the block. Supporters say up to a dozen guards monitor him day and night. Feng is used to battling officials: in 2009, he made headlines around the world by camping out at Tokyo&apos;s Narita airport when Chinese authorities stopped him returning to his own country eight times. Many compared his case to the film The Terminal. After three months of high-profile protest, he was finally able to re-enter China. But since then he has experienced repeated harassment, including numerous bouts of detention and more than 10 searches of his flat. He believes the official resentment over his protest is partly to blame for his predicament, but says they are also angry that he helped other citizens to protect their rights. &quot;I exposed the unfairness of Chinese administration of justice and that has put pressure on local officials,&quot; he said. Cui Fufang met the activist when he helped her seek compensation over the demolition of her home. Now she is one of several petitioners who regularly gather beneath Feng&apos;s window to show their support. &quot;He helped so many people to get their legal rights. He was helping the country by protecting its dignity,&quot; she said. Police have never formally notified Feng he is under house arrest. An officer at the local station referred queries to the Shanghai police media department, where calls rang unanswered. Wang said: &quot;We do not have conclusive data, but my impression is that [house arrest] has been more favoured by the government since the Olympics. It doesn&apos;t elicit such a reaction from the public as putting people in prison.&quot; Liu Xia, the wife of jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo, has been under house arrest since the announcement that her husbandhad won the Nobel peace prize in October 2010. Grassroots democracy campaigner Yao Lifa has been held for shorter periods many times. Other dissidents and activists are often kept under &quot;soft detention&quot; at sensitive times \u2013 allowed to leave their homes under escort, but not to move freely or receive visitors. &quot;My freedom is not important,&quot; said Feng, from his flat. &quot;Whether China can be a country ruled by law is more important.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo Jungle (Sony, PS3)            Shown off in a shadowy corner of Sony Europe&apos;s demo room, this PSN treat is a bizarre cross between a pet sim and a post-apocalyptic adventure.", "Players choose from a selection of animals, all with their own stats for strength, speed and hunger, before exploring the empty streets of Tokyo, devoid of humans but filled with vicious wildlife."], "tags": ["E3 2012", "Games", "Technology", "PlayStation", "PS3", "Wii", "Xbox", "PC", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-11T13:40:00Z", "title": "E3 2012: our 10 favourite games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jun/11/e3-2012-our-ten-favourite-games", "article": "And suddenly it&apos;s all over. The gigantic circus tent of gaming hubris that is E3 has collapsed in on itself for another year. Hundreds of new titles have been paraded across the stifling showfloor, many of them jammed into mega-stands that will have cost tens of millions to book, build and staff.  So what remains? Well, here are the 10 titles that Gamesblog writers Keith Stuart and Simon Parkin most enjoyed discovering and playing during the three-day extravaganza. This is in no way meant as an all-encompassing &quot;best of E3&quot; collection \u2013 this is the stuff that really stuck out for us, amid dozens of other really great games.  Anyway, have a read and feel free to bring up any titles that particularly caught your eye.  Beyond: Two Souls (Sony, PS3)            David Cage returns with another fraught psychological thriller, this time following a young girl (played brilliantly by Ellen Page) who is shadowed everywhere by a supernatural presence and whose psychic powers bring her into deadly contact with the FBI. The interface looks similar to Heavy Rain&apos;s with onscreen arrows and icons guiding player inputs, but there are also more free control sections, and the story looks to be more cogent and involving. The ability to control ghost character, Aidan, as he floats around the game environment is intriguing too. However, it&apos;s the drama and darkness that engrossed us during the E3 demo, as did Cage&apos;s insinuation that the plot may continue into lead character Jodie Holmes&apos; afterlife\u2026  Dishonored (Bethesda, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            With a world designed by Half Life 2 architect, Victor Antonov, Arkane&apos;s plague-ridden playpen for the imaginatively cruel has a rare visual authenticity and coherence. The systems that fill City 17 are beguiling too, allowing protagonist Corvo to dispense of his targets in myriad ways. It&apos;s another assassin game then, but in its freedom of choice Dishonored seems set to offer a flexible thrill ride, not just in terms of the structured overarching story, but also in the stories of brutality or cowering that blossom in moment-by-moment play. The Last of Us (Sony, PS3)            Everyone knew Naughty Dog&apos;s post-apocalyptic action adventure was going to be bleak, but few were prepared for all the raw, visceral violence. In the E3 demo we see male lead Joel battling with a bunch of other survivors in a broken down hotel. He smashes one in the face with a brick, blows another&apos;s head off with a shotgun and generally pummels and blasts his way to bloody victory. The development team say they want the violence to be horrifying so that players understand the cost, the sheer finality of violence, in this dying world. But amid the action, there is a compelling emotional tale as well \u2013 the relationship between Joel and his young accomplice Ellie could be the most compellingly drawn since Monkey and Trip in the similarly apocalyptic Ninja Theory adventure Enslaved.  Need For Speed: Most Wanted (EA, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            Having already re-invented NFS: Hot Pursuit with considerable panache, Criterion now has its hands on another Need For Speed offshoot. Most Wanted is an open-world driving adventure, in which players compete across seamless racing and freestyle events, racking up XP and sharing their best times, experiences and achievements over a re-built Autolog system. Our lengthy hands-on with the single- and multiplayer modes was thrilling and hilarious in equal measure, with breathtaking crashes, awesome handling and gorgeous city visuals. Criterion has clearly learned a lot from Burnout Paradise and Most Wanted is the massively promising result. NintendoLand (Nintendo, Wii U)            Nintendo&apos;s Wii may have been buoyed by mini game collections in its early days, but the console eventually drowned at their ubiquitous hands. Bold, then, of the Kyoto-based company to lead its creative charge for Wii-U with a slew of snack games designed to show off its new console&apos;s capabilities. But in the hands, NintendoLand dazzles. Admittedly, these five-minute gameplay morsels are ideally suited to consumption on the E3 show floor. Nevertheless, NintendoLand effortlessly presented some of the best game ideas of this year&apos;s show. Project P-100 (Nintendo, Wii U)            Curiously absent from Nintendo&apos;s press briefing, Platinum Games&apos; Wii-U launch title may have a placeholder title, but its gameplay is anything but. Brighter and more accessible that the company&apos;s previous work (Bayonetta, Vanquish) Project P-100 enjoys some of the herding dynamics of Pikmin but combined with exuberant anime cartoon action. Integration with the Wii-U controller was a little clunky, but Project P-100 offers the kind of once common flash of Japanese creativity that we have so sorely missed. Resident Evil 6 (Capcom, PC, PS3, Xbox 360)            Few loved Resident Evil 5 more than the fourth instalment in the long-running survival horror series, creator Shinji Mikami apparently taking more than just his name from the company in his departure. But Capcom has poured resources at this next game, with over 600 staff working to finish the project ahead of its October release date and some its best creative minds working out how to define the genre in 2012. With (at least) three story lines to play through and some fascinating co-op innovation on show at E3, it seems like they are winning the war against the zombies. Sim City (EA, PC)            The original urban sandbox returns with a full visual makeover and an intriguing multiplayer mode which allows friends to build cities in the same region, sharing and competing for resources. The depth and freedom are still there, but Maxis has added enormously to the user-experience, allowing for less rigidly blocked streets (you can now have bendy roads!), as well as providing little stories within the simulation, like criminals scorching into town and robbing banks. There&apos;s also a lovely new method of overlaying data onto the main map, thereby showing elements such as electricity and crime without having to resort to pop-up graphs and tables. Beautiful and exciting in ways only a Sim title could be. Tokyo Jungle (Sony, PS3)            Shown off in a shadowy corner of Sony Europe&apos;s demo room, this PSN treat is a bizarre cross between a pet sim and a post-apocalyptic adventure. Players choose from a selection of animals, all with their own stats for strength, speed and hunger, before exploring the empty streets of Tokyo, devoid of humans but filled with vicious wildlife. The goal is just to survive and procreate, hunting smaller prey, avoiding larger predators and tracking down potential mates. You can also unlock clothing for your chosen beast, so you may end up controlling a kangaroo in hot pants and a motorcycle helmet as it creeps up on a pack of wild Pomoranians. Incredible stuff from Sony Japan and developer, Crispy&apos;s \u2013 and a Western release should follow shortly after the native launch in June. Watch Dogs (Ubisoft, PC, TBC)            Ubisoft&apos;s near-future surveillance adventure was the biggest surprise of E3, coming out of nowhere to dominate every conversation on the packed show floor. Developed at the publisher&apos;s Montreal studio, this dark action thriller follows hacker activist Aiden Pearce as he battles an oppressive government and its corporate lackeys. The defining feature is the ability to hack into facilities and urban infrastructures to complete missions. Enemy getting away in a car? No problem - just hijack the traffic lights and cause a pile up right in front of him. More intricately though, you&apos;re able to access the personal data of every non-player character in the game, discovering their habits and secrets and unlocking a wealth of side-tasks and convert missions. It&apos;s every information voyeur&apos;s fantasy and a neat theme to base a paranoid high-tech action title around. \u2022 Keith Stuart travelled to E3 with EA; Simon Parkin travelled to E3 with Microsoft"}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo has regained the dubious honour of being the world&apos;s most expensive city, where a cup of coffee will set you back \u00a35.25, a newspaper \u00a34 and a litre of milk \u00a32.", "The cheapest city was Karachi, in Pakistan, where the cost of living was a third of that in Tokyo, closely followed by Islamabad."], "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Expat finance", "Renting property", "Japan", "Money", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-11T23:05:00Z", "title": "Tokyo named world's most expensive city", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jun/12/tokyo-world-most-expensive-city", "article": "Tokyo has regained the dubious honour of being the world&apos;s most expensive city, where a cup of coffee will set you back \u00a35.25, a newspaper \u00a34 and a litre of milk \u00a32. The Japanese capital topped the annual cost-of-living survey by the HR consultants Mercer, which ranks cities according to the needs of expatriates. Luanda, in Angola, where more than half the population of 5 million live in poverty and where the Foreign Office advises visitors not to venture out at night, was the second most expensive. British cities have fallen down the list in recent years, reflecting the weakness of sterling against the US dollar. London was the 25th most expensive city, said Mercer, down from 18th last year and behind every large Australian city and many emerging Asian metropolises. Birmingham was 133rd, Aberdeen 144th and Glasgow 161st. Belfast (165th) was the UK&apos;s least expensive major city, ranking cheaper than Warsaw, Budapest and Cairo. The survey takes account of small items of spending, such as a hamburger or a cinema ticket, but is dominated by the cost of renting a luxury two-bedroom apartment of the type favoured by expats. In Luanda, which is experiencing a post-civil war boom fuelled by oil exports to China, an apartment typically cost \u00a34,114 a month, said Mercer, compared with \u00a32,800 in London. In Hong Kong a city-centre apartment cost \u00a34,489 a month to rent. The survey highlights the shift in economic power towards China and the countries that supply it with raw materials. Shanghai was named the 16th most expensive city, moving ahead of London, New York and Paris. Australian cities have leapt fastest up the rankings after a currency surge. Sydney climbed from 14th to 11th, Melbourne from 21st to 15th, Perth from 30th to 19th and Brisbane from 31st to 24th. Last week the Australian airline Qantas issued a surprise profits warning brought on in part by hard-up Europeans cancelling holidays to what has become one of the most expensive destinations in the world. On every indicator counted by Mercer except for the price of petrol, Sydney was more expensive than London. The cheapest city was Karachi, in Pakistan, where the cost of living was a third of that in Tokyo, closely followed by Islamabad. Some US cities are also remarkably cheap: Winston Salem, in North Carolina, was said by Mercer to have the lowest cost of living of any major urban area in the US; Chicago was ranked a lowly 110th overall and Washington DC 107th. The Swiss cities of Geneva and Zurich remain hugely expensive destinations for expats, once again featuring in the top 10. Athens (78th) is still more expensive for an expat to live in than Berlin (106th), which was easily the best value of any major European capital. A coffee will on average cost \u00a33.35 in Berlin and \u00a33.77 in Athens.

What are the instincts with which millions of years of evolution have endowed us? Like our closest relatives the chimps and gorillas, we are primates who live in social groups defined by shared information. Within the group we tend to be friendly, sharing and co-operative. For most of our history there was a sexual division of labour with males doing the hunting while the females did the gathering, an activity that could be done while holding and feeding the babies. The males form a hierarchy which, as the military knows, is the efficient way of organising both the hunting and the defence of the group against others. When faced with these others we tend to be suspicious, even hostile. In modern political terms this all translates into the commitment that we call patriotism, a strong military, a broad hierarchy between the leaders and the led, and keeping the womenfolk at home. Sound familiar? What conservatives are trying to conserve is merely our instinctual ways of doing things. But Guardian readers have sufficient intelligence to overcome these instincts. We get the message of the parable of the Good Samaritan. We would rather talk than fight. We find it obscene that American children go hungry while Mitt Romney installs elevators in the garage of his third house to accommodate all his wife&apos;s Cadillacs. We understand that women can perform most tasks (even military ones) as well as men and that simple justice requires that they not be denied the opportunity. We agree that rape should be a war crime, surely the most obvious and longest delayed legal advance of all time. Simon Jenkins should simply congratulate himself on being a part of this community of decent and intelligent people. Graham Andrews Spokane, Washington, US \u2022 Simon Jenkins writes a fascinating piece regarding the shortfalls of reasoned debate, but what he describes as human intuitions, I\u00a0would refer to as personal values. The limitation of reason or logic is that it is based on a foundation of values, or ego personal to the particular logician. These are so ingrained into the ego that they assume a status of universal truth to the individual, shaping his or her perception of the world and truth itself. Of course, values differ greatly and the resulting tension of conflicting universal truths is the cause of a lot of animosity across the globe. Jenkins would like to persuade those in disagreement with him that his/her logic is wrong, but what that generally leads to is persuading the other that his/her values are wrong \u2013 which would be a rather arrogant position to take (and fruitless too, given the expected and understandable firm rebuff of such an assault on one&apos;s universal truths!). It may be difficult to live with others of differing values, but far more so where there is ignorance about such differences. I would suggest that we have a better chance of avoiding murder and countless wars if more trouble was taken to understand that these value differences exist, what they are and the reasons for them in the first place \u2013 because unbeknownst behind the values are usually quite logical reasons. Martin Dupont Sagamihara, Japan Lockerbie imbalance With reference to the leader comment on the Lockerbie bombing (25\u00a0May), wasn&apos;t this about the same time that a US warship shot down an Iranian commercial aircraft in the Persian Gulf? As I recall, hundreds of pilgrims to Mecca were killed. The US made a formal apology and that was the end of it. We are angry about what is done to us, but not at what we do to others. B Seymour Newcomb, Victoria, Australia Austerity bites Will Hutton&apos;s comment on European unemployment (8 June) is a refreshing wind of common sense. He is right to comment on the folly of employee-biased social legislation. However, here in Spain, that is not an issue as companies do not, in the main, have permanent employees (and haven&apos;t for years) because it is too expensive to get rid of them. Instead the normal practice (even by central government) is to hire people on temporary contracts which can be replaced by further temporary contracts when they expire. It is not unusual for someone to have had the same employer for over 20 years and never to have had a permanent employment contract, and so never to have been a beneficiary of those employee-biased legal provisions. \u00a0 The main problem here, as in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, is that austerity causes the economy to shrink. Someone once observed that those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it and we need look no further back than the 30s to see the great depression which was caused by governments thinking that austerity and book-balancing were the way to economic heaven. Will we have to again wait 10 years before someone realises that spending borrowed money is the only way to restart an economy? Alan Williams-Key Madrid, Spain Immigration money talks For years high-income countries have opened their doors to the &quot;best and the brightest&quot; immigrants while asylum seekers are treated very differently. Australia&apos;s new policy of selling visas to anyone with $5m (Australia lures super-rich immigrants, 1 June) simply exposes more starkly the class-ridden basis of global migration. I wonder (not exclusively but unavoidably in the case of China&apos;s new multimillionaires): is Australia interested in how these super-rich made their money? Whether environmental depredation, labour exploitation or simple corruption lay anywhere in the recent past of such vast capital accumulation, in an era of widening inequalities? And whether those are the sorts of people a country wants to stake its civic future on? Not that all wealthy people have come by their riches in immoral or amoral ways. But there is a large historical legacy of many who have. The\u00a0lure of foreign investment should not blind public policy. Ronald Labont\u00e9 Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Roll out local currencies The return of the Irish punt in Clones (1 June), and examples like the Lewes pound in England, give one clue to how business can survive despite global financial instability. A local currency not backed by a national government, and intended to trade only in a small area, serves the true function of money, to enable the exchange of goods and services. This proposal reinforces the concept of community as an extension of one&apos;s individual ego. Working for the local community produces benefits for oneself that are visible \u2013 but for too many people, working for a company is viewed as being exploited for the sake of profits by distant and faceless shareholders. Reverse the cry, &quot;Look how the government is letting me rot&quot;, to a cry of &quot;I am not going to let anyone rot me&quot;, and this is a surer route for the instinct of self-preservation. People all operated on subsistence economies once. We now have the know-how to see what can be done at the small-scale, local level with greater efficiency than at the global. Valerie Yule Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia Briefly \u2022 A Shortcuts headline reads: Possums aren&apos;t that ridiculous (18 May). More than ridiculous is the ongoing poison regime in New Zealand that dumps toxin 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) from helicopters on to the bush and into waterways to cruelly kill possums, and all breathing mammals and invertebrates. The majority of New Zealanders oppose possum poisoning. Researchers, without a conflict of interest, oppose the dumping of toxins into our wilderness, but vested interests promote them as the easy, cheap fix.

Sam Swain, 22, said he had travelled through countries, such as Iran and China, that were supposed to be hazardous and had met more than a few &quot;unsavoury&quot; characters. But he had not felt that he or his Dawes Super Galaxy touring bicycle were ever at risk. Now he feels angry and disillusioned after the bike was taken as he worked at a Bristol restaurant to save up for his next trip. Swain, who travelled with his father, Mark, said: &quot;We went to all of these countries that are supposed to be really dangerous and met all kinds of unsavoury characters but everyone was so hospitable compared to how they are in this country. &quot;I think people in the UK are simply out for themselves, they don&apos;t care if what they do affects others. It left such a sour feeling about how people in this country are. We were in places like Iran where people are really struggling and they were so much more united. &quot;When we were travelling we used locks but in some places it was so remote you could only attach the bikes to each other. No one ever tried to steal our bikes.&quot; The pair began their 10-month journey on the west coast of Ireland. They cycled through Europe and made it to Tehran in Iran. Officials there refused to grant them visas to carry on so they got on a plane to India and cycled across the subcontinent. They also travelled through Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and China before finishing their journey in Tokyo. Father and son arrived back in the UK last year. Swain was working at an Italian restaurant in Bristol city centre to save for another trip to Poland, which was due to start next month, when the thief struck. &quot;We had no problems throughout the trip. We come back to England and my bike gets stolen,&quot; said Swain. CCTV footage captured a boy of around 13 riding off on the bicycle on 1 June. A woman who was apparently with the youngster left the scene on foot. Swain said he thought there was little chance of getting his bicycle back. An Avon and Somerset police spokesman said they took the theft of bikes seriously. &quot;We would encourage anyone who knows people who steal or handle stolen bikes to get in touch with us,&quot; he said. Swain, who has written a book about the trip with his father, said the bike had great sentimental value. &quot;I used that bike to go around the world and have had so many memories on it.

What has struck him in New Zealand, for example, is how relatively little knowledge All Blacks have of their English counterparts. &quot;One of the most interesting things I learned from people like Adam Thomson and Andrew Hore is that, bar knowing someone like Owen Farrell and what foot he kicks off and what basic pattern we have, they don&apos;t know who they are playing against. If you get your own gameplan sorted and worry about yourself, everything else takes care of himself. Sometimes as a nation we have been a little caught up in talking up opposition too much.&quot; His spell with the Ricoh Black Rams in Japan was equally enlightening. &quot;In Japan you have to look to yourself to rise to the challenge every week. We had a few foreign guys but you couldn&apos;t sit in their pockets. It would have been easy to go: &apos;I&apos;m in Japan, nobody is really looking, I could lie back&apos;, but it made me realise that motivation has to come from me. We were all over Japan \u2013 bullet train here, bullet train there. Sometimes it is difficult sitting in a hotel room thinking: &apos;I literally don&apos;t know what they have just said.&apos; But I knew they expected big things of me. You can easily cut corners in life and I found that isn&apos;t what I am about.&quot; He is also under no illusions he may have to be patient on this trip. England&apos;s midweek opponents, the Southern Barbarians, are not the strongest and even a seat on the Test bench on Saturday will take some earning. &quot;I have 42 caps but I am right at the bottom of the ladder here. They talk in New Zealand about All Blacks having a three-year life expectancy in the shirt. Without Stuart putting it into words it is the same thing here. You are not guaranteed a shirt, you have to fight for it.&quot; England&apos;s second-stringers may even encounter the odd scuffle at GWK Park . &quot;I would imagine that, like most midweek sides, they will be fairly hostile and physical and will be looking to stick one on us,&quot; said England&apos;s assistant coach Simon Hardy. &quot;But we want to regain some momentum on this tour and that comes from winning matches.

The vision of the planners, led by Newham council&apos;s ebullient Labour executive mayor, Sir Robin Wales, is for the Carpenters to make way for a new campus for University College London (UCL), enhancing the life prospects of the neighbourhood and enriching hard-up Newham as a whole. An estate resident, Mary Finch, takes a bleaker line: &quot;I think that the Olympics has lost me my home.&quot; She has lived on the Carpenters for 40 years and is disinclined to depart quietly. &quot;I think they&apos;re gonna have to come in here and drag me out. Why should somebody be able to force you out of your home? A home that&apos;s got nothing wrong with it, that&apos;s standing solid? I do not want to go.&quot; Slow dispersal of the estate&apos;s residents, mostly to alternative dwellings nearby, has been in progress for some time. This has been justified for Wales by the need to embrace a host of development opportunities created not only by the draw of the Games and the park but also, just as importantly, by the economic arteries formed by the improved transport hub at Stratford station. Already, the giant Westfield Stratford City shopping centre has been a hit.&quot;It&apos;s always a balance if you want to do something for an area,&quot; Wales says. &quot;What is the wider community getting at the expense of the inconvenience caused to local residents? People in Carpenters are concerned. I would be too. I completely understand that. But with UCL we would get an amazing, top university coming to the area. Our vision is for science and hi-tech providing jobs and skills. It would be such a good offer from the point of view of our kids.&quot; Finch is not alone in being unenthusiastic. Two younger residents, Joe Alexander and Osita Madu, are driving forces in the campaign group Carp \u2013 Carpenters Against Regeneration Plan \u2013 which has been quarrelling with Wales&apos;s pledges to treat residents properly, bombarding him with questions at public meetings. They reason that the Carpenters works well as a community, so why dismantle it? &quot;We&apos;re not some kind of social ill or blight on the landscape that needs help,&quot; says Maduu. &quot;Somehow Newham council thinks we&apos;re a social problem that needs to be addressed.&quot; &quot;We voted for a mayor and got a dictator,&quot; adds Alexander. It is, in many ways, an archetypal urban regeneration conflict between local authorities on a mission to improve, and those on their patch who fear they only stand to lose. Strife also marked the clearance of the Olympic Park site, when a twilit labyrinth of small industrial concerns was removed from the land on which the array of sports venues now awaits the world&apos;s athletic elite. Among them was H Forman and Son, a family salmon-smoking business founded in east London by a Jewish migrant from Odessa in 1905. The proprietor, Harry Forman&apos;s great-grandson Lance, had his premises where the Olympic stadium now is. He fought a long compensation battle and celebrated victory with an email to the Games organiser Lord Coe, a former Olympic champion whom he&apos;d been due to cross-examine at a public inquiry. The email said: &quot;You can run, but you can&apos;t hide.&quot;           The upshot is a handsome, salmon-pink building on a bank of the river Lea, containing not only a smokery, but also a restaurant and an art gallery in a location long called, with glorious suitability, Fish Island. Olympic dignitaries and others now congregate there. The stadium looms across the water. Forman will soon erect a pop-up corporate hospitality venue on a piece of adjoining land he owns, complete with recreational beach volleyball court. Speedo was the first big name to take space in this Fish Island Riviera, and Forman is finalising discussions with others. &quot;We&apos;re going to have some luxury yachts along the riverfront,&quot; he enthuses. &quot;Sixty palm trees are being shipped in. We&apos;re going to have this beach club that turns into a nightclub.&quot; Forman hopes to emerge a winner from the Games, but says business is still recovering from the disruption caused by compulsory purchase. He hopes to be part of long-term rejuvenation by developing the land his Riviera will briefly occupy, perhaps with a mixture of homes and boutiques, and facilities for the arts community that has flourished in recent years in former warehouses along the towpath in Hackney Wick. Forging links, he invited a graffiti artist to enhance his restaurant&apos;s toilets. In the gents, fine silver fish leap skywards above the urinals. &quot;I think the area was regenerating anyway,&quot; Forman says, looking across at the stadium. &quot;But the existence of the park ought to help. I think when people come here they&apos;re amazed at how impressive it already is and how easy to get to.&quot; London&apos;s outgoing Olympic legacy chief, Margaret Ford, also gives an upbeat assessment of the post-Games future of the 200-hectare park and its immediate surroundings, although she warns that expecting it to be &quot;the catalyst for the regeneration of the whole of east London&quot;, has &quot;never been entirely realistic&quot;. Citing prior experience with renewing England&apos;s coalfield communities, she stressed the need for &quot;continued investment and belief over a long period&quot;. Ford steps down as chair of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) this month, having led it and its predecessor, the Olympic Park Legacy Company, since May 2009. She says the park should be an example of how you &quot;change the psychology&quot; about an area. &quot;You&apos;re hoping that the whole view of investing in east London changes by persuading people that it is a fabulous place to come to and do business and invest.&quot; She accepts that a great fear with large regeneration projects is that the wealth they attract fails to benefit existing residents, many of whom are in pressing need. Canary Wharf, whose glass towers pierce the skyline a short distance away, is often condemned as the ultimate example. &quot;The concern is that the park will become a sort of golden city on a hill surrounded by a sea of poverty,&quot; says John Biggs, a former City analyst and senior Labour member of the London Assembly, who represents three of the six Olympic boroughs \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Newham and Barking and Dagenham. Ford, a Labour peer held in high regard across the political spectrum, says she and her board have been &quot;utterly preoccupied from day one&quot; with ensuring that local people derive the maximum value from the post-Games plans, and with facilitating the Olympic boroughs&apos; goal of economic convergence with the richer west and centre of London. She is proud of creating training and schemes and close links with local schools. &quot;The big game-changers will be jobs and changes in educational attainment and aspiration for a lot of families in east London,&quot; she says. Ford will depart with most of the arrangements made for putting the permanent sporting venues and other attractions to post-Games community use, and with decisions in the pipeline for the three big jigsaw pieces not yet in place: \u2022 The commercial occupants, either a fashion hub or digital &quot;innovation city&quot;, for the two buildings the media will use during the Games. \u2022 The long-running search for tenants for the main stadium, very likely to include a football club. \u2022 The determination of planning applications for the future development of the park as a residential area and visitor destination. Five neighbourhoods will form within the boundaries of the park over the next 20 years, with the first, Chobham Manor, due to be completed at the end of 2014. Ford emphasised the importance of including sufficient genuinely affordable housing. &quot;I think we need to remember there was quite a big promise made to the communities in east London about the houses being affordable \u2013 either affordable to rent or affordable to buy. I think it&apos;s one they are not going to forget.&quot; While pointing out that the LLDC remains committed to 35% of the up to 8,000 homes it plans to see built on the park being affordable \u2013 in addition to 3,000 that the Athletes&apos; Village will be converted into \u2013 she felt it was a matter for regret for London as a whole that the government&apos;s new funding approach means &quot;affordable&quot; rent can now be up to 80% of local market rates, which even in poorer parts of London are high compared with the rest of the country. &quot;I think Londoners are desperately short of affordable housing. It&apos;s definitely short of good-quality social housing [which has far lower rents]. If we mean what we say about needing to house all of our key workers, we need to house lots of people in lower-paid jobs who make this city work then, yes, I would say moving to 80% of market rents will cause some of those people not to be able to afford properties.&quot; Another Olympic borough mayor, Tower Hamlets&apos; independent Lutfur Rahman, who, like Wales, is a member of the LLDC board, has called for more homes for social rent among the 800 housing units proposed for the Olympic Park neighbourhood to be called Sweetwater, which will fall within his boundaries. Ford, who has 33 years&apos; experience of delivering regeneration programmes under both Labour and Conservative governments, is to be replaced by the Conservative politician Daniel Moylan, the appointee of London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, to whom the LLDC is accountable. The selection of Moylan, an experienced councillor in Royal Kensington and Chelsea whom Johnson made his deputy as chair of Transport for London two years ago, has caused some disquiet among political opponents. Biggs says that although he likes the urbane Moylan \u2013 &quot;he&apos;s fun to talk to&quot; \u2013 he worries that he is not equipped to follow someone with Ford&apos;s track record. &quot;The truth is, he doesn&apos;t know anything about regeneration.&quot; There&apos;s an ideological issue too. &quot;The point of bodies like the development corporation is to do the things the market can&apos;t or won&apos;t, and Daniel is the sort of politician who thinks red-in-tooth-and-claw market forces will take care of everything.&quot; Ford, though, says she&apos;s confident Johnson has made a good choice and praises him for allowing her and her chief executive, Andrew Altman, to produce a new masterplan for the park. The one she&apos;d inherited, she says, &quot;pretty much had the place populated by high rise buildings. Why would you stuff it full of flats when it&apos;s an obvious family housing neighbourhood, given the green space and the venues? We didn&apos;t want to create some pastiche of the Old Curiosity Shop, but a place that had squares and crescents and little pocket parks \u2013 the kinds of things that make London quite higgledy piggledy but recognisably London. Boris was hugely encouraging.&quot; She gathered intelligence for the masterplan on &quot;mystery shopping&quot; excursions \u2013 chatting to people in cafes and the old Stratford shopping centre. &quot;They wanted front gardens, back gardens for their kids to play in, really good lighting, lots of storage space, nice green spaces, somewhere they can afford and a decent school \u2013 it&apos;s not bloody rocket science.&quot; When the park begins to reopen for the public next July, its name will change to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Ford believes the royal touch will enhance local attachment: &quot;It&apos;s about creating a different feel about the place. It&apos;s about people having a pride in it.&quot; Even so, while Olympic borough schools gear up for the excitement of the summer, renaming their classes Helsinki, Tokyo and Beijing, parents express a mix of views about the value of the changes underway. Martin Sadler, a resident of Hackney who works in education and lives with his wife and two daughters not far from the park, foresees a good and a bad side. &quot;I think this part of Hackney will start feeling a bit more like central London and less like east London,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve lived here for over 20 years, and it&apos;s always been a traditional East End sort of place \u2013 a real mixture of people, plenty of cheap accommodation. It&apos;s already becoming more affluent, partly because the schools have improved. That brings good things with it, but there are worries too. I think London could be getting more like Paris \u2013 that doughnut effect, with the poorer people having to move out of the centre.&quot; That is not the outcome legacy idealists say they have in mind. Time will tell if they manage to avoid it."}, {"sentences": ["The report, published on the website of the Tokyo-based Dolphin and Whale Action Network, said the Institute of Cetacean Research, a quasi-governmental body that oversees the hunts, had hoped to use sales from the meat to cover the costs of the whaling fleet&apos;s expeditions."], "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Whales", "Marine life", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Cetaceans"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-14T09:19:13Z", "title": "Japan's appetite for whale meat wanes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/14/japan-appetite-whale-meat-wanes", "article": "Japan&apos;s failing appetite for whale meat left three-quarters of meat from whales caught in the north-west Pacific last summer unsold, according to a report. Junko Sakuma, a freelance journalist, said the body responsible for selling meat from Japan&apos;s controversial &quot;scientific&quot; whaling programme had failed to sell 908 tonnes of the 1,211-tonne catch, despite holding 13 public auctions since last October. The report, published on the website of the Tokyo-based Dolphin and Whale Action Network, said the Institute of Cetacean Research, a quasi-governmental body that oversees the hunts, had hoped to use sales from the meat to cover the costs of the whaling fleet&apos;s expeditions. The failure of the auctions to pique consumer interest in meat from minke, Bryde&apos;s and sei whales has forced the institute to revert to private sales through Kyodo Senpaku, the for-profit firm that collects, processes and sells the meat on behalf of the institute. Sakuma said the oversupply of whale meat, despite pockets of demand for the highest quality produce, had made Japan&apos;s lethal research programme unsustainable. The Institute of Cetacean Research blamed low demand on the complicated auction procedure and reluctance among food suppliers to attract criticism from anti-whaling groups such as Sea Shepherd. &quot;We could not achieve the results we had anticipated,&quot; an institute official told Kyodo. Although the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986, Japan is allowed to conduct so-called &quot;scientific&quot; hunts in the north-west Pacific and the Antarctic. The IWC stipulates the meat must be processed and sold on the open market. But campaigns to revive the tradition of eating whale meat \u2013 which was largely confined to a few coastal towns \u2013 have failed to capture the public&apos;s imagination. A 2006 survey by the Nippon Research Centre found that 95% of Japanese people never or rarely eat whale meat. Consumption of whale meat rose after the second world war as it provided a much-needed source of protein. Sakuma&apos;s report will come as another blow to Japan&apos;s beleaguered whaling industry. Campaigners claimed a major victory when the Antarctic whaling fleet returned to port in March with just 30% of its planned catch of more than 900 whales. The fisheries agency blamed the poor catch on bad weather and &quot;sabotage&quot; by Sea Shepherd. Late last year, it was revealed the government used 2.28bn yen (\u00a318.5m) from the 11 March earthquake recovery fund, on top of its existing $6m (\u00a33.87m) annual subsidy, to pay for the most recent Antarctic hunt. The fisheries agency said the use of the fund was justified because one of the towns destroyed by the tsunami was a whaling port. \u2022 This article was ammended on 15 June 2012 to correct the currency conversion"}, {"sentences": ["Airports: that long Christmas day in Panama City: changing planes Tokyo, where she bought the pretty little bottle of &quot;Petite Moon&quot; sake that still sits in our refrigerator."], "tags": ["Books"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-14T12:52:00Z", "title": "Francisco Goldman: forgetting to remember", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/14/francisco-goldman-forgetting-to-remember", "article": "Yesterday morning over breakfast, as I was reading an article in the Sunday Times real estate section about soaring rents in Manhattan, the words &quot;financial district&quot; triggered a memory: the shiny glass and chestnut-hued vestibule of an apartment or condominium tower of the contemporary type. Strips of white tape on glass panes, I recalled that, and a vacant security desk. A brand new building, still unoccupied. Then I was in a small, bare apartment with two ridiculously small rooms and a view out the windows of lower-Manhattan, a glimpse of the harbor. When was I ever in such a building? My mind drew a blank, and then, as we were being shown the workout room, a row of stair-masters and elliptical machines and such, that blankness began to fill and swell with an invisible almost helium-like giddiness, and by the time we were in that lounge that the tenants would be free to use for social gatherings, I remembered. Next we were in an apartment furnished like an office, with platters of cupcakes with orange frosting \u2013 it was autumn \u2013 and coffee thermoses on a table and financial and rental forms stacked on another. We ate cupcakes and tried not to break out in giggles while the realtor finished her pitch. Aura turned everything into comedy. We lived in a very spacious brownstone apartment \u2013 our walk-in closet was larger than the rooms we&apos;d just seen - with generously low rent in a trendy Brooklyn neighborhood, but Aura was always talking about moving; she liked to take me on these &quot;open house&quot; realtor visits to see apartments we would never consider living in. The realtor shared her vision of a building where you didn&apos;t just pay exorbitant rent for a cramped apartment but acquired new friends too, a whole social life: work-out together, party together in the lounge, insider-stock-trading tips from your neighbors in the laundry room, and so on.  Sitting at my breakfast table yesterday, I was grinning ear to ear, grateful for this somewhat synesthetic surprise, the words &quot;financial district&quot; in a newspaper delivering the memory of an apartment vestibule that I, so to speak, walked into, trying to solve a riddle that posed itself in images - empty apartment, gym, cupcakes - until finding the memory of having been there with Aura, probably about two years before her death, in the summer of 2007. After almost five years of mourning, this hardly ever happens anymore, this arrival of a vivid, new memory \u2013 one not collected in the ritualized memory corridors that I&apos;ve been obsessively revisiting over the past five years, tracing and re-tracing my steps. I had totally forgotten about that day when we visited that silly, sterile building in the financial sector, a sort of co-ed frat-house in the sky for young Wall Street-types. Now that memory can join the rest of the collection. A special day, February 12, 2012, when I unexpectedly recovered it.  Brooklyn, Manhattan, Morningside Heights, an immense incessantly curated urban memory palace. Mexico City is another; Mexico, itself. So is Paris. Guatemala, Boston, Austin, Hong Kong, Ucross, Wyoming, California, and \u2013 these memory palaces begin to shrink to dollhouse size, but are all just as obsessively tended \u2013 Portland, Oregon, and Key West, Florida, and Provence, and Barcelona, and Murcia, all the places where Aura and I spent at least a few days during our nearly five years together. Airports: that long Christmas day in Panama City: changing planes Tokyo, where she bought the pretty little bottle of &quot;Petite Moon&quot; sake that still sits in our refrigerator. I have hundreds of photographs but I don&apos;t need to look at them, I have them all memorized. Usually only dreams and nightmares surprise.  But how did I forget Cartagena, Colombia? We spent the week before Christmas there in 2006, that&apos;s where we were flying back from that day we had the long layover in the airport in Panama. I was teaching a workshop there at the Fundaci\u00f3n Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano. Two weeks ago, when I went back to Cartagena for the Hay Festival, I was bewildered to realize that I could remember almost nothing about the week Aura and I spent there. Somehow, in these years of ritualized memory, I had neglected Cartagena. Why? I guess I just forgot. At the FNPI they work you really long hours, from morning to night, so we spent out days apart, though I do recall Aura at least once joining me and my students for lunch. She must have spent at least one day in our hotel room doing me the favor of reading the manuscript of a just completed draft of my book: I remember that, because her suggestions were invaluable to me. But I couldn&apos;t remember what hotel we&apos;d stay in, or even what part of the city it was in. I did remember the beach we went to on December 24, the day after the workshop ended. A Christmas Eve Mass in an old church. But of that week, nothing. I walked the streets of the old Spanish Colonial port city immortalized in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez&apos;s El amor en los tiempos del c\u00f3lera, and found no trace of us. I knew we must have walled on the thick stone ramparts, built in the sixteenth century against pirate attacks, that surround the walled city, but couldn&apos;t remember us doing so. So here was what the dreaded realization of what my five years of memory rehearsals had been meant to stave off. I neglected to protect Cartagena, and now the memories were gone.  One night I was sitting with friends at an outdoor pizza restaurant in a plaza in the old city. It was a beautiful, warm night, the old walls a mellow gold in the lights, similar to the hue of the underside of the leaves in the trees over the plaza, which a gentle breeze stirred. I felt a sensation similar to the one I felt yesterday at breakfast, something invisible slowly filling, a giddiness of expectation, a memory about to be born. Aura and I had been here, the memory was about to arrive, I was sure of it \u2026 But it didn&apos;t arrive.  What is the name for that state of expectation, that something that is invisible yet feels as ripe as a fruit about to drop from a limb, a memory that is not yet a realized visual or aural or even olfactory memory? This is forgetting when it is on the very border of memory, and it is not yet certain which side is stronger. Maybe I had never encountered it so certainly as I did that night in Cartagena. What is that state called? If there is no such word, then I would like to propose one already in use and which already possesses a number of not unrelated definitions. Because it is like an &quot;invisible emanation,&quot; I suppose. &quot;The distinctive atmosphere or quality that seems to surround and be generated by a person, thing, or place&quot; \u2013 that, and &quot;invisible emanation,&quot; are among the OED&apos;s definitions for the word &quot;aura.&quot; People also, of course, speak of &quot;mystical emanations.&quot; In Spanish \u2013 which retains the word&apos;s old Middle English definition - an aura is also &quot;a soft, gentle breeze.&quot; In both languages, aura is also the medical term for &quot;a warning sensation experienced before an attack of epilepsy,&quot; which I imagine could manifest as giddiness in the nerves endings. The dictionary of Spanish Royal Academy also denotes aura as the name of a new world scavenging bird, such as a condor or vulture."}, {"sentences": ["     The last member of the apocalyptic cult behind the worst act of terrorism on Japanese soil has been arrested in Tokyo, 17 years after he allegedly helped other fanatics mount a deadly gas attack on the capital&apos;s subway system.", "Kyodo said the detained man was apprehended in Tokyo&apos;s Ota ward and admitted to investigators that he was Takahashi.", "Police stepped up their pursuit of Takahashi, 54, after he was filmed by security cameras withdrawing more than 2m yen (\u00a320,000) from a bank in Kawasaki, a town south of Tokyo where he is thought to have lived for more than a decade.", "Kikuchi later had a relationship with Hiroto Takahashi (not related to Katsuya Takahashi), with whom she lived for six years until her arrest in Sagamihara, a town 20 miles south-west of Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-15T03:21:50Z", "title": "Aum Supreme Truth: last Tokyo subway attack suspect is arrested", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/15/aum-supreme-subway-suspect-arrested", "article": "     The last member of the apocalyptic cult behind the worst act of terrorism on Japanese soil has been arrested in Tokyo, 17 years after he allegedly helped other fanatics mount a deadly gas attack on the capital&apos;s subway system. Japanese media reports said police were holding Katsuya Takahashi, who allegedly drove five members of Aum Supreme Truth to the locations from which they launched their co-ordinated attack in March 1995. Using umbrellas with sharpened tips, they punctured bags filled with liquid sarin and sent the gas coursing through carriages packed with commuters. Thirteen people died and thousands were injured in the attack. Kyodo said the detained man was apprehended in Tokyo&apos;s Ota ward and admitted to investigators that he was Takahashi. His capture came a few days after police arrested another Aum fugitive, Naoko Kikuchi, who allegedly helped mix the nerve agent. Kikuchi had found regular work and lived with Takahashi for 10 years during her time on the run. She insists she didn&apos;t know what she was producing. Police stepped up their pursuit of Takahashi, 54, after he was filmed by security cameras withdrawing more than 2m yen (\u00a320,000) from a bank in Kawasaki, a town south of Tokyo where he is thought to have lived for more than a decade. Takahashi went into hiding again after learning of Kikuchi&apos;s arrest on 3 June; when police raided his room at a dormitory in Kawasaki last week he had packed a few belongings and fled. Police sources described Takahashi, whose last job was with a construction firm in Kawasaki, as an avid reader with a short temper and a clear gift for evasion. During the decade he lived with Kikuchi \u2013 pretending to be a married couple called Shinya and Chizuko Sakurai \u2013 he decided they should take advantage of the anonymity offered by big cities, save prodigiously and avoid using planes and bullet trains. He was often seen at a restaurant near his dormitory, where he typically drank just one drink with three skewers of grilled chicken, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. By the time the couple separated in 2006, Takahashi is thought to have amassed well over 10m yen, including cash Aum had given him to help him escape. Kikuchi later had a relationship with Hiroto Takahashi (not related to Katsuya Takahashi), with whom she lived for six years until her arrest in Sagamihara, a town 20 miles south-west of Tokyo. As police closed in on Katsuya Takahashi, about 5,000 police officers were sent on to the streets with leaflets bearing an up-to-date image of a middle-aged man bearing only a passing resemblance to the younger man with thick eyebrows whose face had stared out of thousands of wanted posters for the previous 17 years. Takahashi&apos;s arrest will close a significant chapter in the Aum saga but it will be some time before Japan fully recovers from the national trauma created by the gas attacks. Thirteen Aum followers, including its founder, Shoko Asahara, are awaiting execution, while the trials of Kikuchi, Takahashi and Makoto Hirai, who turned himself in on New Year&apos;s Eve, will serve as reminders of the violent cult that sought confrontation with the government as a preface to the end of civilisation.

Antony Beevor has opted to write a military narrative and to devote about two thirds of his space to the eastern front and to grand\u00a0strategy. In doing so, he is playing to his strengths. Many of the chapters on the Nazi-Soviet war find Beevor at the top of his game, in command of a huge range of sources, with a fine eye for place and detail, deftly manipulating incident and character, and making effective use of soldiers&apos; diaries and letters to create a vast human tapestry of war. The prose is relaxed and retains a spring in every paragraph. He excels, too, at grand strategy \u2013 as a diplomatic historian, he is a match for AJP Taylor. The conferences at Casablanca, Tehran, Yalta and so on, which can have their longueurs, here sparkle with wit and insight, especially into the behaviour of Stalin. There are revelations too: for example, that the &quot;rightwing fanatic&quot; who so conveniently murdered Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Darlan in Algiers in 1942 happened to be working for the British Special Operations Executive. But, although the fall of France is magnificently told, the later campaigns in western Europe don&apos;t engage Beevor in the same way and the writing, while always lucid and authoritative, is much more detached. Elsewhere, Beevor&apos;s choices are not so happy. The battlefield narrative method which worked so well in Stalingrad is less effective when dealing with the wider conflagration, where military events often matter less than the underlying forces of ideology, political geography, or industrial production. Beevor&apos;s technique of frog-marching his readers to the station and getting the train moving, exemplified by an opening chapter which gets the war going in a mere 10 pages, achieves momentum, but often at the expense of clarity. The limitations of the old-fashioned military approach are highlighted by the minute attention paid to the names of units and commanders and the bizarre practice of giving German generals (and only German) their full titles \u2013 as in &quot;General der Panzertruppen Leo Freiherr Geyr von Schweppenburg&quot;. There are also structural problems. Beevor&apos;s skill with sustained narrative is repeatedly undermined by a salami-slicing attention to chronology. Rommel&apos;s arrival in north Africa is brilliantly staged but his subsequent campaign in the desert is told in disconnected fragments, the discussion of whether Hitler was right to forbid a retreat in front of Moscow in December 1941 is sandwiched inside a chapter on Pearl Harbor, and the development of the Mustang fighter \u2013 which transformed the air war against Germany \u2013 is a throwaway paragraph in &quot;The Soviet Spring Offensive&quot;. Not only is too much space given to the eastern front, the narrative develops a relentlessness \u2013 one damn battle after another \u2013 thanks to a lack of variety in pace and vantage point \u2013 an odd failing from an admirer of Vasily Grossman. Beevor does devote a chapter to Nazi-occupied Europe, and gives a solid, unflinching account of the Holocaust, though he never personalises any of its victims; but he skimps on or simply ignores many important aspects of the war, including the Manhattan Project, Albert Speer&apos;s transformation of German armaments production and the development of Ultra signals intelligence. A book aimed at an international audience may leave British readers feeling short-changed: there is little on the Blitz, the Battle of Crete gets more space than the Battle of Britain, and William Slim, the outstanding British general of the war, gets only a few passing mentions. Beevor is very good on one neglected area, relations between Moscow and Tokyo, but in general the sections on the far east are the weakest. There is an art to writing about the war in the Pacific, and he hasn&apos;t quite got it. You have to find some meaning behind the bloody events \u2013 whether it be in the triumph of American logistics, the complexities of racial hatred or the mechanised rape of island paradises. Beevor gives us a bald military narrative garnished with deft sketches of warlords such as the egomaniacal Douglas MacArthur. We never pause to share the life of an individual marine or Japanese infantryman. On China, by contrast, Beevor does have a theme: he endorses the modern revisionist line that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek and his nationalist army, far from being idle, corrupt and uninterested in fighting the Japanese, were making the best of a very difficult situation and that American policymakers, instead of constantly denigrating Chiang, should have concentrated on keeping him in play as a strong counterweight to Mao Zedong&apos;s communists, who would defeat him in 1949. Fair enough, but Beevor doesn&apos;t help his case by clumsy scene-setting and telling us little about what the communists were up to, while using hindsight to attack fellow travellers such as Agnes Smedley for not predicting the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The Second World War is handsomely produced and generously priced but its oddities and imbalances suggest that Beevor has not had the editorial support that even a writer of his talents needs on so vast a project. One hopes this is not the shape of things to come in publishing."}, {"sentences": ["My\u00a0mother would visit from Tokyo for\u00a0a day or two and what she said was: &quot;You are a good\u00a0writer."], "tags": ["Yoko Ono", "Sam Taylor-Johnson", "Art", "Art and design", "John Lennon", "Culture", "Nowhere Boy"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-16T23:06:00Z", "title": "When Sam Taylor-Wood met Yoko Ono", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/17/sam-taylor-wood-yoko-ono", "article": "Before the opening of Yoko Ono&apos;s major solo retrospective at the Serpentine this week, she does something unusual: she summons another artist, who on the face of it has nothing to do with her show, to come and join her. But then nothing about Yoko Ono is usual. And when she explains she would like to have Sam Taylor-Wood by her side, you don&apos;t question it. You wait to see what will happen. Yoko likes to do things her way. And, unlike most of us, she knows what her way is. It is an overcast morning as she steps into the Serpentine Gallery looking like \u2013 well, looking like herself. The first accommodation on meeting such a colossal celebrity is to remind oneself one has never met her before. In a sense, she could not be less &quot;colossal&quot;. This legendary but diminutive woman cuts a dash in her regulation black suit offset by a trilby of dove-grey felt. &quot;Yoko&apos;s hair is never a problem,&quot; confides the makeup artist she has in tow, &quot;she always wears a hat.&quot; And I observe they have brought a reserve selection of trilbies. Sam Taylor-Wood arrives a minute later, known to Yoko not so much as a Turner prize-nominated artist as because of Nowhere Boy, the film she directed about the adolescent John Lennon. Sam has a last-minute glamour: she wears a blue and white striped top, as if at any moment she might be thinking of setting sail. She has extracted herself from a house with four children \u2013 including a baby. &quot;I shouldn&apos;t be talking about my children as if I wanted sympathy,&quot; she laughs. You can see how at home with herself she is \u2013 and warm. It is easy to understand why she has so many famous (and otherwise) friends: Elton John, David Beckham, Kate Moss and, now, Yoko Ono. Yoko is eager to show us her work but some exhibits have yet to arrive, others are still bubble-wrapped. This does not deter her. And the tour of what is not there makes one aware of how vividly each piece exists in her mind&apos;s eye. She speaks in a soft, precise, Japanese little girl&apos;s voice. She giggles and sighs. I am struck by her sweetness and animation. John Lennon once called her &quot;the world&apos;s most famous unknown artist&quot;. I suspect there has always been a need to make her voice heard. Eight months away from her 80th birthday, her unchanging youthfulness is astonishing. And, as a peace activist, she has not changed either. When I ask whether she seriously thinks world peace a realistic goal, she answers with determination: &quot;At this point, it is a luxury for us to have negative thoughts \u2013 we can&apos;t.&quot; Optimism is her vocation, as the exhibition&apos;s title, To the Light, makes clear.     John and Yoko\u2019s Bed-In in Amsterdam, March 1969. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    We stare through the bubble wrap at a hybrid photograph of three men: her father, John Lennon and her son, Sean. Whose face dominates? &quot;My father&apos;s,&quot; she says with something between a sigh and a giggle. I can only see John Lennon. She shows us high-heeled shoes in which blood is pooling \u2013 part of her sequence Family Album (1993) about what it is to be a woman. She leads us towards an elegant, perplexing Perspex maze. Difficult to plan? &quot;Yes,&quot; she says, with satisfaction. She shows us two sets of footprints \u2013 hers and John&apos;s. Hers are tiny besides his. &quot;Goodness,&quot; I exclaim, looking at her neat black feet. &quot;What size shoes do you take?&quot; She brushes the question away like a fly \u2013 the answer, in every sense, beneath her. The last room, as though to test what the maze has taught us, asks: &quot;Where do you want to go from here?&quot; We want to go upstairs. And what I am about to find out is that these women have more affinities than you would have thought possible \u2013 in life and art. I am already, in fantasy, curating a double bill of a show in which Sam&apos;s Crying Men \u2013 of famous actors weeping \u2013 is placed next to Yoko&apos;s Smiles in which not-so-famous people, from all over the world, smile. And \u2013 even more tempting \u2013 I would love to see Sam&apos;s beautiful film of fruit as it decays alongside Yoko Ono&apos;s study of a wizened apple. And had it been possible, one might even have explored a connection\u2013 if only because of the intimacy of the ideas \u2013 between Sam&apos;s film commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery of David Beckham asleep and John and Yoko&apos;s famous Bed-In for peace.     Sam Taylor-Wood\u2019s 2004\u00a0video of David Beckham sleeping at the National Portrait Gallery. Photograph: Adam Butler/AP    I am aware, too, of a deeper overlap in the lives of the two women. They are survivors. Somehow, Yoko has lived through Lennon&apos;s assassination (on 8 December 1980). Sam has coped with cancer (colonic and breast). Each woman has experienced painful separation. Forty-five-year-old Sam&apos;s father then mother left her when she was a child. Yoko&apos;s daughter Kyoko was abducted by her second husband, American art promoter Tony Cox, when she was eight and Yoko did not see her again until Kyoko was 31. Yoko also had to weather the disapproval of conservative, aristocratic parents when she first got together with Lennon. They put out a press release saying: &quot;We are not proud of Yoko Ono.&quot; On a more trivial level, there is the older woman tag they have had to live with \u2013 Yoko was seven years older than John; Sam Taylor-Wood is more than twice the age of 22-year-old Aaron Johnson, who played John Lennon in her film and is father to two of Sam&apos;s four daughters. There is going to be so much to talk about. But the conversation begins with a present Sam has brought for Yoko, wrapped in bright tissue paper: a Japanese tea cup and &quot;salty caramel&quot; chocolates from Cocomaya in Bayswater. Sam has persuaded the shop to sell her the cup that was not for sale. How did she pull that off? &quot;I can be persuasive,&quot; she says, and one sees this is true. &quot;I love chocolate,&quot; exults Yoko. The teacup, Sam explains, reminds her of the last time they saw each other at Yoko&apos;s home, in New York, overlooking Central Park. Yoko pours tea into her cup (&quot;I like strong green tea&quot;) and I ask how they first met and we begin: STW I met Yoko before she knew who I was \u2013 at an exhibition in Islington. KK But you met properly through the film? YO Let me tell you how I met Sam, because it is important people understand about how these things happen. She was probably in a difficult situation like I was in when I made the Yes painting in 1966 [you had to walk up a ladder, with a magnifying glass, to find the word &quot;Yes&quot;]. I was in a totally difficult situation in my life and I thought: what I need is a Yes, and so I put the word on the ceiling. I never thought it was about to change my whole life by 180 degrees. STW Amazing how positive a word can be. YO It was that Yes painting that brought John into the gallery. He saw it and said great. Because the thing is that, unbeknown to everyone, John was going through some hard times too and feeling alone. I was feeling totally alone too. KK And are you saying that Sam needed a yes too? YO Yes. She had so much talent and incredible energy. She wanted me to give her the rights to use John&apos;s anthem Mother in her film. I thought, I&apos;d like to see that film and was flabbergasted by it because it was so beautiful. But I must have a very strong prejudice about Englishwomen because I thought, how can a woman make this thing? It was a very bad way of reacting. And then I saw her and she is not a teenager but looked like a teenager and I thought, what is she doing? This is a miracle. I was impressed. Since then, I have got to know her way of life and it is incredible. Did you know there is a very old idea in China that a woman can keep on having a child every four years? And if she keeps on doing it, she can go on for ever \u2013 until she is 80 or 90? KK You&apos;d have a lot of children. STW I am happy with four. YO No [laughs], but the idea to remember is that women have the power. I am not trying to have a baby myself but people might say: she is 80, she does not have to do anything any more. And yet we can do anything we want. We have such freedom with our bodies. ON EMOTION IN ART KK Yoko&apos;s Smiles and Sam&apos;s Crying Men share emotional directness. How important is it?     Yoko's Smile. Photograph: Yoko Ono    STW Emotional directness is imperative. It is so exciting to see [work from Yoko&apos;s retrospective] To the Light, which is so emotionally direct. To see the footprints of John and Yoko walking up the room made me well up. And I think something as simple, beautiful and elegant is what has been lost somewhere. I have not seen anything like it for a while and I need to see it. In the current climate, people want to feel more. YO I think Sam has been a little bit lonely. You see, when you become very famous, other people talk to you and they are not really friends. What you need to share is not what they want to hear from you\u2026 although you try to be truthful. STW I think so. ON TRUST KK Sam&apos;s film of David Beckham asleep; Yoko&apos;s Cut Piece (1964), where she allowed people to snip off her clothes until she was naked involved trusting and being trusted. Another affinity? YO I trust myself. You need that to survive. And how we are surviving is like almost drowning in a tsunami, a big wave. To come out of that, you have to trust yourself. STW Although I had met Yoko socially, we did not have a relationship where I could talk to her about Nowhere Boy. So I wrote to tell her about it and asked: Is there anything you want to say to me? Her response was to trust. No interference at all. And she said something so simple to me that it makes me cry. You said [to Yoko]: &quot;John loved Aunt Mimi and Aunt Mimi loved John and that is all that you have to think about when you make this film.&quot; That was my guiding light through the film. And there was trust between us. YO I really think John would have loved the film. KK The emotional centre of it seems to be a line where John says about his mother: &quot;There is no point hating someone you love.&quot; YO That is beautiful. It is very difficult for us to know we love somebody because it is an insecure position to be in. But in the end, it is important to be honest about your love because life is not that long\u2026 ON SEPARATION AND RECONCILIATION KK John was separated from his mother; Sam&apos;s mother left her when she was small. Yoko&apos;s daughter was abducted. YO With my daughter, the thing that was done was done. I can&apos;t be too hooked on that. But now I am very happy she is around because we have a good dialogue. STW Relationships can go wrong very simply, very quickly, and when you have children you become more aware of relationships around you. I had to repair the relationship with my mother. I couldn&apos;t afford to be angry or feel anything apart from: I need you back in my life. And it is not easy. YO No, it is not easy. STW I remember Yoko saying that if you hold on to anger and hate, it physically affects you. And if you think on a global scale about Yoko&apos;s messages of peace and her peace tower in Iceland, it is all about projection of hope and love. You have to do it on a grassroots level to be able to do it on a global level. KK But, realistically, are you serious \u2013 what chance do we hopeless human beings have of achieving peace? YO The reason we will make it is because we are people who have a tremendous talent to conquer negativity. I really think we will do it. The reason I had to learn about this was when John passed away. I would see the mirror in the morning and I looked terrible. And I would think: oh my God, I can&apos;t be looking like this for Sean even. So then I thought, why don&apos;t I just smile? And when I smiled at the mirror, it was phoney but I kept doing it and, finally, the smile started to come from my body and was very good. But also the funny thing is that, in the 60s, I\u00a0had this vision of everyone in the world smiling together. People might have thought it was a kooky idea. But we are doing it now [in Smile film, part of the retrospective]. It is amazing, isn&apos;t it? It will be very good for healing. ON BRITAIN YO May I say something I really want printed? Countries have lost their culture because what they wanted was\u00a0money. Money became the running theme in every country and culture was sacrificed. With the Olympics coming to England, we can show people what life is about. It will\u00a0be so good for this country \u2013 which\u00a0I have always felt was a very spiritual country \u2013 because of John mainly, but even before John too. There is too much focus on billionaires when this is a country of poets. Let us go back to that! What we need is spiritual energy. KK And yet you both have tremendous physical energy and use your bodies in your work. I was interested that Yoko once said this was narcissism. Did you really mean that? YO What is wrong with narcissism? We need to take care of ourselves. STW I love the idea that Yoko can be a trailblazer of narcissism. I find that I put my body in my work when I am at a particularly difficult or joyous point because I want to feel that moment.     Yoko Ono's Apple (1966). Photograph: Iain MacMillan    YO I was evacuated during\u00a0the war and it was very hard because I did not have much to eat. My\u00a0mother would visit from Tokyo for\u00a0a day or two and what she said was: &quot;You are a good\u00a0writer. Why don&apos;t you write about this? It could be like Gone With the Wind, but more interesting.&quot; From then on, I was always writing in my mind. It is important never to be totally involved\u00a0\u2013 so a part of me is always in a corner from where I am watching myself. ON BEING WOMEN ARTISTS KK How are you seen as artists? YO Women artists are still treated differently from men. STW I had a difficult scenario recently with an American gallerist. He said: &quot;I&apos;d like to show your work, but I don&apos;t know, now that you have four children, whether you are as strong an artist any more.&quot; YO Oh my God \u2013 I can&apos;t believe it. STW I was so struck by what he said, I found myself being defensive. He then listed all these men artists and said: &quot;How can you compete?&quot; I said: &quot;But they have children too.&quot; YO And what did he say? STW And he said: &quot;Of course they do, but does it affect their work in the way it will probably affect yours?&quot; YO No! You are not competing against anybody. When I was 21 and we had a university party, I remember a guy saying: &quot;You are pretty now but in 40 years you are going to look like a fat Spanish woman.&quot; KK How wrong he was! What do you both think of the New York art scene compared with London? STW I feel the art world in New York has a stronger following than Britain. If you go to a New York art district on a Saturday morning, it will be so busy with families and openings \u2013 art is much more ingrained in the culture. YO I don&apos;t know, it goes up and down. I think London, from the US point of view, is really happening now. ON BEING DEFINED BY MEN   KK Both of you have been defined by men \u2013 Yoko on a mind-boggling scale. Is it fair to define anyone through their sexual relationships? STW It is \u2013 in a way. I am happily defined by my relationship with Aaron. It is a big part of who I am and I can&apos;t allow people to come at me and attack. YO In my relationship with John, it is complicated. I would like to think of John as independent and not just my partner because he was an incredible guy and with his independence and creativity, he will do a lot of good for the world. And he has. What I am doing is different from John. Together, we created an incredible, powerful image, but it would not have been unless we had\u00a0been independent of one another. And we were. ON LOSS KK You have both experienced tremendous loss in your life \u2013 how far does adversity feed your art? STW Art is my way of controlling it, not allowing it to take over my life. Sometimes, I get afraid it has defined me, that sense of grief, loss and illness. But actually, it is about allowing myself to take hold and say: this is part of who I am, but not only who I am. YO I say in a British way that everything is a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot;, though sometimes I wish the disguise was less thick. KK How often do you think of yourselves in terms of your ages? YO I don&apos;t. Only the outside world makes me think about it. STW I was about to say exactly the same thing. It is not something I get up and think about. KK I don&apos;t know if Yoko got a hard time for being seven years older than John \u2013 but I suppose that was always a mere nothing compared to the 20 years or so between Sam and Aaron? YO She topped me! STW I am not ever aware of it in my relationship. I don&apos;t think about it. I never think: if only I were 25\u2026. YO We don&apos;t want to be 25 again, do we? [laughs]. ON CELEBRITY AND ANONYMITY KK How often do either of you find yourselves wishing you could be anonymous? YO: Celebrity helps me communicate my work, so I don&apos;t think that. STW Anonymity would be a fantastic umbrella. I don&apos;t like intrusion. KK What matters most to you? STW The simplest things: love, trust and\u2026 YO The first word that came to me is health; spiritual, mental and physical. But also without love and trust, you will not have health. When people ask me what the most important thing is in life, I answer: just breathe. STW And that is amazing because that feels like the essence of so much of your work. When you look at something like the films, there is such humour and simplicity. But I want to tell you how I saw Yoko and the Plastic Ono Band perform in LA. It is one of the most extraordinary things I have seen. I wrote her a fan letter afterwards. It was almost shamanistic. YO [laughs] Maybe! STW You are very upfront with your emotions. And I was surprised because I had thought: she must be fed up with being defined by John sometimes. But you ran films of him and he is still very much with you and a part of your work. YO Yes\u2026 always together. STW And I felt proud of you for being there and still integrating John into your life and also having Sean on stage. I watched him looking at you with loving pride. You have helped me to define myself. People want to know: are you a film-maker now or an artist? I just say: &quot;It is me and I am a creative person.&quot; Yoko makes music, films, sculptures. Sometimes you can&apos;t be defined as one thing. YO Don&apos;t censor yourself! STW And I feel that having my children is as creative as \u2013 and more challenging than \u2013 making a film. ON MOTHERHOOD KK Did it change your art? YO No, although I was not prepared to have my daughter and I was amazed: is this what women go through? We were never told. But from her, I learned to be grounded, which is good. STW I felt giving birth was the most creative act of all my creative acts \u2013 literally creation! YO We are goddesses, creating the human race! STW We are \u2013 and it is as powerful as anything you could ever do. Being a mother is part of my work and world. KK Tell me this then: why be an artist at all? YO Because that is who I am. I didn&apos;t try to be \u2013 but I was always an artist. STW I tried not to be, but I couldn&apos;t be anything else. I tried many other things but I didn&apos;t know what being an artist meant other than being myself. YO Yes. It is exactly the same with me. As she stands up, Sam says the conversation has been &quot;inspiring&quot;. Yoko is still sparking \u2013 ready to talk all day now, it seems \u2013 but the conversation is almost over. I have one\u00a0last question as a post-script: would they have got on if they had met as children? They were, they agree, isolated little\u00a0girls. Yoko has &quot;no idea&quot; but wonders whether they might have &quot;pushed&quot; each other around. She remembers: &quot;I was always very much myself&quot; and, looking at Sam, asks: &quot;Were you?&quot; Sam replies: &quot;I was fiercely independent but I really wanted friends.&quot; And Yoko starts to laugh: &quot;How good it would have been to have an intelligent friend.&quot; Yoko Ono: To the Light is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 from 19\u00a0June to 9 September"}, {"sentences": ["Now I wondering how I would have turned out if I had stayed in Barcelona or moved to Tokyo, or Paris or Newcastle...

Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I don&apos;t think I really write about books, but rather about people, stories, language, ideas... The four books in the cemetery of forgotten books quartet are indeed very related to the world of readers, writers, booksellers, publishers and everybody in the orbit of literature, but they try to tackle on the classic themes of literature. They aspire to be about life. Books and literature, or storytelling, are just a part of that. Itzelt asks: Is the The Cemetery of Forgotten Books inspired on an actual building in Barcelona? How long did it take you to write La Sombra del Viento from the first idea to final &quot;manuscript&quot;? The father/son relationship in this book is endearing, do you have a close relationship with you father? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: Not really. I gotr the idea of the cemetery while living in Los Angeles. A big inspiration was a huge used bookshop in Long Beach, California, called Acres of Books. Ray Bradbury wrote once about that place and I was a frequent visitor for years, until it closed down. To me the cemetery of forgotten books is a metaphor, not just for books, but for ideas, beauty, knowledge, for people, for the world of the mind, for memory... all the things that makes us human and provide meaning. Books, in a way, are a symbol for all that in the story. It usually takes me one to two years to write a book of this kind, and shadow was no exception. My relationship with my dad isn&apos;t like Daniel&apos;s in shadow. Some aspects of it are similar, but my dad is a very different person from daniel&apos;s dad. And I am more Carax than Daniel, really. C&apos;est la vie. Charlotte Jones asks: Hi, here&apos;s a couple: What is the difference between writing YA novels and adult novels, or are they actually any different at all? Which do you prefer and why? The Cemetery of Forgotten Books obviously has a note of nostalgia about it - where are you in the books vs. ebooks debate? Why do you write in Spanish, rather than English? Does that language give you something that English can&apos;t and, if so, what? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I don&apos;t think the writing process is very different between writing YA or adult novels, really. I just try to write for people who like to read, and not worry too much about their age. Age, in a reader, is a very relative quality. I like to write books for readers who love literature, language, storytelling... I don&apos;t ask readers for an ID to check their ages. I like to think that, in some way, I am writing for readers of all ages. I see no debate in ebooks vs books. Books are books, not the platform they&apos;re distributed in. A Mozart symphony is the music, not a CD or a tape or an MP3 or a FLAC file. It is the music. Literature to me is the same. It is about the work, the language, the creation. I write in spanish because I am spanish. I was born in Barcelona and both spanish and catalan are my mother languages. I believe a writer of fiction should try to write in the language in which he or she learned to read and write, because there&apos;s something extremely important about that connection you don&apos;t want to mess with. Alll languages give and take something. Romanic languages such as spanish, italian, french, catalan, portuguese have, I feel, an enourmous range of subtlety and detail, while english, for instance, provides concision and precision. I just wish I could be fluent in them all. Sebastian Eklund asks: As a writer, what are some of your enduring inspirations? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I am inspired by life, by my personal experience, my memories, what I see inside of me and around of me... I am also inspired by literature, by music and beauty in general. I am a fool for beauty. Caffeine also does a swell job. msmlee asks: Which is your favourite library in the world? Is there a real life inspiration for the &quot;cemetery of forgotten books&quot;, maybe a disused warehouse or a little known reading room? If you could only save one book, what would it be? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I love many libraries... one of mt favorites is the one at the Ateneu of Barcelona, a century old literary club in the old town. But give me a library and you&apos;ll get a convert... If I could save a book... mmmm. I guess the politically correct answer to that would be a classic or some wonderful book we all love. Since this is a big, bad, heartless world and God loves a villain, I would let my evil twin choose. And he would choose to save one of mine, as undeserving as it would be... writers are like that. Deplorable citizens... MJShadow asks: Any advice for a new author?Do you listen to music when you write?Any hobby confessable? Could you send me an e-mail to Rawen88@hotmail.es? I finished a manuscript two days ago, and i would appreciate to know your opinion about a few chapters. Thanks in advance and kind regards. Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: Write, write and write. And then rewrite. To death. Work hard. Learn your craft. Never give up. Persevere. Don&apos;t become a snob, a bitter hater or an envious person. Work hard for your goals. Write from your heart, but make sure before it gets to your fingers it goes through your brain. And did I mention do not give up? Music is what I most in the world, so I have to be careful when writing to it because my mind wanders into the orchestrations, the bassline... Sometimes I do, yes. But in a deeply controlled way. Confessable hobbies? Playing and writing music, watching the world go by, chasing beauty and knowledge and doing nothing at all. I am sorry, but I cannot read your book for obvious legal reasons. You want an editor or an agent to do that. Best of luck. msmlee asks: Which book influenced you the most as a youngster? Are there particular authors who inspired you into becoming a writer yourself? What is your next writing project? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I can&apos;t finget the ONE book that influenced me. I would say it was all books, the world of reading, literature and storytelling in general. Same for authors. Too many to mention. I am working right now on the fourth and final book in the sequence of the cemetery of forgotten books... Wish me luck. msmlee asks: Do you have a writing routine? How do you work with translators of your novels? Do you have editorial input into the transtated editions of your books? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I work in my studio/office. Long hours. Five days a week, sometimes 6 or 7. I rewrite as I write, constantly. I walk around the room. Talk to myself. Move from the desk to a piano I have in the office. Curse my own limitations. Drink too much caffeine. Consider a career in looking paint dry on walls... Then I rewrite and rewrite again and again. I work for months on end until what I have is as close as it gets to what I set out to do. I work closely with some of my translators and in some cases I have a lot of input into the translations, rewriting sections and making sure what you get is as close as it can be to the original. In other cases Iet them to fend for themselves and be devoured by wild beasts. That&apos;s the way I roll. Skintatpres asks: As an aspiring YA author, with a file filled with rejection emails, I was wondering how many rejections you received, before getting the all important agent and publishing deal and did you ever feel like throwing in the towel? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I published my first book more than 20 years ago, but before that yes , I had rejections. All writers get them. Do not be discouraged by them. Keep working. Keep learning and never give up. Writers write. No matter what. And yes you feel like throwing in the towel. But you don&apos;t. Not if you&apos;re a writer. Because writers write. Publishing, that&apos;s another matter. Stay strong, be true to yourself and work hard. The world will catch up, eventually. stoneofsilence asks: How do you view your relocation to LA ? Does this afford you another perspective on your writing? Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: I moved to Los Angeles in 1994 and lived there for 10 years, more or less. I guess leaving home and going to another country teaches you a lot, not least about yourself. I think it was a good thing for me to do. Nowdays I spend as much time in California as I do in Barcelona or around Europe. I am not sure that going to LA specifically gave a different perspective about my writing. That evolves no matter what with time, regardless of where you are, I think. Probably it changed me more as person in general, which of course surely changed me as a writer as well. Now I wondering how I would have turned out if I had stayed in Barcelona or moved to Tokyo, or Paris or Newcastle... Alternate universes. robinck asks: Do you publish first in the languages where you have the highest readerships by book sales? I have friends who love your story telling (as do I) who speak Italian and was told of &quot;Marina&quot; earlier this year - disappointingly told by Waterstones that it would not be published in English until September. Thank you for all your fabulous books. Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n replies: Publication order is not really set by me, but by my publishers in every country and they esentially pick up the time they feel is right for them. Sales don&apos;t affect the order really. Each publisher has its own process, its own needs... once the translation is done, they figure out when they want to come out. Usually the books all come out within a year of the original version, but sometimes a publisher may take longer. It depends. Indeed, the english version of MARINA has been slightly delayed not to overlap with The Prisoner of Heaven. I am sorry about that. Marina is a book I am quite fond of, if only for personal reasons. I appreciatte your patience. Cheers. memlee asks: Very sorry to be hogging the thread, so one final tranche of questions... What is your favourite place in Barcelona? How would you describe the contemporary Spanish literature scene? Do readers enjoy a diverse mix of genres or are the bestsellers the usual cookbooks and celebrity biographies? Are traditional Spanish bookshops being threatened by the rise of new technologies? Is there a literary vs popular fiction divide in contemporary Spanish literature? How do you feel about some critics&apos; view that The Shadow of the Wind is not &quot;literary&quot; enough but just another plot-driven thriller? What is your own criteria of a good book? I personally has The Shadow of the Wind as one of my favourite books ever. I so identified with the boy protagonist and I had the most vivid pictures of &quot;cemetery of forgotten books&quot; conjured up by your writing. Thank you for this wonderful book and I look forward to the sequel. Carlos Ruiz Zafon replies: My favorite place in Barcelona is my home. But there&apos;s plenty of wonders in town to see... get good shoes and walk around. The literary market in spain right now is very similar to that of other european countries, and you get a similar mix of books and genres. Maybe less celebrity cookbooks, but along the lines of the rest of Europe for sure. I can&apos;t really describe the contempary spanish literary scene. I am not sure there&apos;s one, but probably a series of them layered upon each other. It&apos;s been changing anyway over the last 10 years, for the better I&apos;d say. I am not sure what critics you refer to. Some may have said that, some have said the exact opposite, some have said something altogether different. I don&apos;t see the point of writers commenting or answering to critics or to publicly expressed opinions and comments, whether they are favorable or not. Critics say what they say, and that is fine. It is just an opinion and it is not an author&apos;s place to dispute it. Thanks for yours questions and kind words. alirennie86 asks: Is there going to be another series of GamesMaster? Carlos Ruiz Zafon replies: Not from me, sir. I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about. But sounds like a lot of fun. Go for it, girl! Carlos Ruiz Zafon says: Thank you all for your questions. Apologies for the typos. I am using one of those damned windows keyboards and I feel like Tarzan hammering at it... It&apos;s been a digital pleasure to chat with you. Good readings, good adventures and good fortune to all."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Cheiloscopy deals with the examination of systems of furrows on the red part of human lips,&quot; he specified, then explaining that Yasuo Tsuchihashi and Tazuo Suzuki at Tokyo University had examined the lips of 1,364 persons."], "tags": ["Research", "Forensic science", "Higher education", "Education", "Science"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T15:30:05Z", "title": "The research that's on everyone's lips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/18/lip-print-research", "article": "They are on everyone&apos;s lips always, and sometimes on a shred of evidence in a murder trial, and occasionally in the title of a scientific report. Lip prints have become the subject of formal study. That formal study has a formal name: cheiloscopy. Basic questions still nag at cheiloscopists. A Portuguese population lip print patterns paper, Morphologic Patterns of Lip Prints in a Portuguese Population: A Preliminary Analysis, written by Virginia Costa and Ines Caldas of the University of Porto, in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, shows how scientists have worked hard to classify the universe of lip patterns into a set of standard categories. They slightly lament the existence of competing standards, the field being too new for its experts to settle on a single taxonomy. They also worry at the how-do-the-lips-change-after-death conundrum. Criminal investigators find themselves haunted by a scarcity problem with both-before-and-after patterns. &quot;Very few&quot; corpses arrive with a companion set of pre- and postmortem lip prints, Costa and Caldes say, &quot;which obviously impairs a comparative study.&quot; Does each of the 7,000,000,000 or so people on earth (and each of their ancestors) have a unique set of lip prints? Jerzy Kasprzak of the Military Police School in Minsk Mazowiecki, Poland, addressed that in 1990, in Possibilities Of Cheiloscopy, in the journal Forensic Science International. &quot;Cheiloscopy deals with the examination of systems of furrows on the red part of human lips,&quot; he specified, then explaining that Yasuo Tsuchihashi and Tazuo Suzuki at Tokyo University had examined the lips of 1,364 persons. Thanks to those 1,364 sets of lips, Kasprzak said, Tsuchihashi and Suzuki &quot;established that the arrangement of lines on the red part of human lips is individual and unique for each human being&quot;. Do women&apos;s lips have identifiably different patterns to men&apos;s? In 2009, a team at Subharti Dental College in Meerut, India, attacked the question, using &quot;lipstick, bond paper, cellophane tape, a brush for applying the lipstick, and a magnifying lens&quot;. Their resulting treatise, Cheiloscopy: The Study of Lip Prints in Sex Identification, reports success in identifying the gender of 18 of 20 women and 17 of 20 men. Lips being often associated with romance, cheiloscopy smacks occasionally of glamour. Ana Castell\u00f3, Mercedes Alvarez-Segu\u00ed and Fernando Verd\u00fa of the University of Valencia, Spain, noticed that advanced developments in the fashion industry had forced crime-fighters to come up with their own, countervailing technological leaps. In 2002, they and colleague Marcos Miquel published a study called Long-Lasting Lipsticks and Latent Prints, in which they complained that &quot;the cosmetics industry has developed long-lasting lipsticks that often do not leave visible prints&quot;. The Valencia team experimented with chemicals \u2013 especially a dye called Nile red \u2013 that helped to reveal nearly invisible prints left by such lipsticks. That led them, three years later, to publish one of the most romantically titled reports in the history of forensics: Luminous Lip-Prints as Criminal Evidence. \u2022 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize"}, {"sentences": ["The Cheshunt-based supermarket chain arrived in Japan in June 2003 when it acquired Tokyo convenience store chain C Two-Network for \u00a3173m."], "tags": ["Tesco", "Japan", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T19:39:45Z", "title": "Tesco offloads Japanese operation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/18/tesco-japan-sells", "article": "Tesco is paying rival Japanese supermarket operator Aeon a \u00a340m dowry to take its loss making chain off its hands. After ploughing more than \u00a3250m and the best of a decade into trying to crack one of the toughest retail markets in the world, Tesco boss Philip Clarke hoisted the for sale sign over Tesco Japan last summer. The terms of the deal, however, suggest buyers were in short supply with the British grocer selling a 50% stake for a token sum of Y1 \u2013 less than 1p \u2013 while also pumping \u00a340m into the new joint venture. The arrangement, Tesco said, meant it would have &quot;no further financial exposure to the Japanese business or its operations&quot;. &quot;We are very pleased to announce this deal with Aeon and are confident this will deliver the best outcome for our staff and for our shareholders,&quot; said Clarke. When he called time on Japan last August he said the group had &quot;concluded we cannot build a sufficiently scalable business&quot;. The \u00a340m dowry will be used to refurbish stores as Aeon outlets with the cash helping to preserve employment of Tesco&apos;s nearly 1,000 workforce. Foreign retailers have struggled to conquer Japan due to the toxic combination of intense competition and years of lacklustre economic growth. French giant Carrefour pulled out of Japan in 2005 when some of its stores were also acquired by Aeon. &quot;Without some serious M&amp;A, Tesco were never going to reach the scale required to create a profitable business in what remains one of the most competitive markets on earth,&quot; said Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts. &quot;It makes sense to pull out and this seems a dignified way of doing it.&quot; Clarke has bigger problems than Japan, which was the smallest of Tesco&apos;s 13 international chains. He has taken over the day-to-day running of the grocer&apos;s UK store operation after a shock profit warning in January saw it admit it had been serving its UK shoppers poorly. The UK chain generates two thirds of group profits and had been milked to bankroll international expansion, leading to shabby stores and deteriorating customer service. Last week Tesco reported like-for-like sales down 1.5% in the first quarter as Clarke&apos;s fightback plan struggles to gain traction, which includes more staff on the shop floor as well as store makeovers. His other headache is loss-making US start-up Fresh &amp; Easy which is not expected to break even until next year. Last week&apos;s update highlighted a worrying slowdown at the California based chain with growth of 3.6% compared with more than 12% in the fourth quarter. The Cheshunt-based supermarket chain arrived in Japan in June 2003 when it acquired Tokyo convenience store chain C Two-Network for \u00a3173m. The push was led by former chairman David Reid who at the time described it as a &quot;neat entry&quot; to a market with higher operating margins than in the UK and went on to acquire bankrupt convenience store chain Fre&apos;c. Aeon is expected to buy the rest of the shares in Tesco Japan in the autumn. The retrenchment is a setback for the globe-trotting British retailer, which has spent the past decade planting its red, white and blue flag in countries ranging from Turkey to Thailand. There have been upsets though: Tesco abandoned its first attempt to crack Ireland and has previously exited France and Taiwan. Tesco underestimated the challenges it would encounter in Japan, the world&apos;s third-largest grocery market after China and the US. At last count its market share in Japan was 0.1% compared with more than 30% in the UK. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the 117 store Japanese chain was losing about \u00a330m a year and had become a distraction. &quot;Tesco appears to our minds to have taken the correct approach with funded withdrawal,&quot; said Black."}, {"sentences": ["The Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan in early July is an opportunity to set the right course, to substantiate the grand ambitions set out in many previous conferences, including in Bonn in December.", "Third, Tokyo should clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of the Afghan government and international community and agree a mutual accountability mechanism."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "Aid", "Global development", "Conflict and development", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-21T12:57:48Z", "title": "Real security in Afghanistan depends on people's basic needs being met | Michael Keating", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/21/security-afghanistan-basic-needs", "article": "The message from May&apos;s Nato summit in Chicago was that the Afghans would not again be abandoned by the international community, as they were in the early 1990s. It resulted in financial pledges for Afghan security forces beyond 2014, whose cost is estimated at over $4bn a year, by which point most foreign troops will have left. This was no small achievement in today&apos;s global economic climate, given growing disenchantment with Afghanistan. But it is not enough. Unless funding for Afghanistan&apos;s security forces is matched by investment in meeting people&apos;s basic needs, and by robust efforts to protect civilians and human rights, the money being spent on security could be wasted. For Afghans, particularly women, security is not only about protection from external threats and insurgents, critical as these are. It is also about protection from unaccountable officials and security forces in the course of daily life. It is about knowing that that jobs and opportunities are not just for the well-off, that property rights are respected, injustices addressed, abuse of authority checked. Afghans are no different from the rest of us. The imperative now is to ensure that the blood spilled, money spent and gains made over the last decade are not reversed, that they yield a sustainable security dividend. What is needed is a partnership that focuses on meeting Afghans&apos; practical needs. The Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan in early July is an opportunity to set the right course, to substantiate the grand ambitions set out in many previous conferences, including in Bonn in December. As foreign troops go, economic activity, revenues for the state and foreign aid budgets will drop. A virtue must be made of this necessity \u2013 to rationalise international support in a way that protects people, supports them to manage their own affairs, and rewards enterprise. Aid and development alone cannot deliver peace, any more than security forces. An inclusive intra-Afghan political process is a must, supported by neighbouring countries, both to bring the country&apos;s long nightmare to a close, and to reduce the need for costly security. Equally important is to ensure that presidential elections, slated for 2014, do not become the catalyst of violence, but are accepted as credible by the population, ideally contributing to reconciliation. Not easy, given ongoing insurgency, but it can be done. But the bedrock of longer-term security and stability is sustained improvement in the quality of life, authorities that are accountable, institutions that function, and jobs. Despite the decade of progress in areas as diverse as freedom of expression and political participation, infrastructure and mine clearance, healthcare and girls&apos; education, Afghans are increasingly anxious about the future, and frustrated. Five million still live as refugees or undocumented migrants. Conflict-induced displacement has risen steadily over the last five years and now amounts to over 500,000 people. Women and children suffer disproportionately from the conflict. In 2011, a quarter of the population received food support, and over a million people got emergency drinking water. 55% of Afghan children under five are stunted, and their chances later in life of being self-reliant and contributing to economic growth are impaired. Female illiteracy and maternal mortality rates are among the highest in the world. Land, soil, forests, water resources, and mineral deposits are degraded by over three decades of conflict, prey to illicit exploitation. The incidence of disasters, including floods, earthquakes, avalanches and droughts, is increasing. Drug production is responding to international demand, as farmers seek incomes to survive. About half the population is under 18, with few prospects, particularly in rapidly growing cities. These are not the ingredients of stability. A long-term partnership is needed to tackle problems that are now inter-generational. First, protection of civilians, accountability and the rule of law must be hardwired into plans for the transition, training and support of security forces. Strengthening a police force that is professional, answerable and responsive to civilians is essential. Second, funding for security must be matched by funding of a practical, needs-based development agenda that focuses on what Afghans want, especially jobs, functioning institutions and basic services. They also need help to deal with urgent and extensive humanitarian needs. This must go hand in hand with support for public-private partnerships to generate revenues that will increase the country&apos;s self sufficiency \u2013 infrastructure, services, and responsible management and exploitation of the country&apos;s vast natural resources. Third, Tokyo should clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of the Afghan government and international community and agree a mutual accountability mechanism. Stronger and more accountable governance must be at the heart of the deal. That is what local people want, entrepreneurs need, and what western politicians must have if they are to vote the funds. The price tag of continued support will be significant. But this will be modest compared to the vast sums now spent by the west on security \u2013 currently over $2bn a week - and the cost both to Afghans, the region and the international community if social tensions and a sense of injustice go unchecked. Getting it right will pay enormous dividends \u2013 for Afghans, the region and the world. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["Shindo grew up on a farm \u2013 his parents had been rich landlords but they went bankrupt, causing the family to break up \u2013 and left for Tokyo in 1928 where he entered one of the cinema studios."], "tags": ["Film", "BFI", "Culture", "Yasujiro Ozu", "Akira Kurosawa"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-22T21:55:17Z", "title": "Kaneto Shindo \u2013 master of Japanese cinema", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/22/kaneto-shindo-japanese-film", "article": "Kaneto Shindo, who died last month aged 100, just before the start of a two month British Film Institute season dedicated to his career and that of long-term collaborator Yoshimura Kozaburo, spent a lot of time among the reeds, wading through mud, puddles and into woods of bamboo. He was most comfortable there, where life was reduced to its bare essentials. Shindo was born in 1912 in Hiroshima. Japan modernised dramatically over his lifetime, but he observed it at a distance, with the knowledge that all this could disappear drummed into him from childhood after what had happened to his hometown. His subjects in the 49 films he made, ranging from melodramas to horror stories to erotic fictions, were those society had rejected or brutalised, who were now struggling to survive, sometimes resorting to even more brutal methods. Shindo&apos;s work has been eclipsed by his contemporaries, namely the &quot;emperor&quot; Akira Kurosawa, and the folowing generation, with its New Wave rebels Nagisa Oshima and Shohei Imamura. This is not unjust: Shindo&apos;s work can be formally messy and his tales overly simplistic. But viewing the films today offers an insight into an oeuvre made entirely in the shadow of Hiroshima, and how this provoked feelings of guilt, paranoia and instability in survivors, but not necessarily rebellion, or a cold look at the events that led up to it. Shindo grew up on a farm \u2013 his parents had been rich landlords but they went bankrupt, causing the family to break up \u2013 and left for Tokyo in 1928 where he entered one of the cinema studios. Eventually he progressed into the role of assistant director at Shochiku \u2013 one of the majors along with Nikkatsu and Toho \u2013 and also the home of the golden generation: Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi, then at the peaks of their careers. Shindo&apos;s encounter with the latter was defining: Mizoguchi took him as assistant for The Straits of Love and Hate in 1937 and then in 1941 for The 47 Ronin. He encouraged Shindo to pursue screenwriting as a first stage to becoming a director but the war intervened, and Shindo was drafted to the Imperial Navy. Out of the group of 100 men he served with, six returned. Shindo&apos;s hometown had also been destroyed when he came back and his older sister later died from radiation sickness. One of Shindo&apos;s first screenplays, The Ball at the Anjo House in 1947 was for his friend Kozaburo Yoshimura, who shares the BFI retrospective because the two men&apos;s careers were so intertwined \u2013 Shindo writing most of Yoshimura&apos;s scripts (as well as hundreds more for television and other directors) and Yoshimura producing many of Shindo&apos;s films. The Ball was inspired by Yoshimura&apos;s experience shortly after returning from his drafting in southeast Asia, but the story of an aristocratic family&apos;s decline and swansong party at their mansion \u2013 ending with a sad tango between daughter Setsuko Hara and her suicidal father \u2013 also drew from Shindo&apos;s heritage. As he moved to directing, Shindo hit against the majors&apos; increasing reluctance to back films with a so-called &quot;dark outlook on life&quot; when what they wanted, and what the US occupation also approved of, were morale-boosting comedies or escapist tear-jerkers. Rather than compromise as Ozu and Mizoguchi had been forced to do throughout their careers, Shindo and Yoshimura were among the first in Japan to found their own production company in 1950, Kindai Eiga Kyokai. This early phase is often misleadingly described as Shindo&apos;s &quot;political&quot; period, but while he always described himself as socialist, Shindo was never affiliated to any party nor involved in militant activities, and his political stance was very simple: follow those who have been left behind, whether they are prostitutes, farmers, migrant workers or serial killers. He took their side and filmed from their point of view. The 1950s was more appropriately the phase of Shindo&apos;s social dramas, as he used melodrama to explore issues and inequalities thrown up by Japan&apos;s class system, often with a female protagonist, from his first autobiographical film in 1951, Story of a Beloved Wife, to Gutter three years later, which followed a troubled, desperate young woman and her bleak experiences as a geisha. When the US occupation ended in 1952, Japan began a delayed confrontation with the atrocities of the war and Shindo was commissioned by the Japan Teachers&apos; Union to make the first film about the atom bomb. But Children of Hiroshima \u2013 commercially released in the US only last year \u2013 was met with a tirade of criticism for failing to point the finger at America, and the JTU commissioned\u00a0a second film, this time from Hideo Sekigawa. The resulting Hiroshima, with its scenes of Japanese tourists buying victims&apos; bones, went down much better, and was so popular it set off a wave of similar anti-American films. The political muteness of Children of Hiroshima is startling. Shindo&apos;s young school teacher \u2013 played by his wife Nobuko Otowa, who took on so many different roles in his films, from vengeful woman, monstrous spirit, diligent farmer to desperate mother \u2013 returns four years after the atomic explosion and searches for the three survivors from her class. One is an orphan, another is dying from radiation poisoning and the last boy is the only child to have been saved, though his sister was badly injured. The dialogues have a deliberateness, so too the ponderous moments standing in front of rubble. The only moment of anger comes from an old man, now a disfigured beggar, who lashes out into the darkness, cursing &quot;that damn A-bomb&quot; and his bad luck. Shindo&apos;s film was in part realist, as he used radiation victims in many of the roles, but essentially he turned the political into melodrama. In doing so, he captured the way Hiroshima was understood by many at the time \u2013 an inevitability, experienced and mourned as a natural disaster more than a planned political act. In the 1960s, as opposition to the Security Treaty with the US intensified from a progressively radicalised student population, Shindo stopped making social dramas altogether. He filmed instead what became his biggest international success, The Naked Island, a film without dialogue, set on a barren island in the Inland Sea. Repeating the question so many faced after the bomb \u2013 what do you do when you lose everything? \u2013 The Naked Island was Shindo&apos;s answer. &quot;It is a symbol of the world. Two human beings arrive and must make a life for themselves.&quot; The island has no drinkable water so twice a day the parents row across the sea to the nearest town, fill their buckets and head back, the wooden stick bending with the weight and digging into their backs as they carry it to the top of their hill. Through a succession of beautiful images we watch them, back and forth, farming the difficult land, surviving. The musical score is continuous, initially seeming to celebrate this simplicity but it becomes more sinister as the melody remains the same while the scenes start to tell a different story: one of their little boys dies, the wife buckles under the weight of the water buckets, tending to the crops she breaks down, sabotaging the plantations as her husband looks on. After the success of The Naked Island, Shindo changed gear again: no more social dramas or stylised allegories but racy horror movies. His &quot;erotic&quot; period, continuing into the 70s with progressively diminishing returns, mirrors a turn many Japanese film-makers made, encouraged by or reacting to the emerging soft porn or &quot;pink&quot; films. The erotic and horror themes allowed Shindo to approach the instinct of survival from a different angle. &quot;Political things such as class consciousness or social existence really come down to the problem of man alone,&quot; he explained. &quot;I discovered the powerful, very fundamental force in man which sustains his survival and which can be called sexual energy.&quot; In the most striking works from this period, Onibaba in 1964 and Kuroneko four years later, Shindo was also at his most formally inventive, more playful than perfectionist with messy jump cuts and sound edits, and drawing obvious inspiration from the French New Wave. From the 70s Shindo&apos;s inventiveness\u00a0and daring had started to subside\u00a0and he returned to old themes. He\u00a0did not take the route of many once\u00a0pioneering directors in Japan, such as Oshima or later Takeshi Kitano,\u00a0whose recent films often do little more than mimic the Hollywood aesthetic. Shindo&apos;s work was always more marginal and less exportable. For his final film, Postcard, completed when he was 99, Shindo went full circle and returned to the origin of his cinema, taking a story from his experience in the navy, when nearly all his colleagues died before coming home. War marked his generation, and Shindo captured on screen one way Japan dealt with it, both obsessively and evasively.."}, {"sentences": ["4 Vitamin C. 5 Tokyo."], "tags": ["Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-22T21:59:15Z", "title": "The Weekend Quiz", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jun/22/the-quiz-guardian-weekend-magazine", "article": "The questions 1 Who didn&apos;t &quot;wake up for less than $10,000 a day&quot;? 2 What was demarcated by the 1820 Missouri Compromise? 3 The Maroons and the Blues contest\u00a0which Australian sporting\u00a0series? 4 L-ascorbic acid is another name for\u00a0what? 5 Where is the 634-metre Skytree\u00a0tower?6 Max von Sydow made 13 films with which director? 7 What TV series was set in the south coast town of Tarrant?8 What is MI6&apos;s official name?

This particular variant of it, however, is definitively 21st century, tracing the supply chain of models from Siberia to Tokyo. The film follows Nadya, a 13-year-old aspiring model from a remote Russian village, and Ashley, the jaded scout who spots her at a casting call for bikini-clad Siberian children, and sends her to Japan. Depressing, but, like most things bearing the Storyville brand, altogether compelling.

The concept drags a touch over the extended running time but there are many wonderful moments, especially the revelation that Partridge likes to imagine the sheep in a nearby field as people who have wronged him: &quot;Andrew Marr, the Dimbleby brothers, loads of builders.&quot; Gwilym Mumford Veep10pm, Sky Atlantic Armando Iannucci and his The Thick of It co-writers shift their sights to Washington in this zippy new comedy about US vice-president (or Veep) Selina Meyer.

The club, which has its story chronicled in Michael Winterbottom&apos;s 2002 film 24 Hour Party People, was launched as a rainy, northern version of cool New York venues, showcasing artists and bands including Madonna and The Smiths. Opening 30 years ago, it became famous for acid and rave music, and in its latter days a byword for drugs and gang violence, before closing in 1997. Hook was a co-owner of the nightspot that was regarded by devotees as the best in the world, and as a thorn in the side of the local police who tried for years to have it shut down. The master&apos;s course in music industry management and promotion is being launched by the University of Central Lancashire, in association with Hook&apos;s Factory251, the music venue within the former Factory Records office in Manchester. A key text for students aspiring to become industry movers and shakers will undoubtedly be Hook&apos;s own rueful 2009 memoir, How Not to Run a Club. The Hacienda rarely made any money even as it became world famous: Hook recalled one epic night when the indoor fireworks set the entire New Year&apos;s Eve takings up in smoke. He once said sadly that it would have been cheaper for the band \u2013 whose hits kept the club running \u2013 if they&apos;d handed everyone in the queue a tenner each and turned them away. The club was opened by the comedian Bernard Manning, who evidently didn&apos;t get the joke of inviting a man infamous for his sexist and racist lines to launch such a would-be cool venue. His remark &quot;I&apos;ve played some shitholes in my time but this is really something&quot; did not go down well, and he left without claiming his fee. The course promises to train students in skills which were entirely lacking in the early days of the Hacienda, including &quot;identifying and monetising viable music projects ... business planning, presenting and formatting music for commercial release ... as well as devising and executing marketing plans &amp; promotional campaigns.&quot; Student mentors will include Hook himself; Tony Rigg, former operations director of the Ministry of Sound; and Aaron Mellor of nightclub company Tokyo Industries, which now co-owns Factory251.

And the consensus is clear: we need to advance a &quot;greener&quot; economy, but we aren&apos;t moving fast enough to do so. Running up to the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, or Rio+20, 300 participants from the businesses, government, academia and civil society took part in the Green Economies Dialogue \u2013 a series of in-depth discussions focused on how to cultivate and maintain greener growth and jobs. The Green Economies Dialogue has taken place in Washington DC, Paris, Tokyo, Beijing, Brasilia and now Rio \u2013 and despite differing national priorities, there appears to be an emerging consensus on five key themes: 1. We need economic growth to create a greener economy. 2. All sectors must be involved in creating a greener economy \u2013 not just green jobs \u2013 and all jobs can contribute to a greener society. 3. Innovation is key for a greener society, not only in technology, but also in services, management, business models and financing structures. 4. Greening economies should be viewed in the broader context of sustainable development \u2013 together this can lead to economic and social development and environmental benefits. 5. Business will be the delivery engine for greener growth, but business and government need to work together to create enabling frameworks and public-private partnerships to speed progress. Businesses have expressed a desire for clearer, more stable policy frameworks in which to plan their longer-term capital investments. And throughout the series of dialogues, they have also provided policymakers with several examples in which the business drive for resource efficiency and supply chain resiliency enhances global environmental outcomes. Progressive businesses are already finding opportunities for green growth by reseting organisational boundaries and fully integrating sustainability into the core business. At PwC, my colleagues and I continues to lead businesses toward sustainable business solutions and prove that these efforts enhance their competitiveness in the marketplace while also adding value to society and the environment. The Green Economies Dialogue gives me hope that, with careful analysis of energy and environmental policies, business and government can come together and create economic frameworks that make our society sustainable and more resource-efficient without restricting economic growth. Rio+20 was a milestone in a public-private dialogue that will continue to evolve. As it does, here are a few priority areas for future conversations: \u2022 Begin to appropriately measure and account for the value of natural capital in business decisions \u2022 Foster innovation that leads to new, greener technologies, services and supporting structures \u2022 Maintain focus not just on green jobs and green growth but on making all jobs and every aspect of the economy greener Copy on this page is provided by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development"}, {"sentences": ["The tender document calls for bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2016 Olympics in Rio but also provides the option for broadcasters to tie up rights until the end of the decade, encompassing the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the 2020 Olympics in either Tokyo, Madrid or Istanbul."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "BBC", "Sports rights", "Media", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-26T21:01:01Z", "title": "BBC's Olympic rights under threat from new TV deal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/26/bbc-olympic-rights-new-tv-deal", "article": "Jacques Rogge, the International Olympic Committee president, has declared &quot;everything is possible&quot; when it comes to selling TV rights for the Games after London, raising the prospect of the BBC losing some or all of its coverage of the event. A wide range of bids from traditional free-to-air broadcasters, pay-TV companies and telecom providers is expected by the IOC when it tears open envelopes containing the bids on Friday. It will then decide whether to go to a second round of bidding, as it seeks to maximise broadcasting revenue . The UK broadcasting rights, which are held by the BBC, are protected by listed-events legislation that guarantees it free-to-air coverage. But the IOC has confirmed that a pay-TV broadcaster such as Sky or a telecom company such as BT, which recently paid \u00a3738m for a slice of Premier League live rights, could bid in expectation of the legislation being altered, or to sublease some of the rights back to a free-to-air broadcaster. Alternatively, in the new digital landscape, there are many more companies which could potentially launch a free-to-air channel distributed via Freeview, cable, satellite and the internet. It is understood that ITV, Channel\u00a04, Sky and BT have also received the tender documents and are weighing up their options. Channel\u00a04, which will show the Paralympics this summer and bid for Formula\u00a0One rights, could be a surprise contender. The government, which shelved an ongoing review of listed events when it came to power, will review the situation again this year, when the entire analogue TV network had been switched to digital. Sources said it is unthinkable that the Olympics will not remain on the list in some form. But it is possible that they could follow the path taken by the IOC in reserving 200 hours of coverage for free-to-air TV (100 hours for the Winter Games) and broadcasting the rest through pay-TV or another platform. &quot;Everything is possible,&quot; Rogge told the Guardian. &quot;We just launched a tender, because this is an obligation by the EU. It is open to everyone \u2013 to public companies, private companies, free-to-air, satellite, mobile, even the possibility to sell them to an agent company that buys the rights and sells them on. The deadline is 29\u00a0June and then we will enter into negotiations with different companies,&quot; he said. &quot;We sold the rights to Sky Italy but for the summer Games it has an obligation to run 200 hours free-to-air and for the Winter Games 100 hours. They did not have the free-to-air capacity but they teamed up with Rai, who will take care of the 200 hours. We have many countries where that is the case. In many countries in Europe there is a complementarity between pay television and public television.&quot; Another option, said Rogge, is separating out the broadcasting, internet and mobile rights, and selling them to different players. The IOC has sought to maximise the value of the TV rights since turning its back on a deal with the European Broadcasting Union in 2008, through which the BBC held the rights for the 2010 Vancouver Games and London 2012 as part of a $700m pan-European agreement. The majority of European rights were sold to the sports agency Sportfive, but the six most lucrative markets \u2013 Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the UK \u2013 were carved out for direct negotiation. They have all been sold, apart from the UK. If it secures more than $71m from the UK auction, which should be a foregone conclusion, it will have raised more than $1bn from European sales. The tender document calls for bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2016 Olympics in Rio but also provides the option for broadcasters to tie up rights until the end of the decade, encompassing the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the 2020 Olympics in either Tokyo, Madrid or Istanbul. That was the route taken by the US broadcaster NBC when it tied up the US rights until 2020 with a $4.4bn bid in the face of competition from Fox and ESPN. In total, $3.91bn was raised from TV rights deals for the 2010 and 2012 Games, a significant increase on the $2.57bn raised from the previous four years. A further, more-modest increase is expected for 2014 and 2016. BBC insiders say that it is desperate to hang on to the Olympics, recognising their value as the sort of major event that binds the country and burnishes its public-service credentials. But it is also operating on a tighter sports-rights budget, having endured a 20% cut in the wake of the licence fee being frozen."}, {"sentences": ["Rogge disagrees, insisting the three contenders for 2020 - Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo - are strong ones, after the IOC decided Baku and Doha should not make the shortlist."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-26T21:01:01Z", "title": "London 2012 Olympics: Jacques Rogge relaxed about his final Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/26/london-2012-olympics-jacques-rogge", "article": "With exactly a month to go until the opening ceremony of a London Games that will be his last as International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge is in relaxed mood. But then it is hard to tell when the gnomic Belgian is not. Amid all the UK scrutiny of the \u00a39.3bn budget, the security fears, the danger of transport meltdown, the sponsors and the Games lanes, it is easy to forget that for Rogge and the IOC the preparations for London 2012 have been pretty stress\u2011free. There has been none of the last\u2011minute construction panic of Athens or the human-rights protests ahead of Beijing. Rogge, the former Olympic sailor who has been a calm hand on the tiller of the Lausanne-based organisation since his 2001 appointment, is effusive in his praise for Lord Coe&apos;s organising committee. On recent inspection visits to London, the IOC and Locog have been in lockstep. The IOC needs the London Games to be a success, not only to prove that hosting them is a risk worth taking but to show that all the promises around legacy, around a &quot;compact Games&quot;, around putting athletes first, were more than just\u00a0rhetoric. &quot;Organising the Games is always a difficult logistical challenge and you can have unforeseen circumstances to which you have to adapt. They are in budget and some of the contingency will remain, which is a good thing. And we have seen a lot of creativity. They know sport, they love sport and they have this added layer of creativity on top,&quot; says Rogge, who will stand down as president in September 2013. He is amused to note that Danny Boyle plans to bring village cricketers to the Olympic opening ceremony in his &quot;green and pleasant&quot; opening tableaux, and enthuses about the public reaction to the torch relay. So confident is Rogge that his only concern is the same topic that will obsess much of the country for the next month. &quot;Every drop of rain that falls now is good news,&quot; he says, in the hope of getting the worst of the British summer out of the way before 27\u00a0July. Rogge identifies three factors that he believes will turn a good Games into a great Games. &quot;Good organisation with good weather, the performance of the home team and gold medals up front.&quot; As such, he says, he will be cheering Mark Cavendish down the Mall \u2013 assuming he is not being challenged by a Belgian cyclist. &quot;The Canadians waited five days to get their first gold medal in Vancouver and then you get a sea change. People went to the streets, partying, having fun.&quot; The final key ingredient, says Rogge, is\u00a0iconic performances by iconic athletes \u2013 in other words, Usain Bolt needs to be on top of his game. Not everyone is yet sold on the vision for London&apos;s Games, however. There are those who find the \u00a39.3bn taxpayer\u2011funded budget unpalatable in austere times and there are those who believe the modern Games is a heavily branded corporate monster, devouring a city in which it is staged before moving on to the next. It is a charge that Rogge is well used to defending. &quot;We are often interrogated about the fact the Games should be commercialism free and shouldn&apos;t be sponsored. I always argue that would take us back to the unfair and elitist atmosphere of the Olympic Games before the 1960s,&quot; says Rogge. &quot;There was no sponsorship, no TV rights. The result was that only the rich countries could send athletes, developing countries did not send one athlete.&quot; Rogge, once a keen rugby player who also became a big cricket fan after spending time with relatives in Cornwall in his youth, says the explosion in value of sponsorship and broadcasting rights has been used towards the staging of the Games (a third of Locog&apos;s \u00a32bn privately raised budget comes from the IOC) and underpinning the global groth of the Olympic movement.With weary resignation, he admits that the Olympics have become a lightning rod for protest. &quot;We are supposed to cure all the ills of society and the world, every problem. We&apos;ve been addressed for many, many problems \u2013 animal rights, social rights,&quot; he says. &quot;People say the IOC has to take a position on everything. We are a sports organisation. We are not autonomous from society, we are part of society. We reflect society, the good points and the bad points.&quot; Another spectre that has haunted successive Games has been thrust back into the spotlight. The court of arbitration for sport verdicts against IOC and British Olympic Association rules that provided for an &quot;additional sanction&quot; for drug cheats, but were incompatible with the global anti\u2011doping code, mean that the spotlight will be on the likes of LaShawn Merritt and Dwain Chambers. &quot;If I cross paths with Dwain Chambers and he wants to shake hands, I will shake hands and wish him well. You have to treat him normally, that&apos;s the rule of law,&quot; says\u00a0Rogge, who is hopeful that the new 2013 Wada code will reintroduce the ability to ban athletes for two years plus the following Olympic Games. On another contentious issue, he is also confident that Saudi Arabia will become the final country to ensure gender equality and send male and female athletes to\u00a0the Games. There are believed to be two\u00a0women in line for places, with\u00a0the IOC awaiting confirmation of their nomination from the National Olympic Committee. &quot;We believe if there is a woman participating that will be a big symbolic event. You can&apos;t expect a country to change overnight its cultural, social, political fabric. Whether we like it or not, this is a fact of life. It will take time, but this is the first step,&quot; says Rogge. London was also supposed to provide a template for reducing the cost of staging the Games, but the public cost has still risen to \u00a39.3bn. Rome&apos;s decision to pull out of the race to host the 2020 Games raised fears that it would be increasingly difficult to find cities prepared to take the gamble. Rogge disagrees, insisting the three contenders for 2020 - Istanbul, Madrid and Tokyo - are strong ones, after the IOC decided Baku and Doha should not make the shortlist. &quot;We made good progress. The first thing I did in 2002 after my election was to put a cap on the number of athletes and to put a cap on the number of sports. We took more than 100 different measures to reduce the cost of the Games. This has resulted in a positive result in the worst economic crisis since 1930. We still had six countries reduced to five after Rome pulled out. And we still had five countries that we reduced to three with the shortlist. If you look at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, you have six candidate cities [including Glasgow]. Already I hear for 2022, that Oslo is a candidate, that Switzerland will have a candidate, that the Americans are considering. Overall, the size of the Games is OK,&quot; he says. Baku and Doha were simply &quot;not ready&quot;, he says. The 70-year-old has built his reputation on being an anti-Sepp Blatter, cleaning up the IOC&apos;s reputation in the wake of the Salt\u00a0Lake City bribery scandal and attempting to guard against excessive expansion \u2013\u00a0putting a cap on the number of athletes (10,500) and sports (26) included in the Games. That reputation, however, has come under renewed threat amid allegations that for some confirm existing prejudices about the closeted world of the global sporting &quot;blazerati&quot;. Though keen to emphasise that the national Olympic committees from 54 countries implicated in selling tickets on the black market are technically independent of the IOC, Rogge recognises that is not a distinction the public will make. He says he cannot prejudge the outcome of the IOC&apos;s ethics commission but is &quot;determined the affair will not be swept under the carpet&quot; and insists &quot;those found guilty will be heavily punished&quot;. Regardless, he is sure that once the Olympic circus has left London the doubters will be convinced, pointing to research conducted either side of the 2008 Beijing Games. &quot;The difference between appreciation before and after was unbelievable. The people who have seen the Games say: &apos;This is valuable.&apos; The ones who are against it in the UK will definitely change after the Games. There is no doubt about that.&quot; Rogge is equally upbeat on the controversial legacy commitments made by London to secure the Games. He says there is already a regeneration legacy, even before the opening ceremony, and is &quot;very optimistic&quot; there will be a legacy for sports participation too \u2013 despite serious doubts over the ability of an Olympics to inspire people off their sofa and into the pool. &quot;You need a lot of things to have sports participation. You need the responsibility of parents, there is no kid that will go alone to a sports club at 10 or 11. You need a good sports policy from the public authorities and, for me, you also need another approach to sport from the sports clubs,&quot; he says. &quot;They need to compete against the internet, against computer games, against Facebook and Twitter. They have to attract and retain people. But the Games are definitely a big boost to that. There will be a good legacy in terms of youth sport, the awakening of interest among young people.&quot; As for his own legacy, Rogge usually refuses to engage in the question. But contemplating the end of his tenure, he appears minded to muse on his contribution. &quot;I will be happy if after London the athletes who have participated in the Olympic Games on my watch will say: &apos;These were good Games.&apos; This is our core business. I think young athletes will in future be happy with the Youth Olympic Games and I think they will be very important for the development of the Olympics. I hope the athletes will say he did a good job in the fighting against doping and match fixing, because this is becoming a major threat,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope my colleagues in international federations, NOCs and organising committees will be able to say we raised good revenues that were distributed to them.

Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the City regulator, said that a &quot;number of other significant cross-border investigations in this area&quot; were under way involving other banks. &quot;The action against Barclays should leave firms in no doubt about the serious consequences of this type of failure,&quot; she said. The bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are among those co-operating with the authorities. The total fines levied against Barclays reach \u00a3290m when penalties to settle actions with the US department of justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are included. They follow an investigation of the activities of its traders in London, New York and Tokyo. Bob Diamond, the chief executive of Barclays, insisted that the events &quot;fell well short of the standards to which Barclays aspires in the conduct of its business&quot;. &quot;When we identified those issues, we took prompt action to fix them and co-operated extensively and proactively with the authorities,&quot; Diamond said in a statement. He and the chairman Marcus Agius spoke to shareholders to try to reassure them about the impact of the affair, which could have resulted in an \u00a385m fine from the FSA if the bank had failed to co-operate. One investor said: &quot;The company needs to urgently convince shareholders that this is not symptomatic of wider ethical business failures.&quot; Barclays refuses to disclose how many employees were caught up in the affair and how many have left or face disciplinary action, although it is known that some employees connected to the affair have left. The account of the long-running saga provided by the CFTC showed that Barclays attempted to manipulate, and made false reports concerning, two global benchmark interest rates &quot;on numerous occasions and sometimes on a daily basis over a four-year period, starting as early as 2005&quot;. The benchmarks referred to are the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor). They are used by the financial industry to set the rates of interest that households and major companies pay to borrow. Banks are asked which rate they think they will be able to borrow from each other for periods of time ranging from overnight to 12 months in currencies including sterling, US dollars, euros, yen and Swiss francs. The rates are then submitted to the British Bankers&apos; Association which publishes the &quot;fix&quot; each day. The actions against Barclays show how crucial the rate became during the financial crisis when the management of the bank was worried about the negative publicity surrounding the higher rates it was submitting compared with its rivals. In October 2008, in the days before other banks were bailed out, a &quot;submitter&quot; \u2013 one of the Barclays traders responsible for submitting rates \u2013 remarked that &quot;manager E asked me to put it lower than it was yesterday \u2026 to send the message that we&apos;re not in the shit&quot;. The FSA admits that a miscommunication may have occurred after a conversation between Barclays management and the Bank of England. &quot;No instruction was given to Barclays to lower its Libor submission during this telephone conversation. However, as the substance of the telephone conversation as relayed down the chain of command at Barclays, a misunderstanding or miscommunication occurred. This meant that Barclays submitters believed mistakenly that they were operating under an instruction from the Bank of England to reduce Barclays&apos; Libor submissions.&quot; The other part of the offence relates to the breakdown in systems controls at Barclays that allowed interest rate traders to work with &quot;submitters&quot; to make the rates suit the traders&apos; and the bank&apos;s purposes. It was not until 20 May 2009 that requests to submitters were rebuffed by an email that said: &quot;Sorry I can&apos;t do that \u2013 compliance would have a real issue with that.&quot; The impact went far beyond London. David Meister, the CFTC&apos;s director of enforcement, said: &quot;The American public and our markets rely upon the integrity of benchmark interest rates such as Libor and Euribor because they form the basis for hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions.&quot; Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister, said that the regulation of Libor arrangements now needed to be reviewed. &quot;We need to know what the government plans to do to prevent traders manipulating the independent interest rates between the banks for their own advantage.&quot; said Leslie."}, {"sentences": ["Jeffrey Sachs&apos;s famous arrival in Bolivia to visit shock therapy on an unsuspecting population is only the most famous of all the blueprint approaches typical of the neoliberal era of western aid, written behind a Washington or Tokyo desk."], "tags": ["Aid", "The future of development", "Global development", "Brazil", "Americas", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-28T06:00:01Z", "title": "Western donors could learn from Brazil's new brand of development aid | Jonathan Glennie", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jun/28/western-donors-brazil-development-aid", "article": "Technical advice and capacity building have been central to much of western aid over the past few decades but examples of success are hard to come by. On a recent visit to Brazil I was struck by the confidence with which many of those involved in fleshing out what might be described as the Brazil model of south-south co-operation insisted that they would succeed where so many had failed. I was not entirely convinced \u2013 some of the problems of the aid relationship (related to power, ownership, culture and information) are fairly intractable however you go about seeking to resolve them. But there is one aspect of the Brazil model that made me cautiously optimistic that it may be more effective than traditional donor approaches: the limiting of scope to areas of direct and recent experience. Brazil exports success. Rather than advising governments on what should work, the hallmark of much western advice for decades, Brazilian co-operation is based directly on what manifestly has worked. Understanding the agriculture sector in the past 10 years or so has been the mainstay of Brazil&apos;s economic and social progress. While presidents Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff have kept well away from any deep land reform \u2013 much to the despair of their critics on the left \u2013 radical investments in small-scale farmers, to complement the continued might of mega-plantations, has led to increased food supply, reduced hunger in rural areas and, crucially, stimulated internal demand, with knock-on effects for the rest of the economy. The technology, research and policy ideas associated with this progress forms the core of Brazil&apos;s agriculture co-operation, about a quarter of its aid effort. In health, Brazil&apos;s second largest co-operation sector, the human milk bank is a flagship initiative demonstrating how milk can be donated by mothers, categorised according to its nutritional quality, and supplied to premature babies. The zero hunger strategy linking social safety nets to school attendance is another of Brazil&apos;s proudest achievements, and one that it is working actively with the World Food Programme to share with other countries. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) donors claim to have expertise on all aspects of development, from budgeting to education, resolving conflict, ending maternal mortality and everything else, but their actual experience of such issues in a development context is a distant memory at best. In contrast, Brazil, like other southern countries, is still contending with extreme poverty at home, especially in the rural north-east, so it knows the challenges first-hand. Brazil&apos;s experts are not part of an overpriced development industry, but are drawn directly from the sector ministries and give their time as part of their regular salaried jobs. The people responsible for success at home are the very ones sent abroad, providing a direct link and plenty of experience to share with counterparts, with the Brazilian Co-operation Agency playing only a co-ordinating role. Although many traditional development consultants and advisers are true experts in their fields and make an incredible contribution to foreign countries, it is hard to deny that the cult of the western expert has been counterproductive as often as it has proven useful. When I left university a number of my friends went to work for management consultancies and within a few months were advising companies on how to run their businesses better. This is not unlike some of the western consultants doing the rounds in developing countries. Jeffrey Sachs&apos;s famous arrival in Bolivia to visit shock therapy on an unsuspecting population is only the most famous of all the blueprint approaches typical of the neoliberal era of western aid, written behind a Washington or Tokyo desk. Brazil&apos;s new breed of development practitioner has a rather different experience of development from that of most westerners \u2013 that of recipient rather than donor. When the US sought to implement its flagship Aids programme, Pepfar, in Brazil, &quot;no one asked what our needs were, and there was little concern for sustainability&quot;, says one senior health official. Brazil eventually rejected Pepfar money because of policy disagreements. So Brazil is committed to tailoring its support to country needs \u2013 but isn&apos;t that what everyone says? Again, there are two reasons tentatively to hope that the Brazil model may be different. First, while OECD donors feel the need to engage with all countries, including fragile and conflict ones, both for development and political reasons, Brazil feels no such responsibility, thus relieving itself of the hardest development conundrum \u2013 how to achieve change in a country where the conditions are not right. It is demand driven, meaning that only countries already keen on its way of working will come looking, filtering out those with whom tensions might arise. Second, the promise of hard cash can distort so many otherwise promising relationships, including between countries. According to Mauro Figueiredo, who is responsible for many of Brazil&apos;s 120 health projects worldwide, &quot;money can get in the way&quot; of the crucial process of dialogue. Brazilian co-operation deals with far smaller sums of money than western aid; while more money is needed to bolster and expand Brazil&apos;s co-operation activities, it is not the central part of the deal. I am aware of the danger of idealising a new approach simply because the old one has so many flaws. When money and national interests enter the equation more fully, when some of the intractable contradictions of &quot;country ownership&quot; emerge, when the public in Brazil and the host country start to request impact evaluations of projects carried out with taxpayers&apos; money, Brazil may find that it runs up against the same kind of harsh realities that have dogged technical co-operation for decades. But for now, it would be churlish to seek to undermine the confidence with which this new power is seeking to learn from the past and do things differently."}, {"sentences": ["When he and Luis Figo co-hosted a press conference in a Tokyo hotel, Beckham was ushered to an ostentatious gold throne and Figo to a normal chair placed to its side."], "tags": ["David Beckham", "Olympics 2012: football", "Olympic Games 2012", "Team GB", "Football", "Sport", "Stuart Pearce", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-28T14:10:45Z", "title": "David Beckham has had his moments in the sun. It is time to move over | Louise Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/28/david-beckham-london-2012", "article": "When Barack Obama held a White House reception for David Beckham and his Los Angeles Galaxy team-mates in May, the president of the United States briefly seemed mildly taken aback. When talk turned to the prospect of Beckham playing for Stuart Pearce&apos;s Great Britain side at the Olympics, Obama reminded the former England captain that he was old enough\u00a0to have fathered several of his potential team-mates, most of whom are under 23. Beckham is 37. At that age the majority of outfield players have long since retired, which is very possibly what the former Manchester United winger would have done a couple of seasons ago had he still been playing in the intensity of the Premier League or La Liga rather than amid the sunnier, appreciably more relaxed, environs of California. There are rare exceptions to this rule. At 38 Ryan Giggs still gets a game for United but at Old Trafford he is surrounded by younger, faster, fitter colleagues. In naming Giggs in his squad Stuart Pearce, the GB coach, effectively left himself no option but to exclude Beckham. Two midfield slow-coaches would be one too many, especially if you aim to actually win the tournament. Pearce travelled to California at least twice to watch Beckham in action, most recently a couple of weeks ago when, in Carson, he saw LA Galaxy beat Portland Timbers 1-0 in the MLS, with the winner\u00a0created courtesy of a corner from guess who? Although Beckham now suffers from a chronic lack of pace and mobility, even if he can still unleash a few Pirlo-esque passes, there was arguably a case for naming him in the squad on exceptional dead-ball ability alone. Giggs, though, is currently a bit more versatile \u2013 as well as possessing the added benefit of being Welsh and thereby bringing geographical balance to the squad. His critics may question his tactics at times but everyone agrees that Pearce is refreshingly honest and very much his own man. Having watched Beckham in action he clearly decided he would not be right for his squad and that Giggs, Craig Bellamy and Micah Richards would make more impact as the three permitted over-age players. In many ways the antithesis of the celebrity culture which surrounds modern football, Pearce is also among the least likely to have been swayed by Beckham&apos;s fame. Indeed he may instead have harboured real concerns about the media circus which invariably surrounds a man who appears to spend as much time modelling underwear and cosying up to politicians and royalty as actually playing football these days. Although he is, by all accounts, a decent person and in some respects a fine role model, Beckham&apos;s celebrity can do strange things to delicate dressing-room ecosystems. Back in 2003 some England players were criticised for not accepting an invitation to meet Nelson Mandela when they played a friendly against South Africa in Durban. Those who stayed behind at the team hotel did so partly because they were fed up with the whole &quot;Beckham circus&quot; and questioned precisely why the meeting with Mandela had been engineered. The same year Beckham joined Real Madrid from Manchester United. On the pre-season tour of the Far East his new colleagues were clearly taken aback by the added scrutiny and generally craziness that his presence generated. When he and Luis Figo co-hosted a press conference in a Tokyo hotel, Beckham was ushered to an ostentatious gold throne and Figo to a normal chair placed to its side. The Portuguese was having none of it. &quot;I am Luis Figo,&quot; he said as, much to the horror of his Japanese hosts, he sat down on the throne and told Beckham to take the chair. There may not be too many Figo-sized egos among Pearce&apos;s Olympic party but Beckham&apos;s predilection for the limelight could well have provoked a muttering of discontent. Moreover the potential chemistry between the LA Galaxy midfielder and the notoriously straight-talking Craig Bellamy \u2013 another overage Welshman in the squad very much on merit \u2013 may have proved combustible. Pearce, being Pearce, would have overlooked such potential problems if he believed Beckham could help deliver a meaningful campaign. Instead he clearly feels that the extra midfield place could be more profitably utilised by a young player who will gain invaluable tournament experience. Some Olympic ticket holders may be disappointed by Beckham&apos;s absence but after being excluded from the senior England coaching setup by the manager Roy Hodgson and with his Under-21 side facing a tough-looking European Championship finals in Israel next summer, Pearce cannot be worried about upsetting anyone. Moreover, in this age of spin, shallow celebrity and, above all, commercial greed, everyone should be grateful that the GB team is being managed by a man of principle. Beckham has enjoyed sufficient moments in the footballing sun \u2013 it is now time to offer someone else a turn."}, {"sentences": ["Beastie Boy Ad-Rock \u2013 real name Adam Horowitz \u2013 has performed at a Pussy Riot benefit in New York; the US punk band Anti-Flag have released an English-language cover of the controversial Punk Prayer, and the Tokyo Palace in Paris has opened an exhibit on the jailed rockers."], "tags": ["Russia", "Europe", "World news", "Protest", "Vladimir Putin", "Pussy Riot"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-30T11:21:21Z", "title": "Russians join in call for Pussy Riot trio's release", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/30/support-pussy-riot-trio", "article": "Artists and musicians around the world have called for their release. Now, nearly four months after three women were arrested for performing a protest anthem inside Moscow&apos;s most important Orthodox church, Christ the Saviour cathedral, a growing number of Russians are joining calls for their freedom. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Ekaterina Samutsevich and Maria Alehina \u2013 all members of the anarchic Pussy Riot punk band \u2013 have been in prison since March, held on charges of hooliganism which could eventually mean a seven-year sentence. Many Muscovites were happy enough to see a tough response to the band&apos;s irreverent act of rebellion, which was aimed at President Vladimir Putin. But with no trial date set, no signs that they will be released and opposition to Putin spreading, support for the trio has grown, even among those who at first condemned them. &quot;Their actions insulted me, because I&apos;m religious,&quot; said Alexander Ivanov, a popular musician. &quot;It&apos;s not what they said, it&apos;s where they did it. I was offended \u2013 but for them to get seven years in jail for an unsuccessful experiment, that&apos;s going too far.&quot; Ivanov is one of more than 100 cultural figures who signed an open letter last week calling on the state to release the women, in an indication that popular unease at their plight is growing. &quot;It scares me that, for a rather unsuccessful, but extreme, cultural experiment, they want to jail them for so many years,&quot; he said. &quot;Artists need to have freedom.&quot; Some of Russia&apos;s best-known opposition figures \u2013 satirist Viktor Shenderovich, poet Lev Rubinstein, musician Yury Shevchuk \u2013 signed the letter. Other names were more surprising, such as those of actress Chulpan Khamatova and actor Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom appeared in videos for Putin&apos;s re-election campaign earlier this year. Director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a prominent supporter of Putin&apos;s, also added his name. The signatories warned of the social divisions caused by the case, stating: &quot;While the participants in the performance have been held under arrest, an atmosphere of impatience has grown in society which will cause division and radicalism. We do not see any legal foundation or practical sense in further isolating from society these young women who present no real danger.&quot; Nearly 25,000 other supporters have added their names to the letter, which was published on the website of the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy. The domestic groundswell of opinion comes after a concerted international campaign. Beastie Boy Ad-Rock \u2013 real name Adam Horowitz \u2013 has performed at a Pussy Riot benefit in New York; the US punk band Anti-Flag have released an English-language cover of the controversial Punk Prayer, and the Tokyo Palace in Paris has opened an exhibit on the jailed rockers. Benefits have been held in Prague, Warsaw and Tallinn, where the Estonian president was in attendance. But such backing from Russia&apos;s cultural intelligentsia was until recently all but non-existent. Artemy Troitsky, Russia&apos;s premier rock critic, thinks similar acts in Russia would be impossible. &quot;We could put on a concert in support of Pussy Riot in a forest or something,&quot; he said. &quot;But in our police state it&apos;s not realistic to put on such a concert \u2013 it would be stopped.&quot; Troitsky, a harsh regime critic with a sharp, expletive-laden tongue, has instead gathered hundreds of artists to put together a series of albums to support the growing movement against Putin&apos;s rule \u2013 and to call for Pussy Riot&apos;s release. The so-called &quot;White Album&quot; has more than 350 artists so far; a proper album is in the works. Troitsky is hoping for songs, or messages of support, from stars such as Paul McCartney or Madonna, who will perform in St Petersburg in August. &quot;We&apos;re calling for honest elections, a fight against corruption, justice and freedom for political prisoners \u2013 Pussy Riot first,&quot; Troitsky said. &quot;They are the clearest and most undoubtable case of people arrested for political reasons.&quot; Last week Amnesty International again called for the release iof the three women, whom they have dubbed prisoners of conscience. The statement came after a Moscow court extended the trio&apos;s detention until 24 July. No trial start date has been set. &quot;The case is dragging on because they can&apos;t do anything \u2013 on the one hand, they can&apos;t let them go because it would be against Putin&apos;s order; on the other hand, they can&apos;t start the trial because they have no argument,&quot; Troitsky said. Putin criticised Pussy Riot&apos;s performance shortly after their arrest, which many in Russia took as a signal of his support for the criminal case against them. The longer it drags on, the more public acts of defiance grow. Last week, actor and director Olga Darfi strutted down the red carpet at the opening of Moscow&apos;s International Film Festival in a makeshift pink balaclava. &quot;I don&apos;t share their point of view and I&apos;m not aesthetically close to what they do, and maybe they deserve some administrative punishment,&quot; Darfi said. &quot;But that they&apos;re in jail is totally illegal. And we have to fight against this situation and create social pressure \u2013 if we do nothing then any of us can find ourselves in this situation. It&apos;s very dangerous.&quot;Pussy Riot shot to notoriety inside Russia with their flash performances of anti-Putin punk songs, accompanied by a revolutionary look of bright balaclavas and stockings. A February performance inside Moscow&apos;s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, dubbed Punk Prayer, led to their arrest. The anti-government lyrics, delivered in the heart of official Orthodox Christianity, shocked the nation. The powerful Orthodox church has continually attacked the band. Last week its spokesman, Vsevolod Chaplin, said that God had told him in a divine revelation that he &quot;condemns what they have done&quot;. He added: &quot;This sin will be punished in this life and the next.&quot;The signatories of the open letter in support of Pussy Riot warned of the social divisions caused by the case. &quot;While the participants in the performance have been held under arrest, an atmosphere of impatience has grown in society which will cause division and radicalism. &quot;We do not see any legal foundation or practical sense in further isolating from society these young women who present no real danger,&quot; the letter said.

This month we are looking at sports photography, in particular a photo of Ann Packer and Robbie Brightwell at the Tokyo Summer Olympics in 1964. Observer photograph of Ann Packer and fiance Robbie Brightwell at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, 1964 The photograph was taken for the still very new Observer Magazine, which was first published in September 1964. The magazine was in colour, and a colour feature was commissioned on the Tokyo Games, which were held in October that year. However, in the end, the 1964 Olympics received little coverage in the magazine. The archive holds the many of the original transparencies for an Olympics story which remain unpublished. While the Observer Magazine did not give as much space as originally intended to the Games, 1964 was a successful year for British athletes in Tokyo. The team had a total medal haul of 18, including 4 golds and 12 silver medals, putting it (just) in the top ten on the medal table for that year. Runners Ann Packer and Robbie Brightwell both contributed to this success. Packer and Brightwell were engaged at the time, and both were bright medal hopes for the British team in the 400 metres. Brightwell was captain of the men\u2019s British Olympic team and Packer had run the fastest 400m time in the world that year. Though both were expected to win their 400m races, neither did. Brightwell came fourth, and Packer was beaten by Betty Cuthbert of Australia, and had to settle for silver. The pair had more success in their next events. Brightwell went on to win a silver medal in the men\u2019s 400m relay, where he ran the crucial final lap that took the team from fourth to second place. However Packer\u2019s story in the 1964 Games turned out to be extraordinary.  Despite having never run in an 800 metre race internationally before, Packer took the third spot in the British team for this event. In the build up qualifiers and her Olympic heat, she ran unimpressive times, coming fifth in the heat, and running two seconds slower than the French favourite, Maryvonne Dupureur in the semi finals. In the final she was the slowest competitor going in.  By the halfway point of the race, Packer was in sixth place, but \u201chaving to go the long way round\u201d as BBC commentator David Coleman put it, she then overtook the pack, running round the outside, and at the very last, switched to a sprint speed to triumph, finishing almost a second faster than Dupureur. She was the first British woman ever to win an Olympic gold medal in a track event, and ran a world record time of 2:01.1. Packer\u2019s achievement has gone down in history as one of the great sporting moments. Her 800m win was featured as one of the Guardian\u2019s 50 stunning Olympic moments. At a time when even the gold medal hopes for track events did not expect to make a living from their sport, both Packer and Brightwell were teachers professionally. Packer has talked about how it was difficult to fit training around her work life as a PE teacher. After their successes in 1964, despite only being 22 and 24 years old respectively, Packer and Brightwell both retired from competitions, and were married that December. A Reuters news wire from the time describes the Olympic themed wedding, with a gold and white colour scheme (Packer even had a gold lame lining to her train) and a six foot high wedding cake decorated with Olympic rings, and replicas of the pair\u2019s gold and silver medals. They had three sons, all of whom were sportsmen. George Brightwell became a 400m runner like his parents, and Ian and Dave both played football for Manchester City. It was another 40 years before another woman, Kelly Holmes, won a track gold medal for Great Britain at the Olympics.

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to make a statement to MPs on Monday, with Agius&apos;s resignation yet to puncture the political pressure on the bank. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is calling on the bank&apos;s chief executive, Bob Diamond, to quit and has stepped up his efforts to force the government to set up a Leveson-style inquiry into banks by bringing forward an amendment in parliament. &quot;I think there needs to be more a more general change of leadership including the chief executive, Bob Diamond,&quot; Miliband told ITV Daybreak. The bank put board director Sir Michael Rake, the former top accountant and serial company director, in the new key role of deputy chairman to oversee an audit of the bank&apos;s business practices, the findings of which will be published. A &quot;zero-tolerance policy&quot; will be adopted against staff who damage the bank&apos;s reputation and a new code of conduct drawn up, which all staff will need to adhere to. After a wave of political fury was unleashed by a record \u00a3290m fine for the bank&apos;s attempt to manipulate key interest rates, Agius described himself as the &quot;ultimate guardian of the bank&apos;s reputation&quot;. He said &quot;last week&apos;s events \u2013 evidencing as they do unacceptable standards of behaviour within the bank \u2013 have dealt a devastating blow to Barclays&apos; reputation. As chairman, I am the ultimate guardian of the bank&apos;s reputation. Accordingly, the buck stops with me and I must acknowledge responsibility by standing aside,&quot; Agius said. Rake is expected to be considered as a candidate to replace Agius in a search process that will be led by the former Cadbury boss Sir John Sunderland. The search \u2013 from within the existing board members and from outside \u2013 will begin immediately and Agius will stay until his successor is found. The process may be drawn out as the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, needs to authorise the candidate. The audit of business practices will be conducted by an external company, which will undertake a &quot;root and branch review&quot; of all the business practices since the credit crisis. &quot;This exercise will be part of a broader programme of activity intended to restore Barclays&apos; reputation and we will establish a zero-tolerance policy for any actions that harm the reputation of the bank,&quot; said Agius. &quot;I am truly sorry that our customers, clients, employees and shareholders have been let down. Barclays is full of hard working, talented individuals whose integrity is not in question.&quot; Agius, who earns \u00a3751,000 a year, is still expected to appear before MPs on the Treasury select committee on Thursday \u2013 the day after Diamond, whose role in the interest rate-fixing scandal will take centre stage after it emerged he had personally spoken to the Bank of England about the rates being set. The bank&apos;s annual report shows that the chairman can receive &quot;potential compensation for loss of office&quot; of 12 months&apos; fees. It was not immediately clear on Monday morning if any compensation would be paid. Diamond showed no signs of tendering his own resignation on Monday. Instead he expressed his gratitude to Agius. &quot;Marcus has shown a remarkable passion for Barclays and its people,&quot; Diamond said. But the pressure on Diamond remained. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: &quot;Bob&apos;s still got to go. Barclays simply isn&apos;t safe in his hands. The board is so hopeless they&apos;ve just shot the head of the firing squad and missed the prisoner.&quot; Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said Agius&apos;s departure would &quot;do little to appease the many who see Bob Diamond as having primary responsibility&quot;. The bank was fined for attempting to fix interest rates, known as the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the European equivalent, Euribor. These are two benchmarks that are the basis for pricing an array of financial products, potentially affecting the price at which households and businesses borrow money. The Financial Services Authority fined the bank \u00a359.9m, while in the US the department of justice and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission also imposed fines, some \u00a3230m combined. The offences took place in two ways. First, from 2005, Barclays traders tried to alter rates to help themselves and rival traders. Second, in 2008 \u2013 when Barclays raised concerns about Libor \u2013 the bank is said to have kept rates lower because higher levels might have been misinterpreted as suggesting the bank was facing financial difficulties. At one point, the documents released by the FSA showed that so-called submitters of the rates used to calculate Libor  believed they were operating under the instruction of the Bank of England. Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, spoke to Diamond at the time although the Bank of England made clear on Sunday it had not known about the problems with Libor. Fourteen Barclays traders in New York, London and Tokyo are implicated by the regulators but other banks are still the subject of investigations. RBS, for instance, has sacked four traders and up to 20 banks and financial firms are thought to be co-operating with international regulators."}, {"sentences": ["As for buildings I&apos;d have to say La Maison Rouge, La Palais Tokyo (both in Paris), BAC, Tricycle Theatre, Donmar Warehouse and The Bike Shed (in Exeter)."], "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Leadership", "Logistics", "Professional development"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-03T10:26:02Z", "title": "Arts head: Jay Miller, artistic director, The Yard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/03/the-yard-theatre-jay-miller-interview", "article": "What were you doing before The Yard theatre? I trained in Paris and then lived and worked in the continent for a short while. When I came back to England I worked in Newcastle (where I grew up) and lived in London \u2013 working away from the capital gave me space and creative freedom, while living in London (but not being from London) helped me observe what was happening artistically. You&apos;ve said you founded The Yard because you felt disillusioned with the state of British theatre \u2013 what did you find so wrong and how did that spur you on? When I moved to London there didn&apos;t seem to be a space in which risks could be taken. The fringe seemed to aspire to be a microcosm of West End productions rather than a place to fuel and challenge mainstream theatre \u2013 there seemed to be established formulae rather than experiment and all fringe spaces looked the same (black and small). We are in a moment of reflection \u2013 it&apos;s a moment to question what we are doing and how we do it and we want The Yard to be the artistic epicentre of that moment. The Yard is unique in that it&apos;s made with recycled and reclaimed material \u2013 how did the concept come about and how difficult was it to implement? The Yard started as a collaboration between theatre makers and architects. We spent a long time discussing what sort of space we wanted and the way it should look. We wanted something honest, raw and unique. The recycled materials is not really a comment about environmentalism (although we do of course try to keep our waste to a minimum) \u2013 we scavenged for materials because we didn&apos;t have any money to buy anything else. Most of the materials we used were free. We bought some old scaffold planks on the black market, we took some unwanted lino from the Olympic authorities and we found some disused chairs in local restaurants. We then bought some nuts and bolts and started to build. Architecture plays a big part in what The Yard is (the dressing room is a semi-transparent light box that sits in the bar) \u2013 why is it so important? Architecture is vital and fascinating \u2013 it affects our mood, behaviour, our experience and, in a theatre, it can affect art. We wanted The Yard to be a space that was different from every other theatre in London. We built something that looked liked a classical theatre in a post industrial landscape. We had a lot of requests to make the space flexible to enable us to programme &apos;immersive theatre&apos; but we decided to retain a classical form. It is not a black box (I don&apos;t understand why black boxes are so popular \u2014 they are so separate from our beautifully bustling city) and it seats over 100 people. Not too small, not too large. We wanted a space that felt inclusive; the seating is shaped like an amphitheatre so it hugs the stage. The theatre supports an open submissions programme \u2013 how does that work? We open up the programming to be as transparent as possible (like the dressing room). We give opportunities to artists who may have never made work before while simultaneously inviting more established artists to make work at The Yard \u2013 this process enables us to discover unheard, brilliant voices. Can you tell us a bit about the community work and partnerships The Yard is engaged in? We partner community centres in the East End of London. We rehearse in their spaces during the day and deliver workshops for free in the evening to the local residents. We want to make our work accessible for everyone, and we believe that if that work is made in our local communities it will make it easier for people to discover theatre. It&apos;s a method by which we can make the process of making art a little more public. And then in the workshops we share our skills with that public. What inspires you? People Who are your creative role models and what other theatres do you admire most? Some of the directors I admire are Howard Davies, Michael Grandage, Dominic Cooke and Rufus Norris, and the theatre makers I admire are Thomas Ostermeier, Tim Crouch, Rimini Protocol and Made in China. As for buildings I&apos;d have to say La Maison Rouge, La Palais Tokyo (both in Paris), BAC, Tricycle Theatre, Donmar Warehouse and The Bike Shed (in Exeter). The writer I have loved most recently is David Foster Wallace. What is The Yard up to at the moment and what does the future hold? We have just started The Theatre Of Great Britain \u2013 we thought we&apos;d take a moment to analyse what our fair and pleasant land might be. We have an Iraqi girl from Bradford telling a story about her love of Saddam, we have an exploration of street culture in London&apos;s Perverted Children, we have video games, we have dance. I&apos;m very excited \u2013 it&apos;s going to be remarkable. What piece of advice would you give any budding young creative directors out there? There isn&apos;t any money, so don&apos;t wait for it. Do something. What&apos;s the secret to running a successful theatre? I haven&apos;t been doing this job very long so I don&apos;t have many tips. But I can tell you what I&apos;m thinking about at the moment \u2013 how do we find the balance between giving people what they want and what we (as artists) think they need? This question effects everything \u2014 in our bar do we serve a specialised bottle of beer brewed in the Welsh countryside or a pint of Stella? Do we programme a musical or a challenging verbatim piece about youth unemployment? Answers on a postcard please. And one final thing I definitely know \u2014 work with people you like, trust and believe in.

The press are in town and it is not long before the question James Tindall, Simon Mantell, Matt Daly, Jonty Clarke and Stephen Dick were expecting to crop up is fired their way.   Related: Why Olympians shine under the spotlight    \u201cCan you name the players who won hockey gold for Britain 20 years ago?\u201d asks one of the reporters. \u201cSean Kerly \u2026\u201d comes the tentative response, followed by complete, collective silence. The reporters close in and one suggests British hockey has hardly made the most of that victory in Seoul in terms of keeping the sport in the public consciousness and that it is a real shame the heroes of 1988 have become so easily forgotten. Then, in what seems like a blink of an eye, one of the men in the blue and red Team GB tracksuits hits back: \u201cDavid Faulkner, Imran Sherwani, Stephen Batchelor, Ian Taylor, Richard Leman, Stephen Martin, Kulbir Bhaura, Paul Barber. And Kerly. Obviously.\u201d Raucous laughter suddenly fills the room and it is later pointed out that Tindall, Mantell and co are aware that others, such as the captain Richard Dodds, Jon Potter, and Martyn Grimley, also won gold two decades ago. Of course they had not been forgotten. How could they be? Seoul \u201888 is to British hockey what Wembley \u201866 is to English football, and then some. The triumph was the nation\u2019s first in the sport at that level \u2013 gold had been won by a purely English side at the 1908 and 1920 Games, in London and Antwerp respectively \u2013 and created instant heroes of amateurs who prior to the Olympics were barely recognisable faces in their own streets. Well perhaps Sherwani was \u2013 the scorer of two goals in the 3-1 final victory over West Germany had in 1988 also been a newsagent in Cobridge, Staffordshire. Unlike that of 1966, this success was also secured on foreign soil and in the particularly alien conditions of South-east Asia. Kerly and co not only beat Australia and West Germany en route to the high-point of their careers, they also overcame searing heat and exhausting altitude. Little wonder, then, that every generation since has been reminded of the heroes of Seoul. What took place in South Korea was, above all, a triumph for long-term planning and the art of using a slump as motivation to strive for greatness, twin processes which had their roots in the formation of the British Hockey Board in 1948. The organisation was put together in response to the individual successes of England, Scotland and Wales in the pre-war era and, initially, appeared a step in the right direction as Britain took silver at the 1948 Games in London, losing 4-0 in the Wembley final to an impressive India side. But from there a decline set in motion, beginning at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics when Britain finished up with a bronze medal on the back of a farcical period of preparation during which the BHB voted to withdraw the team from the competition only for officials from England and Wales to veto the move. There were no medals at all in Melbourne four years later, or in Rome in 1960, before things got really bad. Britain finished eighth at the Tokyo Olympics and then 12th in Mexico in 1968 before salvaging some pride with a sixth-place finish in Munich four years later. But humiliation was back in 1976, when the team were not even present for the Montreal Games despite the withdrawal of 25 African countries protesting at New Zealand\u2019s sporting links with South Africa. The team were also denied the chance to compete at the 1980 Moscow Games following the BHB\u2019s decision to adhere to the British Government\u2019s boycotting of the event. 1980 was, however, to prove a decisive year. Fed up with their decline, the BHB appointed the single-minded Roger Self as manager of the British team and gave him the time and authority to put together a gold medal-winning campaign. He, in turn, made what would prove to be the shrewd decision of hiring David Whitaker as the coach. The former Great Britain international had more than 100 caps to his name but very little coaching experience and, as such, was deemed a risky appointment. But Whitaker had a plan, one based on focusing on the mental preparation of his players to ensure they went into every match believing victory was in their grasp. The fruits of Whitaker\u2019s work was evident at the 1984 Olympics, when Britain won bronze after stepping in at the last minute following the USSR\u2019s withdrawal. They came through their five pool games in Los Angeles unbeaten before losing by a single goal to West Germany in the semi-final and then beating Australia, who had started the Games as favourites, 3-2 in the third-place match. It was a stunning performance from a side short on preparation but clearly not lacking in belief. More success followed at the 1986 World Cup when Britain, as hosts, finished with a silver medal, losing to Australia in the final at Willesden. By that stage the bulk of the side had been together for six years and, under Self and Whitaker, formed a collective sense of purpose based on improved performances. It was no surprise, then, that they headed to Seoul in buoyant mood. \u201cWe were seeded second for the Olympics but the only thing we wanted to achieve was the gold medal,\u201d said Sherwani. \u201cTwo years before, Britain had reached the World Cup final. We were so happy just to be there we neglected the fact that we were there to win it. The guys adopted a different frame of mind before Seoul. Our thoughts were firmly fixed on winning gold.\u201d The sense of destiny only grew after the goalkeeper Ian Taylor was chosen to be Britain\u2019s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony, but there then came a quick and sudden crash as the team were held to a 2-2 draw with South Korea in their opening pool game. A victory over Canada followed but then came a 2-1 defeat to West Germany, with the winning goal originating from the decision of the umpire, Don Prior, to award a rather dubious penalty to the 1984 silver medallists. A second defeat to West Germany at consecutive Olympics could have been taken as a sign that the gold medal was not going to be after all, but under the captaincy of Dodds, a full-time surgeon and part-time midfielder who had been leading the side since 1983, Britain rallied immediately with victories over the USSR and India to secure a semi-final place against the top-seed and favourites, Australia. It was in this match that Kerly\u2019s status as the star turn of British hockey was firmly established. Then aged 28, the striker was already highly regarded having scored seven goals during the 1984 Games, but a hat-trick against the Australians turned him into an overnight, national sensation, nudging Gary Lineker out of the spotlight following the England football striker\u2019s failure with the national team at Euro \u201888. Kerly had a bit of bite about him, too: the grammar schoolboy from Whitstable who swore occasionally was not afraid to raise his stick at an opponent. \u201cI was a bit rough around the edges and a bit feisty,\u201d he said. \u201cI was up for a fight with anybody. Oh, and my name was heaven for the headline writers.\u201d Britain, after all, were about to grab Germany by the \u201cSean and Kerlys\u201d, with their 3-2 win over Australia \u2013 they had led 2-0 before being pegged back to 2-2 \u2013 setting up a final showdown with the team of Heiner Dopp, Carsten Fischer and the towering forward Stefan Bl\u00f6cher. In front of a crowd of 12,000 at the Seongnam Stadium on a humid, early October day, history was in the offing. Self and Whitaker had instilled a level of confidence within the British squad which made them believe victory was possible over a team who had beaten them in their last two Olympic clashes, and their spirits were raised further after discovering Bl\u00f6cher had been ruled out of the match due to a blow to the head suffered in West Germany\u2019s 2-1 semi-final win over Holland. Along with belief there was also a tactical plan. The Germans were expected to play with a blanket defence in which 11 players would be placed behind the ball in a narrow, compact formation. It was decided, then, that Britain would attack from the flanks. The strategy quickly proved successful as Britain took a first-half lead with Sherwani\u2019s first goal of the game, which resulted from the player cutting in from the left wing, moving past two German defenders and striking the ball into an open net. The lead gave Britain motivation to attack with even more numbers, which pinned West Germany back but also left them vulnerable to the counterattack, and there were spells in the first-half when the opposition created chances to equalise. Fortunately, Taylor was having the game of his life while the defence in front of him was in commanding form, no one more so than Barber, who was earning his 99th and final international cap. Britain doubled their advantage in the second half thanks to Kerly\u2019s eighth goal of the tournament. The men in red, black and white were on top now and it came as little surprise when Sherwani made it 3-0, again coming in from the left-wing to slide in Batchelor\u2019s excellent cross from the right. That goal not only sealed a golden moment for Britain but also led to one of the most famous lines in TV sporting commentary: \u201cWhere were the Germans?\u201d said a delirious Barry Davies as Batchelor fell to his knees in celebration. \u201cAnd frankly, who cares.\u201d Dopp did score for Germany but it was no more than a consolation. Britain were Olympic hockey champions. \u201cI remember standing on the podium, looking down at the Germans on one side and the Australians on the other knowing we had won a gold medal \u2013 it was a big day for us,\u201d said Kerly, who like the rest of the squad returned to Britain as heroes. Television appearances followed and a brief but generally enjoyable moment in the national spotlight. \u201cIt was great fun,\u201d added Kerly, not surprisingly, perhaps, given his perks of celebrity included being paid \u00a32,000 for reading out a few words at a dry-cleaners\u2019 conference shortly after the Games.   Related: Hockeyroo Anna Flanagan snubbed for Rio despite clearance    Seoul was the culmination of an eight-year dream that turned into a glorious reality and, as such, it was no surprise that the team broke up soon after. Dobbs and Barber were among the bulk of players who retired while those who continued to play did so at a less vaulted level. Sherwani helped Leek hockey club reach domestic league status while Kerly, now a 52-year-old grandfather, still turns out for Canterbury\u2019s sixth team. Others continued to play a role in the national game, with Self becoming president of Great Britain\u2019s Olympic Hockey Board in 2005 and holding the position for two years, while Whitaker wrote three books on hockey coaching. Faulkner, meanwhile, is the performance director for GB hockey and has stated his belief that at London 2012 the men and women\u2019s teams can match the achievements of 24 years ago. \u201cThey both have the talent to do so,\u201d he says. Watching on will be Kerly in his role as a BBC pundit. And the man he will be speaking alongside? Barry Davies.

In a highly critical assessment published on Thursday, a Japanese parliamentary panel challenged claims by the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), that the triple meltdown at the plant in north-east Japan had been caused solely by a 14-metre tsunami on 11 March last year. The panel said the magnitude-9 earthquake that preceded the waves could not be ruled out as a cause of the accident. It accused Tepco and regulators at the nuclear and industrial safety agency of failing to take adequate safety measures, despite evidence that the area was susceptible to powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. &quot;The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,&quot; said the report, compiled by the Fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission. &quot;They effectively betrayed the nation&apos;s right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly &apos;man-made&apos;. &quot;We believe that the root causes were the organisational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions, rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual. &quot;Across the board, the commission found ignorance and arrogance unforgivable for anyone or any organisation that deals with nuclear power. We found a disregard for global trends and a disregard for public safety.&quot; The commission&apos;s chairman, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a professor emeritus at Tokyo University, said in a scathing introduction that cultural traits had caused the disaster. He said: &quot;What must be admitted \u2013 very painfully \u2013 is that this was a disaster &apos;Made in Japan.&apos; Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to &apos;sticking with the programme&apos;; our groupism; and our insularity. &quot;Had other Japanese been in the shoes of those who bear responsibility for this accident, the result may well have been the same.&quot; The 641-page report was published on the same day a nuclear reactor in western Japan became the first to produce electricity since the accident. All of the country&apos;s 50 functioning reactors had been switched off after the crisis to undergo safety checks. Japan, which once depended on nuclear power for about a third of its energy supply, was briefly without atomic power for the first time in more than 40 years after the last reactor went offline in early May. The No 3 reactor at Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture is the first to be restarted after passing stress tests that the government introduced last year to ease public concerns over safety. The government approved the restart of reactors 3 and 4 at Oi amid warnings that without them a large area of western Japan, including the industrial city of Osaka, could face power shortages this summer. The No 3 reactor should reach full capacity by 10 July, the plant&apos;s operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), said, while the second unit will begin producing electricity towards the end of the month. The last of the plant&apos;s 11 reactors were switched off in February. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the prime minister&apos;s office every Friday evening to protest against the restart, while polls show a majority of Japanese want the government to phase out nuclear power. &quot;We have made a step toward the safe and stable supply of electricity by being able to deliver nuclear-generated electricity for the first time in four and a half months,&quot; Kepco&apos;s president, Makoto Yagi, said in a statement. While not unexpected, the critical tone of Thursday&apos;s report contrasts with a similar investigation by Tepco in which the utility insisted it had acted appropriately in the wake of a natural disaster it claimed it could never have predicted. Tepco has always maintained that the damage to four of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s reactors was caused by the tsunami, which knocked out cooling apparatus and prompted a core meltdown in three of the units. More than 15 months later, the plant has been brought to a safe state known as &quot;cold shutdown,&quot; although concerns have been voiced about the state of a pool containing spent fuel rods in reactor No 4. Thursday&apos;s report called for an investigation into the role the earthquake played in the accident. &quot;As for direct cause of the accident, the commission reached the conclusion that we cannot definitely say any devices that were important for safety were not damaged by the earthquake,&quot; it said. &quot;We cannot rule out the possibility that a small-scale LOCA (loss-of-coolant accident) occurred at the reactor No 1 in particular.&quot; The panel was also critical of Naoto Kan, the prime minister at the time of the accident, whose &quot;direct intervention&quot; in the early days of the crisis had caused confusion in the chain of command and wasted valuable time. Kan has said he decided to intervene in the emergency response because Tepco and safety officials appeared incapable of doing so. The parliamentary panel said there was no evidence, however, to support Kan&apos;s claim that Tepco was preparing to withdraw all of its workers from the plant in the immediate aftermath of the accident.

In his combative preface to the report, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a medical doctor and professor emeritus at Tokyo University, said the crisis was the result of &quot;a multitude of errors and willful negligence&quot;, by the government, safety officials and the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco]. But behind the safety missteps and lack of readiness for a tsunami in a region known for powerful earthquakes, are cultural traits that ensured the disaster was &quot;made in Japan&quot;, Kurokawa said. &quot;Its fundamental causes,&quot; he wrote, &quot;are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to &apos;sticking with the programme&apos;; our groupism; and our insularity. &quot;What must be admitted \u2013 very painfully \u2013 is that this was a disaster &apos;Made in Japan&apos;. &quot;Had other Japanese been in the shoes of those who bear responsibility for this accident, the result may well have been the same.&quot; None of the agencies involved emerged with any credit. &quot;The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,&quot; said the report, compiled by the Fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission. &quot;They effectively betrayed the nation&apos;s right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly &apos;man-made&apos;.&quot; The panel&apos;s report, one of three major investigations into the accident, challenged claims by Tepco that the triple meltdown at the plant in north-east Japan had been caused solely by a 14-metre tsunami on 11 March last year. The panel said the magnitude-9 earthquake that preceded the waves could not be ruled out as a cause of the accident. It accused Tepco and regulators at the nuclear and industrial safety agency of failing to take adequate safety measures, despite evidence that the area was susceptible to powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. &quot;We believe that the root causes were the organisational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions, rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual,&quot; it said. &quot;Across the board, the commission found ignorance and arrogance unforgivable for anyone or any organisation that deals with nuclear power. We found a disregard for global trends and a disregard for public safety.&quot; The 641-page report was published on the same day a nuclear reactor in western Japan became the first to produce electricity since the accident. All of the country&apos;s 50 functioning reactors had been switched off after the crisis to undergo safety checks. Japan, which once depended on nuclear power for about a third of its energy supply, was briefly without atomic power for the first time in more than 40 years after the last reactor went offline in early May. The No 3 reactor at Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture is the first to be restarted after passing stress tests that the government introduced last year to ease public concerns over safety. The government approved the restart of reactors 3 and 4 at Oi amid warnings that without them a large area of western Japan, including the industrial city of Osaka, could face power shortages this summer. The No 3 reactor should reach full capacity by 10 July, the plant&apos;s operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), said, while the second unit will begin producing electricity towards the end of the month. The last of the plant&apos;s 11 reactors were switched off in February. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the prime minister&apos;s office every Friday evening to protest against the restart, while polls show a majority of Japanese want the government to phase out nuclear power. &quot;We have made a step toward the safe and stable supply of electricity by being able to deliver nuclear-generated electricity for the first time in four and a half months,&quot; Kepco&apos;s president, Makoto Yagi, said in a statement. While not unexpected, the critical tone of Thursday&apos;s report contrasts with a similar investigation by Tepco in which the utility insisted it had acted appropriately in the wake of a natural disaster it claimed it could never have predicted. Tepco has always maintained that the damage to four of Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s reactors was caused by the tsunami, which knocked out cooling apparatus and prompted a core meltdown in three of the units. More than 15 months later, the plant has been brought to a safe state known as &quot;cold shutdown,&quot; although concerns have been voiced about the state of a pool containing spent fuel rods in reactor No 4. Thursday&apos;s report called for an investigation into the role the earthquake played in the accident. &quot;As for direct cause of the accident, the commission reached the conclusion that we cannot definitely say any devices that were important for safety were not damaged by the earthquake,&quot; it said. &quot;We cannot rule out the possibility that a small-scale LOCA (loss-of-coolant accident) occurred at the reactor No 1 in particular.&quot; The panel was also critical of Naoto Kan, the prime minister at the time of the accident, whose &quot;direct intervention&quot; in the early days of the crisis had caused confusion in the chain of command and wasted valuable time. Kan said he decided to intervene in the emergency response because Tepco and safety officials appeared incapable of doing so. The parliamentary panel said there was no evidence, however, to support Kan&apos;s claim that Tepco was preparing to withdraw all of its workers from the plant in the immediate aftermath of the accident. But it accused Tepco of ignoring warnings going as far back as 2006 that a tsunami could cause a blackout at the plant. The firm, regulators and the government had &quot;failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements, such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans for the public in the case of a serious radiation release&quot;, it said. &quot;Since 2006, the regulators and Tepco were aware of the risk that a total outage of electricity at the Fukushima Daiichi plant might occur if a tsunami were to reach the level of the site.&quot; The 10-member commission is one of several panels investigating the Fukushima Daiichi accident.

The money would help keep the country afloat after most foreign troops leave by the end of 2014, taking with them generous budgets for building everything from roads to schools, and leaving behind greater concerns about accountability. But critics fear that there will be little way of holding countries to promises made in Tokyo, and argue that Afghanistan needs more than another headline-grabbing conference. &quot;Afghanistan has been subjected to a plethora of high-profile international meetings,&quot; William Byrd argued in a paper for the US Institute of Peace released ahead of the Tokyo gathering. &quot;If high-profile meetings and high-quality documents alone could solve a country&apos;s problems, the effort in Afghanistan already would have succeeded.&quot; The US has taken a back seat in preparations for the conference, after leading the Nato summit in Chicago in May that focused on security. Instead, it has been left to the EU and Japan to shape the meeting and round up promises of cash. The UK development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who underlined Britain&apos;s commitment to spend \u00a3178m a year on aid to Afghanistan until 2017, said finding that money was important for British security. &quot;Afghanistan faces enormous challenges in the years ahead, and will require significant long-term international development assistance,&quot; he said on a visit to Kabul ahead of the conference. &quot;If that is not forthcoming, the progress on security and development that I have seen for myself in areas like Helmand will be put at risk. This will have repercussions for Afghans, the region and us.&quot; Foreign aid has undoubtedly helped bring impressive improvements in education and health to a country where little over a decade ago girls were banned from school and there were barely 1 million students nationwide; now there are around 8 million, the Associated Press reported. But critics say funding was often poorly monitored and spent with more regard for donors priorities than Afghan needs, so the country is still desperately poor. And if Afghans most basic development needs are not met, spending on the army and police could be wasted, Michael Keating, the deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan has warned. Last year over a million people needed emergency help with access to drinking water alone, over a quarter of the population received food support, and over half the country&apos;s children are chronically malnourished. There will be representatives from around 70 countries and organisation at Sunday&apos;s meeting, and a key result is expected to be a &quot;road map of accountability&quot;. In return for the cash, they will hold Afghanistan to account on areas from protecting women&apos;s rights to rooting out corruption. There have been a string of high-profile graft cases in recent years, including a $900m banking scandal, but no high-profile convictions. Up to $1bn of the $8bn donated to Afghanistan over the past eight years has been lost to corruption, Huguette Labelle, chairwoman of anti-fraud group Transparency International, warned in an editorial in the New York Times. Afghanistan was listed last year as the fourth most corrupt country in the world. Diplomats and politicians across the west know voters are feeling the strain of economic crises back home and increasingly wary of sending funds to a country where their troops are no longer fighting, particularly if there is little evidence the cash is doing any good. &quot;We know Afghanistan will need continuous support and the EU is committed to that. But we are not blind and we feel a considerable fatigue among taxpayers in the EU and beyond,&quot; said Vygaudas Usackas, the EU&apos;s special representative for Afghanistan. He said the specific system to hold Kabul accountable for the funds it received was a &quot;game changer&quot;, after years of laxer spending."}, {"sentences": ["The conference in Tokyo on Saturday is designed to secure funding of $4bn a year for five years \u2013 the UK has pledged \u00a3178m per annum but ministers believe other countries must make substantial and firm commitments.", "Britain will still have a major role to play in the development of Afghanistan for decades to come.&quot; Mitchell, who is travelling to Japan, said: &quot;Tokyo is very much about showing support and giving confidence to the Afghan government that it won&apos;t be deserted by the international community following the transition and the drawdown of troops."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "Aid", "World news", "Military", "UK news", "Society", "Global development", "Nato"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-06T16:47:22Z", "title": "UK must not abandon Afghanistan after Nato pullout, ministers warn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/06/uk-must-not-abandon-afghanistan", "article": "The UK will have to play &quot;a major role in Afghanistan for decades to come&quot; to stop the country falling back into turmoil after military operations come to an end, two senior ministers have warned. Speaking on the eve of an international conference on Afghanistan, Nick Harvey, the armed forces minister, and Lynne Featherstone, equalities minister, also admitted the west could not expect Afghanistan to make advances in women&apos;s rights or human rights. They said the only way the west could help Afghanistan make progress in any of these spheres, and keep the country on an even keel, is to commit &quot;hard money and action on the ground&quot;, and not abandon the nation once Nato&apos;s forces have left in two years. Their warning comes at the end of a week in which three more British soldiers died in Helmand province after an Afghan policeman opened fire on them at a checkpoint. On Wednesday, the secretary for international development, Andrew Mitchell, said the &quot;green on blue&quot; attack was &quot;dreadful&quot;, but insisted such incidents must not deflect from the main task in hand. The Afghan government, he said, still needed to be convinced it wasn&apos;t being &quot;deserted&quot; by the international community. The aim of the donor conference was to reassure the Kabul authorities that they would not suffer the same fate as Mohammad Najibullah, Afghanistan&apos;s leader at the time of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 \u2013 who ended up hanging from a lamppost in Kabul. With the military effort under Nato&apos;s International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) winding down over the next two years, there is huge concern that countries that spent billions to wage war against the Taliban will not provide enough cash for aid and development. The conference in Tokyo on Saturday is designed to secure funding of $4bn a year for five years \u2013 the UK has pledged \u00a3178m per annum but ministers believe other countries must make substantial and firm commitments. Harvey and Featherstone, who are both Liberal Democrats, said the best way to ensure security in Afghanistan was to provide the money it needs for development, otherwise the country would start to take backward steps. &quot;Did we send British forces to Afghanistan to liberate women, build schools and government institutions, and persuade Afghans to grow crops other than poppies?&quot; the ministers said. &quot;No. We went as part of a Nato mission after 9/11 because the Afghan Taliban government gave al-Qaida a safe haven. &quot;Bin Laden may be dead, and his network diminished. But it would be wrong to be complacent about the threat re-emerging in Afghanistan if the state were to fail.&quot; They added: &quot;The Afghan government&apos;s ability to provide services to its people, including the rights of women and girls, are part of the picture in building a secure Afghanistan resilient in the face of violent extremism. It is not mission creep \u2026 it is about who the Afghan people trust to keep them safe. Development and governance go hand in hand with security in creating the conditions for peace.&quot; The reality was that the west cannot &quot;guarantee advancement in respect for human rights and gender equality&quot;. &quot;In May insurgents targeted a secondary school for girls, burning it to the ground. This will be an uphill struggle over a long period. But we have made absolutely clear our commitment to helping Afghan civil society, particularly around the rights of women and girls. Britain will still have a major role to play in the development of Afghanistan for decades to come.&quot; Mitchell, who is travelling to Japan, said: &quot;Tokyo is very much about showing support and giving confidence to the Afghan government that it won&apos;t be deserted by the international community following the transition and the drawdown of troops. It shouldn&apos;t be forgotten that the reason that the regime of Najibullah ended with him hanging from a lamppost in Kabul was not because he was defeated militarily, but because the Russians stopped paying the bills.&quot; Mitchell said Britain would maintain its current funding levels for Afghanistan but warned that if other donors did not show a similar commitment, the security and development gains of the past few years could be lost. &quot;We are also trying to ensure that the international community is crowded in behind this agenda, and that there are specific commitments, not vague commitments, and they are specific in terms of timing as well. Britain is seeking to put pressure on other countries \u2013 the US, Japan and Europe \u2013 to make the same commitments.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["8.46am:IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been speaking in Tokyo this morning, warning about the continuing downturn in the global economy and IMF downgrades."], "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Business", "Spain", "Italy", "Greece", "Germany", "Stock markets", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-06T17:20:00Z", "title": "Eurozone crisis live: Markets falling as Spanish bond yields continue to rise", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/06/eurozone-crisis-live-stock-markets-pressure", "article": " 6.19pm: This from DB&apos;s Q1 interim report: &quot;Deutsche Bank AG has received various subpoenas and requests for information from certain regulators and governmental entities in the United States and Europe ... in connection with setting interbank offered rates for various currencies&quot; And: &quot;In addition, a number of civil actions, including putative class actions, have been filed in federal courts in the United States against Deutsche Bank AG ... on behalf of certain parties who allege that they transacted in Libo-based financial instruments and that the defendants manipulated, through various means, the U.S. dollar Libor rate and prices of U.S. dollar Libor-based derivatives in various markets&quot;  4.41pm: Liborgate spreads its tentacles....

That seemed to be reinforced today by an interview with its finance minister. Now economist Nouriel Roubinin has looked at the prospect of Finland leaving the eurozone, the Fixit in the parlance. His conclusion?   A trigger to increase the chances of Fixit would be a decision by the eurozone to increase the potential losses and credit risk of the core members\u2014including Finland&apos;s\u2014via a fiscal and transfer union, debt mutualization and eurozone-wide deposit insurance. At that point, the forces pushing for Fixit may get the upper hand.   3.56pm: The US jobs figures announced earlier seem a bit Goldilocks - not cold enough to prompt action by the US Federal Reserve to boost the economy, not hot enough to make people think the recovery is happening. Having said that, some seem to think they&apos;re actually bad enough to prompt the Fed to act, University of Pennsylvania economist Justin Wolfers for one. Full story on our US live blog on the jobless numbers, but here&apos;s a taste:  My bet is that there&apos;s some sort of communication \u2013 a video conference or phone meeting, perhaps \u2013 occurring right now. So there&apos;s a good bet that we&apos;ll see a further round of quantitative easing, QE3, sometime tomorrow. If that forecast is wrong, then I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll act by the time they next meet.   Does he really mean tomorrow - Saturday - or could it wait until Monday once the weekend is over? That surely smacks of panic, which the markets are unlikely to cope well with.  2.57pm: Our City editor Jill Treanor has written about the SFO decision to investigate the Libor scandal. She says:  The decision to embark on a formal investigation appears to been taken quickly as on Monday the SFO had said it was considering &quot;whether it is both appropriate and possible to bring criminal prosecutions&quot;. &quot;The issues are complex and the assessment of the evidence the FSA has gathered will take a short time, but we hope to come to a conclusion within a month,&quot; the SFO had said on Monday.  You can read her full story here And with that, I&apos;m handing over to Nick Fletcher.  2.51pm: The risks from any direct financial assistance given by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to banks, like the payout for Spain&apos;s struggling institutions, would remain the responsibility of the country making the request, according to Reuters. It quotes an unnamed senior eurozone official saying: &quot;It remains the risk of the sovereign because you have the counter guarantee by the sovereign.&quot;The official added there would be an &quot;endorsement&quot; of a rescue for Spain&apos;s banks but no final agreement on Monday when finance ministers meet in Brussels. Dampening expectations, perhaps?  2.39pm: Libor scandal update The Serious Fraud Office has launched a formal investigation against Barclays over allegations of fixing Libor after the bank was fined \u00a3290m by the FSA and US authorities. That could make Chairman Marcus Aegius&apos;s questioning by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee next week, um, difficult. We can only imagine he&apos;s looking in the mirror repeating &quot;I cannot comment during the ongoing investigation&quot;  2.35pm: Back to matters closer to home. Here&apos;s some reaction to Ian McCafferty&apos;s appointment to the Bank of England&apos;s MPC to replace Adam Posen from Philip Rush at Nomura. He generally welcomed the appointment, although notes that the Treasury failed in its attempts to appoint a woman. He added:  With two ex-city economists, five career central bankers and one academic, he will become the closest thing to an industrialist the MPC has. So the perspective and experience he is bringing to the table may prove valuable to the MPC. It is too early to call what end of the &quot;avian scale&quot; Ian McCafferty will take to. While Chief Economic Adviser at the Confederation of British Industry, he made numerous dovish comments, but it is difficult to disentangle his own views from those of the industry body, whose members wanted looser policy. So he may not be that dovish at all. Indeed, the MPC&apos;s former arch-hawk Andrew Sentence (CBE) also once worked for the CBI, not that that commonality need extend that far. For now, we assume he is broadly in agreement with the path that the MPC is taking, but will not be the cheerleader for it that Adam Posen was.   2.06pm: For more information on the US job figures, check out our US team&apos;s live blog covering all the reaction from across the pond here  2.00pm: As analysts pore over the jobs report from the US, there&apos;s a mixed response to the below-expectation figures. One thing is for sure, all eyes now shift to the Fed for their 31st July meeting where Bernanke must decide whether to introduce QE3, or stick with his current plans to shift money around.

It seems the Finnish threats on the eurozone are now being played done. More details as we get them.  Denials right on schedule...RANsquawk: Reports of Finland threatening to quit the Euro are false according to the finance ministry \u2014 Open Europe (@OpenEurope) July 6, 2012   12.46pm: Italy&apos;s deficit cutting is actually ahead of the UK and US, says Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank. He adds:  The euro crisis may show up in sovereign debt markets, but the Eurozone&apos;s public debt is not more problematic than in other western countries. The Eurozone&apos;s 2011 public deficit of 4.2% of GDP was half that of the UK (8.3%) and even less compared to the US (9.6%). At 88% of 2011 GDP, gross public debt levels are similar to the UK (86%) and lower than in the US (103%). It is not the lack of adjustment, either. Italy is on track to meet the Maastricht criterion of a 3% budget deficit ratio this year, after 3.9% in 2011. Tax measures taken last year are bearing fruit and cut monthly borrowing to 2.9% of GDP in June 2012. Italy is far ahead the UK or US in terms of adjustment. The key difference between the Eurozone and other western countries is the role of the central bank. Many central banks have purchased vast amounts of government bonds to stabilise the financial system. The Bank of Japan&apos;s asset purchase programme stands at 15% of GDP, the US Federal Reserve&apos;s at 17% and the Bank of England has just increased its target to \u00a3375bn or 25% of GDP. The ECB has only bought 3% of GDP&apos;s worth of assets. Large-scale long-term liquidity provision to banks has expanded its balance sheet since 2008 by \u20ac1.6trn or 17% of GDP, but LTROs are not quantitative easing: they are largely substituting cross-country private interbank financing. The ECB leaves it to Eurozone governments to convince investors of the desire and ability to continue servicing their debt and sticks to its price stability mandate. This triggers front-loaded fiscal pain and reforms in the South and financial support from northern Europe where markets lose confidence. Without smoothing by central bank intervention, the process remains subject to considerable risks, not least the political risks of reform fatigue in the South and rescue fatigue in the North.   12.38pm: Here is a lunchtime round-up.  Rather worryingly, Spanish and Italian bond yields are back at pre-EU summit levels. The Spanish 10-year yield has broken through the 7% danger mark again, up 25 basis points at 7.038%. The Italian equivalent has risen through 6%, another important level - up 5 bps at 6.046%. Turning to stock markets, the FTSE 100 index in London is treading water ahead of key US jobs data, out at 1.30pm BST. It is down 0.4 points at 5692. Germany&apos;s Dax and France&apos;s CAC are both down 0.4%, while Spain&apos;s Ibex has tumbled 1.3% and Italy&apos;s FTSE MiB has lost 0.6%. UK producer price figures showed factory gate inflation easing to a three-year low, while Spanish industrial production data were pretty dire, down 6.1% in May. In Germany, output was up 1.6% month on month.  Here in the UK, American economist Adam Posen will be replaced by the CBI&apos;s economic adviser Ian McCafferty on the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee.  12.29pm: Adam Posen&apos;s replacement on the Bank of England&apos;s all-important Monetary Policy Committee has been revealed as Ian McCafferty. He is the chief economic advisor at the CBI and will have big shoes to fill when he takes over from heavyweight Posen, who has been a consultant on economic and foreign policy issues to several US government agencies, the European Commission, the UK Cabinet Office, and to the IMF. Posen has also been a member of the Panel of Economic Advisers to the US Congressional Budget Office, is a visiting scholar at various central banks across the world, has written six books and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and of the Bellagio Group of international economic academics and officials. McCafferty, who has been in his position at the CBI since 2001, is formerly Head of Macroeconomics at BP and Director of International Economics for Natwest Markets. Posen is off to head up the Peterson Institute in Washington.  12.04pm: Ahead of the US jobs figures (non-farm payrolls today at 1.30pm BST, after decent US employment figures from the ADP payroll company yesterday) experts believe the numbers will be up 100,000 month-on-month compared with a dismal 69,000 in May. Unemployment levels are expected to remain the same, with any strong rise likely to delay QE3. Here&apos;s some thoughts. Michael Hewson CMC Markets said  Even a positive US ADP employment report couldn&apos;t mask the concern felt in the markets that stimulus could well be running out of road. Disappointing US same store sales for June came in at their worst levels in three years yesterday, reflecting increasing concern about the economic outlook whatever consumer confidence numbers would appear to suggest.\u00a0 Today&apos;s US Non-farm payrolls report will offer important clues as to whether or not yesterday&apos;s ADP report was a one-off. Another poor jobs number could well raise expectations of further Fed easing, however given the market reaction to the combined central bank efforts yesterday you have to ask yourself how effective any Fed action would be.  Andrew Taylor at GFT Markets said  Tonight&apos;s final Non Farm Payrolls before the next FOMC meeting [that&apos;s Federal Open Market Committee] will be all about the expectations of the Fed announcing QE3. The current market sentiment is less panicked post EU Summit which means we would need to see a print less than the previous read of 69k for the Fed to move closer to what the equity and commodity bulls are after. An increase over and above the forecasted 90k should see Chairman Bernanke remove his finger from the panic button.  Ilya Spivak at DailyFX said  &quot;US economic data has increasingly underperformed expectations over the past two months, hinting investors are likely to interpret the result in terms of its implications for the likelihood of another round of Federal Reserve quantitative easing. &quot;Needless to say, a print that trumps forecasts can be expected to have the opposite effect as stimulus hopes fade. A pick-up in the service-sector ISM employment index as well as yesterday&apos;s firm ADP print seem to tilt surprise risk toward the latter scenario.&quot;  Chris Beauchamp at IG Index said  &quot;Expectations for today&apos;s job numbers are that the US economy added 100,000 jobs in June, forecasts having been increased yesterday after a stronger ADP employment report. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.2%. A stronger number would provide a much-needed boost to confidence, especially now that eurozone worries are creeping back in, with Italian and Spanish yields pressing higher once again.&quot;   11.39am: Our Rome correspondent John Hooper gives us a quick overview of Italy&apos;s woes and what it means for the country&apos;s 10 year bond yield going over 6%  The rise in Italian borrowing costs to 6% is a bitter pill for Italy&apos;s prime minister, Mario Monti, coming at a time when he is making much-resented savings. During the night, at the end of a seven-hour meeting, his cabinet agreed to cuts that aim to slice \u20ac26 billion out the budget over three years. Some will really hurt, like reductions in the number of hospital beds and the funds available for universities. The government&apos;s line is that the savings can be made by greater efficiency -- and there is certainly scope for that in Italy. But the politicians who back the Monti government (and keep it in power) are already squirming in discomfort, and it remains to be seen whether they can bear the electoral heat that is coming their way. Cuts directed at the public administration mean that for the first time Monti&apos;s non-party, technocratic government is taking on the country&apos;s super protected (and super-unionised) state employees. The number of Italy&apos;s largely useless provincial authorities is to be drastically reduced. And civil servants will no longer be able to count on a job for life. The government is going to have a tough time getting these cuts through. The fact that government bond yields should be rising against such a background underlines the degree to which they remain vulnerable both to generalised euro zone sentiment and the market&apos;s (understandable) fears about Italy&apos;s huge public debt (120% of GDP and still rising). But it also highlights the risks to the euro zone of not giving Monti what he tried to get from last week&apos;s EU summit -- a mechanism to hold down borrowing costs by means of credible intervention on the bond markets. A lot of Italian (and not just Italian) observers, perhaps influenced by Italy&apos;s 2-1 victory over Germany that night in Euro 2012, thought he too had emerged a winner. Subsequent comments by Angela Merkel and others suggest, however, that Italy&apos;s triumph on the field was a lot more clear-cut than the one in the conference hall.   11.25am: Some decisive news coming from Europe. In a newspaper interview, Finland&apos;s finance minister Jutta Urpilainen said the country would rather leave the eurozone than continue bailing out struggling countries. According to AFP, she said: &quot;Finland is committed to being a member of the eurozone, and we think that the euro is useful for Finland&quot;Finland will not hang itself to the euro at any cost and we are prepared for all scenarios. The country still has a prized AAA credit rating and fears any shared responsibility could damage that status.  11.11am: Spanish 10 year bond yields hit 7% Looks like any joy from last week&apos;s eurozone summit has well and truly gone. Reaction as we get it, but going past 7%, which means paying back effectively double what you borrow, is usually the trigger for a government bailout. Spain has already had a bailout for its banks but this could be more serious.  11.04am: Better news from Germany, where industry output was up 1.6% month-on-month. It was a huge leap by comparison with the consensus that growth would be just 0.1%. In understated fashion, Germany&apos;s economy ministry said industrial output remains &quot;solid&quot;.  10.59am: Back to Italy. It seems Italian banks have increased their holdings from the ECB. They held \u20ac281.4bn from the ECB at the end of June, up from \u20ac272.7bn in May.Funds borrowed rose last month to \u20ac11.7bn from \u20ac4bn in May.  10.52am: A fake Barclays bus stop advert is doing the rounds on Twitter. Along the lines of &quot;Barclays, best at fixed rates&quot; etc. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not real. But for a slice of irony and some light relief (hat tip to reader slackrabbit) here is a video of one of the bank&apos;s adverts from 2002 featuring Samuel L Jackson.  10.33am: Libor scandal update. The Bank of England&apos;s deputy governor Paul Tucker will appear before the Treasury Select Committee on Monday where he will no doubt be defending himself from accusations by Bob Diamond that a call to the bank caused the &quot;confusion&quot; that led to the interbank lending rate to be fixed. Tucker hopes to become the next governor at the BoE when Mervyn King steps down, but his rival for the top job, Adair Turner, FSA chairman will also be appearing - according to Reuters - in front of the committee of MPs to show off his credentials. Marcus Agius, the former non-exec Chairman, now executive Chairman, of Barclays will also give his Libor views on Tuesday  10.19am: Last bond post for a bit. Promise. BUT... Spanish 10 year bonds are getting dangerously close to the 7% level economists consider is unsustainable Current yield is 6.94% up 15bps Italian 10 year bonds 6.02% up 2bps The downbeat messages coming from banking officials can&apos;t be helping matters. IMF chief Christie Lagarde said earlier today the IMF is set to downgrade its forecast a day after Mario Draghi, ECB head, warned of &quot;heightened uncertainty&quot; in the eurozone. We will let you know if Spain hits 7%  10.07am: Here&apos;s some reaction to the UK PPI figures.  Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics said:  The hefty 10% fall in crude oil prices caused overall input prices to fall by 2.2% on the previous month. This pushed the annual rate of input price inflation into negative territory for the first time since September 2009. And while oil prices currently stand 4% above their average level in June, provided they do not rise any further, annual input price inflation is likely to remain negative well into next year. Meanwhile, output prices fell by 0.4% m/m, causing the annual inflation rate to ease from 2.9% to 2.3%.Given the relatively long lags involved, this points on past form to the potential for core consumer goods inflation to fall into negative territory in mid-2013. So, following a prolonged overshot of the MPC&apos;s 2% inflation target, it is becoming increasingly likely that we are now heading for an equally elongated period of below target inflation.  Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:  The June producer price data are benign, supporting hopes that consumer price inflation will head down appreciably further over the coming months. This would give the economy much needed support by easing the squeeze on consumers&apos; purchasing power. It would also facilitate further stimulative action later this year by the Bank of England should the economy fail to improve.  Chris Williamson at Markit said:  A key driver of lower prices has been the sharp fall in oil prices since their peak earlier this year. Brent crude, for example, dropped\u00a0more than\u00a025% between\u00a0March and June. At the same time, weak demand and over supply for many inputs has created a buyers&apos; market, meaning companies\u00a0have been able to\u00a0negotiate discounts with suppliers.\u00a0A concern is that\u00a0oil prices have crept up above $100 per barrel again recently, which\u00a0will inevitably\u00a0put some\u00a0renewed upward pressure on manufacturers&apos; costs in\u00a0the near future.   9.47am: The Bank of England&apos;s new financial risk watchdog published the minutes today from its quarterly meeting. Set up to avoid future boom and bust (where have we heard that before?) the minutes from the 22nd June meeting show the members have no concerns about conflicts when asking banks to reduce credit during the good times. They say  It was noted that the primary objective to protect and enhance resilience and the news secondary objective were compatible. Indeed, the committee&apos;s recommendations... over the past year had been specifically designed to build resilience while supporting lending and growth.  For those who can&apos;t remember, the Financial Policy Committee recommended last week that banks should feel free to tap into their cash piles to keep lending. Genius.  9.38am: UK factory gate inflation has eased due to lower oil prices, which will be welcome news to the Bank of England. According to official figures, producer output prices climbed 2.3% in June from a year ago, the lowest annual rate since October 2009, and below City forecasts. Manufacturers&apos; raw material and other costs fell back by 2.3% on the year - the biggest decline since September 2009.  9.31am: Good and bad news coming out of Spain. Bad: Industrial output fell for the ninth straight month in a row in May. It fell 6.1% year-on-year in another real-life example of the crippling effect the problems are having on the country Good: The 6.1% fall was less than the 8.5% that had been predicted, and was at a slower rate of decline compared with the 8.3% drop (year on year) in April. Production hasn&apos;t grown in Spain since February 2011.  9.17am: Here&apos;s some reaction to yesterday&apos;s big moves by the BoE, ECB and China&apos;s central bank to stimulate some growth. Most analysts and experts were unimpressed, but some were surprised by the reaction (or lack of) from the markets. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:  Yesterday&apos;s market reaction to the combined policy actions of the Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People&apos;s Bank of China is a worrying sign that the drug of central bank stimulus could be wearing a little thin as investors slowly come to the realisation that monetary policy could be starting to reach its limits... throwing more money won&apos;t remove the problem of banking systems buckling under increasing amounts of bad debt.   Another poor jobs number could well raise expectations of further Fed easing, however given the market reaction to the combined central bank efforts yesterday you have to ask yourself how effective any Fed action would be.  Andrew Taylor at GFT Markets said:  The overnight flurry of Central Bank action has done little to build confidence in markets as equities and commodities continued on with the negative lead set by the US.As the ECB and BoE fired shots from their depleted stimulatory arsenal, the PBoC decided to join the fray in what looks to be an uncoordinated effort with its counterparts.  Gary Jenkins at Swordfish Research said:  Three central banks taking action within an hour of one another to try and stimulate the economy and / or boost short term confidence and the market not only shrugged it off but it seemed to actually make matters worse in some areas.It was particularly interesting to look at Spanish bond yields. At one stage in the morning the 10 year was some 22bps higher but after the central bank action it recovered to be just a few basis points away from being unchanged. However it ended the day 36bps wider at 6.74%. So after all the intervention, from both the central banks and the European politicians in the last week, the 10 year is now just 17bps lower than where it was the night before the European summit decision.   9.00am: Italian 10 year bond yield rose above 6% in early trading, but has now settled below the psychological threshold at 5.98%.Over in Spain 10 year bond yields were up 5bps so far at 6.84%. Markus Huber at ETX Capital summed it up:  Of much more concern however seems to be the sharp increase in periphery bond yields after yesterday&apos;s Spanish bond auctions to levels not seen in two weeks. Slowly the optimism after the last EU summit seems to be vanishing and reality is setting in with weak growth, high debt levels and unemployment once again in the spotlight.   8.46am:IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been speaking in Tokyo this morning, warning about the continuing downturn in the global economy and IMF downgrades. She said: &quot;In the last few months, the global outlook has been more worrying for Europe, the United States and large emerging markets.&quot; The IMF will downgrade some of its economic forecasts later this month as economic data from major and emerging economies has deteriorated in recent months, she added. &quot;The IMF&apos;s forecasts are likely to be lower than our previous forecasts.&quot; Japan&apos;s Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the eurozone crisis was unfairly hitting the yen.He said: &quot;Market jitters on eurozone problems, especially one-sided yen rises that do not reflect Japan&apos;s economic fundamentals, are inflicting severe damage on economic sentiment.&quot;You can read Largarde&apos;s full speech here  8.28am: Here&apos;s today&apos;s agenda: \u2022 UK Producer Prices for June at 9.30am BST\u2022 Germany total industrial production for May at 11am BST\u2022 US employment report for June including non-farm payrolls, the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings at 1.30pm BST \u2022 The Bank of England publish the minutes from the latest Financial Stability Committee meeting\u2022 ECB Chair Mario Draghi, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius meet for and economic conference\u2022 Greece&apos;s parliament begin a three day dabate ending in a confidence vote in the new government on Sunday Meanwhile, stock markets across Europe opened down\u2022 FTSE 100 down 47 at 12897\u2022 German DAX down 25 at 6511\u2022 French CAC down 17 at 3212\u2022 Spanish IBEX down 80 at 6875\u2022 Italian FTSE MIB down 75 at 14015 And bond markets, which had a decidedly rocky ride yesterday were also suffering\u2022 Spain&apos;s 10 year bond yield is up to 6.86%\u2022 Italy&apos;s 10 year bond yield is up to 6%  7.52am: Good morning and welcome to another day of action from the eurozone crisis. We will be bringing you up to date with the latest unravelling as we head into the weekend. We are not expecting anything as exciting as yesterday, when we saw the Bank of England introduce QE3 - pumping in an extra \u00a350bn, the European Central Bank reducing interest rates 25 basis points to 0.75%, and China surprising everyone by reducing interest rates for the second time in a month. The FTSE 100 is expected to open down 0.3%, with Germany&apos;s Dax down 0.5% and France&apos;s Cac off 0.8%. The oil price has fallen back below $100."}, {"sentences": ["In a further move to mend relations, Clinton is due to meet with Pakistan&apos;s foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar in Tokyo on Sunday on the sidelines of a conference on Afghanistan."], "tags": ["US foreign policy", "US news", "Drones (military)", "Pakistan", "World news", "US military"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-06T19:12:15Z", "title": "Latest US drone strike in Pakistan kills 12 suspected militants", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/06/latest-us-drone-strike-kills-twelve", "article": "A US drone killed at least 12 suspected militants on Friday when it fired missiles at a compound in Pakistan near the Afghan border, local intelligence officials confirmed.

The announcement by Clinton during a brief visit to Kabul means Afghanistan will join a small, rather disparate group of 14 countries, including Israel, Japan, the Philippines, Bahrain and Pakistan, which hold the privileged status. This status allows for streamlined military co-operation with the US, with access to weapons and training among other advantages. The extent of US military spending in Afghanistan already put it effectively on a par with some other &quot;major non-Nato allies&quot;, but with US troops expected to be mostly home by the end of 2014, Clinton described the formal label as a sign of long-term commitment. It is the first country awarded the status by Barack Obama&apos;s administration. &quot;We see this as a powerful commitment to Afghanistan&apos;s future,&quot; she told a joint news conference, after a breakfast meeting with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. &quot;We are not even imagining abandoning Afghanistan.&quot; Clinton and Karzai then flew to Tokyo, where Karzai will seek promises of up to $4bn a year in development aid, to match a similar amount of funding for the police and army. Clinton said she would hold a joint meeting with the Pakistani and Afghan foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Tokyo meeting, which could help boost a largely moribund effort to set up talks with the Taliban. Although Clinton noted that security is improving, Afghanistan&apos;s porous border, the resilience of the insurgency and slow progress in building the capacity of the Afghan police and army mean that a negotiated settlement is widely seen as a strong hope of ending the conflict and staving off possible civil war. The Tokyo conference is also expected to address the massive problem of corruption in Afghanistan, last year ranked fourth most corrupt country in the world. Up to $1bn of the $8bn donated to Afghanistan over the past eight years has been lost to corruption, Huguette Labelle, the chairwoman of the anti-fraud group Transparency International, warned in a recent editorial in the New York Times. While there have been a string of high-profile graft cases in recent years, including a $900m banking scandal, no high-profile convictions or sentences have been handed down. Donors will lay out at the conference a &quot;framework of accountability&quot; that will require Kabul to make progress on issues such as women&apos;s rights and rule of law in return for the funds it gets. Clinton said she believed the government was sincere about tackling fraud. &quot;This is an issue the government and the people of Afghanistan want action on, and we want to ensure they are successful,&quot; she told the news conference, under vast trees in a garden at the heart of the presidential palace."}, {"sentences": ["On Sunday, Clinton is due to meet with Pakistan&apos;s foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Drones (military)", "US news", "Pakistan", "US foreign policy", "Hillary Clinton", "World news", "US military", "CIA"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-07T13:25:19Z", "title": "Drone strike kills 19 ahead of US-Pakistan meeting in Tokyo", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/07/drone-strike-us-pakistan-tokyo", "article": "The death toll from a US drone strike in Pakistan rose to 19 on Saturday, increasing tensions ahead of a meeting between secretary of state Hillary Clinton and her Islamabad counterpart.

Civil society groups said they were welcomed but their demands ignored. And a slice of Sunday&apos;s headline-grabbing donation figure produced by the conference in Tokyo was a repackaging of existing promises rather than new aid, with Britain&apos;s contribution an example of the financial confusion. The figure in the final conference statement covered spending only until 2015, and Britain already has a long-standing pledge to provide \u00a3178m in aid a year until then. The UK also promised additional cash until 2017, but those two years of spending were not detailed in the Tokyo agreement, only a loosely worded commitment to &quot;sustaining support ... at or near levels of the past decade&quot;. Senior diplomats anxious about widespread corruption in Afghanistan hailed a Tokyo framework of mutual accountability, laid out together with the funding promises as a critical tool for ensuring taxpayers money was not wasted. It states the cash will flow only if there is progress from the Afghan government in tackling corruption, protecting women&apos;s rights and democracy, and other key issues. Vygaudas U\u0161ackas, EU special representative for Afghanistan, said: &quot;The time for delivering on [these] conditionalities is now. That will determine the degree of staying power beyond 2014.&quot; But Kabul has long grown used to hearing strongly worded western warnings that it must crack down on rampant corruption, and appears to suffer few consequences from ignoring them. Up to $1bn of the $8bn donated to Afghanistan over the past eight years has been lost to corruption, according to Huguette Labelle, head of the anti-fraud group Transparency International. And although there have been a string of graft cases in recent years, including a $900m banking scandal at a lender connected with the brothers of both President Hamid Karzai and his vice-president, Mohammad Qasim Fahim, there have been no high-profile convictions. Civil society groups that have played a critical role in areas such as improving the status of women and bolstering the rule of law, warned that they had been marginalised by the final conference statement. Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;Many speakers have praised the increased presence of civil society at the Tokyo conference, and it is true that Afghan civil society groups have been a forceful, organised and impressive presence. Far less in evidence, however, is any indication that anyone is taking them seriously.&quot; Their key demands, including a greater stake in overseeing aid, and more emphasis on human rights, women&apos;s rights and a justice process to deal with the country&apos;s &quot;history of atrocities&quot; when setting conditions for aid, had not made it into the Tokyo declaration, Barr added. The conference aims in part to forestall a repeat of the fate Afghanistan suffered in the early 1990s, when it was largely abandoned by the international community after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and fell into a civil war. But the provision of a concrete aid figure until 2015 also underlines the harsh political reality that it is hard for western governments to promise money over more than a few years. Leaders, and interest, may be quite different once the troops have gone. And for Afghans struggling to survive in one of the world&apos;s poorest countries, fearful of a future of economic turmoil, or even another civil war, the figures bandied around in Tokyo are unlikely to mean much. Anja de Beer, an adviser at the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development writing for the Afghanistan Analysts Network, warned: &quot;Chances are that the sweeping statements promising continuous support and billions of aid again only confirm the suspicion that this is just another talk show.&quot; De Beer, who has more than a decade&apos;s experience in Afghanistan, added: &quot;If the ceremonial renewal of the vows is what it takes to ensure the long-term needed support for the Afghans, so be it. But the big conferences could probably take place less frequently, made more driven by a genuine development agenda and resulting in realistic decisions that can monitored relatively easily.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Speaking in Tokyo, Clinton said an admission by UN mediator Kofi Annan that his peace plan was failing should serve as a &quot;wake-up call for everyone&quot;.", "In Tokyo, Clinton said that the worsening situation in Syria risked pushing the country to the point of collapse."], "tags": ["Syria", "US foreign policy", "Hillary Clinton", "Bashar al-Assad", "US news", "World news", "Obama administration"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-08T17:06:00Z", "title": "Clinton issues stern warning to Assad as war of words escalates", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/08/hillary-clinton-syria-washington", "article": "     US secretary of state Hillary Clinton warned hardline Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad that his days were numbered as both countries intensified the rhetoric in a war of words on Sunday.

Instead, there are only legions upon legions of expats. The word conjures up groups ripening in the sun on recliners by the pool, lounging in bars festooned with union flags, combing foreign supermarket aisles for Marmite and HP Sauce, and decrying bronzed natives and their lack of work ethic. For a year or two I fancied I was an expat myself. I came from India to study at St Andrews on a bursary. I mingled with classmates who had multiple passports, whose parents were expats in Zurich, Dubai, New York and Tokyo. But as I marvelled at the ease with which they glided into France, took trains in Croatia and made friends with Bedouins in Jordan, I was having protracted arguments with customs, who jabbed at my documents every time I tried to nip over to Ireland or France. Such treatment made me realise I would never been an expat \u2013 only an immigrant. It seems it&apos;s impossible to be an Indian expatriate. Even Lakshmi Mittal, the richest man in Britain, and an Indian passport holder, wouldn&apos;t dare to call himself an expat. So what is the difference? It seems expats have a special prerogative. It is an entitlement with far-reaching consequences. Not long ago, I won a free trip to the Caribbean. On my flight was a senior executive from a large London-listed company heading back to his tax-haven paradise in the Bahamas. He had been an expat for nearly 25 years. The Londoner loathed Britain and its tax regime. He foamed at the mouth and gesticulated wildly as he nursed a glass with fluctuating levels of scotch. I learned of his disgust at the dross pouring into his once-beloved country and the horrifying prospect of them benefiting from his tax money. I nodded gamely as he told me how he hated immigrants and wished they would all bugger off to where they came from. Then he leaned back, closed his eyes, clucked his tongue, and said: &quot;It&apos;s a good thing we have tame natives in the Caribbean. None of that PC nonsense.&quot; The British in Spain number close to a million, and they positively abhor being called immigrants. The most common argument given by the expat community is that they contribute to the local economy, take nothing, and create jobs. They are not job-seeking flotsam and, after all, where would the Manuels and the Jos\u00e9s be without their money. The irony of complaining about immigrants in their own country while living the life of an expat escapes the British. I don&apos;t blame them. It is mere cognitive dissonance born out of centuries of dominion over large swaths of the world. From Delhi to Darfur, the correct way to drape a napkin on your knees or manipulate dinner cutlery was the British way. The Indian just off the plane at Heathrow, the Pakistani out for his maiden walk on Oxford Street, the Lithuanian finding his way around St Pancras are all too acutely aware that this is not their country. They must ingratiate themselves as soon as possible. Our expat has no such dislocations. Australia, Canada, America, New Zealand and scores of pins and flags on the world map were once firmly and exclusively Anglo-Saxon in identity. Not any more. The last few decades have seen planes and boats disgorge people of other, newer ethnicities, and they and their children have gained momentum in their adopted countries. In face of this rising demographic pressure there is an even more urgent need to distinguish themselves as British. Meanwhile, in France, the term immigr\u00e9 has negative connotations, almost always indicating either a clandestine or a Magrebhi. In Greece, being a metanastis is as good as being unwanted cargo from Africa. The term expatriate is a stamp of superiority and is reserved for those who have the right passport \u2013 and look the part. I, sadly, will never fit that mould. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["Wizards are male, so that&apos;s OK.

I do hope so, because I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s wildly unexpected news from Saudi Arabia, where one of the kingdom&apos;s less cuddly newspapers reports that no women have qualified for its Olympic team. Can it really be only a fortnight or so ago that the Saudi Olympic Committee were intimating that they would not remain the only country who refuse to send women to the Games? Yes. Yes it can, with the country&apos;s 26 June statement on the matter concluding thus: &quot;The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to reaffirm its support for the sublime meanings reflected by the Olympic Games and the cherished values of excellence, friendship and respect that they represent.&quot; Alas, it appears that the words &quot;and we&apos;re totally crossing our fingers while we&apos;re saying this&quot; were snipped off the end of the communique, leaving IOC president Jacques Rogge&apos;s professed &quot;optimism&quot; looking faintly naive. Or the sort of thing that might be said by someone who claimed there would be no internet censorship at the Beijing Games, before it turned out there would, and then he turned out not to have been sufficiently principled about it anyway to make a fuss. Whether that little episode will provide a template for how Rogge &quot;handles&quot; the Saudi situation is difficult to say. My heart says there is no better person to respond correctly to this than a serially compromised Belgian sports bureaucrat, but my head says &quot;whatcha talkin&apos; bout, Willis?&quot; If Mr Rogge delved into the Olympic history books, he would find a precedent for addressing a country&apos;s slippery attempts to claim it is committed to mixed competition when it is anything but. After all, it was with only a few weeks to go before the 1964 Tokyo Games that the IOC decided to ban South Africa because of the country&apos;s apartheid policy, and the South African National Olympic Committee&apos;s studied refusal to suggest publicly that the policy might be unsporting. Rather like Saudi Arabia&apos;s committee, South Africa&apos;s Olympic bigwigs indulged in a little quarter-arsed politicking in a last-minute attempt to sate the IOC, announcing that the country would include seven non-white athletes in its team of 62. For the IOC of 1964, however, that just wasn&apos;t enough. They demanded a public renunciation of discrimination in sport, and when it failed to materialise by the appointed deadline, promptly delivered on their ultimatum. South Africa did not compete at a Games until 1992, when all apartheid legislation had been repealed. Back in the present day, meanwhile, is the IOC comfortable with the impression that the Saudis have played them like a violin? Head of media Emmanuelle Moreau tells me Saudi Arabia have committed to send women athletes to London, and &quot;we hope this will be the case&quot;. &quot;The IOC does not give ultimatums or deadlines,&quot; she declares, &quot;but rather believes that a lot can be achieved through dialogue.&quot; For the second time, it is pointed out to her that in 1964, the IOC gave both an ultimatum and a deadline, and had the moral courage to see both through. And with that, communications channels go quiet. Still, when I know more, so will you.

In the &quot;Parade of Nations&quot;, the world&apos;s best male and female athletes will walk and wave behind every country&apos;s flag \u2013 all except the Saudi flag, behind which only men will march. In June, Saudi authorities had pledged to abide by the Olympics mandate of gender equality by allowing at least one &quot;qualified&quot; woman to compete, for the first time. The Saudi National Olympic Committee now says it cannot find a single woman to represent the country. With days to go until the Olympics begin, how did this come to pass? In 2008, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei fielded all-male teams. The International Olympic Committee&apos;s goal for the 2012 Games was to have been that all participating teams include women. But Saudi Arabia is a global outlier in women&apos;s rights, banning women and girlsnot only from meaningfully taking part in sport in the country, but also from making even the most basic decisions about their lives.  The International Olympic Committee and the United Kingdom as the host country have pressured Saudi Arabia to comply with the rules, to no avail. The Saudi failure to send women is a clear violation of the Olympic Charter, which states:  &quot;The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind. [Any] form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.&quot;  Despite these rules, Prince Nawaf al-Faisal, the head of the Saudi National Olympic Committee, who is also the sports minister (and an elected member of the governing International Olympic Committee itself) said, &quot;At present, we are not embracing any female Saudi participation in the Olympics or other international championships.&quot; This is consistent with the systematic discrimination against women and girls in the kingdom.  Saudi Arabia has one of the world&apos;s worst records for respecting and protecting women&apos;s rights. Under the government&apos;s male &quot;guardianship&quot; system, women must obtain permission from a father, husband, or even a son to study, marry or access healthcare. They are not allowed to make decisions about their children, such as enrolling them in school. Notoriously, women in Saudi Arabia are banned even from driving a car. Alone in the world, Saudi Arabia \u2013 as a matter of government policy \u2013 bars millions of girls from taking part in sport in schools. Even some private gyms for women have been closed down. The Saudi National Olympic Committee has no women&apos;s section. In fact, as explained in Human Rights Watch&apos;s report, government restrictions on women essentially bar them from sport (Reema Abdullah&apos;s Jeddah Kings United is the only private sports company with a women&apos;s team). As Reema Abdullah has asked, why should women in Saudi Arabia be denied the health benefits of sport and their dreams to compete? Equally to the point, the International Olympic Committee and the international sporting community have dropped the ball on this issue by failing to turn up the heat on Saudi officials long ago. There is ample Olympic precedent for banning Saudi Arabia from the Games for not playing by the rules. In 1964, apartheid-era South Africa was barred from the Tokyo Olympics for racial discrimination, and was not permitted to participate until the end of apartheid. In 1999, Taliban-run Afghanistan was banned from the 2000 Sydney Olympics for similarly denying women the right to play. Saudi leader King Abdullah, who has allowed some very limited reforms for women, is in ill-health. The risk that he may be succeeded by a more conservative leader means the international community \u2013 and the international sporting community \u2013 has a narrow window of opportunity to help secure the human rights of millions of Saudi women and girls, including their right to participate in sport. The Saudi ministry of education has written to Human Rights Watch that &quot;The issue of girls&apos; physical education is under serious consideration as one of the priorities of the ministry&apos;s leadership.&quot;  In that case, the IOC should use its leverage to get Saudi leaders to open up sports to millions of women in the Kingdom. This means setting a timeline and firm benchmarks for introducing sports for girls in public and private schools, allowing women&apos;s gyms and sports clubs to operate and creating women&apos;s sections in the sports ministry and the National Olympic Committee. Saudi Arabia should play by the rules, and let women play \u2013 not just in London, but inside the Kingdom, once the 2012 Olympics are over."}, {"sentences": ["Having qualified at February&apos;s Tokyo marathon, Soares \u2013 who will represent Timor-Leste, formerly East Timor, in the men&apos;s athletics team at this year&apos;s Games \u2013 says he&apos;s prepared for whatever London may throw at him, from cold weather (&quot;No problem \u2013 I&apos;ll bring a jumper&quot;) to a circular route (&quot;It&apos;s boring and tiring to run in loops, but I&apos;ll watch other people and their style of running&quot;).", "&quot;As long as he sleeps enough, he&apos;ll be fine.&quot; In mid-JuneLast month, Soares and Amaral headed to Portugal for additional training, before going on to London, where the goal is for Soares to run under 2:25:00, shaving more than eight minutes off his Tokyo time of 2:33:46."], "tags": ["Timor-Leste", "Olympic Games 2012", "Athletics", "Sport", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-11T20:43:48Z", "title": "London 2012: Timor-Leste athletes do it for national pride", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/11/road-london-timor-leste-athletes", "article": "It is nearly pitch black when Augusto Ramos Soares starts training. His morning workouts are eerily quiet: there&apos;s the rustle of palm trees swaying in the early-morning breeze; the scratch of his torn running shoes on the stadium track; the swoosh of a machete as nearby greenkeepers cut the grass. When light breaks, it&apos;s 32C, Soares is drenched in sweat, and university class \u2013 in nutritional science and athletics \u2013 beckons. Welcome to Olympics training, tropical island-style. In a country where 40% of the population still lives on less than 78p a day, Soares faces pre-Games woes that many of his competitors don&apos;t, from irregular training schedules to wrecked trainers and a shortage of proper food and supplements. But the 25-year-old is undaunted.

Their participation is no small feat for a country still shaking off a past so violent that locals like to joke: &quot;The last time I ran, it was because Indonesian troops were chasing me.&quot; A Portuguese colony for nearly 500 years, Timor-Leste finally won its independence in 1975, only to be brutally annexed by Indonesia a week later. The takeover killed off nearly a third of Timor-Leste&apos;sits population by 1999, and left the country in ruins. It finally gained independence in 2002 after a UN-brokered peace deal, and in May celebrated a decade of self-rule. This year is therefore a hugely important one for the nation, not least because of its participation at the Olympics, which many see as proof that it is fully standing on its own two feet. In March a new president was sworn in \u2013 the former guerrilla fighter Taur Matan Ruak, who replaced the Nobel laureate Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, parliamentary elections took place on 7 July, and the UN peacekeeping force \u2013 which has been present on and off since 1999 and can still be seen throughout the capital, Dili \u2013 is due to withdraw fully by\u00a0December. With its inadequate training facilities and insufficient athletic funding, Timor-Leste&apos;s government knows that it falls short in its ability to support its athletes, but hopes that this will change. &quot;We can&apos;t yet send athletes from other sports [to the Olympics] because we can&apos;t afford the pre-qualifications,&quot; says Afranio Xavier Amaral, who heads Timor-Leste&apos;s the National Sports Federation. &quot;But I have a vision that in the future we will have competitors in judo, gymnastics and swimming.&quot; In a nation where most of the 1.1 million inhabitants are among the world&apos;s poorest, the government&apos;s recent focus on sports is an interesting one. Dili has hosted an international marathon since 2010, as well as a mountain-biking competition held in September, started by Ramos-Horta, who says that sports are a form of &quot;group therapy&quot; for the nation to help heal resentment and conflict. &quot;When you&apos;re confronted with a society suffering from conflict and violence, you devise strategies to deal with it,&quot; he explains. &quot;Every society needs role models. Now, look at us. For the first time in 10 years, we&apos;re fully eligible to attend the Olympics on our own merit, instead of &apos;being permitted&apos; out of sympathy to participate. That creates pride in our people.&quot; Soares&apos;s coach, Agueda Amaral, is perhaps Timor-Leste&apos;s most famous role model and a source of great national pride. After being run out of her house by Indonesian troops in 1999, who went on a looting, killing and raping spree after Timor-Leste voted for independence, Amaral was forced to train for the 2000 Sydney Olympics at refugee camp where she and thousands of others were displaced. &quot;I lost everything \u2013 my house, my belongings, my only pair of running shoes, everything,&quot; she says. &quot;So I trained barefoot and I trained proud.&quot; Soares was just 15 when he saw the photos of Amaral crossing the Sydney finish line in his local paper. &quot;Then she came to my school to recruit runners, and I got motivated,&quot; he says. &quot;In my village, no one has any skills or knowledge. I wanted to be like Agueda: she&apos;s an amazing athlete and a true inspiration to Timorese youth.&quot; Training whenever he can and eating what he wants, Soares&apos; only directions are to avoid soft drinks, gassy liquids, ice and smoking. &quot;He&apos;s the best of my recruits already,&quot; Amaral says. &quot;As long as he sleeps enough, he&apos;ll be fine.&quot; In mid-JuneLast month, Soares and Amaral headed to Portugal for additional training, before going on to London, where the goal is for Soares to run under 2:25:00, shaving more than eight minutes off his Tokyo time of 2:33:46. Soares, who is one of seven children and donates the prize money from his previous marathons to his parents, says he is grateful for the opportunity to have a life his family long imagined impossible. &quot;If I didn&apos;t have this opportunity, I&apos;d be doing what my parents are doing: farming. Now I get to see cities like London. I know nothing about it. Is it very modern? That&apos;s what I heard.&quot; They are calm and collected now, but at times both Amaral and Soares seem like they want to pinch themselves. &quot;I never thought this day would happen,&quot; says Amaral, waving her hand behind her as if referring to Timor-Leste&apos;s bloody past. &quot;This really is a very exciting and privileged time for us.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Today, (5 July 2012), in Tokyo, Kromek, a UK based platform technology company, is launching RadAngel(TM), a new high performance but simple to use personal portable radiation detector.", "Tokyo, Chernobyl, Sellafield.. er..

These businesses that have brought new energy to the Shoreditch area. So why have so many small digital businesses decided to locate in this part of London? My research suggests that there are a number of factors. Firstly, agglomeration or clustering in digital and other sectors \u2013 whether in Accra, Bangalore, Dublin, San Francisco, Seattle or Ebene in Mauritius \u2013 creates its own momentum, driven by competition, collaboration and the exchange of information. Secondly, the relatively low cost and flexible leasing arrangements of office space in the Shoreditch area has been instrumental in capturing small businesses and start-ups, particularly when compared with costs incurred in other parts of the capital traditionally associated with the creative industries, such as Soho and Fitzrovia. Moreover, the primary buyers of digital content services are located in London and the south-east. They, as well their counterparts from other first-tier global cities like New York and Tokyo, find Shoreditch wedged as it is between the City and poorer parts of East London an intriguing place to visit. It has a dynamic, liminal quality. Brick Lane is both a place and a metaphor in this regard: eat jalfrezi and feel the zeitgeist. Which leads me to a final point.

From Silicon Roundabout to Tech City Although the name &quot;Silicon Roundabout&quot; started as a joke, the growth in digital businesses located in the Shoreditch and Old Street area is taken extremely seriously by David Cameron and his advisers \u2013 not least because it offers London an alternative to its moribund financial services sector. &quot;Our ambition is to bring together the creativity and energy of Shoreditch and the incredible possibilities of the Olympic Park to help make east London one of the world&apos;s great technology centres,&quot; said the prime minister in November 2010, in a speech which heaped praise on the remarkable growth in digital businesses in the previous year. Cameron reckoned that soon the newly rebranded Tech City would be able to challenge Silicon Valley. Now we have a report from the Centre for London, part of the thinktank Demos, which argues that the government is right to promote the UK as a digital economy, but has a muddled strategy to do so. The authors estimate that there are now 1,600 firms operating in the digital &quot;hot zone&quot; \u2013 Hoxton, Haggerston and Clerkenwell \u2013 and at least 3,200 in the broader area of inner east London, providing employment for some 48,500 people. But they are concerned about the lack of banking expertise among these industries and that foreign investment might stifle innovation. The report is also scathing about the coalition government&apos;s plan to establish a hi-tech corridor between Old Street and the Olympic Park. The prediction is that only limited relocation is likely to occur because of the &quot;complexity&quot; of the innovation eco-system. My own view is that as digital content businesses and their owners mature and enter new markets, some might indeed welcome the opportunity to move to Stratford; Shoreditch &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;vibe&quot; will not be so important for success, and other attributes might take precedence. There is all to play for. Think tanks have a duty to question and criticise government policy but if we stand back and see the big picture, and this is relatively minor stuff \u2013 the big change in work and leisure patterns is well underway and looks unstoppable. As British social anthropologist Ernest Gellner pointed out in his acclaimed 1997 book Nationalism, since the problem of food production has been more or less solved and more tangibles are made by machines, work in the advanced economies is increasingly focused on &quot;semantic&quot; and &quot;communicative&quot; activities. Put simply, wealth is created through the control and manipulation of signs, symbols and people. The incredible growth in the internet, especially the recent developments in mobile technologies, has given this trend additional impetus. Spanish sociologist and urbanist Manuel Castells argues that the change in economic activity towards information processing \u2013 what he calls the &quot;network society&quot; \u2013 is the biggest shift social since the jump from and agrarian mode of production to the industrial one in 18th and 19th century Europe and North America. As London changes too, the capital&apos;s centre of gravity is being pulled away from central and west London. There is no doubt that other parts of the capital will continue to flourish, but one reason this will happen is because of the growth in innovative digital content companies in the east. They will act as a powerhouse for growth not only in London but also for other parts of the UK. But this presents a huge question for London&apos;s boroughs. Outside the affluent enclaves within Hackney, Islington, Tower Hamlets and the City, live some of the poorest people in the country. There may be an economic and technological revolution happening on their doorsteps, but many will be unaware of that. Without help for the very poor and even the relatively poor \u2013 the sons and daughters of Brick Lane restaurant workers, for example \u2013 a significant segment of the capital&apos;s population will not be able to participate in this economic and social growth. Pump priming of infrastructure and some really smart and creative planning will be necessary to maintain momentum and ensure growth, but educational and employment inclusion is also a big challenge for local government as the economy builds a new future.

Served as tempura or sashimi, or baked and added to a glass of hot sake, fugu \u2013 or blowfish \u2013 is a rare and expensive treat for most Tokyoites. But food authorities in the capital are preparing to introduce a change to regulations, allowing unlicensed restaurants to serve fugu \u2013 a move that will make the fish cheaper but which some chefs say could also raise the risk for diners. The Tokyo government says the change will simply bring the city into line with the less rigorous preparation regimes in most other parts of Japan. And it will still require the removal of poisonous parts to be performed, off-site, by licensed chefs before the detoxified flesh is delivered to unlicensed restaurants. Among the most vocal critics of the revision are qualified chefs who have spent years learning how to safely handle fugu through every stage of its preparation. In the hands of an expert, fugu poses almost no risk to diners, who pay up to \u00a535,000 (\u00a3285) a head for a multiple-course meal and, perhaps, for the frisson of danger that accompanies eating a fish containing a toxin many times more deadly than cyanide. &quot;As long as the fish are prepared off-site by qualified chefs, then I don&apos;t think there is any danger of diners being poisoned,&quot; said one fugu chef in the capital&apos;s Ginza district, who asked not to be named. &quot;But if restaurants with unlicensed chefs buy in cheaper fugu with its organs still intact and try to prepare it themselves, then there could be a problem.&quot; Others believe the change makes a mockery of the years they have devoted to their craft. &quot;We have spent time and money to obtain and use the blowfish licence, but with these new rules anybody can handle blowfish even without a licence,&quot; Naohito Hashimoto, a blowfish chef for 30 years, told Reuters. Chefs train for at least two years to obtain a blowfish licence. By the time they qualify they can strip a fugu of its toxic parts in just a few minutes, using razor-sharp knives that are stored separately. The exam is notoriously tough \u2013 only 35% of candidates pass. They dismiss as a myth the idea that trace amounts of poison are occasionally left intact to produce a tingling sensation on the diner&apos;s lips. But some chefs can be persuaded to serve the liver, for which toxicity levels vary dramatically from one fish to another. Only last December, the food safety authorities in Tokyo revoked the licence of a chef at a two-star Michelin restaurant after he had served the liver to an insistent diner. The victim, a 35-year-old woman, suffered partial paralysis but recovered after a few days in hospital. Several people die every year after attempting to prepare fugu at home. The flesh is safe, but other parts, including the liver, heart, intestines and ovaries, contain tetrodotoxin, which can kill even in minute quantities. Physical signs that all is not well begin with a numb feeling around the mouth, followed by paralysis, breathing problems and, in the worst cases, death within four to six hours. According to government figures, there were 23 deaths among 338 fugu poisoning cases recorded in Japan from 2000 to 2009. Between 2008 and 2010, just three people died. &quot;Outside of Tokyo, the regulations for blowfish are even more relaxed and yet there are hardly any poison-related accidents,&quot; said Hironobu Kondo, an official in Tokyo&apos;s food control department. Still, the relaxing of the law contrasts with previous attempts to regulate Japan&apos;s appetite for fugu. The 16th-century feudal warlord Hideyoshi Toyotomi banned blowfish consumption among his soldiers, and similar nationwide bans stayed in place through the Edo period (1603-1868). Tellingly, fugu is said to be the only fish Japan&apos;s emperor is not allowed to eat."}, {"sentences": ["According to a Reuters report in December of last year: &quot;When he isn&apos;t fielding calls from international media, Abdulrahman is a few minutes down the road at his clothes shop, which he runs with his wife.&quot; When the Guardian&apos;s Middle East live blog cited &quot;Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights&quot; it also linked to a sceptical article in the Modern Tokyo Times \u2013 an article which suggested news outlets could be a bit &quot;more objective about their sources&quot; when quoting &quot;this so-called entity&quot;, the SOHR."], "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Foreign policy", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-12T14:48:30Z", "title": "The Syrian opposition: who's doing the talking? | Charlie Skelton", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking", "article": "A nightmare is unfolding across Syria, in the homes of al-Heffa and the streets of Houla. And we all know how the story ends: with thousands of soldiers and civilians killed, towns and families destroyed, and President Assad beaten to death in a ditch. This is the story of the Syrian war, but there is another story to be told. A tale less bloody, but nevertheless important. This is a story about the storytellers: the spokespeople, the &quot;experts on Syria&quot;, the &quot;democracy activists&quot;. The statement makers. The people who &quot;urge&quot; and &quot;warn&quot; and &quot;call for action&quot;. It&apos;s a tale about some of the most quoted members of the Syrian opposition and their connection to the Anglo-American opposition creation business. The mainstream news media have, in the main, been remarkably passive when it comes to Syrian sources: billing them simply as &quot;official spokesmen&quot; or &quot;pro-democracy campaigners&quot; without, for the most part, scrutinising their statements, their backgrounds or their political connections. It&apos;s important to stress: to investigate the background of a Syrian spokesperson is not to doubt the sincerity of his or her opposition to Assad. But a passionate hatred of the Assad regime is no guarantee of independence. Indeed, a number of key figures in the Syrian opposition movement are long-term exiles who were receiving US government funding to undermine the Assad government long before the Arab spring broke out. Though it is not yet stated US government policy to oust Assad by force, these spokespeople are vocal advocates of foreign military intervention in Syria and thus natural allies of well-known US neoconservatives who supported Bush&apos;s invasion of Iraq and are now pressuring the Obama administration to intervene. As we will see, several of these spokespeople have found support, and in some cases developed long and lucrative relationships with advocates of military intervention on both sides of the Atlantic. &quot;The sand is running out of the hour glass,&quot; said Hillary Clinton on Sunday. So, as the fighting in Syria intensifies, and Russian warships set sail for Tartus, it&apos;s high time to take a closer look at those who are speaking out on behalf of the Syrian people. The Syrian National Council The most quoted of the opposition spokespeople are the official representatives of the Syrian National Council. The SNC is not the only Syrian opposition group \u2013 but it is generally recognised as &quot;the main opposition coalition&quot; (BBC). The Washington Times describes it as &quot;an umbrella group of rival factions based outside Syria&quot;. Certainly the SNC is the opposition group that&apos;s had the closest dealings with western powers \u2013 and has called for foreign intervention from the early stages of the uprising. In February of this year, at the opening of the Friends of Syria summit in Tunisia, William Hague declared: &quot;I will meet leaders of the Syrian National Council in a few minutes&apos; time \u2026 We, in common with other nations, will now treat them and recognise them as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people.&quot; The most senior of the SNC&apos;s official spokespeople is the Paris-based Syrian academic Bassma Kodmani. Bassma Kodmani      Bassma Kodmani of the Syrian National Council. Photograph: Carter Osmar    Here is Bassma Kodmani, seen leaving this year&apos;s Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia. Kodmani is a member of the executive bureau and head of foreign affairs, Syrian National Council. Kodmani is close to the centre of the SNC power structure, and one of the council&apos;s most vocal spokespeople. &quot;No dialogue with the ruling regime is possible. We can only discuss how to move on to a different political system,&quot; she declared this week. And here she is, quoted by the newswire AFP: &quot;The next step needs to be a resolution under Chapter VII, which allows for the use of all legitimate means, coercive means, embargo on arms, as well as the use of force to oblige the regime to comply.&quot; This statement translates into the headline &quot;Syrians call for armed peacekeepers&quot; (Australia&apos;s Herald Sun). When large-scale international military action is being called for, it seems only reasonable to ask: who exactly is calling for it? We can say, simply, &quot;an official SNC spokesperson,&quot; or we can look a little closer. This year was Kodmani&apos;s second Bilderberg. At the 2008 conference, Kodmani was listed as French; by 2012, her Frenchness had fallen away and she was listed simply as &quot;international&quot; \u2013 her homeland had become the world of international relations. Back a few years, in 2005, Kodmani was working for the Ford Foundation in Cairo, where she was director of their governance and international co-operation programme. The Ford Foundation is a vast organisation, headquartered in New York, and Kodmani was already fairly senior. But she was about to jump up a league. Around this time, in February 2005, US-Syrian relations collapsed, and President Bush recalled his ambassador from Damascus. A lot of opposition projects date from this period. &quot;The US money for Syrian opposition figures began flowing under President George W Bush after he effectively froze political ties with Damascus in 2005,&quot; says the Washington Post. In September 2005, Kodmani was made the executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative (ARI) \u2013 a research programme initiated by the powerful US lobby group, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The CFR is an elite US foreign policy thinktank, and the Arab Reform Initiative is described on its website as a &quot;CFR Project&quot; . More specifically, the ARI was initiated by a group within the CFR called the &quot;US/Middle East Project&quot; \u2013 a body of senior diplomats, intelligence officers and financiers, the stated aim of which is to undertake regional &quot;policy analysis&quot; in order &quot;to prevent conflict and promote stability&quot;. The US/Middle East Project pursues these goals under the guidance of an international board chaired by General (Ret.) Brent Scowcroft.     Peter Sutherland pictured at the Bilderberg conference. Photograph: Hannah Borno    Brent Scowcroft (chairman emeritus) is a former national security adviser to the US president \u2013 he took over the role from Henry Kissinger. Sitting alongside Scowcroft of the international board is his fellow geo-strategist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who succeeded him as the national security adviser, and Peter Sutherland, the chairman of Goldman Sachs International. So, as early as 2005, we&apos;ve got a senior wing of the western intelligence/banking establishment selecting Kodmani to run a Middle East research project. In September of that year, Kodmani was made full-time director of the programme. Earlier in 2005, the CFR assigned &quot;financial oversight&quot; of the project to the Centre for European Reform (CER). In come the British. The CER is overseen by Lord Kerr, the deputy chairman of Royal Dutch Shell. Kerr is a former head of the diplomatic service and is a senior adviser at Chatham House (a thinktank showcasing the best brains of the British diplomatic establishment). In charge of the CER on a day-to-day basis is Charles Grant, former defence editor of the Economist, and these days a member of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a &quot;pan-European thinktank&quot; packed with diplomats, industrialists, professors and prime ministers. On its list of members you&apos;ll find the name: &quot;Bassma Kodmani (France/Syria) \u2013 Executive Director, Arab Reform Initiative&quot;. Another name on the list: George Soros \u2013 the financier whose non-profit &quot;Open Society Foundations&quot; is a primary funding source of the ECFR. At this level, the worlds of banking, diplomacy, industry, intelligence and the various policy institutes and foundations all mesh together, and there, in the middle of it all, is Kodmani. The point is, Kodmani is not some random &quot;pro-democracy activist&quot; who happens to have found herself in front of a microphone. She has impeccable international diplomacy credentials: she holds the position of research director at the Acad\u00e9mie Diplomatique Internationale \u2013 &quot;an independent and neutral institution dedicated to promoting modern diplomacy&quot;. The Acad\u00e9mie is headed by Jean-Claude Cousseran, a former head of the DGSE \u2013 the French foreign intelligence service. A picture is emerging of Kodmani as a trusted lieutenant of the Anglo-American democracy-promotion industry. Her &quot;province of origin&quot; (according to the SNC website) is Damascus, but she has close and long-standing professional relationships with precisely those powers she&apos;s calling upon to intervene in Syria. And many of her spokesmen colleagues are equally well-connected. Radwan Ziadeh  Another often quoted SNC representative is Radwan Ziadeh \u2013 director of foreign relations at the Syrian National Council. Ziadeh has an impressive CV: he&apos;s a senior fellow at the federally funded Washington thinktank, the US Institute of Peace (the USIP Board of Directors is packed with alumni of the defence department and the national security council; its president is Richard Solomon, former adviser to Kissinger at the NSC). In February this year, Ziadeh joined an elite bunch of Washington hawks to sign a letter calling upon Obama to intervene in Syria: his fellow signatories include James Woolsey (former CIA chief), Karl Rove (Bush Jr&apos;s handler), Clifford May (Committee on the Present Danger) and Elizabeth Cheney, former head of the Pentagon&apos;s Iran-Syria Operations Group. Ziadeh is a relentless organiser, a blue-chip Washington insider with links to some of the most powerful establishment thinktanks. Ziadeh&apos;s connections extend all the way to London. In 2009 he became a visiting fellow at Chatham House, and in June of last year he featured on the panel at one of their events \u2013 &quot;Envisioning Syria&apos;s Political Future&quot; \u2013 sharing a platform with fellow SNC spokesman Ausama Monajed (more on Monajed below) and SNC member Najib Ghadbian. Ghadbian was identified by the Wall Street Journal as an early intermediary between the US government and the Syrian opposition in exile: &quot;An initial contact between the White House and NSF [National Salvation Front] was forged by Najib Ghadbian, a University of Arkansas political scientist.&quot; This was back in 2005. The watershed year. These days, Ghadbian is a member of the general secretariat of the SNC, and is on the advisory board of a Washington-based policy body called the Syrian Center for Political and Strategic Studies (SCPSS) \u2013 an organisation co-founded by Ziadeh. Ziadeh has been making connections like this for years. Back in 2008, Ziadeh took part in a meeting of opposition figures in a Washington government building: a mini-conference called &quot;Syria In-Transition&quot;. The meeting was co-sponsored by a US-based body called the Democracy Council and a UK-based organisation called the Movement for Justice and Development (MJD). It was a big day for the MJD \u2013 their chairman, Anas Al-Abdah, had travelled to Washington from Britain for the event, along with their director of public relations. Here, from the MJD&apos;s website, is a description of the day: &quot;The conference saw an exceptional turn out as the allocated hall was packed with guests from the House of Representatives and the Senate, representatives of studies centres, journalists and Syrian expatriats [sic] in the USA.&quot; The day opened with a keynote speech by James Prince, head of the Democracy Council. Ziadeh was on a panel chaired by Joshua Muravchik (the ultra-interventionist author of the 2006 op-ed &quot;Bomb Iran&quot;). The topic of the discussion was &quot;The Emergence of Organized Opposition&quot;. Sitting beside Ziadeh on the panel was the public relations director of the MJD \u2013 a man who would later become his fellow SNC spokesperson \u2013 Ausama Monajed. Ausama Monajed  Along with Kodmani and Ziadeh, Ausama (or sometimes Osama) Monajed is one of the most important SNC spokespeople. There are others, of course \u2013 the SNC is a big beast and includes the Muslim Brotherhood. The opposition to Assad is wide-ranging, but these are some of the key voices. There are other official spokespeople with long political careers, like George Sabra of the Syrian Democratic People&apos;s party \u2013 Sabra has suffered arrest and lengthy imprisonment in his fight against the &quot;repressive and totalitarian regime in Syria&quot;. And there are other opposition voices outside the SNC, such as the writer Michel Kilo, who speaks eloquently of the violence tearing apart his country: &quot;Syria is being destroyed \u2013 street after street, city after city, village after village. What kind of solution is that? In order for a small group of people to remain in power, the whole country is being destroyed.&quot;     Ausuma Monajed. Photograph: BBC    But there&apos;s no doubt that the primary opposition body is the SNC, and Kodmani, Ziadeh and Monajed are often to be found representing it. Monajed frequently crops up as a commentator on TV news channels. Here he is on the BBC, speaking from their Washington bureau. Monajed doesn&apos;t sugar-coat his message: &quot;We are watching civilians being slaughtered and kids being slaughtered and killed and women being raped on the TV screens every day.&quot; Meanwhile, over on Al Jazeera, Monajed talks about &quot;what&apos;s really happening, in reality, on the ground&quot; \u2013 about &quot;the militiamen of Assad&quot; who &quot;come and rape their women, slaughter their children, and kill their elderly&quot;. Monajed turned up, just a few days ago, as a blogger on Huffington Post UK, where he explained, at length: &quot;Why the World Must Intervene in Syria&quot; \u2013 calling for &quot;direct military assistance&quot; and &quot;foreign military aid&quot;. So, again, a fair question might be: who is this spokesman calling for military intervention? Monajed is a member of the SNC, adviser to its president, and according to his SNC biography, &quot;the Founder and Director of Barada Television&quot;, a pro-opposition satellite channel based in Vauxhall, south London. In 2008, a few months after attending Syria In-Transition conference, Monajed was back in Washington, invited to lunch with George W Bush, along with a handful of other favoured dissidents (you can see Monajed in the souvenir photo, third from the right, in the red tie, near Condoleezza Rice \u2013 up the other end from Garry Kasparov). At this time, in 2008, the US state department knew Monajed as &quot;director of public relations for the Movement for Justice and Development (MJD), which leads the struggle for peaceful and democratic change in Syria&quot;. Let&apos;s look closer at the MJD. Last year, the Washington Post picked up a story from WikiLeaks, which had published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables. These cables appear to show a remarkable flow of money from the US state department to the British-based Movement for Justice and Development. According to the Washington Post&apos;s report: &quot;Barada TV is closely affiliated with the Movement for Justice and Development, a London-based network of Syrian exiles. Classified US diplomatic cables show that the state department has funnelled as much as $6m to the group since 2006 to operate the satellite channel and finance other activities inside Syria.&quot; A state department spokesman responded to this story by saying: &quot;Trying to promote a transformation to a more democratic process in this society is not undermining necessarily the existing government.&quot; And they&apos;re right, it&apos;s not &quot;necessarily&quot; that. When asked about the state department money, Monajed himself said that he &quot;could not confirm&quot; US state department funding for Barada TV, but said: &quot;I didn&apos;t receive a penny myself.&quot; Malik al -Abdeh, until very recently Barada TV&apos;s editor-in-chief insisted: &quot;we have had no direct dealings with the US state department&quot;. The meaning of the sentence turns on that word &quot;direct&quot;. It is worth noting that Malik al Abdeh also happens to be one of the founders of the Movement for Justice and Development (the recipient of the state department $6m, according to the leaked cable). And he&apos;s the brother of the chairman, Anas Al-Abdah. He&apos;s also the co-holder of the MJD trademark: What Malik al Abdeh does admit is that Barada TV gets a large chunk of its funding from an American non-profit organisation: the Democracy Council. One of the co-sponsors (with the MJD) of Syria In-Transition mini-conference. So what we see, in 2008, at the same meeting, are the leaders of precisely those organisations identified in the Wiki:eaks cables as the conduit (the Democracy Council) and recipient (the MJD) of large amounts of state department money. The Democracy Council (a US-based grant distributor) lists the state department as one of its sources of funding. How it works is this: the Democracy Council serves as a grant-administering intermediary between the state department&apos;s &quot;Middle East Partnership Initiative&quot; and &quot;local partners&quot; (such as Barada TV). As the Washington Post reports:  &quot;Several US diplomatic cables from the embassy in Damascus reveal that the Syrian exiles received money from a State Department program called the Middle East Partnership Initiative. According to the cables, the State Department funnelled money to the exile group via the Democracy Council, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit.&quot;  The same report highlights a 2009 cable from the US Embassy in Syria that says that the Democracy Council received $6.3m from the state department to run a Syria-related programme, the &quot;Civil Society Strengthening Initiative&quot;. The cable describes this as &quot;a discrete collaborative effort between the Democracy Council and local partners&quot; aimed at producing, amongst other things, &quot;various broadcast concepts.&quot; According to the Washington Post: &quot;Other cables make clear that one of those concepts was Barada TV.&quot; Until a few months ago, the state department&apos;s Middle East Partnership Initiative was overseen by Tamara Cofman Wittes (she&apos;s now at the Brookings Institution \u2013 an influential Washington thinktank). Of MEPI, she said that it &quot;created a positive &apos;brand&apos; for US democracy promotion efforts&quot;. While working there she declared: &quot;There are a lot of organizations in Syria and other countries that are seeking changes from their government \u2026 That&apos;s an agenda that we believe in and we&apos;re going to support.&quot; And by support, she means bankroll. The money  This is nothing new. Go back a while to early 2006, and you have the state department announcing a new &quot;funding opportunity&quot; called the &quot;Syria Democracy Program&quot;. On offer, grants worth &quot;$5m in Federal Fiscal Year 2006&quot;. The aim of the grants? &quot;To accelerate the work of reformers in Syria.&quot; These days, the cash is flowing in faster than ever. At the beginning of June 2012, the Syrian Business Forum was launched in Doha by opposition leaders including Wael Merza (SNC secretary general). &quot;This fund has been established to support all components of the revolution in Syria,&quot; said Merza. The size of the fund? Some $300m. It&apos;s by no means clear where the money has come from, although Merza &quot;hinted at strong financial support from Gulf Arab states for the new fund&quot; (Al Jazeera). At the launch, Merza said that about $150m had already been spent, in part on the Free Syrian Army. Merza&apos;s group of Syrian businessmen made an appearance at a World Economic Forum conference titled the &quot;Platform for International Co-operation&quot; held in Istanbul in November 2011. All part of the process whereby the SNC has grown in reputation, to become, in the words of William Hague, &quot;a legitimate representative of the Syrian people&quot; \u2013 and able, openly, to handle this much funding. Building legitimacy \u2013 of opposition, of representation, of intervention \u2013 is the essential propaganda battle. In a USA Today op-ed written in February this year, Ambassador Dennis Ross declared: &quot;It is time to raise the status of the Syrian National Council&quot;. What he wanted, urgently, is &quot;to create an aura of inevitability about the SNC as the alternative to Assad.&quot; The aura of inevitability. Winning the battle in advance. A key combatant in this battle for hearts and minds is the American journalist and Daily Telegraph blogger, Michael Weiss. Michael Weiss One of the most widely quoted western experts on Syria \u2013 and an enthusiast for western intervention \u2013 Michael Weiss echoes Ambassador Ross when he says: &quot;Military intervention in Syria isn&apos;t so much a matter of preference as an inevitability.&quot; Some of Weiss&apos;s interventionist writings can be found on a Beirut-based, Washington-friendly website called &quot;NOW Lebanon&quot; \u2013 whose &quot;NOW Syria&quot; section is an important source of Syrian updates. NOW Lebanon was set up in 2007 by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executive Eli Khoury. Khoury has been described by the advertising industry as a &quot;strategic communications specialist, specialising in corporate and government image and brand development&quot;. Weiss told NOW Lebanon, back in May, that thanks to the influx of weapons to Syrian rebels &quot;we&apos;ve already begun to see some results.&quot; He showed a similar approval of military developments a few months earlier, in a piece for the New Republic: &quot;In the past several weeks, the Free Syrian Army and other independent rebel brigades have made great strides&quot; \u2013 whereupon, as any blogger might, he laid out his &quot;Blueprint for a Military Intervention in Syria&quot;. But Weiss is not only a blogger. He&apos;s also the director of communications and public relations at the Henry Jackson Society, an ultra-ultra-hawkish foreign policy thinktank. The Henry Jackson Society&apos;s international patrons include: James &quot;ex-CIA boss&quot; Woolsey, Michael &quot;homeland security&quot; Chertoff, William &quot;PNAC&quot; Kristol, Robert &quot;PNAC&quot; Kagan&apos;, Joshua &quot;Bomb Iran&quot; Muravchick, and Richard &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; Perle. The Society is run by Alan Mendoza, chief adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on transatlantic and international security. The Henry Jackson Society is uncompromising in its &quot;forward strategy&quot; towards democracy. And Weiss is in charge of the message. The Henry Jackson Society is proud of its PR chief&apos;s far-reaching influence: &quot;He is the author of the influential report &quot;Intervention in Syria? An Assessment of Legality, Logistics and Hazards&quot;, which was repurposed and endorsed by the Syrian National Council.&quot; Weiss&apos;s original report was re-named &quot;Safe Area for Syria&quot; \u2013 and ended up on the official syriancouncil.org website, as part of their military bureau&apos;s strategic literature. The repurposing of the HJS report was undertaken by the founder and executive director of the Strategic Research and Communication Centre (SRCC) \u2013 one Ausama Monajed. So, the founder of Barada TV, Ausama Monajed, edited Weiss&apos;s report, published it through his own organisation (the SRCC) and passed it on to the Syrian National Council, with the support of the Henry Jackson Society. The relationship couldn&apos;t be closer. Monajed even ends up handling inquiries for &quot;press interviews with Michael Weiss&quot;. Weiss is not the only strategist to have sketched out the roadmap to this war (many thinktanks have thought it out, many hawks have talked it up), but some of the sharpest detailing is his. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights  The justification for the &quot;inevitable&quot; military intervention is the savagery of President Assad&apos;s regime: the atrocities, the shelling, the human rights abuses. Information is crucial here, and one source above all has been providing us with data about Syria. It is quoted at every turn: &quot;The head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told VOA [Voice of America] that fighting and shelling killed at least 12 people in Homs province.&quot; The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is commonly used as a standalone source for news and statistics. Just this week, news agency AFP carried this story: &quot;Syrian forces pounded Aleppo and Deir Ezzor provinces as at least 35 people were killed on Sunday across the country, among them 17 civilians, a watchdog reported.&quot; Various atrocities and casualty numbers are listed, all from a single source: &quot;Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP by phone.&quot; Statistic after horrific statistic pours from &quot;the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights&quot; (AP). It&apos;s hard to find a news report about Syria that doesn&apos;t cite them. But who are they? &quot;They&quot; are Rami Abdulrahman (or Rami Abdel Rahman), who lives in Coventry. According to a Reuters report in December of last year: &quot;When he isn&apos;t fielding calls from international media, Abdulrahman is a few minutes down the road at his clothes shop, which he runs with his wife.&quot; When the Guardian&apos;s Middle East live blog cited &quot;Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights&quot; it also linked to a sceptical article in the Modern Tokyo Times \u2013 an article which suggested news outlets could be a bit &quot;more objective about their sources&quot; when quoting &quot;this so-called entity&quot;, the SOHR. That name, the &quot;Syrian Observatory of Human Rights&quot;, sound so grand, so unimpeachable, so objective. And yet when Abdulrahman and his &quot;Britain-based NGO&quot; (AFP/NOW Lebanon) are the sole source for so many news stories about such an important subject, it would seem reasonable to submit this body to a little more scrutiny than it&apos;s had to date. The Observatory is by no means the only Syrian news source to be quoted freely with little or no scrutiny \u2026 Hamza Fakher The relationship between Ausama Monajed, the SNC, the Henry Jackson hawks and an unquestioning media can be seen in the case of Hamza Fakher. On 1 January, Nick Cohen wrote in the Observer: &quot;To grasp the scale of the barbarism, listen to Hamza Fakher, a pro-democracy activist, who is one of the most reliable sources on the crimes the regime&apos;s news blackout hides.&quot; He goes on to recount Fakher&apos;s horrific tales of torture and mass murder. Fakher tells Cohen of a new hot-plate torture technique that he&apos;s heard about: &quot;imagine all the melting flesh reaching the bone before the detainee falls on the plate&quot;. The following day, Shamik Das, writing on &quot;evidence-based&quot; progressive blog Left Foot Forward, quotes the same source: &quot;Hamza Fakher, a pro-democracy activist, describes the sickening reality \u2026&quot; \u2013 and the account of atrocities given to Cohen is repeated. So, who exactly is this &quot;pro-democracy activist&quot;, Hamza Fakher? Fakher, it turns out, is the co-author of Revolution in Danger , a &quot;Henry Jackson Society Strategic Briefing&quot;, published in February of this year. He co-wrote this briefing paper with the Henry Jackson Society&apos;s communications director, Michael Weiss. And when he&apos;s not co-writing Henry Jackson Society strategic briefings, Fakher is the communication manager of the London-based Strategic Research and Communication Centre (SRCC). According to their website, &quot;He joined the centre in 2011 and has been in charge of the centre&apos;s communication strategy and products.&quot; As you may recall, the SRCC is run by one Ausama Monajed: &quot;Mr Monajed founded the centre in 2010. He is widely quoted and interviewed in international press and media outlets. He previously worked as communication consultant in Europe and the US and formerly served as the director of Barada Television \u2026&quot;. Monajed is Fakher&apos;s boss. If this wasn&apos;t enough, for a final Washington twist, on the board of the Strategic Research and Communication Centre sits Murhaf Jouejati, a professor at the National Defence University in DC \u2013 &quot;the premier center for Joint Professional Military Education (JPME)&quot; which is &quot;under the direction of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.&quot; If you happen to be planning a trip to Monajed&apos;s &quot;Strategic Research and Communication Centre&quot;, you&apos;ll find it here: Strategic Research &amp; Communication Centre, Office 36, 88-90 Hatton Garden, Holborn, London EC1N 8PN. Office 36 at 88-90 Hatton Garden is also where you&apos;ll find the London headquarters of The Fake Tan Company, Supercar 4 U Limited, Moola loans (a &quot;trusted loans company&quot;), Ultimate Screeding (for all your screeding needs), and The London School of Attraction \u2013 &quot;a London-based training company which helps men develop the skills and confidence to meet and attract women.&quot; And about a hundred other businesses besides. It&apos;s a virtual office. There&apos;s something oddly appropriate about this. A &quot;communication centre&quot; that doesn&apos;t even have a centre \u2013 a grand name but no physical substance. That&apos;s the reality of Hamza Fakher. On 27 May, Shamik Das of Left Foot Forward quotes again from Fakher&apos;s account of atrocities, which he now describes as an &quot;eyewitness account&quot; (which Cohen never said it was) and which by now has hardened into &quot;the record of the Assad regime&quot;. So, a report of atrocities given by a Henry Jackson Society strategist, who is the communications manager of Mosafed&apos;s PR department, has acquired the gravitas of a historical &quot;record&quot;. This is not to suggest that the account of atrocities must be untrue, but how many of those who give it currency are scrutinising its origins? And let&apos;s not forget, whatever destabilisation has been done in the realm of news and public opinion is being carried out twofold on the ground. We already know that (at the very least) &quot;the Central Intelligence Agency and State Department \u2026 are helping the opposition Free Syrian Army develop logistical routes for moving supplies into Syria and providing communications training.&quot; The bombs doors are open. The plans have been drawn up. This has been brewing for a time. The sheer energy and meticulous planning that&apos;s gone into this change of regime \u2013 it&apos;s breathtaking. The soft power and political reach of the big foundations and policy bodies is vast, but scrutiny is no respecter of fancy titles and fellowships and &quot;strategy briefings&quot;. Executive director of what, it asks. Having &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;human rights&quot; in your job title doesn&apos;t give you a free pass. And if you&apos;re a &quot;communications director&quot; it means your words should be weighed extra carefully. Weiss and Fakher, both communications directors \u2013 PR professionals. At the Chatham House event in June 2011, Monajed is listed as: &quot;Ausama Monajed, director of communications, National Initiative for Change&quot; and he was head of PR for the MJD. The creator of the news website NOW Lebanon, Eli Khoury, is a Saatchi advertising executive. These communications directors are working hard to create what Tamara Wittes called a &quot;positive brand&quot;. They&apos;re selling the idea of military intervention and regime change, and the mainstream news is hungry to buy. Many of the &quot;activists&quot; and spokespeople representing the Syrian opposition are closely (and in many cases financially) interlinked with the US and London \u2013 the very people who would be doing the intervening. Which means information and statistics from these sources isn&apos;t necessarily pure news \u2013 it&apos;s a sales pitch, a PR campaign. But it&apos;s never too late to ask questions, to scrutinise sources. Asking questions doesn&apos;t make you a cheerleader for Assad \u2013 that&apos;s a false argument. It just makes you less susceptible to spin. The good news is, there&apos;s a sceptic born every minute. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"sentences": ["This week&apos;s Tokyo conference, which focused on aid to Afghanistan , confirmed that tackling violence against women would be a priority for the international community beyond the withdrawal of troops in 2014."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "Women", "Life and style", "Human rights", "Law", "Equality", "Society", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-12T20:00:07Z", "title": "Letter: Afghan women's rights", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/afghan-women", "article": "The footage showing the murder of an unnamed 22-year-old Afghan woman by a man believed to be a member of the Taliban is horrific and raises serious questions about the advancement of women&apos;s rights in Afghanistan since the Nato intervention in 2001 (Report, 11 July).

Throughout this beautifully narrated, carefully analytical and at times personally courageous book, Yu shows the dark side of China&apos;s economic &quot;miracle&quot;. His final two chapters reflect modern currents in the west, too: &quot;copycat&quot; can mean d\u00e9tournement, or artistic reappropriation, but also just means knockoff smartphones, pirated books, or tasteless arrivisme.

It turns out that the new London stadium isn&apos;t much cop, and will make &quot;a really poor football stadium&quot; afterwards. (It&apos;s important for English fans to be close to the pitch, without a running track in the way.) As well as the educational architectural discussion (enhanced by Nigel Peake&apos;s line drawings), Abrahams offers a denunciation of Olympic critics. The French left critique of industrialised sport (updated recently in Marc Perelman&apos;s Barbaric Sport: A Global Plague) is rapidly dismissed, while Abrahams sees psychogeographers such as Iain Sinclair and Will Self appropriating the Situationist &quot;d\u00e9rive&quot; without imagining a better world.

Britain&apos;s male gymnasts this week headed to Arques in north-west France, to train alongside Japan, the favourites for Olympic team gold. &quot;In the past we would have a training camp with countries like Sweden and Norway,&quot; says Eddie van Hoof, the British men&apos;s technical director. &quot;But we want to be out there competing with the best. So now we train with the best as well.&quot; It is a measure of just how steeply Britain&apos;s gymnastics ambitions have risen. And nowhere has that vertiginous curve been more visible than in the men&apos;s team event. Until two months ago, no British team \u2013 male or female \u2013 had ever taken first place at a major championships. Then, in May, the British men&apos;s team held off a Russian challenge at the final apparatus to secure a historic gold at the European\u00a0championships in Montpellier. Even more impressive was the manner of their victory: a thrilling display of nerve from Kristian Thomas on the high bar, where he needed to complete a near\u2011perfect\u00a0routine. In Beijing four years ago, Louis Smith&apos;s bronze medal was a seismic event \u2013 Britain&apos;s first individual medal for 100 years and the first of any kind for 80 years. London will reveal the extent of its impact. Britain&apos;s men have never made it to the team finals of the Olympics before; this year there is genuine hope they could win a medal. &quot;Things have just spiralled since Beijing,&quot; says Sam Oldham, the youngest and newest member of the men&apos;s team. &quot;And it&apos;s been amazing to be a part of that. It&apos;s a lot easier once you&apos;ve got one or two medals. The younger kids are thinking: &apos;If he can do that, we can do that.&apos; So we&apos;ve got a great set-up now and it&apos;s produced not just one or two gymnasts, we&apos;ve got nine or 10 who could have been in this Olympic team. We&apos;ve got great depth.&quot; Japan and China have finished first and second at the past two world championships and their dominance is likely to continue at the Games. But the fight for bronze is thrillingly open and, says Van Hoof, the men&apos;s European championship victory has provided a well-timed confidence boost. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;re fearing anybody in Europe. Obviously there&apos;s still a huge amount of respect for teams like Russia and Germany who have traditionally done particularly well. &quot;The USA \u2013 we think they talk themselves up a bit, it&apos;s typical American hype, although they will certainly be pushing for a medal. The one unknown is Korea, who never really get a mention. Gymnastically and technically they are excellent, but they tend to make mistakes in big competitions.&quot; Other nations too have noticed the British threat. &quot;Great Britain have done an incredible job over the past year,&quot; says Kevin Mazeika, the head coach of the US men&apos;s team. &quot;They&apos;ve improved tremendously. I think the men&apos;s team final is going to be one of the highlights of the Olympics because everybody&apos;s been working so hard and been forced to raise their level. It&apos;s going to be an outstanding competition.&quot; And while Smith remains the strongest hope for an individual apparatus medal on the pommel horse (against his close Hungarian rival, Krisztian Berki), there are outside medal chances for Thomas and Dan Purvis on the floor. Purvis, the three-times British champion and arguably one of the most overlooked figures in British sport, is also fighting for an all-around medal, having finished fourth in the world championships in Tokyo. So how did Britain&apos;s men become so good? It is not that long since British gymnastics had a similar reputation to British ski-jumping. &quot;You don&apos;t have to look back too far in our history, maybe seven or eight years,&quot; admits Tim Jones, the performance director, &quot;and there were some pretty dark times for the men&apos;s programme.&quot; Jones&apos;s arrival in 2007 coincided with an injection of Lottery funding, which now allows the gymnasts to train full-time. And while the monthly stipend remains modest, it has, as Van Hoof points out, removed the need &quot;to do part-time jobs and scratch around for a living&quot;. Purvis also credits the arrival, from Russia, of the national coaches Andrei Popov and Sergei Sizhanov who, he says, have &quot;really helped to improve our basics&quot;. But some argue that it was actually the loss of funding to the men&apos;s sport in 2003 that triggered the most important change. With no money for a central elite programme, gymnasts remained training with their personal coaches at their clubs, while a semi-centralised system grew up to offer and encourage those clubs with sports science, regular evaluation and medical support. &quot;Now the team meet up once a month if not more, so we know what we&apos;re doing and we spur each other on,&quot; says Purvis. It has bred a generation of talent accustomed to winning. In 2008, the British junior team, including Purvis and Oldham, were European champions; two years later Oldham won high-bar gold and pommel silver at the Youth Olympics. &quot;We focused, in the first instance, on junior results,&quot; Jones says. &quot;It&apos;s that transition of good quality junior athletes into high quality senior athletes that has been the key for us.&quot; &quot;In the past,&quot; Van Hoof adds, &quot;we always had great individuals who could shine on one occasion but didn&apos;t come up with the goods consistently. But this last six years have been crucial. The athletes had to become much more professional and dedicated to what they were doing \u2013 it was no longer a hobby sport.&quot; The team-mates know each other well, having competed together for years, and their personalities complement each other. &quot;Kristian Thomas is really level headed,&quot; Purvis says. &quot;He&apos;s almost the daddy of the group. Louis is the really outgoing one, really bubbly, he gets the team going.&quot; Listen closely as a British gymnast takes to the parallel bars or the rings and you can hear Smith&apos;s noisy encouragement. One of the most attractive things about this team is their ability to balance a strong, self-motivating rivalry with enjoyment of each other&apos;s success. &quot;Andrei Popov said we&apos;re trying to make history, just by competing,&quot; says Purvis. But they will believe, quietly, that they can do more."}, {"sentences": ["He left his family at 15 to train in Tokyo with his hero, the Athens gold medallist Naoya Tsukahara, and took silver at Beijing at the age of 19.", "&quot;It takes people months to learn moves, but he&apos;ll try stuff he&apos;s never done before and just get up and do it.&quot; Jonathan Horton, who took all-around bronze at the world championships in 2010, dubbed Uchimura &quot;a machine&quot; after he won gold despite competing with a shoulder injury; he won his last title, in Tokyo, by more than three points, the gymnastic equivalent of lapping your opponents."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Gymnastics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-13T17:15:29Z", "title": "London 2012: Kohei Uchimura can bring perfection back to gymnastics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/13/london-2012-kohei-uchimura-gymnastics", "article": "Gymnastics has not dealt in perfect 10s since Nadia Comaneci&apos;s famous scores of 1976.

The island is the northernmost landmass of the Japanese archipelago, and equivalent in size to Ireland. An hour&apos;s flight from Tokyo, the 400-hectare park is the brainchild of entrepreneur Mitsushige Hayashi, who acquired the land with a view to offsetting the carbon footprint of his newspaper, Tokachi Mainichi. The vision for the garden, to which I was asked to contribute along with the landscape designer Fumiaki Takano, is to create something that is sustainable for the next 1,000 years \u2013 a big ambition, and one that hopes to preserve this section of the island. In reality, none of us have much control over climate change or economy, but we believe education is key. In a country where the greater part of the population is urbanised and far removed from landscape and nature, the idea is to re-engage people with the environment. I have been working at the park since 2000 and in that time we have been coaxing visitors from their comfort zone. Delicate wooden walkways float over managed woodland flora and lead to a\u00a0rolling landform of five hectares. I designed the Earth Garden to merge a flat, arable field into the foothills of the mountain and encourage people to move out into the landscape. We used ornamental gardens, too, and a\u00a0kitchen garden with vegetables and fruit from east and west. Although winter is the dominant season in Hokkaido and it arrives early \u2013 at its coldest, it reaches -25C and the landscape becomes a\u00a0whiteout \u2013 the island has become a focus of contemporary Japanese gardening. Cool summer nights allow a whole range of plants to thrive which would succumb to the heat and humidity of the other islands, and the park is part of a garden trail connecting the seven major gardens flourishing here. The Garden Show is this year&apos;s contribution to the future of the park and it is unlike any other in that it is set within the forest and deliberately influenced by this context. The theme for the show explores &quot;a crush with nature&quot; and the contestants have been encouraged to see the gardens as an access point into the natural world, rather than creating a\u00a0space unrelated to its environment. The show could not be more different from Chelsea. There are no prizes and each of the gardens is given a small and equally sized budget. Most importantly, the gardens will be able to evolve within the forest context for the three-month duration of the show. The gardens nestle into the woods along a watercourse that is fed from the mountains. They are reached by soft bark paths that meander quietly between the dappled glades. My own garden takes the form of an arcing bridge that links the woodland with the meadows and mountains beyond. But everyone had their own particular angle on the &quot;crush&quot; with the forest. A particular favourite caught the angling light in a grid of Perspex verticals that you walked through and became lost in as a child might in a forest. Another had a series of bells attached to the branches in the tree canopy, which rang in the breeze.

Japanese publishers and the rise of retro", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jul/16/japanese-retro-games", "article": "If you&apos;re a fan of 12-year-old Japanese games, you&apos;ve had a good day so far. Sega has confirmed that it is bringing the Dreamcast hit Sonic Adventure 2 to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in the autumn. There are also whispers of Yakuza 1 and 2 re-releases. Meanwhile, Capcom has announced an updated re-run of its idiosyncratic 2D fighting game, Jojo&apos;s Bizarre Adventure, originally released in the arcades back in 1999. That will be hitting XBLA and PSN in August.  These are just the latest examples in an ongoing and escalating trend. Over the past 12 months we&apos;ve seen HD re-releases for Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, and for Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, Devil May Cry and Zone of the Enders. Often these have tied in smartly with news of forthcoming releases \u2013 Silent Hill, Metal Gear and Devil May Cry all have fresh additions coming this year. But in other cases, it&apos;s pure nostalgia \u2013 or, worringly, the signs of an emerging business model. Take Sega. In March, the company announced that it would be undergoing a phase of &apos;structural reform&apos;, downsizing its Western operation, shedding jobs and focusing on key brands. Part of this process will also involve concentrating more efforts on the publisher&apos;s cheaper, less risky digital offerings \u2013 and while interesting new titles like Hell Yeah will figure, the emphasis is currently on HD remakes: hence, Jet Set Radio and NiGHTS Into Dreams both returning after a decade in the vaults.  There is a growing sense that, in global terms, the Japanese industry has lost its way. Major brands like Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Final Fantasy have failed to compete with behemoths like Call of Duty, Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto, and innovation has stuttered. In 2009, Japanese game design legend Keiji Inafune controversially claimed that his country&apos;s industry was finished \u2013 he was at the Tokyo Game Show, once the bright spot on the gaming calendar, now a half-empty shadow, filled with RPGs and mech battle sims.  At the Develop conference earlier this month, Dewi Tanner \u2013 a freelance developer who spent years working in Japan, most notably for NanaOn-Sha, the creator of Pa Rappa the Rapper \u2013 gave a fascinating talk on the state of the Japanese games industry. He argued that Japan traditionally performs much better, creatively speaking, when it is leading trends rather than following them. With the arcade market of the eighties and nineties, Japanese companies like Sega and Namco were at the head of the business, setting trends and leading the way with titles like Ridge Racer and Virtua Fighter.  According to Tanner, however, the country struggles when it seeks to reflect or catch up with global trends. Western fads such as vast open-world shooters, seamless driving sims and dark, adult orientated action RPGs, have been more tricky to comprehend because they&apos;re not part of the native gaming DNA. The responses to this have largely failed. Japanese studios attempting to create games that look and feel like Western releases have produced the likes of Resident Evil 5 and Final Fantasy XIII \u2013 fatally compromised titles that either mimic Western trends or seek to simplify and iron out local eccentricities.  Other publishers have attempted to farm out key brands to Western developers, infusing their franchises with global appeal. Or that was the idea. What this has resulted in is titles like Bionic Commando \u2013 titles no one cares about, whether they live in Japan, the States or Scandinavia.  Currently, then, Japanese mainstream games development is in something of a rut: attempting western-style games in-house doesn&apos;t work, but farming out familiar brands doesn&apos;t always work either (though let&apos;s see how Ninja Theory gets on with Devil May Cry).  A key problem is also in the encouragement of new talent. The major publishers are still dominated by the big name producers and directors we&apos;ve been hearing about for over a decade. According to Tanner, the new generation just isn&apos;t being encouraged. Japan does have a healthy indie scene, but removed from the Western community, its harder for the likes of Dong or Masaaki Hirano to get wider coverage. The worry, of course, is that the Japanese publishers don&apos;t care. Traditional console titles aren&apos;t doing astoundingly well in the country anyway. In 2011, only three releases sold more than a million copies in Japan \u2013 a country of 128m people: Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3D Land and Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. There has, however, been a massive uptake of social mobile games, with platform providers like Gree and DeNA becoming hugely successful by tapping into this exploding preference for casual, highly connected phone titles. Indeed, a huge industry of small studios has grown up, all self-publishing their own titles for native phone operators. The traditional publishers like Konami and Capcom are also heavily involved. When Konami announced its financial results last year, titles like Dragon Collection and Professional Baseball Dream Nine, which run on the Gree and DeNA-run Mobage platforms, were among its biggest earners. Could it be then, that far from going through some protracted period of creative decline, the Japanese games industry is merely switching its focus, away from the global console business and toward the booming native market for social phone games? Sega, Capcom and co have struggled for several years to attune their development studios to Western tastes, with only intermittent successes \u2013 they have never really bought into our obsession with gritty realism and graphic brutality. Instead, there is a thriving local user-base with a familiar mindset and huge growth potential.  Perhaps this reliance on HD remakes and farmed out brand extensions isn&apos;t something we should pity Japan and its developers for. Perhaps we&apos;re the ones getting the scraps; we&apos;re the ones living in the past. Perhaps, Japan has motored into its own version of the future, far away from ours."}, {"sentences": ["But behind Ozawa is a queue of leaders from minor parties \u2013 as well as Tokyo&apos;s rightwing governor, Shintaro Ishihara \u2013 who are expected to consider a pact with Hashimoto&apos;s upstarts from Osaka.", "He was born in Tokyo, and after his parents divorced was raised by his mother in a poor district of Osaka, home to the buraku \u2013 an &quot;untouchable&quot; underclass \u2013 since the 17th century.", "Despite his origins, Hashimoto went on to study at Waseda, a prestigious private university in Tokyo, and became a familiar face on TV offering his views as a celebrity lawyer before entering politics.", "Hashimoto has said he will not run for national office while he still has work to do as mayor, notably the merging of Osaka city and prefecture into a huge, Tokyo-like metropolis.", "&quot;The next election could see the birth of a new kind of Japanese politicis.&quot; In the meantime, Hashimoto has launched attacks on the Tokyo political elite&apos;s dithering over everything from to nuclear power to tax increases.", "&quot;Like the rise of extremist and nationalist parties of the right and left in Europe, Hashimoto derives his popularity from popular frustration with the established mainstream parties and the perceived failure of representative democracy,&quot; says Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-17T10:47:26Z", "title": "Charismatic outsider Toru Hashimoto tipped as future leader of Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader", "article": "Depending on who you ask, Toru Hashimoto is either a dangerous populist bent on returning Japan to its militarist past, or a charismatic radical leading a crusade to breathe life into the country&apos;s stagnant politics. Still in his early 40s, and with no experience of national office, Hashimoto is not only the most talked-about politician in Japan, he is now being tipped as its future leader. As mayor of Osaka, he has built a reputation for controversy, openness and a self-belief that has delivered stunning victories in local elections \u2013 qualities that could soon be tested on the national electorate. As the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, battles to keep his Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) intact after a recent defection by its largest faction, Hashimoto is priming as many as 300 hand-picked candidates to run in what some analysts expect will be a snap general election this year. &quot;The next election is our last chance to change Japan,&quot; Hashimoto said recently. &quot;If there are voices calling for Osaka&apos;s example to spread across Japan, [we] will respond firmly to those calls. Japan&apos;s old politics has to be swept away and a new politics built in its place.&quot; The established parties have much to fear from Hashimoto, who became mayor of Japan&apos;s second biggest city in December after three years as governor of Osaka prefecture. The prospects for an alliance with Ichiro Ozawa, the influential &quot;shadow shogun&quot; who left the DPJ to form a new party, have dimmed. But behind Ozawa is a queue of leaders from minor parties \u2013 as well as Tokyo&apos;s rightwing governor, Shintaro Ishihara \u2013 who are expected to consider a pact with Hashimoto&apos;s upstarts from Osaka. With his policies yet to be tested on the national stage, much of Hashimoto&apos;s appeal lies in his style and unconventional background. He was born in Tokyo, and after his parents divorced was raised by his mother in a poor district of Osaka, home to the buraku \u2013 an &quot;untouchable&quot; underclass \u2013 since the 17th century. He never knew his father, a member of the yakuza, who committed suicide after becoming indebted to underworld associates while his son was still young. Despite his origins, Hashimoto went on to study at Waseda, a prestigious private university in Tokyo, and became a familiar face on TV offering his views as a celebrity lawyer before entering politics. His Osaka Ishin no Kai (Osaka Restoration Group) party has positioned itself as an alternative to politics as usual which, after the appointment of six prime ministers in as many years \u2013 during which there have been only two elections \u2013 resembles a power-sharing agreement between a political elite with an unshakeable sense of entitlement. In style and substance, Hashimoto could not be more of a departure from that. Critics say his high-profile tussles with teachers&apos; unions and his ban on public servants with tattoos are proof that he is an autocrat in the making. But from his power base in Osaka, a port city faced with huge debts, failing schools and the highest proportion of welfare recipients in the country, the 43-year-old has won over despondent voters with attacks on inept national politicians and calls for a more presidential style of leadership. His contempt for consensus building is matched by an enthusiasm for tearing up Japan&apos;s US-authored pacifist constitution, prompting one commentator to liken him to Hitler and nickname his movement &quot;Hashism&quot;. After months of speculation, Hashimoto has said 200-300 Ishin no Kai members will run in the next general election, selected from 2,000 students at the political finishing school he opened in Osaka in March. &quot;Become warriors,&quot; he told them during a recent address. &quot;Let&apos;s fight together. Let&apos;s change Japan.&quot; As support slips away for the ruling and main opposition parties, Hashimoto and Ishin no Kai have a deep well of popular disillusion from which to draw. Nearly 80% of Japanese are dissatisfied with the direction the country is heading in, while 86% blame the government, according to a survey by the Pew Research Centre in Washington. Hashimoto has said he will not run for national office while he still has work to do as mayor, notably the merging of Osaka city and prefecture into a huge, Tokyo-like metropolis. But experts on the city&apos;s politics believe he may simply be biding his time. &quot;He probably won&apos;t run this time,&quot; says Yuji Yoshitomi, an Osaka-based journalist who has written a book about Hashimoto. &quot;But the problem for Ishin no Kai is that its popularity is entirely dependent on him.&quot; Yoshitomi believes Hashimoto may wait and see what kind of political arrangement emerges from the next election \u2013 which must be held by August 2013 \u2013 before deciding on his future. At the very least, a decent showing by Ishin no Kai \u2013 perhaps 60 out of 480 seats in the lower house \u2013 could be the catalyst for dramatic changes in Japan&apos;s political landscape. &quot;The DPJ is in trouble and the main opposition Liberal Democratic party [LDP] is in no fit state to fill the void, so the time is ripe for Ishin no Kai and other regional parties,&quot; Yoshitomi says. &quot;The next election could see the birth of a new kind of Japanese politicis.&quot; In the meantime, Hashimoto has launched attacks on the Tokyo political elite&apos;s dithering over everything from to nuclear power to tax increases. Instead, he envisages a &quot;grand reset&quot; he likens to Japan&apos;s transformation from a feudal to industrial economy 150 years ago. The postwar search for consensus, he says, has turned Japan into a democratic basketcase. &quot;Japan is a democracy but it can&apos;t make decisions,&quot; he said at a recent press conference. &quot;We have endless discussions and take on board everyone&apos;s opinion, but nothing ever comes of it.&quot; To achieve that change, he has proposed the abolition of the upper house of parliament, which can block legislation; direct elections for prime minister; and more powers for local government. &quot;Like the rise of extremist and nationalist parties of the right and left in Europe, Hashimoto derives his popularity from popular frustration with the established mainstream parties and the perceived failure of representative democracy,&quot; says Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. &quot;He offers oversimplified, authoritarian pseudo-answers, which don&apos;t really solve problems, but serve as an outlet for popular frustration with the existing political system.&quot; At times, Hashimoto sounds like Junichiro Koizumi, a former Japanese prime minister with hawkish views on defence who shares the mayor&apos;s enthusiasm for Thatcherite social policy. He wants to make it easier to revise Japan&apos;s constitution, which bans the use of force to settle disputes, a move that critics say would open the door to a more aggressive military amid mounting territorial friction with China. On welfare, he apes the conservative right in the US and Britain. &quot;Of course we have to support people who are absolutely unable to fend for themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;But the rest should be encouraged to stand on their own two feet.&quot; Nakano, however, sees a man willing to ditch his principles in his quest for Japan&apos;s highest office. &quot;He is not a Margaret Thatcher or even a Junichiro Koizumi,&quot; says Nakano. &quot;He seems less principled and more populist than they were. He approaches politics purely as a power struggle. Domination is what is at stake.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["While sunseekers in Fukushima marked the day with music, hula dancing and beach volleyball, tens of thousands of people marched in Tokyo calling for the closure of all of Japan&apos;s nuclear power plants."], "tags": ["Japan", "Fukushima", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-17T11:50:58Z", "title": "Fukushima beach reopens to the public", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/17/fukushima-beach-reopens-to-public", "article": "Holidaymakers have descended on a beach near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, the first time they have been allowed to swim in the area since last year&apos;s triple meltdown. Local authorities decided to open Nakoso beach, located just 65km (40 miles) south of the stricken plant, after declaring the water safe. Radiation doses in the air were also low, at up to 0.07 microsieverts an hour, far below those considered a threat to health. On Monday, which was a national holiday held to celebrate the ocean, about 1,000 people, including young families, headed to the beach for the first time in two summers. &quot;The water&apos;s still cold, but it&apos;s going to be a good season,&quot; Yukiei Hakozaki, a local guide, told Kyodo News. &quot;We want lots of people to come.&quot; All 17 beaches in Fukushima prefecture, a popular surfing spot, were closed last summer amid concern over contamination from the power plant and debris created by the tsunami on 11 March, in which almost 20,000 people died. According to the local authorities, the concentration of radioactivity in the water is negligible, at below 1 becquerel per litre, and poses no risk to the health of sunbathers and swimmers. Radiation readings are displayed on the beach twice a day. Nakoso, the prefecture&apos;s southernmost beach, will have to accommodate local holidaymakers alone for the time being, as there are no plans to reopen other beaches in the area. While sunseekers in Fukushima marked the day with music, hula dancing and beach volleyball, tens of thousands of people marched in Tokyo calling for the closure of all of Japan&apos;s nuclear power plants. Organisers estimated that 170,000 people crammed into Yoyogi park in the capital, while the police put the figure closer to 75,000. The demonstration was part of a campaign to put pressure on the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, into reversing his decision to restart two nuclear reactors in western Japan to avoid possible power cuts this summer. One reactor at Oi power plant in Fukui prefecture was restarted earlier this month, while the second is expected to go back online later this week. The march was led by the Nobel literature laureate Kenzaburo Oe, who told the crowd: &quot;The government allowed the Oi nuclear reactors to restart and it&apos;s going to allow more reactors to restart. We feel we have been insulted by the government.&quot; Oe, along with the composer and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and other activists, is putting together a petition of 10m signatures demanding an end to Japan&apos;s use of nuclear power.

The young man has barely set foot outside his room in the past two years, spending 23 hours a day in isolation. His mother leaves him meals on a tray outside his door. He sleeps during the day, wakes up in the evening and spends all night browsing the net and chatting, and playing video games.&quot; Masa is suffering from hikikomori (social withdrawal). This complaint mainly affects young men, taking the form, in the absence of schizophrenia, of a lifestyle centred on the home, and an almost complete lack of interest in school or work, with symptoms persisting for more than six months. In March Teo published an article, in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry, on the first case of hikikomori observed in the US: a man, aged 30, who had lived in isolation in his flat for three years. &quot;He spent the first year in a fairly large walk-in closet, feeding on ready-made meals,&quot; Teo explains. &quot;He did not wash, defecated and urinated in jars, spending his time on the net and playing video games.&quot; The patient agreed to undergo cognitive behavioural therapy, at the end of which he went into remission. &quot;The only rigorous epidemiological study of hikikomori is from Japan, and the study indicated [that the] lifetime prevalence of hikikomori is over 1.2%,&quot; says Professor Takahiro Kato of the neuropsychiatry department of Kyushu University, Japan. &quot;Another survey estimated that 264,000 &apos;core&apos; hikikomori cases exist [in Japan&apos;s population of 127 million]. This report also estimated another 460,000 cases on the verge of becoming hikikomori.&quot; According to Kato, in the near future there will be nearly a million cases in Japan, which will have a socio-economic impact on the country. Some go so far as to say the condition has reached epidemic proportions. Hikikomori youths often suffer from a psychiatric complaint that sustains their isolation. Others display no mental disorder. Above all this phenomenon is not related to what is referred to as an &quot;addiction&quot; to the net and video games. In fact, Kato points out, these two media simply reduce the need for face-to-face communication with others. Kato believes that &quot;worldwide shifts of lifestyles and in social life are in the background of the growing hikikomori phenomenon&quot;. He explains that in traditional Japanese families there were many children living under one roof alongside grandparents. This has been replaced by family units in which the mother and father work, with fewer children and less support from relatives and neighbours. &quot;Under this environment, hikikomori cases easily become problematic.&quot; Another factor is the high-pressure education system. The French psychiatrist Serge Tisseron has a slightly different theory. &quot;Hikikomori,&quot; he says, &quot;could be a form of withdrawal behaviour enabling adolescents to cope unconsciously with emotions and anxiety about the future, avoiding a full-blown psychiatric pathology, such as a nervous breakdown or the development of a phobia.&quot; Hikikomori is not exclusively related to Japanese culture, cases having been observed in Oman, Spain, Italy, South Korea, the US and France. Dr Marie-Jeanne Guedj-Bourdiau, head of the psychiatric unit at the H\u00f4pital Saint-Anne in Paris, has registered &quot;about 30 cases in the past 15 months concerning adolescents of 16 or over, but also young people in their late 20s who have extremely limited social lives, after struggling to complete university studies&quot;. In a recent paper published in a French journal, Les Annales M\u00e9dico-Psychologiques, Guedj-Bourdiau describes 21 instances of social reclusion, all but one of whom were visited at home following a request from the family. The shame, indeed guilt, experienced by families leads to long delays before deciding to seek medical advice, almost always linked to the parents&apos; desire to bring their child out of isolation or the fear of an attempted suicide. The teenagers covered by the study had been living in reclusion for over a year but saw nothing abnormal in their behaviour. Of the 21 cases, 16 were also suffering from a psychiatric complaint. Visits to the home by a therapist are the only way to establish contact with the youths. But &quot;admission to hospital is necessary when reclusion has taken too much of a hold entailing genuine disability&quot;, Guedj-Bourdiau explains. &quot;Sometimes the family tells us that symptoms have reappeared, one or two years later. Much as any abnormal behaviour, social withdrawal tends to recur,&quot; she points out, but adds: &quot;Once they have received care these young people thank us for having reached out to them in their suffering and rescued them from hell.&quot; This article originally appeared in Le Monde"}, {"sentences": ["JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesCuushe - I Dreamt About SilenceTokyo artist Cuushe last brought out an album three years ago, and it turns out she spent the stretch of time after it was released building her own world."], "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-18T09:17:04Z", "title": "July's best music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/jul/18/music-alliance-pact-july", "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the whole 37-track compilation through Ge.tt here.

Actually, as Pray That I Move shows, Josephine&apos;s vocal delivery and idiosyncratic lyrical vision have more in common with Morrissey than Mahalia Jackson. She&apos;s already made a big stir on the regional scene with Elbow&apos;s Guy Garvey and singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt among her champions. Her debut album, Portrait, is out on October 8.  FINLAND: GlueMinttu &amp; Olli - Corduroy BoyMinttu &amp; Olli are a graceful couple homebrewing sweet pop songs.

FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredThe Lemon Queen - Sailing In A Wild LoveThe Lemon Queen hails from Angers, east of France, where the music scene is flourishing at the moment, with everyone trying to play their cards right. The band makes a difference with their psychedelic pop-rock sound, reminiscent of Klaxons, a comparison particularly true on Sailing In A Wild Love. With catchy melodies and an undeniable energy, this quartet should be followed very closely.  GERMANY: BlogparteiSandy Bird - RevokeLittle is known about this band from Berlin which formed in 2008 and have already experienced some member changes. Revoke is taken from their Bambaloo EP. Expect to hear more of this promising post-rock act soon.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaElectric Litany - Sad PartBleak and broody music has never been quite so thrilling. Sad Part is an elaborately orchestrated, inherently dark, minimalist, piano dirge, like a sad dream scented with rain, with searingly compelling lyrical imagery, eerie vocals full of intuitive swells and fades, pauses that embrace some of the pious silence of a prayer and tremolo guitars that do an excellent job of creating a beguiling atmosphere. Electric Litany&apos;s highly anticipated sophomore album is set to be released later this year.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minn\u00datid\u00far - Grasping For AirThis latest track from the ambitious chamber-pop 10-piece sees them entering almost disco-like realms.

INDONESIA: DeathrockstarMarcel Thee - Endless HeartAfter more than 10 years channeling his creativity with the indie-rock band Sajama Cut, Marcel Thee is now the only original member left. Here he pursues his passion for lo-fi, layered sounds, gospel music and poetry. If you love W.B. Yeats, the album is a tribute to him.  IRELAND: Nialler9No Spill Blood - Good CompanyFormed from members of Adebisi Shank, Elk, Magic Pockets and Hands Up Who Wants To Die, No Spill Blood&apos;s first EP is released this month on Sargent House, home to Fang Island, Omar Rodriguez Lopez and Les Butcherettes. If you&apos;re familiar with any of the bands mentioned then it won&apos;t surprise you to hear that No Spill Blood play it fast and furious, running on the noxious interplay between drums, effect-laden synth, low-end bass fuzz and bellowed vocals.  ITALY: PolaroidCosmetic - La Fine Del GiornoCosmetic may sing in Italian but I&apos;m sure their songs will speak to you anyway. Their rough and nervous shoegaze sound often drifts towards more muscular music as it makes way for an explosion of guitars. When I saw them live the first name that came to my mind was Dinosaur Jr. The motto on their Facebook page - &quot;Noise and melodies that fight to get the better of each other&quot; - pretty much sums up Cosmetic.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesCuushe - I Dreamt About SilenceTokyo artist Cuushe last brought out an album three years ago, and it turns out she spent the stretch of time after it was released building her own world. I Dreamt About Silence sees her stretched-out vocals covered in hazy synths, every sound wrapping around one another to create a glowing track you want to be enveloped by. Cuushe shows the best way to escape the rush of the modern world is to construct your own dreamy universe.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaBark Bark Disco - Let&apos;s Do ThisBark Bark Disco is a lo-fi pop band fronted by former inventor Morris Woodcock (great-grandson of Manfred von Richthofen aka The Red Baron). Their songs have a raw immediacy with catchiness befitting a Broadway musical. Let&apos;s Do This is from their latest EP of the same name.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaSonido Gallo Negro - LeticiaChicha is a psychedelic mixture of cumbia with rock &apos;n&apos; roll elements, originating in Peru during the 70s. Mexico City&apos;s Sonido Gallo Negro have unearthed the genre and hybridized it with local surf and rockabilly. Supplemented by the spooky visuals of design wizard Dr Alderete, their live shows are an intoxicating display of collective hypnosis. Throughout July 2012, this song and 13 more will be available for free download from Red Bull Panam\u00e9rika as part of our fourth birthday compilation.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!EARTH CONTROL - Mijn Nieuwe SteekkarArt-school punks Bert and Marcel met at Groningen&apos;s local venue Vera. Every week they formed a brand new band, recorded an album and played one show. But with EARTH CONTROL, things didn&apos;t go exactly as planned; the duo decided to continue under this capitalized moniker. Though barely audible due to their lo-fi production and sub-par electronic equipment, EARTH CONTROL sing in their native Dutch tongue. Their sardonic lyrics deal with everyday subjects such as cell phones, sweaters or, in this case, the online purchase of a new trolley.  PERU: SoTBGrita Lobos - Mr DangerGrita Lobos is a musician who hides behind an Ethiopian mask, his sound influenced by New Order and Depeche Mode in mesmerizing electronic songs that suggest dark stories. Mr Danger is taken from his debut self-titled album which features vocals from actress and singer Anah\u00ed de C\u00e1rdenas.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Micro Audio Waves - Cartoon RealMicro Audio Waves, who made history in 2004 by becoming the first Portuguese band to have a John Peel session, have released four albums and a fifth is due soon. Cartoon Real is a MAP exclusive free download, taken from their Zoetrope concept album, developed with choreographer Rui Horta and released with a DVD featuring one of their unique multimedia and performance live shows.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieEl Medio - Hasta CaerEl Medio is the solo project of Leonardo Balasques (Oscilador 4, Bal\u00fan). Since 2004, Balasques has used this outlet to release very personal songs about life, friendships and love. Using his bedroom (and subsequently his living room) as a recording studio, Leo has crafted an expansive discography that experiments with the confrontation of synths and traditional instruments to create a folk/pop hybrid that warms the heart and stimulates the brain. El Medio has just released the album No Le Tengas Miedo Al Amor, on which you&apos;ll find Hasta Caer, featuring strings by Bal\u00fan&apos;s Ang\u00e9lica Negr\u00f3n and an unexpected, yet much welcomed, dose of blistering guitar noise and distortion.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseSubcarpa\u021bi - Underground FolclorSubcarpa\u021bi is an explosive mixture of old and new. It&apos;s an eclectic combination that brings together melancholy Romanian folk songs, Romanian unity songs, traditional instruments and the rhythms of trip-hop, dubstep, hip-hop and dancehall.  RUSSIA: Big EchoLomovolokno - 22On this short preview from his upcoming album, beatmaker Lomovolokno moves to the next level of romantic harmonies, leaving us excited for a full-length release. He is one of those people who needs time and space to make music, so you need to wait patiently. But when the tracks are finally out, there is nothing as beautiful to compare.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopHoly Esque - RoseThere&apos;s a tangible buzz about the Glasgow music scene right now and part of that has to do with the emergence of Holy Esque. There&apos;s a dark magic about their sound. The rasping, quivering vocals of Pat Hynes calls to mind The Undertones or Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, while the squalls of guitar elicit comparisons with Joy Division or Glasvegas. The anthemic Rose, a MAP exclusive free download, is taken from their excellent debut EP.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Kiat - Riding Past Draco (feat. Klose)Exciting times are looming in the urban jungle of Singapore as audio-visual super-collective Syndicate turns up the heat, dropping influential honcho Kiat&apos;s new album like an A-bomb of intricate beats and samples that warp you into the inner workings of string theory. Featuring stellar collaborations with artists such as Vandetta, Klose, Digital and Isaac Aiesili, the album - titled The Inner Galaxy - decisively proclaims that electronic music from Singapore has come of age and is a force to be reckoned with. Evolution never happened this fast.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Fire Through The Window - Hey!Meet Fire Through The Window. They have the ability to take a simple melody, add their very own quirky styling and turn it into something truly infectious and endearing, all while maintaining a fun pop sensibility. That is wholly true with their song Hey! - it is fun, funky and best shows off the band.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieWagwak - Arabian NightLoud indie-folk duo Wagwak have been around for a few years and made themselves a name at home. They recently left Korea to travel through Europe, playing gigs where they can, and having sung in English all along they&apos;re well prepared to bring their sound to an international audience. Before moving from their native Seoul, Wagwak released EP The Way To Drive Into The Arabian Sunset, opening with the slightly psychedelic Arabian Night.  SPAIN: MusikornerStand Up Against Heart Crime - I Can&apos;t Stand Myself SoberStand Up Against Heart Crime are five desolate souls whose lives have been touched by unease and unhappiness, five romantics who create the soundtrack of a loser who has grown up through the years. They are from Barcelona, and they have played in one of the most important festivals in Spain, S\u00f3nar. I Can&apos;t Stand Myself Sober is a pitiful fable of lack of self-esteem.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaHanna - LionessHanna is Gothenburg-based Hanna G\u00f6ransson, formerly known as Hanna Lovisa and one half of Cat5. As Hanna, she has teamed up with acclaimed Swedish producer Dan Lissvik (of Studio) and Canada&apos;s Young Galaxy to record her new EP Lioness, where feisty pop \u00e1 la a certain Robyn meets Lissvik&apos;s characteristic grooves. The Lioness EP is out now via Sunshower Records and a first full-length is in the works.  SWITZERLAND: 78sMarochine - Braunvieh ExpressMarochine is an instrumental band from Lucerne which alternates its style skilfully between jazz and noise to create beautiful soundscapes. They have released a four-song EP that can be downloaded for free on Bandcamp.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATSoaked - Groove OnSoaked is a synth-pop band based in Istanbul. They formed in 2003 but their first EP only came out in 2010. With the success of it they recorded the Aftermath album at the end of 2011. In their own words, they describe themselves as &quot;not only a musical ensemble but also a creative artistic platform, determined to provide the quality performance and art that Turkish audiences crave&quot;. It might sound pretty pretentious but it sure is true.  UNITED STATES: I Guess I&apos;m FloatingPoolside - Slow DownNew-to-the-scene DJ duo Poolside, from Los Angeles, couldn&apos;t have found a better way to jump into the public consciousness than funky superjam Slow Down. Sounding like a sublime mix of Sebastien Tellier and LCD Soundsystem, the track glows and shimmers in every way - and now it&apos;s perfectly positioned to dominate summer mixtapes across the world.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sTomates Fritos - Eterna SoledadTomates Fritos returns to the Music Alliance Pact after first appearing in July 2010. This time they have released their fourth studio album, Hotel Miramar (free to download on Bandcamp), in which they dare to show a &quot;purest&quot; side to the band - a slight departure from the folk sound that featured in previous records."}, {"sentences": ["During a recent e-book fair in Tokyo, the 49-year-old entrepreneur brandished a T-shirt bearing the message: &quot;Destroy Amazon.&quot; To do so, he has enlisted hitherto sceptical Japanese publishers who appear to have overcome their fear of dramatic falls in physical book sales once Japanese consumers have made the shift to digital.", "According to Yano Research Institute, a market research firm in Tokyo, Japan&apos;s e-book market will be worth 150bn yen by 2015, compared with 67bn yen in 2010; the market for e-readers is expected to soar from 2bn yen to 70bn yen over the same period.", "Roy Larke, professor of international marketing at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, said the shift to digital was inevitable."], "tags": ["Japan", "E-readers", "Ebooks", "Books", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Technology", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-18T09:59:40Z", "title": "Japan finally embraces e-reader revolution", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/18/japan-rakuten-e-reader-evolution", "article": "For a nation of technology-loving avid readers, Japan has been slow to join the digital publishing revolution. While consumers in the US and Europe increasingly turn to e-readers, many Japanese have stubbornly refused to part with conventional reading matter. Look around the carriage of a packed commuter train and most people will still be immersed in a book, not flicking through the virtual pages of a Kindle. Manga comics that can be read on mobile phones are one of the country&apos;s few success stories in digital publishing. But that could all be about to change from Thursday, when the Japanese online retail giant Rakuten launches an e-reader it hopes will see off an expected challenge from Amazon&apos;s device later this year, and corner the world&apos;s second-biggest publishing market. While several firms, including Sony, have already attempted to grow the digital market, Rakuten and Amazon are expected to be key \u2013 and bitter \u2013 rivals. At stake is a slice of a book market estimated to be worth $23.5bn (\u00a315bn). Rakuten&apos;s chief executive, Hiroshi Mikitani, has made no secret of his desire to take on Amazon. During a recent e-book fair in Tokyo, the 49-year-old entrepreneur brandished a T-shirt bearing the message: &quot;Destroy Amazon.&quot; To do so, he has enlisted hitherto sceptical Japanese publishers who appear to have overcome their fear of dramatic falls in physical book sales once Japanese consumers have made the shift to digital. &quot;In the last two months their attitude has completely changed,&quot; Mikitani said. &quot;Before, they were sceptical or worried about the negative impact on their business. Now they have changed their mind. This is their opportunity.&quot; Rakuten&apos;s device \u2013 priced at 7,980 yen ($99), the same as a US-bought Kindle \u2013 is 1cm thick and offers wireless internet connections. Rakuten says the gadget, developed in conjunction with Kobo, a Canadian e-book marketer acquired by Rakuten in January, will run for about a month on a single charge. It quickly became the top-selling product on the firm&apos;s online store after pre-order sales were announced at the start of this month. Rakuten, Japan&apos;s biggest online retailer with more than 8,000 employees, has a captive audience: more than 80% of Japan&apos;s 94 million internet users already have an account on its e-commerce site, it says, and are primed to snap up new product lines. Amazon, meanwhile, has directed Japanese consumers to online information about its plans for a local launch, but has yet to name a date. There are conflicting reports on how many Kobo titles will be available in Japan. Rakuten&apos;s bespoke store will start with a modest 30,000 titles in Japanese, rising to 300,000 by the end of the year. A new firm comprising major publishers and a government-funded investment agency will add an extra million titles over the next five years. &quot;I want to start the reading revolution in Japan and in the world with Kobo, Mikitani said. &quot;Kobo is a global device, a global platform, which allows anyone in the world to enjoy a variety of content.&quot; Despite the size of the publishing market in Japan, where 80,000 new books appear every year, the country has been slow to adopt the new medium. Very few novels and non-fiction titles have been digitised, and the closest many consumers come to the format is reading manga comics on their mobile phones. After spirited resistance from publishers worried about the e-reader revolution&apos;s effect on physical sales, the industry appears primed for a change of direction. And for good reason. According to Yano Research Institute, a market research firm in Tokyo, Japan&apos;s e-book market will be worth 150bn yen by 2015, compared with 67bn yen in 2010; the market for e-readers is expected to soar from 2bn yen to 70bn yen over the same period. Roy Larke, professor of international marketing at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, said the shift to digital was inevitable. &quot;The ease of use and low cost are just too appealing,&quot; he said. &quot;Japan will follow, and follow fast.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Rights the BBC has acquired in the deal announced on Wednesday cover the 2014 Sochi winter Games, the 2016 summer Games in Rio, the 2018 winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and the 2020 summer Games, which will be held in either Istanbul, Madrid or Tokyo."], "tags": ["BBC", "Television industry", "Media", "Sports rights", "Sport", "Business", "Media business", "Olympics & the media", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-18T11:06:34Z", "title": "BBC scores rights to next four Olympic Games", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/18/bbc-rights-next-four-olympic-games", "article": "The BBC has retained the broadcast rights to the Olympic Games until the end of the decade, encompassing the next two winter and two summer Games. The deal is believed to be worth about \u00a360m, a &quot;modest&quot; increase on what the corporation pays at the moment but a relatively small increase compared with rises elsewhere in the world. In total, it takes the amount raised by the IOC from its latest round of rights negotiations to more than $1bn in Europe alone. Although it seriously considered tabling a bid, BSkyB is not understood to have launched a bid for a set of rights that would require changes to the listed events legislation in any case. The International Olympic Committee was understood to be concerned about recent cuts to the BBC sports rights budget but entered exclusive negotiations with the corporation after being reassured of its commitment. Rights the BBC has acquired in the deal announced on Wednesday cover the 2014 Sochi winter Games, the 2016 summer Games in Rio, the 2018 winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and the 2020 summer Games, which will be held in either Istanbul, Madrid or Tokyo. The BBC&apos;s association with the Olympics goes back to 1928, when it first broadcast its radio coverage. It has shown every Olympics since the Rome Games of 1960 live on television in an unbroken sequence. Although the IOC investigated the possibility of splitting the coverage between a free-to-air broadcaster and a pay-TV operation, as is the case in Italy, the BBC was desperate to retain its exclusivity. After last year cutting its sports rights budget by a fifth, the BBC renegotiated its Formula One deal to save money and now shares the rights with BSkyB. It has also withdrawn from horse racing and cut back on darts, tennis and snooker coverage. But the Olympics, which the BBC will broadcast across 26 channels from London this summer, is considered a prime vehicle to demonstrate the corporation&apos;s public service role in bringing large audiences together for major events. &quot;I&apos;m delighted that the Olympic Games will continue to be broadcast exclusively on the BBC into the 2020&apos;s,&quot; said outgoing BBC director general Mark Thompson. &quot;It&apos;s terrific news in the days before BBC Sport begins to cover the London 2012 Games and a tribute to the enduring partnership between the BBC and the Olympic movement.&quot; The deal is also seen as crucial to maintaining morale at BBC Sport&apos;s new base in Salford. During the move north, it lost around half of its staff. &quot;This news will come as a massive boost to our teams who are about to undertake our most ambitious sports broadcast ever at the biggest sporting event in our country&apos;s history,&quot; said BBC director of sport Barbara Slater. &quot;The Olympic Games has always been significant as an event that brings the nation together as well as a catalyst for broadcasting innovation and we&apos;re delighted that BBC Sport can now continue to deliver on these traditions through to 2020.&quot; The IOC has sought to maximise the value of the TV rights since turning its back on a deal with the European Broadcasting Union in 2008, through which the BBC held the rights for the 2010 Vancouver Games and London 2012 as part of a $700m (\u00a3448.43m)pan-European agreement. The majority of European rights were sold to the sports agency Sportfive, but the six most lucrative markets \u2013 Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the UK \u2013 were carved out for direct negotiation. BBC chairman Lord Patten said it underlined the corporation&apos;s commitment to sport, even if it could not always compete with the deep pockets of pay TV rivals for live football. &quot;It&apos;s a fantastic way of starting an incredibly important three weeks or so in the history and life of the BBC. In many ways its the biggest thing we&apos;ve done. It was a very tough negotiation but what swung it for us in the end was that they recognised that we were the best sports broadcaster around. We&apos;ve now got to live up to that,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s hugely important for us as the nation&apos;s broadcaster to be covering such a hugely significant national event. It underlines our commitment to sport despite the fact we haven&apos;t got as deep pockets as pay TV. Our total spend on rights this year is about the same as BT have paid to cover 38 football matches a year.&quot; He pointed to audiences of more than 23m for England&apos;s exit from the European Championships and almost 17m for the Wimbledon final as evidence of the BBC&apos;s continued ability to reach big audiences. &quot;We produce about 2% of televised sport in hours but have about 40% of the audience. It&apos;s significant for reach and as part of our civic role helping to bind the community together,&quot; said Patten, who also underlined the importance of retaining the listed events legislation that retains the Olympics, the World Cup, Wimbledon and other sporting events for free to air television. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

On course to regain the jockeys&apos; championship title this year, Moore&apos;s recent winning run has been helped by a return to form from Sea Moon&apos;s trainer, Stoute. However, the jockey feels that Sea Moon may have to improve again from his recent Hardwicke Stakes victory if he is to take the Betfair-sponsored \u00a31m prize at the expense of St Nicholas Abbey, whom he chased home in last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Turf. There was a twist in the betting as St Nicholas Abbey drifted markedly on the Betfair betting exchange on Wednesday. The original ante-post favourite touched a high of 10-1 before setting at 4-1 third-best at around 2pm. &quot;There&apos;s not a great deal between them and there is a lot of depth to the race this year,&quot; he said. &quot;But to me St Nicholas Abbey is the best horse in the race. I was impressed with him in the Coronation Cup. He looked good in Dubai, he was very good in the Breeders&apos; Cup. He probably hasn&apos;t got the credit he deserves. He&apos;s very good. &quot;Sea Moon disappointed a bit in the St Leger but other than that he always looked a very smart horse and he came forward like we thought he would when he won at Royal Ascot last time. &quot;First time out at Goodwood, it was really quick ground, we were running downhill. Because nobody wanted to make it, we&apos;d gone quite steady. They came and attacked very early and it just didn&apos;t suit him. But he grabbed hold quite late and showed a good attitude. &quot;That race was just a step. He was never going to be too wound up for his first run and that&apos;s how it worked out because he won the Hardwicke well.&quot; Moore agreed that unlucky-in-running second Dunaden should have finished closer, but felt his mount would still have finished on top even had the runner-up enjoyed a clearer passage. &quot;I think it was a solidly run race and it was a fair enough race for everything else,&quot; he said. &quot;The second horse got caught in traffic, got stopped. He was very impressive when he won the Hong Kong Vase and I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve seen the best of him this year. But my horse had the race won a furlong out. &quot;Nathaniel&apos;s rock solid. His form&apos;s there and he won the race last year. It&apos;s going to be a good race. After the Derby, it&apos;s the most important race of the year. The Champion Stakes is obviously there, but it&apos;s still in a position where you can have the Arc and the Breeders&apos; Cup take away from it. This race should be the highlight of the midsummer.&quot; Moore also said he respected the Japanese challenger Deep Brillante, although his experiences riding in Tokyo left him with concerns as to how he would handle the track at Ascot. &quot;Japanese horses are top class,&quot; he said. &quot;They perform very well. Look at how they&apos;ve done recently. Dubai Cups, Melbourne Cups. They&apos;re serious horses, beautiful-looking horses. This horse won the Japanese Derby. The problem for them is that the going will be very, very different. The tracks out there drain so well they can go from soft ground to good ground in a few hours. &quot;Stamina won&apos;t be an issue. You&apos;ve got to stay in Japan. They breed for a lot of stamina. The only worry would be softer ground than what he is used to.&quot; And the jockey, Yasunari Iwata? &quot;He&apos;s ridden in all the big races and won a lot of them,&quot; said Moore. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind his cheque.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The issue surrounding &quot;Nadeshiko Japan&quot;, who lifted the women&apos;s world cup in Germany last summer, began soon after they arrived in Paris on a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo.", "Sawa, who won the golden boot as top scorer in Germany and was named Fifa women&apos;s world player of the year in 2011, suggested that the team&apos;s best chance of securing a more comfortable flight back to Tokyo would be to win gold in London."], "tags": ["Japan Olympic team", "Japan", "World news", "Sport", "Gender", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: football", "Football", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-19T03:56:00Z", "title": "Japan's female athletes fly economy while men's team sit in business", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/19/japan-female-atheletes-economy-class", "article": "They are world champions and brought hope to a nation reeling from a natural disaster, but Japan&apos;s female Olympic footballers had to make do with economy class seats during their gruelling flight to Europe this week, while the less celebrated men&apos;s team relaxed in business class. The issue surrounding &quot;Nadeshiko Japan&quot;, who lifted the women&apos;s world cup in Germany last summer, began soon after they arrived in Paris on a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo. &quot;I guess it should have been the other way around,&quot; Homare Sawa , the team&apos;s star player, told Japanese media. &quot;Even just in terms of age, we are senior,&quot; she joked. The team are due to play a warm-up match against France on Thursday before flying to London. Their first Olympic match is against Canada, in Coventry, on 25 July, in a group that also includes Sweden and South Africa. Sawa, 33, who will be taking part in her fourth Olympics, noted that the team had been awarded business class seats after they won the world cup in Germany last July. That proved to be an exception: the Japan football association [JFA] has since reinstated the practice of putting female players in economy class, although they were given a little extra leg room in premium economy during the flight to Paris, thanks to their status as potential medalists. The team received a heroes&apos; welcome on their return from Germany last summer. Their victory was a rare bright spot for the people of Japan, who were still reeling from the 11 March tsunami, in which almost 20,000 people died, and the Fukushima nuclear accident. Sawa and other players were feted with commercial deals, made numerous TV appearances and became the first sports team to receive the people&apos;s honour award from the government. The most effusive praise came from JFA president Junji Ogura: &quot;The players have showed the brilliance of Japanese women,&quot; he said. While the women set off for London days after an effortless 3-0 victory over Australia, the men failed to impress with a dull 1-1 draw with New Zealand. Nadeshiko are being talked about as gold medal prospects in London, but the men face a difficult opening fixture against Spain, followed by matches against Morocco and Honduras, and are not expected to win a medal. Japan&apos;s Olympic committee pointed out that most of the country&apos;s Olympic athletes, as amateurs, are required to fly economy, with exception made for judoka and other physically large competitors. Well-known athletes often get round the rule by upgrading with help from their sponsors, but that isn&apos;t an option for players in team sports aiming to preserve the esprit de corps. The JFA said the men&apos;s football team had been given business class seats since the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 in view of their professional status. Sawa, who won the golden boot as top scorer in Germany and was named Fifa women&apos;s world player of the year in 2011, suggested that the team&apos;s best chance of securing a more comfortable flight back to Tokyo would be to win gold in London. &quot;When we won the world cup, our seats were changed to business class for our return flight,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope we can produce a good result again and be treated the same way.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The summit was followed by a major donors&apos; conference in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "David Cameron", "Taliban", "Hamid Karzai", "Military", "Nato", "World news", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-19T08:04:23Z", "title": "David Cameron warns Taliban against mounting attack after troops withdraw", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/19/david-cameron-taliban-afghanistan-nato", "article": "David Cameron has warned the Taliban it would be a grave mistake to believe insurgent forces can destabilise Afghanistan by mounting a major offensive when Nato ends combat operations in 2014. Amid concerns among senior British military figures that the government may withdraw troops too quickly, the prime minister said the Taliban should &quot;be in no doubt&quot; about the ability of Afghan forces to confront the insurgency. But the prime minister, who was speaking at a press conference with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, in Kabul, said the Taliban would be welcome to join the political process if it renounced violence. Britain and other Nato countries are to withdraw all their combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. A process to hand over security to Afghan forces in stages was agreed at a Nato summit in Chicago earlier this summer. The summit was followed by a major donors&apos; conference in Tokyo. The prime minister said to Karzai: &quot;Over the last three months, the international community has made clear our commitment to securing Afghanistan&apos;s future and prosperity for decades to come. We want to work with you to transform the future together.&quot; In remarks aimed at the Taliban, the prime minister said: &quot;I think this sends a very clear message to the Taliban: you cannot wait this out till foreign forces leave in 2014 because we will be firm friends and supporters of Afghanistan long beyond then.&quot; Cameron added: &quot;What I would say to the Taliban is be in no doubt there is a very clear and strong plan to transfer lead security responsibility from very capable Isaf [International Security and Assistant Force] forces, including British forces, to very capable Afghan forces. &quot;I am content that they will be able to defeat an insurgency. Of course, we would make even further political progress if there were successful political talks and if the insurgency was to come to an end in that way. But the Taliban should be in no doubt that we will be handing to a very capable, very large, well-equipped Afghan army, security forces, local police.&quot; The prime minister signalled Britain&apos;s continuing commitment to Afghanistan after 2014 by signing an agreement in the grounds of the presidential palace for a &quot;Sandhurst in the sand&quot; officer training camp in Kabul. This will involve 90 members of the British army who will mentor Afghan forces. Karzai praised Cameron as a longstanding friend of Afghanistan. But Britain has privately been irritated that Karzai has stalled peace talks with the Taliban. Tentative discussions in Qatar involving the Americans ran into trouble after Karzai indicated he had been excluded. The prime minister showed the need for dialogue when he said: &quot;So now is the time for everyone to participate in a peaceful political process in Afghanistan. All those who renounce violence, who respect the constitution, can choose to have a voice in the future prosperity of this country rather than continuing in fighting to destroy it. &quot;There are fighters who are leaving the battlefield who are giving up their fighting and who want to be part of a successful future Afghanistan.&quot; Karzai insisted he was committed to reconciliation. &quot;The peace process is the most important of our pursuits for Afghanistan it remains the highest priority.&quot; The prime minister highlighted another British concern \u2013 the need for improved relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 by pressing for a joint meeting in Kabul on Thursday with Karzai and the new Pakistani prime minister, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf. Downing Street saw the meeting as an important way to encourage the neighbours to work together on countering the various insurgencies and to promote dialogue. But the prime minister made clear more needed to be done. &quot;That [peace] plan would be improved by further political discussions, by better co-operation between Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is not dependent on those things.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The Preol\u00edmpico, the South American qualifying tournament for the Olympic Games, was particularly tight ahead of the 1964 Tokyo staging.", "Neither South American qualifier progressed past the group stage in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: football", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-20T08:30:01Z", "title": "The Joy of Six: Olympic football tournament stories | Scott Murray", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/20/joy-of-six-olympic-football-tournament", "article": "1) Denmark 9-0 Athens (demonstration event final, Athens 1906) It&apos;s 1900. In times yet to come, British football administrators would infamously cock their haughty snooks at the World Cup, the European Cup, and the European Championship. Myopic and thoroughly abject clowns we. But back in the early days of the Olympic Games, Britain happily takes its place in the vanguard of the world game \u2026 A Great Britain team competed in a demonstration event at the 1900 Games in Paris. Upton Park FC \u2013 nothing whatsoever to do with West Ham United, before Hammers fans try to claim a second world championship win for themselves \u2013 were Britain&apos;s representatives. The amateurs from East London beat a French representative side 4-0, before \u2026 well, that was all they had to do. The French XI then trounced a side from a francophone university in Brussels 6-2, after which everyone had seen enough. First place was awarded to the Brits, which shows you how far deigning to turn up can get you. At the 1904 Games in St Louis, another demo, this time won by Canada&apos;s Galt FC, who hammered two teams from the USA: a 7-0 win over the local Christian Brothers College, then a 4-0 victory over the St Rose Parish School. St Rose were then defeated 2-0 by the unforgiving Christians, scoring their only goal of the tournament, albeit in the wrong net. Two years later, and a third three-team demonstration, this time at the 1906 Athens Games. Denmark beat an Athens XI 9-0 in the final. The Danes only needed 45 minutes to complete the rout, as their hosts flounced off in a huff at half-time, and didn&apos;t come back. The organisers, rather generously and extremely patiently it must be said, offered the Athenians a chance to play off for second place against an international XI representing the city of Smyrna (now Izmir) and a music club from Thessaloniki. Athens refused, and were told by an exasperated Olympic committee to do one. The pram had been divested of all toys, but soon enough one of their players would have a new one. Within two years, the 18-year-old Giorgos Kalafatis founded Panathinaikos. 2) Great Britain 2-0 Denmark (final, London 1908) All of which led us to the 1908 Olympics, and the very first official Olympic football tournament. The 1908 Games were due to be held in Rome, but when Naples was covered in lava from the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, Italy could no longer afford to host the event. London stepped in at the last minute to hold what proved to be a rain-soaked event at the 70,000-capacity White City stadium (which years later would make way for BBC Television Centre). Eight teams were in the hat to begin with: the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Bohemia, Great Britain (selected by the FA and purely English) and France (who entered two teams). Due to political problems in the Balkans, Hungary and Bohemia were forced to withdraw so the Netherlands and France A sailed through to the semi-finals without playing a match. That would be the sum total of good news for the French. Their B team was beaten 9-0 in the first round by Denmark, while France A were then trounced 17-1 by the same opposition in the semi-final, a result which still stands as an Olympic record. The French A team were too proud to play for bronze, so Sweden were given their place and lost to the Dutch. England&apos;s Great Britain team didn&apos;t rattle in quite as many as Denmark en route to the final, though they did hammer Sweden 12-1 and Holland 4-0. The showdown with the Danes was played in front of an 8,000 crowd and was won by the English 2-0, the goals coming from Frederick Chapman and captain Vivian Woodward. The Official Olympic Report, however, notes the scoreline &quot;rather flattered the winners who did not show real international form. Denmark, on the other hand, displayed the greatest vigour and determination with far more pace and dash than against France&quot;. For an amateur event, the final wasn&apos;t short of star quality. The British captain Woodward played over 100 games for both Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, while Harold Hardman was twice an FA Cup finalist with Everton and later chairman of Manchester United at the time of Munich. Denmark&apos;s star man, meanwhile, was Harald Bohr, who in his day job was a mathematician \u2013 and has a theorem named after him. A theorem! He played for Akademisk Boldklub in Copenhagen alongside his brother Niels, a handy goalkeeper and winner of the 1922 Nobel prize for physics. To put shifting world views of sporting stars over the years into some sort of context, imagine John Terry saying: &quot;L(z) is the only function that satisfies f (z+1) = z f (z) with log (f(z)) convex and also with f(1)=1, you @*$!.&quot; 3) Belgium 2-0 Czechoslovakia (final, Antwerp 1920) For a while, it seemed the big story of the 1920 Olympic football tournament would be a shock. In the first round, Great Britain \u2013 winners at London 1908 and Stockholm 1912 \u2013 were expected to make it three from three in Antwerp. But this \u2013 a blip in the late Sixties ARF! excepted \u2013 would be the end of British dominance in world football. They were turfed out in the first round by Norway, and so went home whining about the &quot;broken-time&quot; payments other countries were making to their players in compensation for missing work. This circumvented the Olympic ideal, we cried. The fact that we&apos;d already been fielding players from clubs such as Everton, Chelsea, Spurs and Derby seemed to pass us by. Oh, us! How could we! Cue isolationist tantrum which would eventually see the Home Nations miss out on all three pre-war World Cups. But back to the 1920 Games, where the real jaw-dropping action occurred in the final between the home nation Belgium and Czechoslovakia. Robert Copp\u00e9e converted a penalty on six minutes for the hosts, then on the half-hour Henri Larnoe doubled the lead with a disputed goal. Nine minutes later, the Czech defender Karel Steiner was sent off for &quot;rough play&quot;. Czechoslovakia walked off the field, incensed that three major decisions had gone against them. They accused the British referee John Lewis of making &quot;distorted&quot; and &quot;incorrect&quot; calls, suggesting that he was biased against them as a result of a recent game he had refereed in Prague, which had ended with the whistler being attacked by the crowd. The fact that Lewis was 72 years old \u2013 he had been a member of the first-ever Blackburn Rovers team \u2013 and had latterly become notorious for struggling to keep up with play probably didn&apos;t help matters too much. Belgium were awarded the gold medal, but with the Czechs disqualified after their appeal to have the final replayed failed, a consolation tournament was staged to decide silver and bronze. Even that would prove to be controversial as the losing semi-finalists France had already gone home and could not compete, so their place was taken by Spain \u2013 who ended up taking silver. The Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora \u2013 sent off against Italy for punching an opponent, and an alleged boozer of the first order \u2013 celebrated by smuggling a ludicrous number of Havana cigars under his seat on the train taking him back home. He was arrested, caught red-handed when, unable to resist temptation, he hung his head out of the window and started sucking his contraband down. 4) Peru 4-2 Austria (quarter-final, Berlin 1936) Fifa&apos;s new World Cup \u2013 won in the first instance by the great Uruguayan team who had wowed crowds at the 1924 Paris Games and the 1928 Amsterdam Games \u2013 immediately took the wind out of Olympic football&apos;s sails. The sport was dropped at the 1932 Los Angeles Games, the Great Depression doing for athletic attendance to such an extent that there was no point staging the competition. The game returned in 1936, but what unfolded did neither football nor the Olympics any credit. In the preliminary round, the Italian defender Achille Piccini was sent off by the German referee Karl Weingartner in a match against the USA. Piccini refused to leave the field, beating Antonio Rattin to the punch by three decades. His team-mates rallied round, literally, by circling the referee. They pinned Weingartner&apos;s arms to his side, then covered his mouth with their hands. Understandably panicked and frightened, the official let Piccini stay on. Italy won 1-0; God alone knows what Alf Ramsey would have called them. Peru had made it past the preliminaries with a 7-3 skelping of Finland, lining up a quarter-final match against Austria, homeland of you-know-who. Austria went two goals ahead on the 36 minute mark, and were coasting into the semis with 15 minutes to play. But then the Peruvians scored twice in six minutes. Extra-time. The scores remained level until, with four minutes to go, Peru scored. And then, a minute before the end, they sealed the deal with a fourth goal. A small contingent of Peruvian fans ran on to the pitch and celebrated the impending win. It would be a costly jig of joy. After the match, Austria protested against the result, claiming the invasion had occurred when the score was 2-2, and that Peru&apos;s goals came during a period of extreme tumult. A jury of appeal, consisting solely of Europeans, ordered a replay. It did not occur. The entire Peruvian Olympic team \u2013 every single athlete, not just the footballers \u2013 went home in protest, as did Colombia by way of support. The German embassy in Lima came under attack from irate punters. Austria, meanwhile, advanced to the semis, where they did for Poland, before succumbing in the final to Italy in a predictably rough and unpleasant game. The 1936 Games did offer one moment of light relief. Germany had beaten Luxembourg 9-0 in the opening round, so Adolf Hitler went along to Berlin&apos;s Poststadion for the team&apos;s second game against Norway, in the hope of basking in some Master Race glory. Oh Adolf! &quot;The F\u00fchrer is very excited, I can barely contain myself, a real bath of nerves,&quot; wrote F\u00fchrerpal Joseph Goebbels in his diary ahead of the match. But the Norwegians were a decent side, and went ahead after six minutes. There would be Reichsteam. &quot;The F\u00fchrer is very agitated, I&apos;m almost unable to control myself,&quot; continued Goebbels. With seven minutes to go, Norway scored a second, at which point Hitler got up and departed in a funk. Humiliated, he never watched a match again. 5) USSR 5-5 Yugoslavia (second round, Helsinki 1952) The 1952 tournament was won by arguably the greatest, but certainly the most famous, side in Olympic history: the Hungarian golden team of Ferenc Puskas, Zoltan Czibor, Sandor Kocsis, Nandor Hidegkuti, Jozsef Bozsik and Gyula Grosics. It was a procession: Romania, Italy, and Turkey were batted aside. The reigning Olympic champions Sweden were thumped 6-0 in the semis. In the final, the gold medal was won, Yugoslavia easily dispatched 2-0 with goals from Puskas and Czibor. &quot;It was not surprising that, after the closing ceremony, we celebrated with some wine,&quot; remembered Puskas, &quot;though naturally in a restrained quantity only.&quot; Despite being outplayed in the final, Yugoslavia deserved a small glass or two as well, for their progress towards it was equally memorable. They scored 26 goals to Hungary&apos;s 20, albeit in one game more. They beat India 10-1 in the preliminary round, Branko Zebec of Partizan Belgrade scoring five. In the quarters, Denmark were skittled 5-3, the team taking their collective foot off the gas to allow the Danes a couple of consolations in the dying minutes. The Yugoslavs saw off Germany 3-1 in the semi, Rajko Mitic of Red Star Belgrade the two-goal hero. But the most memorable game occurred in the first round against the USSR, who had entered the Olympics for the first time and \u2013 with the Communist states at a distinct advantage under the amateurs-only rule \u2013 were hot favourites for the title. But Zebec, on fire after his opening-round heroics, scored again as Yugoslavia went 3-0 up by half-time, then quickly 4-0 ahead just after the break. The Soviets pulled one back soon after through Vsevolod Bobrov of VVS Moscow, but when Zebec scored his second of the game on the hour to make it 5-1, all looked lost for the Russians. With 15 minutes to go, the score remained the same, but then the Soviets embarked on a historic comeback, one referee Arthur Ellis, later of It&apos;s A Knockout fame, suggested was &quot;the most honourable ever recorded&quot;. They scored four in that final quarter of an hour, two of them in the last four minutes of the game. Bobrov \u2013 who also played ice hockey for the USSR and had cheated death in 1950 by taking a train when the rest of the team was wiped out in an air crash near Sverlovsk \u2013 was the star, having ended the game with a hat-trick. He opened the scoring with an early goal in the replay, but Yugoslavia came back to win 3-1. The favourites were out. Still, small mercies, at least the team didn&apos;t have to run the gauntlet of rotten fruit pelted at them by fans when they went back to the USSR: the result wasn&apos;t printed in any papers until after the death of Joseph Stalin, nearly a year later. And the result would galvanise the Russians into coming back stronger next time round; they won gold in Melbourne in 1956. Bobrov was no longer in the team, but never mind: he won ice hockey gold at Cortina in the Winter Olympics that same year. 6) Nigeria 3-2 Argentina (final, Atlanta 1996) Where, in some style, Nigeria proved both Pel\u00e9 and Walter Winterbottom right. Kind of. In the semi-finals, the Super Eagles faced the reigning world champions Brazil. With 12 minutes to go they were 3-1 down. First Victor Ikpeba and then, in the last minute, Kanu took the match to extra-time. Kanu&apos;s golden goal sent Nigeria into the final, where again Nigeria upset the odds. Losing 2-1 against Argentina with 16 minutes remaining, Daniel Amokachi equalised before Emmanuel Amunike scored the winner with the final kick of the game. Four years before the millennium, Africa had a world title \u2013 albeit not the one Pel\u00e9 or Winterbottom were talking about. But with the world&apos;s best strewn behind them, who&apos;s splitting hairs? \u2026 sadly also: Peru 0-1 Argentina (Preol\u00edmpico, 1964) The biggest football disaster in history has no place in a selection with the word &quot;Joy&quot; in the title. So it isn&apos;t in our six. But it did occur during an Olympic football tournament, if not at the Games itself, and as such is worthy of remembrance. Lest we forget. The Preol\u00edmpico, the South American qualifying tournament for the Olympic Games, was particularly tight ahead of the 1964 Tokyo staging. With the round-robin league reaching its denouement, neither Argentina, Brazil nor Peru had lost a game in the group; the top two would qualify, so it was nip-and-tuck. Despite playing the hot favourites Argentina \u2013 who had just thrashed Chile 4-0 \u2013 the Preol\u00edmpico host nation Peru were determined to hold on to their unbeaten record in front of their own fans at Lima&apos;s Est\u00e1dio Nacional on 24 May, four-and-a-half months before the big event in Japan. Throughout the first half the game remained goalless. But 15 minutes into the second, N\u00e9stor Manfredi scored for Argentina. The Peruvians ramped up the pressure and, six minutes before the final whistle, scored in front of a 50,000 strong crowd, who exploded in celebration, believing they were in touching distance of a place in the competition. But the Uruguayan referee Angel Pazos disallowed the goal for \u2013 that time-honoured fiend \u2013 &quot;rough play&quot;. A fan leapt over the nine-foot barrier and threatened him. Within seconds a shower of bottles, bricks and stones flooded on to the pitch. Fearing for his life, Pazos left the pitch, abandoning the game and declaring the Argentinians 1-0 winners. Outraged fans invaded the pitch. Police unleashed dogs and tear gas into the closed south end of the stadium. More than 2,000 spectators tried to flee, but with the gates locked in a stadium packed to the brim, disaster was inevitable. &quot;A few of the victims were fatally wounded by police, but most of the scores of police shots were in the air,&quot; reported the British United Press. &quot;Instead of restoring order, they contributed to the panic.&quot; The resulting crush killed 328. &quot;The pitch looked like a battlefield with missiles strewn everywhere,&quot; reported Reuters of the aftermath. On the streets outside, fans set fire to cars and buses and threw paper bombs into garages. One hospital alone reported receiving 140 dead bodies. A seven-day period of mourning was declared and the following qualifiers cancelled. Argentina were awarded first place, while a broken Peru lost 4-0 to Brazil in a play-off for second. Neither South American qualifier progressed past the group stage in Tokyo."}, {"sentences": ["Sachigusa Yasuda \u2013 Tokyo-born but now based in New York \u2013 has stitched together hundreds of images taken from the tops of skyscrapers."], "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-20T21:59:01Z", "title": "Big picture: Flying, by Sachigusa Yasuda", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/20/big-picture-flying-sachigusa-yasuda", "article": "Afraid of heights?

One in six premises now stands empty across the country, compared with just one in 20 before the start of the recession.

Willing landlords are the key, says Rosie Cann of Popupspace, which sources property for small businesses to use temporarily. &quot;For many years I worked for private landlords, and was always keen to negotiate pop-up style deals on the empty properties I managed.

They made it on to the British political agenda in 2011, when the government asked retail guru Mary Portas to report on how to revive the High Street. Her recommendations included a \u00a310m fund focused on bringing empty shops back to life, and around 370 towns bid for the money. In May 2012, 12 towns, including Stockton-on-Tees and Croydon, were allocated \u00a3100,000 to invest in schemes, including pop-ups. Dan Thompson has used vacant spaces for art projects since 2000, and set up the Empty Shops Network to share his skills and experience. He published the Pop-up People report earlier this year after working with small businesses in the south of England, but says it&apos;s still not clear if they can really revive dying high streets. &quot;The last government gave over 100 towns money for this, but there&apos;s no evidence gathered, so we don&apos;t know what worked or what didn&apos;t. There is also no data on how many pop-ups exist, as they come and go very quickly. Some of the money given to these 12 towns should be used to gather evidence to help our town centres \u2013 the best evidence we have that they work is that traders keep coming back and doing them again.&quot; One pop-up success is the We Are Open project in Middlesbrough, which gives space to creative businesses to showcase and sell their work in prime locations. Jenny Hall says around 150 people have benefited from the scheme since it started in 2009. &quot;The recession has opened up new opportunities for creative businesses, and has given us an opportunity to diversify our homogenised high street mono-culture,&quot; she said. &quot;Small business owners do need to be careful when they get involved \u2013 be wary of what you agree to in terms of the license agreements with letting agents, and always be ready to move out in a moment&apos;s notice.&quot; Music promoter Henry Carden is one of the businesses to benefit from We Are Open. &quot;I&apos;ve organised gigs and a gig poster exhibition, and it&apos;s great to save on rent and not have to commit to a long-term lease. Although Middlesbrough has some great music venues, there is a distinct lack of all-ages venues. One of the beauties of using pop-up-shops is that under-18s can attend the gigs, and also play. &quot;It was also really positive to organise some events that got people talking \u2013 putting on a gig in an empty high street shopping unit at 2pm on a busy Saturday afternoon helped to build up a bit more interest in all of my other gigs and events. Anything that decreases the number of boarded up empty shop units in town/city centres can only benefit communities, so you need to make yourself look as welcoming as possible. &quot;To the general public, walking into an empty shop unit can be a daunting prospect, so even if you&apos;ve made it look incredible inside, that&apos;s irrelevant if it looks closed from the outside.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Hoketsu was in Japan&apos;s showjumping team at the Tokyo Games in 1964, then took a time-out to pursue a business career before riding for his country again in dressage at the 2008 Games \u2013 the 44-year gap must surely be a record."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: boxing", "Olympics 2012: handball", "Olympics 2012: fencing", "Olympics 2012: volleyball and beach volleyball", "Olympics 2012: wrestling", "Olympics 2012: canoeing", "Olympics 2012: hockey", "Olympics 2012: modern pentathlon", "Olympics 2012: equestrian", "Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Sport", "Olympic Games", "Hockey"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-20T22:03:18Z", "title": "London 2012: the hidden gems that can sparkle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/20/london-2012-gems-chance-shine", "article": "Fencing   Fencing is the easiest sell in the Olympics. It is simply a matter of looking at it with the right kind of eyes. Seen one way, it is an obscure, complicated sport that Great Britain is not very good at. Look at it another way, however, and it is fighting with swords. What more could you possibly want? Except, perhaps, a duel to the death. It is like watching an old Errol Flynn swashbuckler on a spotlit stage in a silent auditorium, only with all the tedious love scenes cut out. The fencers, as befits Flynn&apos;s heirs, tend to be both hot and cool. The men are athletic, aristocratic army-types with chiselled jawlines. And the women, like Italy&apos;s three-time Olympic foil champion Valentina Vezzali tend to have long flowing locks of hair, which they toss around when they tear off their masks and scream in success or distress after each point. Frankly everyone looks good when wielding a sabre. The sport is further improved if you mutter dialogue from The Princess Bride while you watch: &quot;You are using Bonetti&apos;s defence against me, ah?&quot; &quot;I thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain.&quot; &quot;Naturally, you must suspect me to attack with Capo Ferro?&quot; &quot;Naturally ... but I find that Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro.&quot; &quot;Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa ... which I have.&quot; Andy Bull Beach volleyball During London&apos;s bid to host the Olympic Games, the staging of the beach volleyball became a totem. Like holding the equestrian events in Greenwich Park, the promise to dump 5,000 tonnes of sand on Horse Guards Parade in central London was emblematic of London&apos;s vision of a &quot;compact&quot; Games in iconic locations that would leave behind no white elephants and provide the best stage possible for the athletes. Horse Guards Parade is a long way from Santa Monica or Copacabana, but ever since Tony Blair joked that its siting so close to his office was a &quot;masterstroke&quot;, the sport has been one of the most discussed of the Games. The central London ticket has also, unsurprisingly, been one of the more popular hospitality offerings outside the Olympic Park. But the athletes themselves sometimes bemoan the fact that the highly effective presentation of the sport, complete with earsplitting music and excitable MCs, obscures the fitness and athleticism required. In both the men&apos;s and women&apos;s events USA and Brazil will start as favourites. The American Misty May-Treanor, who will be partnered by Kerri Walsh, is the most successful women&apos;s player of all time. Owen Gibson Equestrian Greenwich Park is not everyone&apos;s idea of an Olympic three-day event venue \u2013 its limited size means the cross-country course will be shorter and twistier than usual \u2013 but it should at least be exciting. Its hilliness will make it testing and horses will find the narrowness of the path they have to thread between the trees claustrophobic. So will the 50,000 spectators who will be crammed into the park for the cross-country on 30 July. Most will be cheering for Princess Anne&apos;s daughter, Zara Phillips, though Britain&apos;s best hope of a medal lies with the world No1, William Fox-Pitt. But beware the brilliant reigning world and European champion Michael Jung from Germany, who is hotly tipped to complete the set of titles. In the individual showjumping the veteran Nick Skelton is Britain&apos;s best medal prospect, though the Germans and Dutch will be very strong. But for once showjumping may have to play second fiddle to dressage, the arcane horse ballet beloved of aficionados but largely incomprehensible to everyone else. Britain has never won a medal of any hue in dressage but there is huge confidence in the European championship-winning team of Laura Bechtolsheimer, Charlotte Dujardin and Carl Hester. Expect dressage to be one of the unlikely hits of the Games, topped by the appearance of Hiroshi Hoketsu, competing for Japan in the individual event, who at 71 would become the second oldest Olympian ever \u2013 Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn was 72 when he won a silver in Antwerp in 1920. Suddenly calling Skelton a veteran at 54 seems inappropriate; young buck perhaps. Hoketsu was in Japan&apos;s showjumping team at the Tokyo Games in 1964, then took a time-out to pursue a business career before riding for his country again in dressage at the 2008 Games \u2013 the 44-year gap must surely be a record. Hoketsu reckons he would also be in good shape for Rio in 2016, where he would break Swahn&apos;s record, but fears his 15-year-old horse Whisper will be over the hill by then. Stephen Moss Gymnastics  The Visa International Gymnastics test event in January gave a taste of what to expect. A packed, purpose-built arena racked with nervous anticipation that periodically burst into huge cheers from 20,000 people \u2013 the O2, or the North Greenwich Arena as it will be renamed at Games time to comply with IOC sponsorship restrictions, will be a stunning venue for one of the blue riband events of any Games. All eyes will be on the Americans in the women&apos;s competition as a team widely rated as the best since 1996 aims to do what no USA team has done since the so-called Magnificent Seven triumphed in Atlanta and come away with gold medals. At each of the past two Olympics USA have arrived as world champions but won silver. In 2004 Romania took gold in Athens and China memorably triumphed in Beijing despite a fall from the beam, when USA succumbed to a combination of injuries and pressure. The team will be fuelled by the rivalry between two team-mates \u2013 the reigning world champion, Jordyn Wieber, and Gabby Douglas, who recently beat her to the lone guaranteed spot in the team. Their chances are boosted by the fact that the defending champions, China, are in some disarray. They finished only third at the world championships and have since lost their captain, Cheng Fei, to injury. In the men&apos;s competition the Chinese will, as ever, start as hot favourites. But they are also considered more vulnerable than ever, with USA and Japan likely to challenge hard. Britain&apos;s men, who qualified for the Games on an electrifying night at that event in January, will have the crowd on their side and could even be outside contenders for a medal \u2013 a situation that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Owen Gibson Wrestling In Soho there are certain bars with sawdust floors down shady alleyways where people pay good money to watch big women grapple. Which is a cheap joke, and one you should never make to a wrestler&apos;s face if you value your own. But the truth is that wrestling is so silly that it is almost impossible to take it seriously, unless you happen to be in a conversation with someone like Olympic super-heavyweight freestyle champion Artur Taymazov. Greco-Roman wresting, in particular, requires the Spandex-clad competitors to adopt a series of positions so undignified that you would be best advised not to watch it with your in-laws. Unless they are particularly bloodthirsty that is, in which case they should quite enjoy the early rounds, when a string of hapless underdogs from countries with no tradition in the sport get tied up in knots, squashed and pummelled by burly men and women from Eastern Europe and other countries where they take this kind of thing very seriously indeed. Freestyle is more of a free-for-all \u2013 and more enjoyable for it. You won&apos;t get to see any drop-kicks or piledrivers but this is still the closest the Olympics comes to a bit of good old-fashioned, red-blooded, homoerotic ultra-violence. So if that&apos;s your thing, and you want to save yourself the door charge in Soho, you know where to go. Andy Bull Canoeing A sport in which the athlete requires the strength of a rower, the dexterity of a limbo dancer and the ability to read water like a 17th-century dowser is always going to be interesting. Throw in a collection of theme-park style river rapids and some pretty handy Brits and captivating would be a better description. The world No1 canoe slalomist and silver medallist in Beijing, David Florence, is Team GB&apos;s big hope of gold at Lee Valley, but unlike other sports where conditions are not so changeable, there are a variety of factors that can have an impact on the final result in this event. Competitors have no idea until the day of their run how the course will be laid out and they have to walk the banks in advance to decide how to negotiate the 18-25 gates they have to pass through. Then, clipping a gate brings a two-second penalty, requiring paddlers to take calculated risks. And risks they are, one missed gate results in a 50-second penalty. Wave goodbye to a medal, in other words. Having the strength to manoeuvre the canoe while it is being sucked into the powerful eddies behind obstacles is key to a successful upstream start, while then having the courage to approach gates at full tilt while being flushed downstream can be the difference between a good run and a great one. Wet, wild and wonderful. This is every bit as punk rock as BMX. Gregg Bakowski Women&apos;s hockey The Olympic hockey venue is not much to look at, made as it is out of unadorned lattices of scaffolding. It resembles a heap of oversized pick-up sticks. And the pitch is ugly, painted violent shades of pink and blue \u2013 designed to make it more TV friendly. But still, it is going to host what could be the surprise hit of the Games. Great Britain&apos;s men&apos;s team are good \u2013 they are currently ranked fourth in the world \u2013 but the women are better and, inspired by a raucous home crowd, they could easily go on a run to the medal stages of the tournament. It helps, too, that a lot of the best teams they will have to beat \u2013 Germany, Australia, and the world No1 Argentina \u2013 are the kind of sides that bring out the bulldog spirit in the British fans. The team themselves are a likeable, photogenic bunch. A lot of them are talented amateurs, refreshingly free of the arrogance and aloofness that seems to typify the players in so many other, higher-profile, team sports. It is easy to forget how enjoyable hockey is when you never see it. This summer the public should get their biggest reminder of their latent love for this fast, rough, and skilful sport since 1988, when the men&apos;s team won gold at the Seoul Olympics. Andy Bull Handball Fast, furious and often unforgiving when players clash, handball is hugely popular across much of Europe. It is the continent&apos;s second most popular sport, with more than 30 million players, but in Britain both the men&apos;s and women&apos;s teams had to be built virtually from scratch. It is easy to follow and frantically fast, with dozens of goals per match, and most of those who attended the test events in the Olympic Park&apos;s Copper Box went away impressed. The historic first appearance of men&apos;s and women&apos;s British teams has garnered plenty of column inches. But while there is an outside chance that both could make it beyond the preliminary stage, with only two teams in each six-strong group going out, the big guns will take over from that point on. In the women&apos;s competition Norway are favourites, closely followed by the Russians and the French. The Norwegians are the reigning Olympic champions and comprehensively beat France, whom they will play in their opening preliminary phase match, in the 2011 world championship final. In the men&apos;s competition France won the gold in Beijing and will start among the favourites in London. Team GB will meet the reigning champions in their second match. Owen Gibson Modern pentathlon Few events are as historic as modern pentathlon or more likely to provide a dramatic climax. With its roots in the tale of a 19th-century French cavalry officer who had to ride, fence, shoot, swim and run in order to deliver a message, the sport demands its competitors complete those same five challenges in pursuit of a gold medal. Each nation is allowed to put up four athletes; two in the men&apos;s competition and two in the women&apos;s, and, only adding to the appeal, this is a sport which takes place in a single, action-packed day. It kicks off with fencing, which sees every athlete compete in sudden-death bouts, before swimming in a 200m freestyle race and then riding a horse through a 12-jump course. Points are awarded for each and the total scores are converted into a time handicap which determines the start times for the combined running and shooting. In something akin to the 1970s show Superstars, competitors must run to a shooting range and hit five targets in 70 seconds before running 1,000m, shooting a further five targets, running another 1,000m and shooting another five further targets before completing a final 1,000m. The winner, quite simply, is the person who crosses the finish line first. Great Britain has a strong chance of doing well; Mhairi Spence is the women&apos;s world champion while Samantha Murray won bronze at May&apos;s world championships. Meanwhile Nick Woodbridge is the world No5 and is joined by Sam Weale, who recently became the first British man to win a European championship medal. Sachin Nakrani Boxing In boxing, more than any other sport, blink and you miss it. If there is a boxer at these Games to keep us watching closely it is surely Katie Taylor from Bray in County Wicklow, who is as close to a banker as the sport provides. When she returned from China last month with her fourth successive world title, she was greeted at Dublin airport by a rapturous gathering who believe she might be Ireland&apos;s finest ever athlete. If anyone is equipped to bear the weight of a nation&apos;s expectations it is Taylor, queen of the lightweights, who delivers in tournament after tournament. She is a superb technician with a sharp boxing brain, qualities on show in China when she had to adapt in mid-bout in the final against the very good Russian Sofya Ochigava before winning 11-7. Her father and coach, Peter Taylor, described it as &quot;not a fight for the armchair viewers&quot; but, &quot;one for the connoisseurs&quot;. Even other boxers enjoy watching Taylor work, so complete is she as a boxer. She is, she says, &quot;in the best shape I&apos;ve ever been in&quot;. If she meets Ochigava in London, it will be a contest to savour.

Young London designers including Maarten Van Der Horst and Marques Almeida are stocked alongside Kenzo and Opening Ceremony, while bright neon flags, sweetie jars full of key rings and walls of magazines make it a fun place to be.

If Phelps wins, he will become the first ever male swimmer to win a gold medal in the same event at three consecutive games. But a day later, the brilliant Japanese swimmer Kosuke Kitajima has the same shot at history \u2013 and has every chance of following up gold in the 100m breaststroke in Athens and Beijing with a third successive title in London. If he makes it, maybe the general public will recognise something the swimming world spotted a long time ago: that Kitajima is a very special talent. Kitajima, who was born in Tokyo in September 1982, showed his promise early. As a wide-eyed 17-year-old, Kitajima finished a close fourth in Sydney in the 100m breaststroke. With this taste of near success, he went on to get stronger and faster each year. It was in 2003 that his authority in the 100m and 200m breaststroke was stamped. Kitajima won gold in both events at the 2003 world championships in world record time, shooting himself in to the favourite position for gold at the Olympics the following year. Remaining cool under the pressure, Kitajima entered the pool for the final of the 100m breaststroke at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens next to the man who stole the world record from him merely a month before the Games, the American and new favourite, Brendan Hansen. Kitajima&apos;s exuberant screams of excitement after winning gold that night echoed around the pool deck. I remember the joy that spread like fire around the swimmers at seeing someone so genuinely ecstatic. Never since have I been a part of one man&apos;s celebration that not only lifted the whole crowd out of their seats, but also increased the drive and determination of each and every swimmer at those Olympic Games to create their own &quot;Kitajima&quot; moment. He went on to win the 200m breaststroke a few days later, but this time it was a more modest fist-pump and a No1 salute to the crowd, as a cheeky smile crossed his face that showed he was still experiencing primal screams of joy on the inside. In a light-hearted moment after his 100m win, Kitajima repeated the phrase &quot;cho-kimochi-ii&quot;, which translates as &quot;I feel mega good&quot;, to the poolside media. This phrase went on to gain such popularity throughout Japan that it was regarded the best neologism in Japan for 2004 and awarded at the Vogue Words contest. Kitajima came home from Athens a celebrity. That has not changed him mind; he is well liked and highly respected by fellow swimmers, and is known for his approachability around the pool deck, making anyone he talks to feel like his friend. Four years later Kitajima replicated his Olympic success from Athens in Beijing, again winning the 100m and 200m breaststroke events. You can be forgiven for missing this outstanding achievement \u2013 the world was caught up in the superhuman feats of Phelps and his eight gold medal haul. But in the same way his double gold medal achievement inspired the swimmers in Athens, talk and excitement spread quickly around the pool deck about what affectionately became known as Kitajima&apos;s &quot;double double&quot;, and the chance he may have at a &quot;triple double&quot; come the London Olympics. Kitajima is an absolute superhero in Japan, with over 80,000 twitter followers to his name. Known simply as the &quot;Frog King&quot;, Japanese news corporations cover his every move with a microscope and cast opinion on each and every stroke he swims. This intensified following the Beijing Olympics, and while it is an absolute honour to be supported by your countrymen, Kitajima felt he needed to get away from the hoopla to find his love of swimming again, and made the move to train under Dave Salo, at the University of Southern California, in 2009. Despite struggling with injury woes in the years following the 2008 Olympics, most recently with a tear in his left hamstring, Kitajima has managed to keep pushing forward. He has also grieved the tragic loss of his good friend and competitor Alexander Dale Oen (world champion in 2011 and Olympic silver medallist in Beijing) in the lead up to the London Olympics, and will no doubt be thinking of him behind the blocks. Kitajima now finds himself in familiar territory, going in to another Olympic Games as the favourite having established the fastest times of 2012 in both the 100m and 200m breaststroke. I am not for one second suggesting winning will be easy, but in the 100m breaststroke, he is a league ahead. His fastest time of 2012 currently sits at 58.90sec, his nearest rival is his fellow countrymen Ryo Tateishi, 0.70sec back on 59.60. He has much closer company in the 200m breaststroke, again from Tateishi, but this time he sits a tight 0.17sec behind, and he will push him all the way (Kitajima&apos;s fastest time is 2:08.00, Tateishi&apos;s is 2:08.17). He will also have competition from his long-term rival Hansen and Daniel Gyurta of Hungary. Watching Kitajima swim you get the feeling that this is a person who is doing exactly what he was put on the planet to do. He glides through the water with such ease, maximising the propulsion his legs provide him with by maintaining a strong streamlined position and grasping at the water with his hands until they have formed a stable platform for him to pull himself forward and over. Of course, all swimmers aim for perfection within their stroking, but what Kitajima does better than anyone else is swim quicker than his competitors with fewer strokes \u2013 simply put, he gets from one end of the pool to the other without moving as much, hence saving more energy. This results in an ability to swim the last lap of his race faster than any of his rivals, because he isn&apos;t as tired. Swimmers are well known for spending long hours training in and out of the pool. In my most recent preparation for the Australian Olympic Trials, I was in the pool 20 hours a week and working in the gym six hours a week. When you combine this with regular stretching, video research, physiotherapy and other external services, there is not much time left for anything else. Kitajima is no different, he works hard at every session, but he also works much smarter than most. He is renowned for asking his coach and sports scientists many specific questions about his technique. He then persists with thought and practice until he gets it right. Regardless of what his competitors may be doing, he trains for himself, listening to his body, resting when he needs to rest, and pushing when he needs to push. Now history beckons. If the man from Japan can pull it off by winning the 100m breaststroke, you can count on a third repeat of the screams of success, and the rapid-fire spread it will have throughout each and every swimmer in that arena. It is certainly a race I will be waiting for, watching nervously and excitedly for Kitajima to have his moment."}, {"sentences": ["I was in shock, I didn&apos;t believe it.&quot; The International Olympics Committee&apos;s decision rested on Abu Rmeileh&apos;s success at the world judo championships in Tokyo in 2010."], "tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympics 2012: judo", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-24T18:18:02Z", "title": "Maher Abu Rmeileh makes Palestinian sporting history at London 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/24/maher-abu-rmeileh-palestinian-olympics", "article": "The mini-judokas abruptly cease rolling around like play-fighting puppies at the coach&apos;s command and clear the floor for the serious business. Six adult men in blue or white robes step on to the patriotically coloured judo mats. At their centre is an athlete who has just made Palestinian sporting history. Maher Abu Rmeileh is the first Palestinian to qualify for the Olympic Games on merit. Under rules exempting developing nations from having to reach the qualifying standard, Palestine is sending a team of four \u2013 two swimmers and two runners \u2013 to London this summer. But the 28-year-old judoka is a late addition, having only learned of his unique achievement a few weeks ago. With sweat dripping down his face on a scorching Jerusalem afternoon, and the broad grin that rarely leaves his face, Abu Rmeileh recalls the day he got the call from the Al Quds club, where he trains. &quot;They said &apos;come now and bring sweets&apos;. That was all. Then when I got here, they told me I was going to London. I was in shock, I didn&apos;t believe it.&quot; The International Olympics Committee&apos;s decision rested on Abu Rmeileh&apos;s success at the world judo championships in Tokyo in 2010. &quot;At the beginning of this year I hoped I would qualify [for the Olympics] but as the months went by I lost hope,&quot; he says. &quot;But the word &apos;impossible&apos; is not in my dictionary.&quot; His participation in the Olympics will be the culmination of 21 years of practising judo, initially accompanying his judoka father, Shafik, at whose scarf shop in Jerusalem&apos;s Old City alley ways Maher works each day before heading to the Al Quds club in the east of the city to train. &quot;My father had a lot of hope in me. It was also his dream to represent Palestine at the Olympics, and now he is fulfilling his dream through me.&quot; Abu Rmeileh trains for at least two hours a day, seven days a week, a programme which is intensifying in the run up to the Games in the UK. The club, which has about 20 judoka, the youngest of whom is five, charges no fees, relying instead on volunteers and donations. &quot;There is no bar to poor families,&quot; says the club&apos;s head, Numan Dkeidek. Discipline and commitment are required, but, says Abu Rmeileh, the rewards are great. &quot;Judo is one of the most beautiful and one of the most practical of sports. It is a big part of my life.&quot; He will compete in the under-73kg category, which eliminates the possibility of a politically delicate encounter with Israel&apos;s main judoka hope, Arik Zeevi, who is in a heavier class. Abu Rmeileh will not be drawn on issues concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, preferring to focus on his achievement so far and the task ahead. &quot;I&apos;m very proud to be the first Palestinian to qualify. The feeling is indescribable. It means we can send a message to the world that we are as capable as any other country.&quot; His two sons, aged six and four, will watch their father on TV from their East Jerusalem home. &quot;I will encourage them to take up judo too, but they are a bit young now. I&apos;m very happy I will be going as an ambassador for the Palestinian people. I will be carrying the Palestinian flag.

Then, 33 years after its demise, issue a previously unreleased live album in which all the members are playing out of their skins. That&apos;s this July&apos;s final fascinating twist to the story of Keith Jarrett&apos;s great &quot;European quartet&quot; \u2013 when the ECM label released the suitably titled Sleeper, a long-buried treasure from the group&apos;s last months together in 1979. This lineup was Jarrett on piano, Norway&apos;s Jan Garbarek on saxophones and flute (he was 32 when Sleeper was recorded in Tokyo) and Jon Christensen on drums, and Sweden&apos;s Palle Danielsson on bass. The band convened so rarely that Jarrett once told an interviewer it wasn&apos;t an ensemble but a &quot;special event&quot;. Sleeper was captured in the same Tokyo run as the quartet&apos;s existing Personal Mountains album, but it turned out to be more energetic and vivacious even than that fine session. Jarrett was already a solo star for his bestselling K\u00f6ln Concert album, but for all his celebrity status, this group had an indisputably selfless one-for-all feel. Superb Jarrett originals including Personal Mountains, the Ornette Coleman-inflected Oasis, and the free and then softly-rocking Innocence, the pianist&apos;s ecstatically engaged sustaining of a groove, Garbarek&apos;s unkempt, hoarsely poetic, free-jazz sax sound back in those days, and the dynamic interaction of Danielsson and Christensen, all defined a way of jazz-making that was lyrical but edgy, individually scintillating but collectively intense. Here&apos;s the concert finale from Sleeper, Jarrett&apos;s playful New Dance. 2) The AUM Fidelity label  Jarrett and Garbarek are still giants, but they&apos;re not exactly the kind of colossi former New York indie-rock producer Steven Joerg was thinking of when he succinctly observed to the Village Voice that &quot;giants walk among us now, and you&apos;ve got to fucking pay attention&quot;. Joerg&apos;s hardcore tastes in contemporary musical creativity are quite different from the seductive country tinged lyricism that helped Jarrett to become a household name, or the Norwegian folk-song lilt that brought crossover stardom for Garbarek. Reader Emunro rightly commented on last month&apos;s Take Five that the 15th birthday of Joerg&apos;s cottage-industry operation, the AUM Fidelity label, was worth noting for bringing the world such uncompromising originals as the scorching John Coltrane/Albert Ayler-inspired saxophonist David S Ware, pianist Matthew Shipp, former Cecil Taylor bassist William Parker, guitar innovator Joe Morris and plenty more. Joerg&apos;s recruits have brought an astringent curiosity to jazz that has expanded its language and brought niche audiences from different contemporary musics together. Having worked with experimental rockers such as Sonic Youth and Big Black as a manager at Homestead Records, Joerg sensed a comparable grittiness between their work and free-jazz, and founded AUM to try joining them up. Fifteen years later, the label&apos;s catalogue runs to a hundred or more bracing albums \u2013 what the New York Village Voice&apos;s Brad Cohan described as Joerg&apos;s overseeing of &quot;a pioneering cache of singular music while remaining true to his DIY ethos&quot;. French film director Jacques Goldstein caught the spirit of that genre-bending radicalism on a 2003 concert featuring Shipp, with DJ Spooky on turntables, William Parker on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums.

The occasion was Sonny Rollins&apos;s induction into the centre&apos;s jazz hall of fame, and the then 75-year-old sax legend boldly picked one of the least genteel and diplomatic jazz ensembles in the city to help him celebrate. Shipp later observed that he had found the occasion &quot;surreal \u2013 not in a good way&quot;, and the tension between cutting-edge artists and what some see as Lincoln Centre jazz boss Wynton Marsalis&apos;s tradition-burnishing conservative agenda has rumbled on for years. Marsalis and his Lincoln Center Orchestra have been playing a run of different UK concerts for much of July, and Guardian writers have had their own kinds of mixed feelings about the early ones \u2013 the Congo Square African-roots collaboration with Ghana&apos;s Yacub Addy, and the choral Abyssinian Mass. Marsalis is a sumptuously gifted player, a craftsmanlike composer, and a politically canny campaigner for jazz, but his work invariably raises questions \u2013 particularly about contemporary music&apos;s free development, and about audiences&apos; understanding of jazz as he represents it. But you can still make up your own mind this week when he winds up his UK trip with Swing Symphony, a musical history lesson from blues and ragtime via the Charleston, big-band swing and bebop featuring the Lincoln Center players and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Simon Rattle. Here&apos;s a snippet from an education project version of Marsalis&apos; work with Rattle, with some hints of what we might expect.

Live Vortex will mix shows recorded on the premises with interviews and archive footage, and users will be able to switch freely between them. This week&apos;s opener features Sol6 \u2013 an outfit led by UK free-improv pianist Veryan Weston devoted to dismantling everything from Bertolt Brecht to Burt Bacharach, and featuring Dutch bassist Luc Ex, saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock, cellist Hannah Marshall, viola-player Mandy Drummond, and percussionist Mark Sanders. Upcoming Vortex gigs heading for The Space include exuberant avant-groovers Sons of Kemet (including young reeds innovator Shabaka Hutchings] and Seb Rochford on drums) in August, and those dynamic celebrators of the South African jazz legacy of the late Dudu Pukwana and Chris McGregor, Township Comets, in October. 5) Lol Coxhill RIP Lol Coxhill, the unique Portsmouth-born soprano-sax improviser, died on 10 July, and despite being 79 and critically ill for months, there was something about this former busker&apos;s obstinate, idiosyncratic character and pungent wit that still made it seem as though his comeback gig was just round the corner. Coxhill&apos;s influences ran from Dixieland music to the art-rock of the 60s and 70s, and on to the mysterious outlands of improv and the avant garde, and his free-falling, casually pitched ruminations (unaccompanied playing, a relic of his busking days, suited him best) were always instantly identifiable, recognisable. Here&apos;s his inimitably slithery phrasing and bittersweet tone in action, on Soprano Derivato Apricot Jam, from Robert Wyatt&apos;s 1994 Flotsam Jetsam album. Kevin Ayers is the guitarist, Archie Leggett on bass, with Wyatt himself on vocals and percussion.            Reading this on mobile?

Analysts already expect the economy to rebound, after bad weather and an extra day of holiday over the Jubilee led to a 0.7% fall in GDP in the second quarter. Capital Economics says an influx of foreign sports fans as well as Britons stocking up on cold beer and souvenir mascots could help lift GDP by 0.3% in the coming weeks, helping the economy grow by 0.8% in the third quarter. But that is likely to be only a temporary boost. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics says: &quot;There are bigger factors at play. The eurozone is one of the biggest constraints on growth.&quot; He forecasts a 0.4% drop in GDP in the final quarter, meaning the UK would shrink by 0.5% this year. That would be bad news for George Osborne, who bases his budget on forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has pencilled in growth of 0.8% this year. Any downturn could continue into next year. Research by Citigroup shows an upturn in GDP before a Games tends to be followed by slower growth in the following six months. The bank recently mined the data from Games dating back to Tokyo in 1964. Its economist Michael Saunders found that growth tends to rise in the run-up to the tournament, but the effect often starts to fall away even before the games begin, and growth afterwards tends to be weaker. In every country but one that has hosted the Games since 1980, the two quarters before the Games have been far stronger than the two quarters after. The worst slowdowns occurred after the Seoul Games in 1988, Spain in 1992 and China in 2008. Only after the Atlanta Olympics of 1996 did economic growth gain pace after the closing ceremony. The usual slowdown makes sense: much of the benefit is from jobs created through construction, which is out of the way long before the opening ceremony, while the disadvantages \u2013 including less productive working as people huddle round their TV screens, and travel disruption as hundreds of thousands of supporters flock to London \u2013 take place during the Games and afterwards. Britons are expected to splash out during the Games but Capital Economics says much of that will be shifted from spending elsewhere. Cinema tickets and household goods, for example, often fall during such events. The next few weeks will see an influx of tourists to London, with around 1 million Olympic tickets made available for overseas residents. However, the number of tourists visiting the UK could drop as a result of the Games. Tourism association UKinbound said its members had seen a 50% fall in bookings for the third quarter compared with normal. Australia saw a 16% rise in visitors in September 2000 when the Sydney Games were held; but visits then declined for three years afterwards. That suggests many people who had always wanted to go Down Under chose to time their visit to coincide with the Olympics. The Games has offered plenty of employment opportunities. London registered 61,000 more people in employment in the three months to May, which the Office for National Statistics said could indicate an effect of the 2012 Olympics. But Tombs says this will be temporary. &quot;Any boost to employment will fall by the wayside. If you look at the surveys of private sector employment intentions, it looks like those workers are going to find it hard to find jobs.&quot; Saunders agreed: &quot;The Olympics are likely to be very entertaining. But the Games are not an economic policy.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Last October they had their best ever result at a world championships, finishing fifth in Tokyo, and at May&apos;s European championships in Brussels they came fourth, missing out on a medal after two of their gymnasts fell from the beam."], "tags": ["Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "Team GB", "Gymnastics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T09:57:17Z", "title": "London 2012: gymnast Rebecca Tunney will not shrink from Olympic test", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/london-2012-rebecca-tunney-gymnast", "article": "Rebecca Tunney faced just one problem after being named in the Olympic team. &quot;I couldn&apos;t fit in all the kit,&quot; she says. &quot;I was too small.&quot; If anyone has captured the increasingly optimistic state of women&apos;s gymnastics in Britain it is the 4ft 9in Tunney, who had to have her Stella McCartney-designed gear altered. Her story is so full of promise \u2013 a surprise British champion, the youngest Team GB athlete at 15 \u2013 that, even though she is not expected to win a medal, she is already one of the most recognisable faces of the Games. Tunney, whose favourite disciplines are the vault and the floor, hopes to help her team reach the finals for only the third time in their history as well as to qualify for the individual all-around final. She heard about her selection, appropriately, during a PE lesson at school in Manchester. &quot;I started crying,&quot; she says. &quot;This time last year it wasn&apos;t in my wildest dreams to be here.&quot; But her inclusion speaks volumes about the ambitions of the British women&apos;s team, which increase with every major championships. Last October they had their best ever result at a world championships, finishing fifth in Tokyo, and at May&apos;s European championships in Brussels they came fourth, missing out on a medal after two of their gymnasts fell from the beam. Tunney&apos;s strong transition from junior to senior gymnastics is symptomatic of a sport hitting its stride. Of her team-mates Hannah Whelan made the all-around final at the world championships and took bronzes on beam and floor at the Europeans; Imogen Cairns holds three Commonwealth titles, two on vault and one on floor. And then there is Beth Tweddle, one of the best technicians in the world on the uneven bars. A shot at a gold medal is not impossible. &quot;The girls are in a good place at the moment,&quot; says Tim Jones, the team&apos;s performance director.&quot;We&apos;re certainly positive about the outlook.&quot; And while Britain remain some way off being able consistently to challenge any of the sport&apos;s major powers \u2013 the USA, Russia and China \u2013 Jones believes the competition format offers some hope. Three gymnasts compete on each apparatus and every gymnast&apos;s score counts towards the total. &quot;If we perform our routines as we can and one or two other countries have falls, we can throw ourselves into the mix,&quot; he\u00a0says. The British team have another advantage: camaraderie. Of the five gymnasts only Cairns does not train at the City of Liverpool gym. Whelan, Tweddle, Tunney and Jenni Pinches are used to training alongside each other four to seven hours a day, where their coaches, Amanda Reddin and Clare Duffy, have created a culture of excellence. It was notable that when Tunney admitted to being &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by the size of the Olympic Village this week, she added that her team-mates had been quick to &quot;calm me down&quot;. Tweddle in particular has been a great mentor to Tunney, whom she described this week as like a sister. What has Tunney learned from her? &quot;Just how to grow up really,&quot; Tunney says. &quot;How she deals with everything, like when she&apos;s having bad days and things aren&apos;t going right. She&apos;s always in the gym even when she&apos;s not training and she comes and gives us tips.&quot; Tunney demonstrated the lessons she had learned on Thursday when she fell on the floor and hurt her foot. She emerged in the mixed zone later smiling and unfazed \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s fine,&quot; she said, grinning, &quot;just a short landing.&quot;.&quot;She&apos;s got the determination and the will,&quot; Tweddle says of Tunney. &quot;If something is not working she is determined to stay there until it is right. &quot;She&apos;s got the skills and she&apos;s got that oomph about her that I used to feel as a youngster as well. She just wants to please every single time. &quot;And she&apos;s done amazingly. Usually the transition from junior to senior can be: &apos;Is it going to happen?&apos; but she went to the Europeans and the pressure did not faze her at all.&quot; And the pressure of the home crowd? The ever focused Tunney suspects she will hardly notice. &quot;When we&apos;re competing you block out the atmosphere because you&apos;re concentrating too hard.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It was like watching Godzilla stomp his way through Tokyo."], "tags": ["Stage", "Theatre", "Dance", "Culture", "Swan Lake"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T15:06:00Z", "title": "Reader reviews: your take on Schaufuss's Swan Lake and Rylance's Richard III", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2012/jul/27/stage-reader-reviews-swan-lake", "article": "We start this week&apos;s review roundup with a less than complimentary set of comments about Peter Schaufuss&apos;s very badly reviewed Swan Lake at the Coliseum, London (one of the worst productions our critic Judith Mackrell had ever seen). Christopher Bowen wrote in the comment thread under Mackrell&apos;s review:  I remember seeing these in Edinburgh circa 1998. I&apos;m amazed they&apos;ve made it to The Coliseum. As I dimly recall, The Nutcracker is the least awful.  omarvaja was equally unimpressed:  If I were you, I would enjoy your Saturday either sleeping or go for a walk in the park. I left after one act of Swan Lake and threw away my tickets for the other two. I did not wish to give these away as I would not want any of my friends to waste their time on such rubbish.  Blimey. S/he went on to say in another comment:  we were horrified within minutes into Swan Lake and walked out as soon as possible. Have spoken with the management of the Coliseum and have strongly expressed our disappointment that they allowed such rubbish to be performed at their theatre. No where in the publicity material did it state that the music would be recorded. I will not book for dance again unless I know what I am letting myself in for.   MsHairyLegs, alas, agreed:  I went on 25 July and it was dire. The choreography was so, SO awful. Modern dance can be beautiful and athletic but Odile&apos;s choreography was graceless and flat-footed. It was like watching Godzilla stomp his way through Tokyo.   In contrast to this outpouring of disappointment by those who had seen the performance \u2013 matched, unfortunately, by the regret of those who had already bought tickets for later in the run, most people who saw Mark Rylance taking the role of Richard III at Shakespeare&apos;s Globe \u2013\u00a0an eagerly anticipated event \u2013 were overwhelmingly positive. mickangelo wrote:  I saw it this evening too. Kind of agree with the review. I still regard Ian McKellen&apos;s as a kind of benchmark performance (haven&apos;t seen Antony Sher&apos;s nor Jonathan Slinger&apos;s), but I thought Rylance&apos;s pretty powerful. I thought the whole cast were pretty good, too, though I suppose I&apos;d agree it lacked something that would have made it five-star: not sure what, though - a coherence, maybe.  Rainbowpanda was more ambiguous:  I was at first upset that Rylance had made my beloved Richard III, the awesome machiavellian warrior king into a foolish and useless old fool who could barely even hold a sword but then I realized this is a fake Richard III. This is actually a play about Richard III&apos;s kindly but slightly mad grandfather on a daytrip to Brighton.  vbermondsey was more positive \u2013\u00a0with a few reservations:   Richard III at the Globe. I&apos;ve seen a few Richard III&apos;s in my time including Kevin Spacey&apos;s take on it at the Old Vic (referencing Middle Eastern Dictators) and Ian McKellan&apos;s at the National. Mark Rylance&apos;s is all the more sinister because his Richard hides behind a genuinely jovial protrayal. Rarely have I witnessed so many laughs in a production of Richard III. This added an interesting element to the play and went some way to showing how it is that Richard could have gained the initial trust of so many of the nobles around him but in a couple of places it did jar. The pathos of the murders of the princes in the tower was slightly lost and the decision to have the ghosts appear firstly in their body bags verged on the farcical.However such is Mark Rylance&apos;s lyricism that it&apos;s easy to ignore these few jarring notes. He truly does have the incomparable ability to make his 400 yr old lines sound completely fresh.   And Twitter was busy with comments on the show. As just one example, here&apos;s @IntervalThinks:   #GdnReview Heart of darkness..Mark Rylance clever, wheedling, psychopathic, startling, hateful, playful. No line wasted. Olympian perf. \u2014 Guerrilla Criticism (@IntervalThinks) July 26, 2012  But not everyone enjoyed it. Here&apos;s Ascexis:   I&apos;d say I hated it, but it was just boring. Rylance&apos;s Richard is convincing if nothing like the driven arch manipulator of the text, and yes, I could believe it, but it threw the whole rest of the play out of sync. The other characters were reacting to someone who wasn&apos;t actually present. And Richard was more of a vicious clown figure than usual, but without the virtues of his villainy --no sense of planning or real agency in it.I&apos;m afraid I left at the interval.

The preliminary rounds get under way while the men progress into the first round and the women&apos;s event reaches the second round. Initially, Team GB did not qualify for the singles events and therefore relied on host-nation entry to participate. Joanna Parker and Paul Drinkhall will each play in the singles events. At Beijing four years ago, China won eight medals, half of which were gold. Team GB did not manage a medal but the six-strong team are optimistic that home advantage will give them a boost this year. Judo 9.30am The ExCeL plays hosts to a succession of bouts of five exhilarating minutes of combat, with the medals in the men&apos;s 60kg and women&apos;s 48kg sections to be settled on Saturday afternoon. Over seven consecutive days, 386 competitors will battle across 14 weight categories, seven categories each for men and women, ranging from below 48kg to above 100kg; each country is limited to only one judoka per weight. Judo made its first appearance as a medal sport at the Tokyo Games in 1964, though women were not awarded medals until the Barcelona Games 20 years ago. Japan managed four gold medals at Beijing in 2008. Rowing 9.30am The rowing heats begin at Eton Dorney, with crews from 54 countries starting their quest for gold in nine of the 14 events. Team GB will be participating in all the events taking place on Saturday except the women&apos;s single sculls. After the isolated triumphs of the Steve Redgrave era the 2008 Beijing Olympics saw Great Britain rise to the top of the rowing medal table with six in total. The team won two of each colour but this year they are hoping to win even more. Their sights are set particularly on winning gold in a women&apos;s rowing event, which no British crew has ever achieved. Swimming 10am Medals will be decided in the pool in the men&apos;s 400m freestyle, and the men&apos;s and women&apos;s 400m individual medleys. Thirty-four events will take place over eight days, with the last swimming event held a week on Saturday. The spectacular Aquatics Centre will host all races bar two: the swimming marathons take place at the Serpentine in Hyde Park. In Beijing 21 world records were broken, making swimming one of the highlight events. It is hoped that even more records will be broken this year, and the showdown between Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte is keenly anticipated. Road cycling 10am Road cycling has appeared in every Olympic Games since 1912 and exactly a century later the sport is set to fill the streets of London, with the crowds making these among the largest road cycling events of all time. The excitement starts with Saturday&apos;s men&apos;s road race. Like Sunday&apos;s women&apos;s race, this will begin at the end of the Mall opposite Buckingham Palace before heading out of the capital to Box Hill in Surrey, then returning to the Mall for the finish. The road race course is 250km for men and 140km for women. The road races are straight finals, meaning all competitors start together and the first rider to cross the line wins gold. However for the shorter time trial, which will begin and end at Hampton Court Palace, the cyclists start at a minute and half intervals and the cyclist with the fastest time wins."}, {"sentences": ["LK Bennett conducted a national search for women to appear in its Life is the Occasion campaign, while Ben Sherman worked with style magazine Dazed &amp; Confused to cast a gallerist, drummer and apprentice umbrella maker in its Brighton to Tokyo ads."], "tags": ["Lanvin", "Models", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Advertising", "Media", "France", "Europe", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T17:26:54Z", "title": "Supermodels sidelined as Lanvin puts 'real' women in fashion ads", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/jul/27/lanvin-fashion-ads-non-professional-models", "article": "The era of the big-name supermodel may be coming to an end, if the new advertising campaign by Lanvin is anything to go by. Inspired by the increasing popularity of street style blogs, the French fashion house has created a series of advertisements featuring &quot;real&quot; people rather than models wearing its autumn/winter collection. Former Lanvin models such as Aymeline Valade and Marte Mei van Haaster have been replaced by a cast of non-professional models ranging in age from 16 to 82, including a waiter, a milliner, a blogger, a philanthropist and a retired dancer. Lanvin&apos;s creative director, Alber Elbaz, described the campaign, shot by photographer Steven Meisel, as a way to &quot;bring these clothes back to the street somehow. It felt like a crazy family, and I like that.&quot; Judging by the response online, many others liked it too. Photographer Amanda de Cadenet, the Italian Vogue editor, Franca Sozzani, and online fashion store Styloko all voiced their approval on Twitter, while Melanie Rickey, Fashion-Editor-At-Large blogger and editor at large at Grazia, said: &quot;Models are a blank canvas to project style on to, but these are people you would sit with at a party and get to know.&quot; The &quot;real&quot; people approach has been building in fashion in response to the growing influence of blogs documenting street style. The Sartorialist, Face Hunter and Jak &amp; Jil are among sites showcasing fashion as it is worn in everyday life. Subjects may include the French Vogue editor, Emmanuelle Alt, and Anna Dello Russo of Vogue Japan, but these fashion insiders are still going about their daily business rather than starring in a glossy magazine shoot. &quot;There&apos;s more celebration of the relationship between real-life stylish people and their wardrobes,&quot; says Lucie Greene, insight editor at trends forecasting network LS:N Global. &quot;We&apos;re more excited by the idea of fashion as personal expression.&quot; Inspired by the popularity of these sites \u2013 the Sartorialist gets more than 13m page views a month \u2013 and influenced by research such as a recent Canadian study which suggested that women increase their purchase intention by 200% if models look more like them, some brands have embraced a more real-life approach to fashion imagery. LK Bennett conducted a national search for women to appear in its Life is the Occasion campaign, while Ben Sherman worked with style magazine Dazed &amp; Confused to cast a gallerist, drummer and apprentice umbrella maker in its Brighton to Tokyo ads. Meanwhile, French brand The Kooples, which launched in the UK last year, has become instantly recognisable for ads featuring real couples wearing its clothes. &quot;It fitted perfectly with the audience they were aiming for,&quot; says Ruth Mortimer, the editor of Marketing Week, &quot;young, cool people who take their clothing cues from fashionable people they know rather than traditional glossy ads in magazines.&quot; The age range of Lanvin&apos;s subjects also suggests the fashion world may be becoming less obsessively focused on youth. The inclusion of Jacquie &quot;Tajah&quot; Murdock, 82, and Tziporah Salamon, 62,was inspired by Ari Seth Cohen&apos;s blog Advanced Style, which features photographs of flamboyantly dressed older women in New York. &quot;An older model can communicate something deeper about a brand than someone who has less life experience,&quot; says Cohen. &quot;I hope that these images become the norm.&quot; Others hope so too, but believe the biggest disconnect between brand and consumer still isn&apos;t being addressed. &quot;It&apos;s women in\u00a0 their 40s who actually buy things,&quot; says Alyson Walsh, who set up the over-40s fashion blog That&apos;s Not My Age. &quot;It seems crazy not to address that.&quot; Josy Spooner, booker of the Classics Division at Models 1, representing models from their late 20s to their 80s, agrees. &quot;It&apos;s the middle ground that isn&apos;t being covered,&quot; she says. &quot;Brands for women in their 40s and 50s are still using 17-year-old girls.&quot; Meanwhile, Spooner is not worried that Lanvin&apos;s rejection of models suggests she will soon be out of a job. &quot;The demand for models won&apos;t diminish,&quot; she says. &quot;You don&apos;t want someone who looks like your next-door neighbour \u2013 you want someone gorgeous but who you can identify with.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Komova came within 0.033 points of Wieber at the world championships in Tokyo last October and has since raised the stakes, adding extra difficulty to her routines, particularly on the bars and the beam."], "tags": ["Olympics 2012: gymnastics", "USA Olympic team", "Russia Olympic team", "Gymnastics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "US sports", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T19:11:00Z", "title": "London 2012: Gymnastics rivals ready for fierce Olympic Games battle | Emma John", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/27/london-2012-gymnastics-olympics-games", "article": "If anyone should know what to expect of the women&apos;s artistic gymnastics, it is Nastia Liukin. Four years ago, at the age of 18, the American was busy filling her cabinet with Olympic medals, including the prestigious all-around gold. So when Liukin says that this could be one of the best contests the women&apos;s sport has ever known, it is probably no exaggeration. &quot;I definitely think so,&quot; says Liukin, who herself missed out on selection at the Team USA Olympic trials in June, and then retired from the sport. &quot;For the past year I&apos;ve been training and competing alongside the girls, but even I was mesmerised at some of the things they were doing. It&apos;s definitely going to be an exciting competition because the level of difficulty has just picked up tremendously, within the past few years even.&quot; Three teams have been at the forefront of that inexorable evolution: the USA, Russia and China. &quot;Obviously they&apos;re the frontrunners, with Romania in there as well,&quot; says Liukin, who is in London to provide analysis for NBC&apos;s Olympic coverage and contribute blogs to its website. &quot;Anything can happen at the Olympic Games, but over the past few years, at the championships, those teams have been the ones in the medal hunt.&quot; The favourites in almost every quarter \u2013 including, quite possibly, their own \u2013 are the USA. In the 17-year-old world champion Jordyn Wieber the Americans have the sport&apos;s most formidable competitor and, in Gabrielle Douglas, they have the only person in the world to have beaten her \u2013 the 16-year-old&apos;s first place at the USA Olympic trials was the first time someone had finished above Wieber in her senior career. The fact that there was no place for Liukin, a reigning Olympic champion, demonstrates the extraordinary strength of the team. &quot;We are so pumped up, and we love it because Team USA is on fire,&quot; Douglas enthused after podium training on Thursday. &quot;We have been prepared so well \u2026 If we can just take that on the floor and into competition I think that this is going to be a great competition for us.&quot; Curiously, the gymnast who provides the winning factor for the US may just be a Romanian. The Amanar vault \u2013 a fiendish manoeuvre requiring two and a half twists after the gymnast leaves the table \u2013 is named after Romania&apos;s Simona Amanar, the former Olympic vault champion who invented it in 2000. Its difficulty level is so high that anyone who can perform it clean has a huge advantage. Wieber and Douglas both have Amanars in their repertoire and in podium training on Thursday McKayla Maroney, USA&apos;s vault specialist, proved she could perform one even with a broken toe that has not fully healed. Team USA&apos;s rivals have been scrambling to add the Amanar to their armoury and Russia&apos;s Aliya Mustafina tore the ligaments in her left knee, in front of a packed crowd, while landing the vault in last year&apos;s European championships. Russia&apos;s national coach, Valentina Rodionenko, insisted in a recent interview that at least three members of the Russian team will perform Amanars in London. &quot;We feel the risk needs to be taken,&quot; she said. Russia, finally returning as a gymnastics superpower for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union, can claim the greatest challenge to Wieber in the individual all-around title. Mustafina is the 2010 world champion and looked strong in training this week, although her injury, along with a recent growth spurt, may have dimmed her original star. Even Rodionenko, Mustafina&apos;s coach, has admitted that her former star gymnast &quot;doesn&apos;t show the class in execution that we saw two years ago&quot;. The 17-year-old Viktoria Komova, who grew up in Mustafina&apos;s shadow, may have the better chance. Komova came within 0.033 points of Wieber at the world championships in Tokyo last October and has since raised the stakes, adding extra difficulty to her routines, particularly on the bars and the beam. Other team-mates have followed suit \u2013 Anastasia Grishina&apos;s daring new floor routine prompted admiring glances this week \u2013 and along with their improved skills, Russia&apos;s elegance, a throwback to the classical style of old-school Soviet gymnastics, is sure to win plenty of admirers in the stands. The Russian team are, however, prone to error, something their US counterparts are not. &quot;The Americans have a power and a strength and determination in the way they do everything,&quot; says Mitch Fenner, a BBC commentator and the coach to the Dutch gymnast Epke Zonderland. &quot;You almost can&apos;t see them falling off. They have a very businesslike, efficient approach.&quot; Those are words that could also describe the Chinese team, who worked tirelessly on their weaknesses in vault and floor to pull off victory in the team competition at Beijing. But defending that medal will be harder still. Their team contains some great individual talent \u2013 they have a world-class beam specialist in Deng Linlin, and He Kexin, the defending Olympic bars champion, will be Beth Tweddle&apos;s likeliest rival on that apparatus. But China, who managed only bronze at last year&apos;s world championships, lack the depth of Russia and the USA, and matters were made worse in June by the loss of their vault and floor specialist Chang Fei to a ruptured achilles. If one of the three superpowers is to slip off the podium, Romania is the wildcard ready to steal the spot, although their hopes suffered a blow this week when Larisa Iordache, their 16-year-old wunderkind, suffered a foot injury in training. The country that won team golds in 2000 and 2004 has suffered some longueurs in recent years because of the collapse of state funding for the sport. But the powerful combination of the eye-catching Iordache and Catalina Ponor, the former Olympic champion who has returned from retirement, helped them to six medals at the European championships in May. As well as the team gold, Romania took three of the four available individual titles and they will challenge in most departments. Much now rests on whether Iordache recovers sufficiently to play her full part."}, {"sentences": ["Long jump in particular has some of the longest standing records, and this year&apos;s athletes will probably need their maximum permissible tailwind of 2.0m/s, if they are to beat Mike Powell&apos;s 8.95m leap, achieved in Tokyo in 1991."], "tags": ["Weather", "UK news", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-07-29T21:30:03Z", "title": "Weatherwatch: Will the weather help Bolt or Radcliffe?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2012/jul/29/weatherwatch-olympics-training-athletes", "article": "Will Usain Bolt smash his own 100m sprint record in the coming days?

An increased tailwind will reduce atmospheric drag, while hotter temperatures mean thinner air and fewer molecules impeding athletes&apos; paths. Wind assistance will also be key in the 200m, 100m hurdles, triple jump and long jump. Long jump in particular has some of the longest standing records, and this year&apos;s athletes will probably need their maximum permissible tailwind of 2.0m/s, if they are to beat Mike Powell&apos;s 8.95m leap, achieved in Tokyo in 1991. Paula Radcliffe won&apos;t be wishing for searing temperatures. For marathon runners the optimum temperature is somewhere between 5C and 13C, combined with overcast skies. Average August temperatures are around 17C. Both the men&apos;s 100m sprint and the women&apos;s marathon take place on Sunday 5 August. Will the weather help Bolt or Radcliffe?

Greens Japan, created by local politicians and activists, hopes to satisfy the legal requirements to become an officially recognised political party in time for the general election, which must be held by next summer but could come much earlier. The party said it would offer voters a viable alternative to the two main parties, both of which have retained their support for nuclear power, particularly after the recent decision to restart two nuclear reactors in western Japan. The ruling Democratic party of Japan and the minority opposition Liberal democratic party [LDP] both supported the nuclear restart, which came after Japan was briefly left without nuclear power for the first time in more than 40 years. Akira Miyabe, Greens Japan&apos;s deputy leader, said voters had been deprived of the chance to support a party that puts nuclear abolition and other green policies at the top of its agenda. &quot;We need a party that puts the environment first,&quot; he said at a launch event in Tokyo. The 1,000-member party is still a gathering of disparate groups and local politicians, but believes it can emulate green parties in Germany and other parts of Europe and influence the national debate over energy policy. Nao Suguro, a co-leader of the party who sits on a local assembly in Tokyo, said the aim was &quot;to create a broad network to accommodate calls for the abolition of nuclear power plants.&quot; The party will struggle to field any candidates if, as some predict, the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, calls a snap lower house election. But it said it was prepared to put up about 10 candidates in next summer&apos;s upper house elections. Recent demonstrations in Tokyo suggest Japan&apos;s anti-nuclear movement has broken free of its long association with socialist and pacifist movements to include younger campaigners, many of whom are protesting for the first time. The protests are among the biggest Japan has seen in decades, although they have not succeeded in forcing Noda to reconsider his support for the restart of several reactors to avoid power cuts and lessen Japan&apos;s dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports. While thousands of demonstrators held a candlelit vigil and formed a chain around the parliament building in Tokyo on Sunday night, voters in Yamaguchi prefecture in south-west Japan elected a pro-nuclear governor in a poll that some saw as a litmus test of Japan&apos;s enthusiasm for atomic energy. Shigetaro Yamamoto, a former bureaucrat who was supported by the conservative LDP, defeated three rivals, including Tetsunari Iida, who had campaigned against the proposed construction of a nuclear power plant in the area. That vote came after other recent wins for pro-nuclear candidates in local elections. The government is currently sounding out public opinion on three options for nuclear energy&apos;s share of the country&apos;s energy mix in 2030: zero, 15% or 20-25%.

Robert Plant has worked with guitarist Justin Adams in the past, but in his new band, Sensational Space Shifters, he has cleverly invited a second member of JuJu to join him as well. Juldeh Camara, from Gambia, is an exponent of the ritti one-stringed fiddle, and here he brought a wailing African edge to a set dominated by reworked blues classics, with Plant proving that he still has one of the great voices with his edgy, attacking treatment of the Howlin&apos; Wolf favourite Forty-Four . The second great performance of the night came from Kinshasa&apos;s Jupiter &amp; Okwess International, whose hypnotic, high-energy playing mixed jangling rapid-fire funk riffs, and equally tight vocals and percussion work. They are surely the African discovery of the year. From elsewhere on the continent there were upbeat desert blues from Niger&apos;s Abdallah Oumbadougou, and a slick, easy-going set from Rai hero Khaled, who often sounded as if he was on cruise control. This was a great year for Asian music, and Manganiyar Seduction, from Rajasthan, northern India, provided the most spectacular staging for any Womad performance I have seen. Each of the 36 musicians played inside a box initially covered by a red curtain and surrounded by bare light bulbs \u2013 an idea apparently inspired by the red-light district in Amsterdam. The boxes towered high above the stage, with the lights coming on every time a musician started playing \u2013 until they were all flashing like some wild Indian disco, as the musicians switched from fiddles and flutes to a furious climax of vocals and drumming. From further east, there was the entertaining Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, furiously mixing Jamaican styles with jazz. And the strangest music of the weekend was provided by Marewrew &amp; Oki, reviving the unearthly and tranquil songs of Japan&apos;s Ainu people.

These were the words spoken by the British men&apos;s gymnastic team as they struggled to come to terms with what they had just achieved in winning the nation&apos;s first Olympic team medal for a century. The teenagers Sam Oldham and Max Whitlock, both 19, clasped their hands to their faces in shock, bronze medals hanging from their necks. &quot;It&apos;s just not sinking in,&quot; said Kristian Thomas, the star of the team, whose stunning display on the vault \u2013 to score 16.550 points, the highest of the competition for a move that he learned only in January \u2013 helped Britain to a place on the podium. &quot;I&apos;m hoping once the next week is out the way that we can sit down relax and take a moment and think we&apos;ve just achieved one of the greatest things in history within our sport.&quot; The 23-year-old is the same age as the more famous Louis Smith but has spent years in the 2008 Olympic bronze medal winner&apos;s shadow. In the Olympic final, though, Thomas emerged as a force to be reckoned with, consistently performing out of his skin. &quot;I&apos;m just completely overwhelmed by the whole experience right now,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully in a few months I can sit back and think, &apos;Right we really have done something special here now&apos;. Even after I finished floor [the final event] I wasn&apos;t 100% convinced [we had won a medal], until my score came up I couldn&apos;t think &apos;right, we have actually done it&apos;.&quot; Thomas was the gymnast who followed Oldham on the high bar immediately after the teenager had fallen. Unshakeable, he banged out another high score. &quot;I remember looking up and not even taking it in,&quot; he said of Oldham&apos;s fall. &quot;I stuck it to the back of my head and didn&apos;t even worry about it. When I was chalking up for bars I just thought, &apos;Right this is just like any other situation in the gym, it&apos;s not as big an occasion as you think&apos;. I just tried to play the whole situation down and I think that helped.&quot; Four years ago, at the Beijing Games, Smith and his coach, Paul Hall, had talked about 2012 as the year that Britain&apos;s young talent would mature and win medals. Back then nobody had too much cause to believe them. Yes, Smith had just won Britain&apos;s first individual Olympic gymnastics medal in 100 years, but how many gifted juniors bridge the gap to an Olympic podium? Their conviction was rooted in Britain&apos;s junior team victory at the European junior championships in Lausanne that same year, brought about by a prodigiously talented bunch of kids that included Daniel Purvis and Oldham. Now in 2012 here they stood on the Olympic podium in London, blowing out their cheeks. Smith refused to be downbeat about the Japanese protest that meant a regrading of Kohei Uchimura&apos;s score and an adjustment in the podium order, with Britain slipping to bronze. Instead he insisted on saluting Uchimura \u2013 a legend of the sport. &quot;In a way I&apos;m quite happy with that,&quot; he said of the inquiry. &quot;All of us look up to the Japanese gymnastics team \u2013 they&apos;re the pinnacle of gym. All of us want to be as good as them and, to see them get a medal, we feel very happy about that. I don&apos;t think anyone wanted to see them come fourth. If the judges have got something wrong and they deserve to get a silver medal, then they deserve that silver medal.&quot; Having played his part on the pommels in the first round of apparatus, scoring a convincing 15.966points, Smith \u2013 the team captain \u2013 took on the role of group cheerleader for the remainder of the rotations, animatedly leaping into the air to celebrate Thomas&apos;s vault. When Oldham fell from the high bar Smith was shouting &quot;Come on Sam! You can do it!&quot; as the Nottingham-born gymnast tried desperately to steady his nerves. Smith yelled him through every move. &quot;My throat&apos;s a bit sore,&quot; Smith laughed, &quot;I sound like I&apos;ve been out partying all night. It&apos;s mad.&quot; It is easy to forget the context of this medal: a British team who, last year at the world championships in Tokyo, failed to qualify for their home Games and were forced to go away, reassess and come back to fight for a place at the Olympic test event here in January. In the underbelly of the Greenwich North Arena, Smith recalled that journey, reminding his listeners of the struggle. &quot;You bounce back from situations, you learn from mistakes. Who would have thought after Tokyo? Not qualifying a team for this Olympic Games, having to do the test event, and we&apos;re standing here we&apos;re the third best team in the world \u2026 And the injuries in the squad \u2013 we lost [the world silver medallist] Daniel Keatings, who managed to get back as a reserve and keep pushing us \u2013 it has been tough, to keep on top of things.

In the 1970s he helped establish the Centre for the Study of Conflict at the University of Ulster at Coleraine, County Derry. After 25 years at Ulster, he moved in 1999 to the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, as professor of comparative ethnic studies until 2011. There, he continued to initiate and develop new studies. Some idea of the breadth of his passions is indicated by his lifelong interest in cartoons and conflict, leading to the publication in 1985 of Dressed to Kill: Cartoons and the Northern Ireland Conflict. John was born in Belfast, but his family moved to Portrush, County Antrim, when he was quite young. He attended St Patrick&apos;s primary school in Portrush and St Patrick&apos;s college, Armagh, as a boarder. He then did a history degree at Queen&apos;s University Belfast and a one-year postgraduate teacher-training course at St Joseph&apos;s training college, Belfast. John began his career as a history teacher in Belfast, but the impact of the Troubles in the early 1970s led him to the post of research and publications officer to the NI Community Relations Commission. His first book, Conflict in Northern Ireland: The Development of a Polarised Community, was published in 1976 and was an early and influential contribution to understanding of the Northern Ireland problem. In 1974 he was appointed lecturer in social administration in the then new University of Ulster at Coleraine. From 1991, he was closely involved in the creation of the International Conflict Research Institute (Incore), a joint programme of the Tokyo-based United Nations University and the University of Ulster. John wrote or edited 15 books and 120 other academic publications: three of his books, Conflict in Northern Ireland, Intimidation and the Control of Conflict in Northern Ireland (1986), and Guns and Government: The Northern Ireland Peace Process (2002) were listed for international awards. He also held visiting positions in Harvard and Duke universities, and was a fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation in Bellagio, Italy (1990), the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington (1992), the United States Institute of Peace (1998), and the Fulbright New Century scholars programme (2003).

The figures emerge from the World Cities Culture Report 2012 published on Wednesday - an international survey which is the biggest of its kind examining in number crunching detail the cultural offerings of 12 cities, although the authors stress that it is not an attempt to rank them. One of the report&apos;s central points is that world cities are as important in terms of culture as they are in finance or trade. The report says: &quot;Culture in all its diverse forms is central to what makes a city appealing to educated people and hence to the businesses which seek to employ them.&quot; It was commissioned by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and is being published to coincide with a cultural summit in London in which representatives of the 12 cities - London, Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Mumbai, New York, Paris, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo - will gather to discuss common aims. Johnson said: &quot;World cities are international hubs for commerce and trade, but as this groundbreaking report makes clear, they are powerhouses for culture too \u2013 in London the creative industries alone contribute \u00a319bn to our economy and employ 386,000 people. In coming together as city leaders and policymakers we want to harness the full potential of culture, which makes our cities exciting and desirable places to live in and visit, but also makes a massive contribution to wider social and economic goals.&quot; The report says the contribution of the arts and creative industries is fundamental to a city&apos;s health. It uses 60 different indicators and reveals that London has the most museums at 173 which includes 11 national museums; while Berlin has 158 combined; Paris has 137; and New York has 131. Paris has the most art galleries (1,046) followed by London (857), New York (721) and Tokyo (688). The importance of public libraries is explored with Paris coming way out top in numerical terms. It has 830 public libraries compared to Shanghai&apos;s 477, London&apos;s 383, Tokyo&apos;s 377, Johannesburg&apos;s 234, New York&apos;s 220, Sydney&apos;s 154 and Berlin&apos;s 88. Paris also has more bookshops \u2013 1,025 to London&apos;s 802, although Tokyo has the most (1,675); Shanghai has 1,322 and Johannesburg has 1,020. Paris has the most cinemas (302) and cinema screens (1,003) in the world, while London has 108 cinemas and 566 screens. New York comes out top in terms of number of theatres. It has 420, compared to 353 in Paris, 230 in Tokyo, 214 in London and 184 in Istanbul. London&apos;s theatre admissions total is the second highest at 14.2m \u2013 but it is dwarfed by New York which has twice that number at 28.1m. Paris is top in terms of live music venues: a figure of 423 compared to 385 in Tokyo; 349 in London; 294 in Sao Paulo and 277 in New York. London does come top for comedy performances: 11,388 compared to 11,076 in New York and 10,348 in Paris. And the city also has a strikingly high number of restaurants with 37,450, or 478 for each 100,000 of population. The report addresses the assumption by some that the world is &apos;flattening&apos; or becoming more homogenous; that cities are becoming more similar places. &quot;What links world cities to one another is trade, commerce and finance. What makes them different from one another is culture.&quot; The report says many cultural elements shape a city whether &quot;its record shops, its large and small music venues, its libraries and book shops, its museums and galleries, its parks and open spaces, football clubs and cricket grounds, students and cafes.&quot; Paul Owens, of BOP Consulting, who led the research team said: &quot;Culture is an under-researched and poorly understood factor in the social and economic success of world cities. The World Cities Culture Report is the most comprehensive comparative study of its kind - a rich source of data and intelligence with the latest and best policy thinking about culture from across the globe. It will be a hugely valuable tool to policymakers as they devise future strategies for development and investment.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Days before the team flew from Tokyo, children from the region devastated by last year&apos;s tsunami presented each athlete with a wooden medal carved out of debris left behind by the waves.", "The 28-year-old Watanabe, who finished fifth in the keirin at the world track cycling championships in April, was training in Tokyo when the tsunami struck and had to wait hours for confirmation that his relatives had survived.", "A decent medal haul would also boost Tokyo&apos;s chances of hosting the 2020 Games, decades after the capital&apos;s first summer Olympics, in 1964, marked Japan&apos;s re-entry into the international community after the second world war."], "tags": ["Japan Olympic team", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-01T10:05:04Z", "title": "Japan hopes London Olympics will boost recovery from tsunami | Justin McCurry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/01/london-2012-japan-tsunami", "article": "Every one of Japan&apos;s 300 Olympic athletes was a medallist even before their arrival in London. Days before the team flew from Tokyo, children from the region devastated by last year&apos;s tsunami presented each athlete with a wooden medal carved out of debris left behind by the waves. The gifts, attached to ribbons bearing good luck messages, brought tears to the eyes of Japan&apos;s Olympic javelin thrower, Yukifumi Murakami. &quot;I&apos;m really moved,&quot; he said, adding. &quot;I have to repay the faith everyone has placed in me.&quot; That unconventional medal ceremony was only the first of what promises to be a fortnight of poignant moments in London for Japan&apos;s athletes, several of whom were affected by the disaster in which almost 20,000 people died on 11 March last year. About one in 10 of Japan&apos;s contingent has some connection to the disaster-hit region of Tohoku: Kenta Chida, a fencer, lost his best friend to the tsunami; the world champion pistol marksman Tomoyuki Matsuda, practised in Ishinomaki, where thousands died; and the women&apos;s football team gave the country rare cause for celebration when they lifted the World Cup last July. Among them is Aya Sameshima, who worked at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant while playing for Tepco Mareeze, a club owned by the plant&apos;s operator. For Kazunari Watanabe, the repercussions of the disaster promise to continue long after his appearance in London, where he will begin his quest for medals in the men&apos;s keirin and team sprint this week. Watanabe was living with his wife, parents, grandmother and other relatives in Futaba, two miles from the Fukushima plant, when three reactors went into meltdown, causing the evacuation of more than 150,000\u00a0people. Watanabe&apos;s relatives are scattered around several locations and have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return to Futaba, a radiation ghost town where the exclusion order barring residents from returning could remain in place for large parts of the town for another decade. The 28-year-old Watanabe, who finished fifth in the keirin at the world track cycling championships in April, was training in Tokyo when the tsunami struck and had to wait hours for confirmation that his relatives had survived. But the disaster affected his performances; his times suffered and he no longer enjoyed training. Almost 18 months on, he has regained his appetite for the sport, and has an outside chance of winning a medal. &quot;The consequences from the devastation will continue for many more years, and it will be my life work to keep attention on the issue,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to be a source of strength for the people of Futaba and Fukushima at this Olympics, and will aim for the gold medal.&quot; The disaster almost forced Narumi Kurosu, who in London will become the first Japanese woman to compete in the modern pentathlon, to abandon her dream of taking part in the Olympics. The quake badly damaged training facilities in her hometown in Ibaraki prefecture, leaving her with nowhere to practise in a country of only about 100\u00a0pentathletes. Kurosu was on the verge of giving up when she received an unexpected invitation to train in South Korea from a coach who had been moved by her plight. Ten days after the tsunami, Kurosu was training alongside rival athletes in South Korea and, with their help, quickly began putting in the best performances of her career. &quot;I definitely want to put on a good show for the people of Ibaraki,&quot; she said. Japan has used the arrival of tens of thousands of visitors in London to demonstrate its appreciation for the international support received after the disaster. A corner of Holland Park has been transformed into a typical Fukushima garden and, during the Games, Japan&apos;s athletes will be auctioning Olympic uniforms and other items to raise money to rebuild the north-east coast.

Whatever Helen has done, she has always put every effort into it. She really deserves it.&quot; At her former independent school, Millfield in Somerset, Deb Gabb, who was Glover&apos;s &quot;house parent&quot; while she was in sixth form, said she had cried when her former charge won gold. &quot;She made me cry because she was crying,&quot; Gabb said. &quot;You just had to watch her face \u2013 it was absolutely brilliant. &quot;She is a lovely girl and we are all dead chuffed for her.

There were also tears from Glover&apos;s former PE teacher Kate Finch, who was among those packed into Penzance Hockey Club to witness history being made on a large screen. Kelly Thomas, who had trained with Glover at the club, said: &quot;I was really emotional. I started crying because you can see how much it means to her. &quot;She has worked really hard for it, it has taken her away from her home and away from family and friends. She deserves every minute of it.&quot; Members of the club where Glover took up rowing on 2008 and was soon discovered by a talent scout \u2013 Minerva Bath Rowing Club near Bath \u2013 said the atmosphere as the pair crossed the winning line had been electric. Andy Ursell, a senior coach at Minerva, said: &quot;It&apos;s fantastic, to see Helen and Heather win that race in such style, there was no doubt from 500 metres onwards, they looked fantastic. &quot;I think they&apos;re going to lift Team GB, now we&apos;ve got a gold medal, and hopefully it will kick on and people will be inspired by what she&apos;s done, and it also does the same for us here. Helen started here, she&apos;s still a member here and to see that, it&apos;s just fantastic.&quot; At the Boathouse pub, where about 40 people from the club had gathered to watch the final, Sarah Moon, the women&apos;s team captain, said: &quot;It&apos;s an incredible, incredible day for Team GB, an incredible day for rowing.&quot; The Royal Mail announced it was rushing out a commemorative &quot;gold medal&quot; stamp to celebrate the pair&apos;s win by lunchtime tomorrow, and painting one post box gold in their home towns of Lossiemouth and Penzance. The Royal Mail said the new stamp would be printed and distributed within 24 hours in a fleet of 90 Royal Mail vans to 500 post offices around the UK, including the post office in Lossiemouth, the coastal town in north-east Scotland where Stanning&apos;s parents still live. But the stamps would not arrive there until Friday. Moya Greene, the chief executive of Royal Mail, said: &quot;This is a first for Royal Mail and we are proud to play our part in celebrating the many victories this summer. &quot;We will be printing millions of stamps to enable customers to celebrate these sporting successes and I&apos;m sure they will be treasured as unique souvenirs of Team GB&apos;s victories for years to come.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Vertigo is about our inner life.&quot; Third in the critics&apos; list is Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story, the 1953 Japanese drama.", "In the directors&apos; poll, Tokyo Story won over Citizen Kane and Kubrick&apos;s 2001: A Space Odyssey in joint second."], "tags": ["Alfred Hitchcock", "BFI", "Film", "Orson Welles", "World news", "UK news", "Culture", "Vertigo", "Citizen Kane"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-01T17:32:00Z", "title": "Vertigo tops greatest film poll, ending reign of Citizen Kane", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/01/vertigo-hitchcock-bfi-greatest-film", "article": "&quot;It tells a most unlikely tale about a wife-murder, and tells it for more than two hours in a style that is slow, wordy and, apparently, casual,&quot; sniffed the Manchester Guardian&apos;s film critic 54 years ago. To clarify, what he may have meant to say is that Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Vertigo is nothing less than the greatest film of all time. The reappraisal was due on Wednesday after the 1958 film topped the British Film Institute&apos;s much-respected Greatest Films poll, which it has been conducting once every decade since 1952. Vertigo managed to end the reign of Orson Welles&apos;s Citizen Kane, which has topped the list since 1962. &quot;I was a little surprised,&quot; said Nick James, the editor of Sight &amp; Sound magazine, which carries out the poll. &quot;I remember hoping last time that Citizen Kane would get knocked off and it never happened, so yes, I was surprised. And delighted.&quot; Vertigo&apos;s achievement is all the more impressive because the poll, which is considered one of the most authoritative, was bigger and more international this year than ever before, with 846 critics and writers having their say. James said Vertigo&apos;s victory reflected changes in the culture of film criticism. &quot;Cinephilia has changed in that there&apos;s less of a massive respect for the all-singing, all-dancing, every technological achievement in one film kind of film, like Citizen Kane. &quot;People are moving towards more personal films, ones that they can react to personally in their own lives, and Vertigo is that kind of film, especially if you watch it more than once. It is a film that grows and grows on you.&quot; &quot;It feels like a much more contemporary film than Citizen Kane, which is a lot of bombast and is very theatrical and slightly hammy by modern acting standards. Vertigo is about our inner life.&quot; Third in the critics&apos; list is Yasujiro Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story, the 1953 Japanese drama. &quot;I watched this film just three days ago and I couldn&apos;t stop crying,&quot; said James. &quot;It tells you more about family life than any recent Hollywood film, I would suggest, even how we live today. It is very poignant and sad and heartbreaking and fabulous \u2013 it is a masterpiece.&quot; Ozu&apos;s film came top in a parallel poll among directors \u2013 358 of them participated including the likes of Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Woody Allen and Mike Leigh. In the directors&apos; poll, Tokyo Story won over Citizen Kane and Kubrick&apos;s 2001: A Space Odyssey in joint second. They were followed by 81/2; Taxi Driver; Apocalypse Now; The Godfather and Vertigo in joint seventh place; then Tarkovsky&apos;s Mirror and, in 10th, place Bicycle Thieves, which topped the first critics&apos; poll in 1952. The success of Vertigo reflects the remarkable change in fortune Hitchcock has had with critics, some of whom once looked down on him as little more than a Hollywood thriller director. To be fair to the 1958 Guardian critic, he found a lot to like in Vertigo and praised the director&apos;s mastery of suspense. But he added: &quot;This does not, indeed, mean that Vertigo is really a worthwhile film. Even Hitchcock&apos;s mastery cannot obliterate its essential dottiness or banish impatience during its second unnecessary hour.&quot; These days the BFI, which is currently showing a retrospective of the director&apos;s films, believes Hitchcock should be studied in schools alongside Shakespeare and Dickens. Although a British director tops the poll, there are precious few British films in the top 100. Some might argue that 2001: A Space Odyssey is a British film \u2013 ranked 6th \u2013 but the first unarguably British film is Carol Reed&apos;s The Third Man at 73rd. The contemporary love affair with silent films, after the success of The Artist, continues with two new entries in the top 10: Dziga Vertov&apos;s avant garde documentary Man With a Movie Camera at number 8, and Carl Theodor Dreyer&apos;s The Passion of Joan of Arc in 9th place. There is a paucity of offerings from the last 20 years, with the only ones making an impact being Wong Kar-Wei&apos;s 2000 film In The Mood For Love \u2013 at 24 \u2013 and David Lynch&apos;s Mulholland Drive, from 2001, at 28.

Sight and Sound magazine has published its 10-yearly critics&apos; poll of the greatest films, and Orson Welles&apos;s Citizen Kane \u2013 in the No 1 slot since 1962 \u2013 has finally been toppled by Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s 1958 psychological thriller Vertigo, starring James Stewart as the retired, troubled police officer who becomes obsessed with a woman&apos;s eerie resemblance to someone he once had under surveillance. For some observers, irritated by nerdy lists, Vertigo&apos;s triumph is hardly more significant than John McEnroe finally beating Bjorn Borg for the Wimbledon men&apos;s singles in 1981. Others may simply feel that one form of reflex critical orthodoxy has replaced another. Vertigo is a fascinating case study in reputation. It wasn&apos;t all that much liked on release, and its critical prestige accumulated only gradually. Vertigo did not appear anywhere on the Sight and Sound poll for the first three decades, jumped in at No 7 in 1982, No 4 in 1992, No 2 in 2002 and now the gold medal. It&apos;s a brilliant and intriguing film in many ways, boasting an intense, careworn performance from Stewart, though with a narrative &quot;reveal&quot; that arrives disconcertingly early on. My own theory is that Vertigo&apos;s rise in esteem coincides with academic critical fascination with female sexuality and the male &quot;gaze&quot;. The world is ruled by men; they see what they want to see, and the visibility and comprehensibility of women&apos;s emotional lives are constructed by the male observer: Stewart&apos;s agonised cop Scottie thinks a beautiful woman is the reincarnation of another. How irrational is he being? I feel that Vertigo is inferior to Hitchcock&apos;s other more brutally explicit psychological thriller Psycho, but that a persistent gentility in the critical world feels it necessary to reward the classier and more subtle film, and Psycho, for all that it is adored, has the genre taint of &quot;horror&quot; which keeps it out of lists like these. It is sad to see Singin&apos; in the Rain drop out of the top 10, and also that The Godfathers I and II (No 4 in 2002) have vanished. John Ford&apos;s gritty The Searchers (1956) is still a critical darling and Kubrick&apos;s 2001 (1968) is the most recent film on the list. Perhaps it is the stunning success of the recent Oscar-winning The Artist that has triggered a new interest in silent movies, and brought in three silents to the 2012 poll: Sunrise (1927) by FW Murnau (up two places from its No 7 ranking in 2002), The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer and Dziga Vertov&apos;s Man with a Movie Camera (1929), which makes its Sight and Sound poll debut. Among the European masters, Renoir&apos;s Rules of the Game is at No 4 and Fellini&apos;s 8\u00bd is hanging in at No 10, but Bergman is not there, and Antonioni&apos;s L&apos;Avventura \u2013 for decades an absolute shoo-in \u2013 has been excluded, and this his centenary year too. It&apos;s not a bad list, though it&apos;s interesting how cautious critics are about rewarding recent films. When the Sight and Sound 1952 poll was published, and cinema itself hardly more than 50 years old, it boldly gave the No 1 slot to De Sica&apos;s Bicycle Thieves, then just four years old \u2013 and there are many who would agree with that placing now. It would have been exciting to see some films from the past 10 years in the 2012 list.

Although he engaged with the avant garde, Jimmy&apos;s music is melodic rather than atonal and he never confined himself to one genre. He took every opportunity to write pop music, jazz, film and television scores and stage musicals. In 1968 he won an International Society for Contemporary Music award and in the same year his work Exploding Galaxy reached No 1 in the Melody Maker pop charts. In 1990, he was nominated for a Bafta music award for his contribution to the BBC drama Chelworth. Jimmy was born in Dalston, east London. He studied initially with Benjamin Frankel at the Guildhall School of Music in London and with Darius Milhaud, Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger at the Paris Conservatoire. A lifelong pacifist, he was imprisoned during the second world war for conscientious objection. He embraced the cause of CND during the late 1950s and was later involved in the movement for peace in Vietnam. He was the chair of Hammersmith CND and even paid the fines incurred by some activists. In 1995 he was chosen by the Musicians&apos; Union of Japan to represent English artists at the Hiroshima and Nagasaki 50th anniversary memorial ceremonies. Eclectic is an understatement of Jimmy&apos;s work. The BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra premiered his 4th Symphony, and the Buddhist requiem Celebration for the Dead was played by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra. The Brecksville Bees Marching Band from Ohio performed his work Goal at the old Wembley Stadium for the England v Argentina match in 1980. Jimmy never joined the &quot;awkward squad&quot; because they were insufficiently awkward. Maybe if he had taken his tuxedo from his wardrobe more often he would have gained more commissions and his music might have been more widely performed. But that was not his way: he was certain of his talents and no commissioner or film producer was allowed to intervene with his score.

It wasn&apos;t a question of bad manners; more a question of consideration. A stadium-sized roar to acknowledge the arrival of the Games&apos; oldest competitor \u2013 a ramrod-straight and dapper man of 71 \u2013 would have frightened the mare and probably embarrassed her rider. Hoketsu, after all, had not travelled from his home in Germany to fly the flag for older athletes, nor had he come to court the sympathy vote. He had come to London, as he went to his first games in Tokyo in 1964, and to Beijing four years ago, to compete and, hopefully, to win. And beneath a bright sky that turned Whisper&apos;s brown coat a dark gold, that is what he tried his best to do. With a formal nod, Hoketsu began his individual dressage test, guiding his 15-year-old horse around the arena for the benefit of the judges, who sat scrutinising their every move from seven shady huts. His white-gloved hands keeping her on a tight rein, Whisper executed a neat diagonal cross of the arena before pausing and reversing neatly to one corner. Seven minutes later, after she had appeared to jog on the spot, skip and goose-step her way around the arena, Whisper came to a stop in front of the judges. As the first drops of rain began to fall from a greying sky, the crowd burst into applause and Hoketsu raised his hat in acknowledgement. And with that, the oldest Olympian rode out of the arena, to finish 17th out of 24. At the top of Thursday&apos;s dressage table, in first and second, were two British riders: Carl Hester and Laura Bechtolsheimer. Several places behind was Rafalca, the US horse part-owned by Ann Romney, the wife of the Republican party&apos;s presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. If Hoketsu was disappointed by his performance, he gave no sign of it. At one point, not too long ago, it looked as if he would not be coming to London at all. Whisper, who is getting on a bit, had been poorly with bad legs and tendinitis until a new vet helped get her back to form. It is not known, however, whether he also managed to cure her of her phobia of big screens: after finishing 35th in the individual dressage in Beijing, Hoketsu pointed the finger at technology. &quot;My horse just hates to see that moving screen,&quot; he said. Whisper seemed to have no such problems on Thursday afternoon and her rider blamed any failings on himself. &quot;I made two or three mistakes, which I shouldn&apos;t have, so I&apos;m not totally happy, but it wasn&apos;t terribly bad,&quot; he said after the event. And the crowd, he added, had been &quot;very good&quot;. Asked what motivated him to carry on competing six decades after he first climbed on to a horse, Hoketsu laughed. &quot;Probably the biggest motivation for me [is to] feel I&apos;m improving,&quot; he said. &quot;I think if I feel, &apos;OK, I&apos;m getting worse than before,&apos; I will stop.&quot; He had, he said, noticed a cultural shift in the Games since he came 40th in the showjumping in his native Tokyo in 1964. &quot;The Olympic Games itself has changed a little bit,&quot; he said. &quot;At that time, participation was of more importance to everybody. But now I think medals are much more important, not only for athletes but also even for politics.&quot; His life, too, he said, had also changed rather a lot. Had he given as many interviews at the Games 49 years ago? He smiled again. &quot;No, no, no, no. Fortunately not.&quot; Faced with the inevitable question of whether this would be his last games, or whether he intended to return at Rio aged 75, he paused for an instant. &quot;No. I want to but I don&apos;t think I can because it&apos;s very difficult to find a horse to bring me to Brazil,&quot; he said. &quot;My present horse is too old for that.&quot; Present.

David Cameron backed his chancellor on Thursday, insisting he was &quot;not going anywhere&quot; after calls for Osborne to be replaced following U-turns after his unpopular budget and questions about the government&apos;s growth strategy. Osborne highlighted one of the central features of his budget in front of his international audience on Friday, pointing to his decision to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p. He said the government was making &quot;bold changes&quot; to the tax system. &quot;We have introduced the most generous early-stage investment tax breaks in any country in the world,&quot; he added. The event was the latest in a series of 17 summits being staged in London over the next month \u2013 tailored to different parts of the world and different industrial sectors \u2013 as the government seeks to exploit the presence of scores of heads of government and state for the Olympics to raise at least \u00a31bn of inward investment.

GREE also aims to open a new game development studio in the UK.

And that&apos;s why we will continue to do everything we can to help technology investors and entrepreneurs invest, innovate and succeed in the UK.&quot; Osborne gave his address as he was urged to step up investment in projects to boost growth, amid warnings from a leading economic thinktank that Britain&apos;s GDP will shrink by 0.5% in 2012. The prediction by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) was down sharply from its May forecast for zero growth, issued before the publication of official figures showing the economy contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2012 alone. NIESR also downgraded its forecast for UK growth in 2013 from 2% to 1.3% and said the &quot;jubilee effect&quot; reduced growth this spring by 0.4%. The thinktank said Osborne had &quot;scope for a less aggressive path of fiscal tightening&quot; and should consider stepping up investment in big projects to boost growth. The report also found that the government&apos;s decision to implement austerity immediately after it came to power may have cost the country a total of 16.5% in GDP growth over a decade \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a3239bn in 2010 prices. If the chancellor had waited to introduce his deficit reduction package of cuts and tax rises until 2014, by which time the recovery that began in 2010 would have been &quot;well under way&quot;, he could have avoided this year&apos;s double-dip recession, said NIESR&apos;s experts."}, {"sentences": ["His comments came in the keynote address of the World Cities Culture Summit on 1 August at London&apos;s City Hall, which saw the launch of the World Cities Culture Report 2012, an international survey analysing the range of cultural assets and activities that are produced and consumed in 12 major cities: Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, London, Mumbai, New York, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.", "And Yusaku Imamura from Tokyo Metropolitan Government explained how the 2011 Japanese earthquake prompted a reappraisal of values and culture to be put at the heart of its future revival as reflected in its cultural infrastructure and participation."], "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Policy", "Finance", "Leadership"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-03T16:38:00Z", "title": "World Cities Culture: a tale of 12 cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/03/world-cities-culture-summit-report", "article": "What makes a world city? According to British Museum director Neil MacGregor, it&apos;s not cultural integration in London&apos;s case, but a determined fostering of diversity. His comments came in the keynote address of the World Cities Culture Summit on 1 August at London&apos;s City Hall, which saw the launch of the World Cities Culture Report 2012, an international survey analysing the range of cultural assets and activities that are produced and consumed in 12 major cities: Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, London, Mumbai, New York, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. The report, produced by BOP consulting, is a substantial body of knowledge, packed full of revealing statistics and newly gathered data as well as pen portraits of each city alongside commentary to contextualise the findings. Its conclusion: that alongside finance and commerce, culture is the defining cornerstone that establishes a city as a powerhouse within the global economic system. The crux of the summit was MacGregor&apos;s compelling keynote. The British Museum is currently the most visited museum in the UK, attracting more than 5.8 million visitors in the past year. While some might say the British Museum was born out of empire, we were reminded how the museum was established as a consequence of the first global economy in the mid-18th century as a place where any global citizen can visit to gain insight on the interconnected network of human cultures throughout history. World cities are able to support the widest range of cultural activity because of their scale and diversity of people. Instead of forcing cultural integration, suggested MacGregor, London fosters diversity, enabling multiple cultural heritage identities to co-exist, producing art that is unique yet none-the-less inherently British. Hybridised art forms then emerge when ideas are blended together fuelled by their constantly changing populations and international connections \u2013 this forward-thinking approach is not a new argument but one that is more likely to succeed if universally embraced. MacGregor&apos;s words resonate in the context of London 2012. The opening ceremony of the Olympics was a celebration of the rich and continuously evolving nature of our cultural landscape. London is proudly portraying itself as a dynamic and heterogeneous environment where innovation thrives. MacGregor also emphasised that having a strong leader who enables a city to be cosmopolitan is crucial \u2013 commercial exchange and cultural exchange go hand in hand and it is the leader of a world city who lies at the helm of these transactions. Even if he gets stuck on a zip-wire from time to time. Boris Johnson wasn&apos;t there to personally enjoy the summit but MacGregor did show us a colourful PowerPoint slide show that included the Tower of Babel, ancient Vienna and images of the London mayor juxtaposed with other historical leader figures. It went down a treat with delegates and removed the impression that this event was simply a cheer-leading exercise. The ensuring plenary sessions reflected the nuances of different national cultural policies. Dr Bilgili, director of Istanbul&apos;s provincial directorate of culture and tourism acknowledged the challenge of balancing tradition with modernity and ensuring that both are valued in the context of Istanbul&apos;s young dynamic population and its rich history and architecture. Kate Levin, commissioner from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs explained the heavy investment in the arts and culture is most likely to be sustained through continued public-private investment and endowments from wealthy philanthropists. Professor Huang, vice-president of Shanghai Theatre Academy touched on how the city embeds culture in public policy via a five-year development plan that aims to use culture as a way of positioning the city as a global metropolis by 2020. Culture is viewed as a source of cohesion in China&apos;s rapidly changing environment. Rachel Healy, head of culture for the city of Sydney, highlighted they have more festivals and events than any other &apos;World City&apos; and this boosts other economic areas, for instance outdoor dining, in Australia&apos;s rich informal culture. And Yusaku Imamura from Tokyo Metropolitan Government explained how the 2011 Japanese earthquake prompted a reappraisal of values and culture to be put at the heart of its future revival as reflected in its cultural infrastructure and participation. Delegates to the summit arrived a day earlier to sample the treasures of London&apos;s cultural sector. Their itinerary included tours of the Royal Opera House and the fantastic Thomas Heatherwick exhibition at the V&amp;A. Invited guests on the day included the great and good of London&apos;s flagship art institutions, including the Royal Opera House, National Portrait Gallery, National Theatre and the London 2012 Festival. London based arts organisations will be able to see where they feature in the World Cities report and which matrices they contribute to. For instance London has over 1,000 museums and art galleries \u2013 more than the other world cities surveyed \u2013 and the highest level of attendance. Public participation in the arts is a key strength of the capital reflected across engagement with libraries, film and performance. Arts organisations now need to come together to absorb and reflect upon the findings and perhaps use as a goal post for future activities. The summit signalled a desire to cement closer co-operation between the partner cities and there was also talk of expanding the membership of the forum to other world cities wishing to join. The intention is to update the data every three years and rotate future summits between forum members. In the meantime global culture will continue to be shaped by world cities, each with their own individual strengths and each serving as inspiration to the others.

After a simple lunch at the only restaurant in the tiny village \u2013 fried rice, and miso soup with fish and vegetables \u2013 we trotted out one of our few Japanese phrases. &quot;Gochi so sama deshita.&quot; (Thank you, that was a feast.) The cook beamed and said something to our guide. His English was not much better than our Japanese, but technology came to our aid. Tapping his phone he showed us on screen the translation of the cook&apos;s words: &quot;Did you like it?&quot; To smiles all round, we managed unaided a one-word reply: hai (yes). Such minimal communication felt very special: this was the wildest corner of the wildest island in Japan, Iriomote. Why would anyone speak English? The pearl-farming village of Funauki is home to about 50 people, and reached by ferry across a bay from the small port of Shirahama, where the island&apos;s only road runs out. The boat trip takes about 15 minutes but to walk around the bay would, we&apos;re told, take three days of hacking through jungle. This place would probably be worth a three-day hike, though. Iriomote is the biggest, but least densely populated, of Japan&apos;s Yaeyama islands, about 1,200 miles south-west of Tokyo, and much closer to Taiwan than the Japanese mainland. Much of the island is national park, and covered in jungle and mangrove swamps. The western peninsula, on which Funauki sits, is ringed with white-sand beaches, like a scalloped necklace. The closest, Ida, is about a 10-minute walk along a jungle path from the village: dense trees running right down to a perfect coral-strewn shore and clear warm sea. But this was just nibbling at the edges: on our second day on Iriomote, tour operator Inside Japan Tours, which has launched holidays to the region, had arranged something more adventurous for my husband and me. Climbing into one-man kayaks at Funaura Bay, where two broad brown rivers empty into a wide delta, we headed inland. We were aiming for the 55m-high Pinaisara waterfall, the highest in the region, but our eyes were initially fixed on what was closer to hand: mangroves on leggy stilt roots above ground teeming with fiddler crabs, waving their oversized right claws, hermit crabs of all sizes and thousands of mudskippers \u2013 little fish that can walk on land and breathe air. Though it felt intrepid, kayaking on the rising tide in warm sunshine was easy and peaceful, and soon we were tying up at the base of the waterfall for a dip. Pinaisara means white beard: the falls are supposed to look like the long whiskers of an old man. Climbing to its top was more of a challenge, the narrow path so steep in one place that we had to haul ourselves up on a knotted rope.     Liz Boulter kayaking at Funaura Bay. Photograph: Rachelle Rimmer    Our guide, Nao, had promised lunch at the top. We gazed down at the vertiginous drop of white water, and then out at the jungle, the ribbon of river we had kayaked along, the beach, the ocean and a couple of white-rimmed islands in the distance, and meanwhile Nao did a Mary Poppins act with his rucksack. Out came a camping stove and gas bottle, a little folding windshield, pans, water, bowls, chopsticks and food in packets and boxes. His hot noodle soup with pork, spring onions and pickled ginger may not have been the most elaborate meal we had in Japan, but it was the most welcome. For dessert he produced &quot;lollipops&quot; of super-chilled pineapples on sticks. The delicious local pineapples are the size of a large apple: grown on patches of cultivated land by the coast, they stick up from their bushes like toilet brushes. Iriomote&apos;s coast is glorious, with dark green cliffs and headlands plunging to blue seas, but its few small settlements are very different. We were surprised to find buildings of solid grey concrete, a youth hostel that looked like a detention centre, and a similarly depressing feel at the island&apos;s onsen, or hot spring, the most southerly in Japan \u2013 though apparently inside it is lovely. There are two reasons for this style of building: typhoons and diving. From June to September, the islands are regularly hit by tropical cyclones blowing up from the Philippines. Sturdiness, in building design, wins out over aesthetics. And until recently, the few tourists in Iriomote tended to be scuba divers \u2013 passionate about undersea worlds, less so about where they lay their heads. But that is changing: Hoshino Resort Nirakanai is the island&apos;s first luxury hotel, a Bali-esque retreat with 141 rooms, pool, spa and other facilities. We were more taken with our billet, the 15-room Eco Village. My Guardianista ears pricked up at the word eco, but there&apos;s nothing particularly green about this hotel \u2013 it claims the monicker because it is &quot;immersed in nature&quot;, on a deserted beach 40 minutes&apos; drive from the main port. While husband tested the wicker lounger on our wide veranda, I wandered through unfenced lawns past the pool to the sea, picking up bits of broken coral from the sand, watched by crows and a family of goats. The restaurant at Eco Village is particularly fine: each dinner was a stunning array of dishes, some delightfully moreish, such as pork with black sesame and island vegetables; others were just strange, such as raw pig&apos;s ear (like chewing rubber bands). Breakfasts were only a little less elaborate. The main Yaeyama island, Ishigaki, where the airport is located, is a similar mix of tropical lushness and workaday architecture. Ishigaki City, the capital, has a laid-back friendly feel, and is a contrast after frenetic Tokyo. Stallholders in the covered market urged us to try sugar cane candy (yum), sweetmeats made with the ubiquitous purple sweet potato (don&apos;t bother) and salt ice-cream that it would be worth travelling 6,000 miles to taste. Young staff at a downtown restaurant did their best, despite the language barrier. Out came the phone again \u2013 we&apos;d have soba (buckwheat noodles) kitsune (fried), not zaru (chilled). We were then pressed to join in a session with a local folk-singer on his banjo-like sanshin. Diners clacked little castanet-like mittsu instruments, everyone swigging beers to regular shouts of &quot;kampai&quot; (cheers). We&apos;d arrived at our hotel, Nagura Cottages, on a quiet stretch of Ishigaki&apos;s east coast, late and hungry a couple of days earlier. Checking in, I had asked the manager if there was a restaurant near by. We must have looked stricken when he told us no, because he added, &quot;There is me. I can do dinner.&quot; While we settled into our room, in a villa across the courtyard, Sadoyama got busy behind the bar with knives and pans, and within 20\u00a0minutes was serving us a four-course meal that included goya \u2013 a bitter gourd pickled to sweet, spicy, sour crunchiness \u2013 and what looked like a mound of lettuce with tomato sauce, but turned out to hide a tangle of tasty shredded pork on a bed of rice. We&apos;d started with bottles of local Ji beer (chilled, but darker than lager) and when Sadoyama brought us, unbidden, two large glasses of the rice spirit awamori, clinking with ice, the evening took on a pleasant glow. Nagura Cottages opened four years ago to cater for scuba divers and is more basic than Eco Village, but with quirky touches such as pretty origami birds, made by Sadoyama in moments when reception&apos;s a bit quiet.     A lighthouse on Ishigaki island. Photograph: Alamy    In stark contrast to the other islands we&apos;d seen, tiny Taketomi, a 10-minute ferry ride from Ishigaki, looks much as it did when it was part of the Ryukyu kingdom, which ruled these islands until ousted by the Japanese in 1879. Preservation orders have safeguarded a central village of traditional one-storey houses, red tile roofs sporting fierce lion-like shiza statues to ward off evil spirits. Each home sits in a plot of land entirely enclosed by sturdy stone walls \u2013 it&apos;s a bit like the Yorkshire Dales gone mad. On the edge of the village we stopped in the flowery garden of a minshuku, (guesthouse) run by a wacky old lady with a towel round her head. We only ordered soft drinks, but she proudly brought out a little dish of pickled green vegetables and another of home-grown tomatoes in a sesame dressing that was so delicious \u2013 barioishi, the Japanese equivalent, we managed to say \u2013 that I don&apos;t think olive oil and balsamic will ever quite cut it in future. One way of getting around traffic-free Taketomi \u2013 it&apos;s an oval about 2km by 3km \u2013 is on a cart drawn by patient water buffalo, but we rented bikes for the short ride to Kaiji beach in the south-east. This is one of the islands&apos; &quot;star&quot; attractions \u2013 literally. The sand here is not ground-up rock, but the five-pointed skeletons of millions of crustaceans barely a millimetre in diameter. You really are walking on tiny white stars. The ocean views, shady trees and warm, pale turquoise water are pretty amazing too. But what&apos;s under the sea is obviously the main draw here, so at Umicoza Diving School, back on Ishigaki, we pulled on wetsuits and fins and took a dive boat out into stunning Kabira Bay \u2013 the multi-hued water dotted with rocky islets like a mini version of Vietnam&apos;s Ha Long Bay (but without the crowds). The couple of qualified divers on the boat tipped off backwards to descend on to the reef, but in these shallow waters we saw just as much with mask and snorkel. Convoluted coral in blue, green, yellow, white \u2013 though never pink \u2013 and most of the cast of Finding Nemo: triggerfish with white spots on their bellies and perfectly applied luminous yellow lipstick, emperor angelfish in vivid blue and yellow stripes, as well as the famous orange- and white-striped clownfish. We then climbed back into the boat to head for Manta Point, a little to the west. This is a world-renowned diving spot, where Pacific manta rays of up to four metres across gather to feed on the blooming plankton. Far from deterring them, the presence of divers seems to attract these giants \u2013 one theory is the air bubbles tickle a manta&apos;s skin. We jumped in and swam about for a bit, but we were unlucky. No mantas showed. We were not about to complain: the Yaeyamas had already given us so much. The Japanese word for plenty or enough is yoku, and to have griped about not getting more would just have been yokubari \u2013 greedy."}, {"sentences": ["It also does help that the athletes are getting a fairly healthy wind behind them on the home straight.&quot; Quizzed on whether a track can ever be too fast Edwards said the theme brought to mind the controversy over Tokyo&apos;s 1991 World Championships track which was alleged never to have been approved by the sport&apos;s global governing body, the IAAF."], "tags": ["Usain Bolt", "Olympics 2012: athletics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Jamaica Olympic team", "Tyson Gay", "Sport", "Athletics", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-04T17:45:48Z", "title": "Usain Bolt primed for fastest 100m final in history at London 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/usain-bolt-100m-london-20121", "article": "In the buildup to these Olympic Games all talk of the men&apos;s 100m focused on who would win: Usain Bolt, the defending Olympic champion, or Yohan Blake, world champion, young upstart and the man who comprehensively beat Bolt over 100m and 200m before these championships. But after two days of competition in the Olympic stadium in which crowds have witnessed blisteringly fast times run on the London track, there seems to be a new question on everyone&apos;s lips: no matter who wins it, how fast will he go? The triple world record holder Bolt has always maintained that he believes 9.4sec is possible, having already recorded 9.58 at the 2009 world championships in Berlin. This season Bolt has not looked so imperious, with Blake occupying the No1 spot in the world rankings for his Olympic trials-winning 9.75. Indeed the men&apos;s 100m field is looking its most diversely competitive in years \u2013 even leaving Bolt and Blake aside, five other sprinters have run sub-9.90 times this season in Justin Gatlin, Asafa Powell, Keston Bledman, Ryan Bailey and Tyson Gay. Such is the depth of talent that there is even talk of the Olympic final being the first in which all eight sprinters run under 10 seconds. In short, there is a good chance that 80,000 spectators could be about to witness a world record in the distance. Already the crowds have been wowed. In only the first round of the men&apos;s 100m, and despite slowing at the line, the former Olympic champion Gatlin did 9.97, the fastest time in Olympic history for that stage of the competition. In the following heat the American&apos;s team-mate, Bailey, went faster, winning his heat in a personal best of 9.88 \u2013 joint-10th fastest time in the world this season. The previous day there were 15 personal bests in the women&apos;s heptathlon hurdles while in the first round of the women&apos;s 100m six women ran sub-11 second times. Even the athletes themselves were somewhat taken aback. &quot;It was surprisingly easy,&quot; said Bailey, despite what he described as a slow start. &quot;This track is super fast,&quot; said Gay, the second fastest man in history. While Dwain Chambers, the Briton who had not been unable to meet the Olympic A qualifying standard of 10.18 this season \u2013 his best ahead of these Games was 10.25 to win the Olympic trials in Birmingham \u2013 ran over two-tenths of a second faster to win his heat in 10.02. &quot;I don&apos;t know where 10.02 came from,&quot; admitted the 34-year-old. &quot;I&apos;ve been running 10.2 all summer, but I know that isn&apos;t me. I&apos;ve just put it together at the right time, but I wasn&apos;t expecting to run that fast.&quot; Could the answer, in part, be something to do with the use of groundbreaking technology improving an athlete&apos;s speed on the track? At the Olympic test event, in January, Britain&apos;s Harry Aikines-Aryeetey spoke about what he believed to be a unique track surface. Wherever he competes, the former world junior 100m champion takes a cricket ball to test the track for hardness \u2013 for which read, in general terms, speed. &quot;On a normal track it bounces to knee height. On [the London] Mondo track it comes up to your hip, so everything you put into it you get back&quot; said Aikines-Aryeetey. So is this London track distorting results? &quot;It&apos;s certainly fast,&quot; said the triple jump world record holder Jonathan Edwards. &quot;But then it&apos;s always been something that happens in championships that tracks are fast, and in London that certainly seems to be the case. It also does help that the athletes are getting a fairly healthy wind behind them on the home straight.&quot; Quizzed on whether a track can ever be too fast Edwards said the theme brought to mind the controversy over Tokyo&apos;s 1991 World Championships track which was alleged never to have been approved by the sport&apos;s global governing body, the IAAF. At those championships three world records were set, Carl Lewis in the 100m, Mike Powell in the long jump \u2013 breaking Bob Beamon&apos;s 1968 leap to record a distance of 8.95m \u2013 and the men&apos;s 4x100m relay. Even Bolt has dismissed fast tracks before. Last year at the Diamond League in Eugene there were nine sub-10 second runs from the world record holder&apos;s rivals, prompting scorn from the Jamaican. &quot;Listen to me ppl [people],&quot; Bolt tweeted, &quot;that&apos;s the same track last US trial was kept and everybody ran fast and them they couldn&apos;t repeat ok so please.&quot; If fast times continue to be posted during these Games, could there come a point when spectators wonder if a track can be too fast? &quot;No, I don&apos;t think people would think that,&quot; said Edwards. &quot;They&apos;d celebrate the moment, if Bolt runs 9.4, or Blake runs 9.4 I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s going to say, &apos;Oh, it was a fast track, it doesn&apos;t count.&apos; I don&apos;t think so.&quot; Edwards pauses. &quot;Unless, almost like those [now banned] swimsuits, if people start breaking lots of world records, but we&apos;re a long way away from that yet.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Since 1962 every poll has featured Kurosawa, Mizoguchi or Ozu, with the last named now in third place with Tokyo Story, one of the most affecting movies of family life and ageing ever made."], "tags": ["Film", "Alfred Hitchcock", "Culture", "James Stewart", "Ingmar Bergman", "Vertigo"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-04T23:05:00Z", "title": "How Hitchcock's Vertigo eventually topped the Sight & Sound critics' poll", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/05/sight-sound-best-film-poll-2012", "article": "In the early 1950s, the British Film Institute was transformed by Denis Forman and Gavin Lambert. Forman was appointed director of the BFI in 1948, and one year later, he invited Lambert to edit what Lambert recalled as &quot;the institute&apos;s terminally boring magazine Sight &amp; Sound and bring it back to life&quot;. Both left the institute in 1955, Forman to help create Granada TV, Lambert to become a Hollywood screenwriter and novelist, and by then the National\u00a0Film Theatre had been established on the South Bank, and Sight &amp; Sound had become one of the world&apos;s pre-eminent film journals. Among Lambert&apos;s innovations was a worldwide poll of critics to vote each decade on the top 10 films of all time, an immense undertaking that utilises the resources of the BFI and depends on the authority of Sight &amp; Sound. The results of the seventh and largest poll were announced on Wednesday to a gathering waiting with bated breath at the now rather grand BFI Southbank complex (formerly the National Film Theatre), and they&apos;re published in the redesigned September edition of Sight &amp; Sound (in 1952 a quarterly costing 3/6 \u2013 17\u00bdp; since 1990 a monthly now priced at \u00a34.50). In 1962, when there were few books on the cinema, no film schools, and virtually the only way to see a movie was in a picture house or at a film club; all 10 films were in black and white. Six were silent (two of them by Chaplin), Robert Flaherty&apos;s tedious Louisiana Story was the single docudrama, and there were just two postwar movies, Lean&apos;s Brief Encounter and De Sica&apos;s Bicycle Thieves, a key movie in the influential neo-realist style. Fifty years later, with film schools everywhere and 115 years of movies easily available to scholars and fans alike, the only surviving film from the first list is Dreyer&apos;s Joan of Arc, one of three silent pictures. The most surprising inclusion is the documentary Man with a Movie Camera by the Soviet theorist who styled himself Dziga Vertov (Russian for spinning top). Vertov&apos;s film is as dazzling, obscure and avant-garde as on the day it was made, and somewhat less accessible than such masterly movies as On the Waterfront and 12\u00a0Angry Men, photographed in America by his brother, Boris Kaufman. The 1962 list represented the orthodox canon of that day. The 10 top films chosen in 2012 by 846 critics (of whom I was one) are the tip of an iceberg formed by the 1,045 nominated movies, and they reflect a new orthodoxy of sorts. Over six decades a new cinematic canon has been developing and changing, and it is less fluctuating and more conservative than one might have predicted. Neo-realism has come and gone, as has the new Italian cinema that followed in the form of Antonioni&apos;s L&apos;avventura, which in 1962 got on the list in second place a little less than two years after being greeted with uncomprehending derision at Cannes. Ingmar Bergman, too, has also been and gone, possibly because votes were divided between a string of his masterpieces. The same is true of the French new wave, with neither Truffaut nor Godard reaching the top 10. Japanese cinema was unknown until Rashomon took a major prize at Venice in 1951 and helped heal the wounds created by the second world war. Since 1962 every poll has featured Kurosawa, Mizoguchi or Ozu, with the last named now in third place with Tokyo Story, one of the most affecting movies of family life and ageing ever made. In 1962, Citizen Kane suddenly took over the first position, with Renoir&apos;s La R\u00e8gle du jeu close behind. Then, in 1982, Hitchcock&apos;s Vertigo joined the list after spending years out of distribution and available only in bootleg prints. This year, not entirely surprisingly, it became substantially pre-eminent. All three movies were box-office failures in their day, and it needed the polemical magazine Movie in the early 1960s to establish the reputation of Hitchcock as a personal director of great depth rather than just the &quot;master of suspense&quot;, which he called himself, or merely a gifted entertainer, which was Sight &amp; Sound&apos;s view of his achievement. The first book on Hitchcock in English was by a key Movie contributor, Robin Wood, published in 1965 and initially reviewed by a single national paper, the Observer. The 30 pages the September Sight &amp; Sound devotes to the poll make for a fascinating read. So many of the great masters \u2013 Wilder, Lang, Eisenstein, Peckinpah, Almod\u00f3var, for instance \u2013 fail to make the cut, though in some cases only just. There&apos;s not a single 21st-century picture in the new list. The nearest any gets is Wong Kar-Wai&apos;s In the Mood for Love at 24, and David Lynch&apos;s Mulholland Drive at 28. Since 1992, the critics&apos; poll has been accompanied by a parallel top 10 chosen by directors, which also contains nothing from this century. Interestingly, Michael Mann picked two pictures from the 21st century, but they didn&apos;t get on to the winning list. One was James Cameron&apos;s Avatar, which (in an accompanying note) he calls &quot;a brilliant synthesis of mythic tropes&quot;. I first voted in 1972 when I was in my late 30s. My 10 films included Citizen Kane, La R\u00e8gle du jeu and Battleship Potemkin, which all made the top 10 list that year, unlike my other choices, which were Buster Keaton&apos;s The General, Francesco Rosi&apos;s Salvatore Giuliano, Kurosawa&apos;s Ikiru, Hitchcock&apos;s The Lady Vanishes, Ford&apos;s Stagecoach, Kelly and Donen&apos;s Singin&apos; in the Rain and Bergman&apos;s Winter Light. This year (which even an apprentice actuary would tell you is likely to be my last) I decided to make a defiantly different choice of current favourites.

How long will it be before pink paper and pounding presses are mere memories? Now, with subscriptions swelling, the FT looks far better placed for such online transition, a digital trailblazer by choice rather than force of circumstance. Yet hang around for a few more earthbound moments. Nobody, to be honest, can be quite sure yet what such progress means in hard cash terms: the Columbia Journalism Review punches whatever numbers it can find and pronounces FT accounting somewhat &quot;opaque&quot;. It&apos;s fashionable enough for struggling publications to talk of going online-only. Newsweek hinted at just that transition the other day. But digital existence can also be low profile, going on totally obscure. As predicted, Rupert Murdoch&apos;s tablet newspaper The Daily is finding cyberspace a cruel pool for making a splash: no news-stand visibility, no TV or radio summaries, no copies passed from hand to hand. A third of The Daily&apos;s staff were laid off last week. It&apos;s no accident that big digital advertising launches still happen on posters, TV or via print. And FT editions on newsprint or online are complementary, one defined by familiarity with the other so that, as you sit at your screen in Singapore or Tokyo, the FT you scan there is given a special value by the personality and record of the paper version you can also buy. John Ridding, the FT&apos;s buoyant chief executive, may see a long-term strategy working, but he bridles at the thought of the paper being put to death. On the contrary, digital success had given it &quot;a new lease of life&quot; he told the Guardian last week. Remember, too, that the FT&apos;s closest competitor, the Wall Street Journal \u2013 is big in print and big behind a paywall: 2.1m copies purchased, one way or another, every weekday. Of course the Journal is benefiting from rolling its print and digital reach together, claiming convincingly that it is America&apos;s top-selling newspaper: but there&apos;s no sign of Mr M falling out of love with presses or satellite printing there. Would a digital-only FT be able to compete with an all-singing, all-dancing Journal? Could it keep a separate identity in a new world where Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters are the biggest beasts? And how will it cope with a declining but still crucial print sale as real transition starts to bite? It&apos;s easy to talk about moving from one world to another.

But his failures were a distant memory when he leapt to glory to win a gold medal in front of a home crowd \u2013 becoming the first British man to take the title in nearly 50 years. The Milton Keynes-born athlete added to Team GB&apos;s gold medal tally with a 8.31m jump on what was a glorious night in British sporting history. The joint British record holder has had a rollercoaster journey to glory after suffering major setbacks through injury. Last year, he said the fitness problems that hindered his career had left him feeling at an all-time low and he considered giving up. But all this was behind him as he triumphed at the Olympic Stadium, finishing ahead of Australia&apos;s Mitchell Watt, who recorded 8.16m to take silver. Rutherford, 25, had shown natural sporting talent from an early age. As a teenager, he spent six months on trial at Aston Villa football club, following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, Jock Rutherford, who played for Newcastle United and Arsenal and won League Championship and FA Cup medals. But it was in the long jump that he showed the most promise and, in 2005, he won the AAA Championships before going on to win gold at the European Junior Championships with a 8.14m jump. In 2006, he won silver at the European Championships in Gothenburg, but was forced to miss almost all of the 2007 season through injury. He only managed to finish 10th in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but went on to break the British record with a jump of 8.30m at the World Championships a year later, beating rival Chris Tomlinson&apos;s mark by one centimetre. But injury came back to haunt him in 2010 when he was ruled out of the European Championships with a foot problem. He went on to miss a place in the final of the World Championships a year later after suffering a hamstring injury during the qualifying round. After adapting his jumping style to imitate four-times Olympics long jump champion Carl Lewis, Rutherford equalled the British record with a world-leading 8.35m jump in May 2012, equalling the mark set by Tomlinson the previous year. It meant he was a strong contender for a medal in the London 2012 games. The rest is now Olympic history.

Nissan has promised that its new London taxi, a van-like vehicle, can eliminate 20% of the capital&apos;s exhaust pollution caused by its 22,000 black cabs. But the carmaker warned that it was now down to politicians to make electric traffic a practical reality. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, has pledged that a zero-emission taxi fleet will be in service by 2020, although London assembly members have queried the slow rate of installing charging points for electric vehicles. The NV200 taxi will also be produced in a diesel engine version that Nissan claims is 50% more fuel-efficient than existing cabs. The vehicle retains the distinguishing features of London cabs \u2013 the for-hire light and the 25-foot turning circle reportedly required to drive to the Savoy hotel&apos;s front door \u2013 but also has aesthetically questionable tinted sunroofs and sliding doors. The taxis, expected to be on general sale to cabbies by 2014, will be built in Barcelona but the electric versions will have the batteries and motors produced in Sunderland. Andy Palmer, executive vice-president of Nissan, said the vehicles had a potential range of 200 miles a day, based on an overnight charge and a 30-minute fast charge at one of the anticipated future network of charging points. While Nissan is also adapting the same model for Tokyo and for New York&apos;s yellow fleet, it held out the prospect of London&apos;s hackney carriages winning the race for a fully electric future. Palmer said: &quot;The ball was in the manufacturers&apos; court. Now it&apos;s with the cities to see who can get the infrastructure in place. &quot;Charging is the big question. This needs collaboration with government and the authorities to get the range you need. &quot;The ENV200 will have a range of 200 miles but that relies on having chargers in the right place. There&apos;s a lot of work to be done.&quot; Despite the possible public perception that London&apos;s cabbies may not be the most ardent environmentalists, taxi drivers&apos; representatives were enthusiastic about an electric fleet, and not just because Nissan has promised to price its vehicle below those built by rivals the London Taxi Company and Mercedes. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers&apos; Association, said: &quot;People think &apos;Ah, cabbies, they don&apos;t care&apos;, but we sit in traffic all day. We sit in more pollution than anyone.&quot; He said the lack of noise from electric vehicles was the &quot;real competitive edge&quot; for drivers. &quot;They&apos;re so quiet, it&apos;s so much more relaxing.&quot; However, he cautioned against anticipating a transformed experience: &quot;I can&apos;t promise you cheerful cabbies or interesting banter.

And I enjoyed it not least because I was finally able to watch the sport itself without the surrounding hype, the layers of commentary. For a moment there was only that pleasure special to sport: the spontaneity of a story being fashioned in front of your own eyes, once and once only (despite digital repeats), robustly itself and not pretending to be anything else. As a lover and student of sport for many decades, I don&apos;t need to be reminded how compelling sport can be. But I&apos;ve also learned what sport is not and that overstating or misstating its importance does it no favours. As one, the media are cajoling us into appropriate displays of Olympic enthusiasm, particularly in relation to British victories. Breathless BBC commentators reiterate the same round of superlatives \u2013 &quot;unbelievable&quot;, &quot;incredible&quot;, &quot;amazing,&quot; &quot;brilliant,&quot; &quot;unbelievable&quot; \u2013 telling us again and again how unique, how special, how extraordinary these Olympics are. It feels like they&apos;re the ones on performance-enhancing drugs, not the usually sober, poised and realistic competitors. Sadly, at the ExCel, after the refreshment of the boxing came the utterly formulaic torpor of a video package in which celebrities waxed banal on the &quot;atmosphere&quot; that makes the Olympics special and the &quot;unforgettable&quot; moment we&apos;re privileged to be part of. Sorry, but generally I prefer to decide for myself \u2013 or let time decide \u2013 if something I&apos;ve witnessed is unforgettable. Olympic competitions, like other sports competitions, as any sports fan knows, are not an uninterrupted succession of climactic highs. The boring and the (relatively) mediocre play a necessary role. Commentators and politicians rush to squeeze Olympic results into preferred narratives and to draw apposite moral lessons. These lessons are invariably platitudes that tell us little about either sport or the outside world. It&apos;s as if there&apos;s a fear of letting us exercise our own powers of interpretation. The paradox is that at the core of the micro-managed Olympic spectacle is a phenomenon whose essence is its unpredictability, its uncontrollability, its sublime indifference to all extraneous narratives. Sport, even encased in the Olympic armour, retains an autonomy; each competition operates under impersonal self-contained laws. Unlike art, or the opening ceremony, sport cannot be orchestrated. Indeed, that&apos;s a condition of its legitimacy. It does not unfold according to a preconceived scenario, or illustrate a preconceived &quot;lesson&quot;. Once the gun is fired or the clock starts, competitors are subject only to the egalitarian law of the level playing field, something otherwise conspicuously absent in our world. This is why we celebrate a Jesse Owens, an Abebe Bikila, a Cathy Freeman \u2013 because they used the level playing field to overturn (for a moment) historical hierarchies. The Olympic hype has helped me understand an observation made by the philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. Under the old regime, he says, the command was &quot;Thou shalt not&quot;, whereas under the new it&apos;s &quot;Thou shalt&quot; \u2013 a ceaseless injunction to enjoy, consume, spend, celebrate. Or as Olympic sponsor Nike says, &quot;Just do it&quot;. All of which is in its own way as oppressive and self-distorting as the old prohibitions. I&apos;ve been an Olympics follower since the Tokyo games of 1964 but I perfectly understand that many people do not share my interest, and there is no civic requirement for them to do so. The Olympic boosterism treats competitive sport as something it is not and never should be \u2013 mandatory. To be itself, sport needs to be a freedom exercised, an option not an obligation. The injunction to &quot;stop moaning&quot; or &quot;whingeing&quot; should be roundly rejected, not least by genuine sports fans. The issues raised by the Olympics are not trivial: security in the context of the war on terror and the erosion of civil liberties; outsourcing and privatisation; the global ethics of giant corporations; the colonisation of the public realm through the super-enforcement of intellectual property rights; the subordination of local needs to the imperatives of global capital. These are not peripheral questions that can be wished away, and the success or failure of British competitors or of &quot;London 2012&quot; as a one-off event will have no bearing on any of them. Sport does offer a kind of escape, an alternative, exterior focus (like Shakespeare, a Twilight movie, or a game show). But it is not a vacation from critical thought. I find no difficulty thoroughly enjoying the best of the competition without compromising for a moment a necessarily critical perspective on what the Olympic enterprise has become. \u2022 A longer version of this article can be found at mikemarqusee.com"}, {"sentences": ["As a global financial centre it and Tokyo are New York&apos;s only serious rivals and \u2013 as we have learned to our cost \u2013 it is less effectively policed by British regulators, notably the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority (FSA)."], "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Regulators", "Business", "US news", "World news", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-07T11:45:45Z", "title": "Standard Chartered affair has a whiff of US hypocrisy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-affair-whiff-hypocrisy", "article": "On a day like this when another British bank faces accusations of serious wrongdoing by a regulator in the United States, it&apos;s worth remembering that, for all its talk of level playing fields and open trading, the US has always practised a robust form of economic nationalism. Foreigners are often expected to do as Uncle Sam says, not as Sam does. In the 19th and early 20th century Uncle Sam was and remains pretty good at the very economic protectionism it deplores in others. General Motors (GM) is in court in its home state of Michigan this week, accused of driving Saab into bankruptcy for competitive reasons by its former Swedish owners. Let&apos;s stick to banks. Standard Chartered, the Asia-focused but London-based British bank, clearly has some serious questions to answer about its dealings with Iran, in which a little-known US regulator (there are so many) called the New York state department of financial services (NYDFS) alleges it hid \u00a3160bn worth of transactions over a decade when international sanctions against Tehran were being tightened. The language deployed is hyperbolic \u2013 the US financial system has been left open to &quot;terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes&quot;, says the report from the NYDFS. A new and little-known player in the forest of publicity-hungry American regulators, it was created by the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, last year in what the FT calls &quot;a land grab&quot; from the state&apos;s attorney general (as distinct from the much more famous federal US attorney&apos;s office for the southern half of the empire state \u2013 the bit that covers Wall Street). The bank denies the charges, which relate to transactions that were not all necessarily illegal as such but required time-consuming notification to US authorities. It is something said to have been managed by removing codes \u2013 &quot;wire stripping&quot;, in the jargon \u2013 that identified them as Iranian money passing, albeit briefly, through the American banking system. It&apos;s all part of a bigger picture. Four foreign banks \u2013 Barclays, ING, Credit Suisse and Lloyds TSB \u2013 have paid US state and federal fines for evading sanctions without the case going to court. That&apos;s an American practice we don&apos;t have to admire: plea bargaining. At levels both high and low it often provides pretty rough justice. The context, of course, is the appalling recent record of London-based banks, banks often largely owned and run by Americans like Barclays&apos; Bob Diamond, I need hardly point out. Reckless lending practices and poor risk assessment pushed UK (and US) banking to the cliff&apos;s edge in 2008-9 and we are all paying the price in the protracted recession which followed. Last month Barclays was fingered for its role in rigging the London interbank rate (Libor) and HSBC was charged with systemic money laundering of Mexican drugs funds, both much more serious allegations. Other banks are likely to be affected. It&apos;s all awful. But London is a tempting target. As a global financial centre it and Tokyo are New York&apos;s only serious rivals and \u2013 as we have learned to our cost \u2013 it is less effectively policed by British regulators, notably the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority (FSA). JP Morgan traders and \u2013 in the 90s \u2013 those at Goldman Sachs got into trouble at the London end. So have French banks. So we have brought a lot of the trouble on ourselves by not enforcing rules and regulations. But let&apos;s not forget that American banks misbehaved on a heroic scale in the great disaster rooted in the sub-prime mortgage market (read Michael Lewis&apos;s The Big Short for a lively account, a good book for the beach) and that it was the Bush administration&apos;s failure to prevent the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 that brought the crisis to a head. US-based credit ratings agencies like Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s were asleep on the job \u2013 to put it kindly \u2013 during the boom and have been playing tough guy on the US and even German triple-A ratings ever since. Our time for a mauling will come, as Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury minister, appeared to admit this week. More than that, the US regulatory system, admirably robust in so many ways, is also highly fragmented and competitive. The NYDFS is a new kid on the block, so it may be trying to get a reputation at StanChart&apos;s expense. Congressional committees, industry regulators and even the Obama White House showed just how tempting a UK company can be when they lambasted BP \u2013 hey, let&apos;s make that BRITISH Petroleum \u2013 for its role in the Gulf oil spin. Two major US suppliers, Haliburton and Deepwater, were also heavily implicated. The case is still in the courts. We&apos;ll see how things turn out this time. StanChart had a good reputation and kept it during the financial crisis \u2013 until now. It boasts of having a more solid corporate culture. It says what it did was not illegal. Meanwhile its share price tanks on world markets. When dealing with sanctions against Iran, however, it&apos;s worth remembering one covert bit of sanctions-busting which was undoubtedly illegal. Back in the mid-80s the US, still smarting from the humiliating siege of its embassy in Tehran, devised a scheme to break the arms embargo against Iran by shipping weapons via Israel in return for the release of some remaining hostages. The Brits at the time were selling weapons to Iran&apos;s enemy, Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq: immoral but at least vaguely consistent, though Baghdad didn&apos;t pay its bills and we ended up fighting them too. Under President Ronald Reagan \u2013 literally so, since they worked in the White House basement \u2013 the likes of Colonel Oliver North, working in cahoots with Robert &quot;Bud&quot; MacFarlane, the national security adviser, evolved the Iran dodge into a money-raising scheme to fund the contra rebels against the leftwing Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. The Iran-Contra affair was secret too because Congress had explicitly banned such action. When it all came out, Reagan said he knew nothing (strangely believable, too) and got away with it. North was briefly a hero and they later renamed Washington&apos;s downtown airport after the president \u2013 who remains a much loved and iconic leader for the nostalgic American right. I hope the StanChart lawyers spare the time to refresh their memories."}, {"sentences": ["Coach Norio Sasaki said the women may now fly business class back to Tokyo."], "tags": ["Gender", "Equality", "Olympic Games 2012", "Japan", "Australia news", "Women's football", "Olympics 2012: basketball", "Olympics 2012: football", "Sport", "World news", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-07T16:42:07Z", "title": "London 2012: Japan and Australia review athletes' travel in gender equality row", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/london-2012-equality-japan-australia", "article": "When the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, declared at the opening ceremony that London 2012 was &quot;a major boost for gender equality&quot;, perhaps he had not heard that on their flights to London the Japanese women&apos;s football team and the Australian women&apos;s basketball team were relegated to economy class, while the men flew business. Still, hopes that this Olympics may yet live up to its billing as the &quot;equality games&quot; have been boosted as the Japanese Football Association (JFA) suggested its women footballers may get an upgrade on the way home, while Basketball Australia promised a review of Olympic travel policy. The JFA&apos;s treatment of its female team prompted outrage, in less than 24 hours more than 17,000 signed an online petition on the campaign website Change.org to push the JFA to change their minds. Or maybe they just stuck to a promise: after the row exploded the chairman stated that a business-class flight for the women &quot;would be considered for the women&apos;s team if they bring a medal home&quot;. On Monday, the Nadeshiko, as they are known, won 2-1 against France in the women&apos;s football semi-final, assuring themselves a place in the final on Thursday and at least a silver medal. Coach Norio Sasaki said the women may now fly business class back to Tokyo. &quot;The Japan Football Association is trying to work something out,&quot; Sasaki told Kyodo News. &quot;When we came here we came in premium economy and there wasn&apos;t a problem,&quot; he said. But critics will continue to question why the more successful women&apos;s team \u2013 they won the World Cup in Germany last year, bringing joy to a country still reeling from the tsumani which killed 20,000 people \u2013 were given places in economy while the men&apos;s squad relaxed in business class on the same plane. Asked about the situation at the time Homare Sawa, the star of Japan&apos;s women&apos;s football team and Fifa&apos;s 2011 world player of the year, told journalists: &quot;I guess it should have been the other way around. Even just in terms of age, we are senior.&quot; And the upgrade does not even appear to be in the bag. &quot;The problem is when we go back there will probably not be enough business seats available. If that&apos;s the case we will be in premium again,&quot; said Sasaki. &quot;If you look at the way we played then you will see that we are very patient and would put up with economy.&quot; The Japanese women, nicknamed Nadeshiko after a pink flower that symbolises femininity and grace in Japan, have shown no mercy in their quest to win gold. They beat Brazil 2-0 in the quarter-finals. The less successful men&apos;s team also reached the semi-finals, for the first time in 44 years, beating Egypt 3-0. They will now face Mexico on Tuesday. Sohko Fujimoto, 28, co-organiser of the petition on Change.org said the debate was an opportunity for the JFA to prove its commitment to women&apos;s sport in Japan. &quot;Whatever happens we&apos;ll be cheering on Nadeshiko on Thursday,&quot; she said. &quot;If the JFA lends an ear to the thousands of fans around the world who have backed our campaign, that would be a great result, and starting point, for women&apos;s soccer in both Japan and around the globe.&quot; There is also movement from Basketball Australia which was criticised for flying the male squad, known as the Boomers, in business class while the female squad, the Opals, flew economy. The Australian women have taken silver at the last three Games. The men have never won a medal. In a statement, Basketball Australia&apos;s acting CEO, Scott Derwin, promised a review of the travelling arrangements, which were a &quot;longstanding policy&quot;, with each team given a budget, over which they had control. He said that, historically, the Opals had been given more funding. However, he recognised that the furore had left the organisation open to claims of sexism. &quot;The simple fact is when a policy results in gender inequality, it&apos;s very clearly not the right policy going forward,&quot; he said. &quot;I am putting in place a review of our Olympic travel policy with the goal of ensuring there is equity between travel arrangements for the men&apos;s and women&apos;s teams attending future Olympics.&quot; Kristina Keneally, incoming CEO, welcomed the move. &quot;In this day and age, there&apos;s just no excuse for men&apos;s and women&apos;s sporting teams to be treated differently when they both compete at the same world class level.

So who are these cyclists, and how do they feel about cycling in London? The Dutch are, as expected, out in force, and during the Olympics get extra bike safety points with the neon orange outfits many supporters wear. The first cycling tourists I met were riding very attractive town bikes provided by OV-Fiets, a scheme owned by the Dutch Railways that rents out bikes by the day from train stations in the Netherlands. Lawyer Erik Mientjes, 27, arrived on Monday with his friends Remco Vroegop and Merijn van der Klooster. They were looking forward to the women&apos;s hockey semi-finals tonight \u2013 although not as much as they might have been if they&apos;d had tickets to the right semi-final. They had Argentina v Great Britain instead of Netherlands v New Zealand. Like other Dutch visitors, they were disappointed by the lack of proper bike lanes. Wendy, a Dutch tourist from Alphen aan den Rijn, declared the roads in London were &quot;pretty dangerous&quot;.  &quot;There are cycle paths here but they are narrow and they sometimes just stop.&quot;  Rob Marks moved to London from South Africa earlier this year. A Games volunteer, he loves cycling in London, but is aware of the dangers.  &quot;I saw a guy get knocked off his bike in Bow last night because a driver decided to turn straight across a cycle superhighway without signalling. But that said, the cycle superhighway are awesome, we need more of them, although the roundabout where CS2 on Stratford high street meets the dual carriageway is flipping dangerous - it was designed for cars and then had a bike lane added afterwards.&quot;  Chris McMurran, from Ardrossan in Ayrshire, had come down on a whim and put his bike on the train to avoid the traffic.  &quot;At home I&apos;d usually have music playing, but there&apos;s not a chance here. I know there are some cycle lanes but there&apos;s a lot of taxis and buses driving in them \u2013 everyone&apos;s in a hurry. There should be more routes with complete separation.&quot;  Bel\u00e9n, Rub\u00e9n and Oalla from Madrid borrowed bikes from a friend in London, despite finding the fact that bikes share a lane with buses intimidating. They had to cycle because of the cost.  &quot;The underground here is four times as expensive as it is in Madrid \u2013 we&apos;re having a crisis in Spain, we can&apos;t afford to go by tube when we&apos;re here.&quot;  Yuko Motoyama also cited the cost of public transport as the reason for cycling while here, and was a big fan of the London cycle hire scheme, which doesn&apos;t have an equivalent in her native Tokyo. She was surprised at how many people wear helmets in London.  &quot;Usually Japanese people don&apos;t wear them, they&apos;re seen as uncool.&quot;  It&apos;s not just spectators that are cycling to the Games. When I met Daniel Schlang, part of Germany&apos;s first ever Olympic BMX team, he was riding down Stratford high street. Despite the fact that he&apos;s entitled to be driven around in the Games lanes, the 21-year-old athlete had forsaken his chauffeur driven car for his BMX on his way to a training session before the start of the competition today. It was all about speed and convenience for Schlang, from Cottbus, a small town near Berlin.  &quot;It&apos;s a little bit faster because there&apos;s a lot of traffic. The Olympic lanes are brilliant but I ride every day so I think I&apos;m faster on the bike.&quot;  Schlang wasn&apos;t the only one choosing a bike over official Games transportation. Bori Csics\u00e1k, who had come over from Hungary to work in the park, bought a bike off the internet and was using it instead of the bus laid on by the organisers to get back to her lodgings. However, she was riding on the pavement down the high street.  &quot;I don&apos;t have the courage to ride on the road here, the traffic is scary.&quot;  Stopping in the bike park at the Greenway transport hub I got a free bike check from Anabel Sanchez. If only there were more free bike parks like this in London: secure, off the pavement and manned by several staff round the clock. Sanchez is pleased about the work she&apos;s doing.  &quot;There&apos;s not many bike shops in the area so it&apos;s nice that the Olympics gives some service to the locals. If you want to invite them to come by bike, you have to offer them support.&quot;  She mentions that one complaint she&apos;s heard a lot is that the bike parks are a long way from the venues \u2013 &quot;cyclists like to park right in front of where they&apos;re going&quot;. David Hutchinson, a games maker from Norwich volunteering at the aquatics centre, agrees.  &quot;I wasn&apos;t impressed, being a volunteer and giving up all my time, that they didn&apos;t provide any cycle parking any nearer the venues \u2013 I have a half hour walk from here to the aquatics centre.&quot;  He says he feels safer in London, which has more bike lanes than Norwich, but is more wary of the drivers \u2013 &quot;they do come a bit close to you, and they&apos;re less considerate.&quot; Lemar Lewis, working for UPS in the park, had just taken up cycling for the Olympics.  &quot;Everyone&apos;s on the get-fit programme, plus it&apos;s quicker to my house.&quot;  It takes him 15 minutes to cycle to work, compared to 45 minutes by public transport. I ask him if he&apos;ll keep up the cycling after the Olympics:  &quot;Most definitely. I think it&apos;s the best way to get around London. They should put in a lot more bike lanes though \u2013 we need to start making some sacrifices. Oxford Street should be a no-car zone.&quot;  Hopefully his experience will be one that a lot of people have had over the past weeks, and his view echoes what I heard all day: we desperately need to improve conditions, but cycling is still the only way to get around London."}, {"sentences": ["Last week they were auctioned off at Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji market for the first time since the disaster.", "As compensation, fishermen here have received about \u00a380m from the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power."], "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Nuclear power", "World news", "Japan disaster", "Environment", "Fishing", "Food", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Marine life"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-09T14:58:06Z", "title": "Fukushima fishermen battle to turn the tide on a crippled industry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-fishermen-crippled-industry", "article": "One by one they are unloaded, weighed and tipped into plastic vats of ice \u2013 hundreds of octopuses that flail and whip the melting ice into a foaming mollusk soup. In this state they look far from appetising, but the catch marks a critical step forward in the battle to save the local fishing industry almost a year and a half after the meltdown at nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. &quot;That&apos;s quite a good catch,&quot; said Kasunori Endo, general manager of the Soma-Futaba fisheries co-operative. Endo was hopeful that consumers would quickly grow accustomed to seeing even more Fukushima seafood reappear on supermarket shelves: &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to increasing the number of species we can catch. We may soon be able to fish for crab and squid. We won&apos;t make serious progress until we bring in a bigger, more varied catch.&quot; The nuclear disaster heaped an extra layer of misery on the region&apos;s fishermen, who already had to contend with the destruction of fishing boats, equipment and ports by the tsunami that roared ashore on 11 March last year. Fishing co-operatives in Fukushima prefecture voluntarily refrained from venturing into local waters \u2013 an official ban on catching most marine species was imposed only recently \u2013 amid fears that radioactive leaks from the plant had made seafood too dangerous to consume. Then, 15 months after the start of the nuclear crisis, boats in Soma, which is about 30 miles north of the plant, were given permission on a trial basis to start catching two types of octopus and whelks, selected because they are thought to trap fewer radioactive particles than other species. After the catch was unloaded, samples were taken to a nearby lab, to which the Guardian was granted rare access. Staff dressed in white overalls, masks, hats and gloves sliced octopus tentacles into chunks, then wrapped them in plastic to be taken into an adjoining room for testing. On this occasion, as on every other day since fishing in Soma resumed at the end of June, the two radiation-measuring devices in the lab revealed not even the slightest trace of radioactive iodine-131, and caesium-134 and -137. In March, the government introduced stricter acceptable radiation levels in seafood, increased from 500 becquerels per kilo to 100 becquerels. &quot;There may be very tiny amounts, but they are so small they don&apos;t even register on equipment as sophisticated as this,&quot; says Noriaki Haga, the fisheries official in charge of testing. The octopuses are tested again after they have been boiled, in preparation for sale. Despite proof that this particular delicacy is safe, Fukushima&apos;s fishermen concede that the consumers they once depended on to make a living have yet to be convinced. For weeks after fishing resumed, octopus and whelks were sold only at supermarkets in Fukushima prefecture. Retailers reported that the items, priced about 40% lower than usual, quickly sold out as local shoppers put on a display of solidarity with their embattled fishermen. But the fisherman are concerned that the wider Japanese population will be harder to win round. Last month, the recovery reached another milestone when whelks and octopus went on sale in neighbouring Miyagi prefecture. Last week they were auctioned off at Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji market for the first time since the disaster. But dozens of other types of seafood, including the region&apos;s prized squid, crab and flounder, are still off-limits while scientists attempt to gauge the nuclear accident&apos;s long-term impact on the marine food chain. Back in Soma, some fishermen fear that the recent sales are simply delaying the inevitable for an industry that was already in decline, due largely to its ageing, shrinking workforce, well before the tsunami. Annual sales of Fukushima-caught fish plunged from about 11bn yen in 2010 to 1.6bn yen last year, after fishing fleets were forced to suspend operations in the wake of the nuclear accident. As compensation, fishermen here have received about \u00a380m from the plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power. But compared with disaster-hit areas farther north, the cleanup operation has made little progress in places such as Soma. Debris in Fukushima cannot be transported outside the prefecture for burial or incineration, and the government has yet to reach agreement with communities near the plant about the construction of temporary storage sites. &quot;Most of our nets were washed away and our ice storage facility was ruined,&quot; said Tadashi Sakurai, a 73-year-old Soma fisherman as he repaired nets retrieved from the tsunami debris while bulldozers clear the building remains on the quayside. &quot;Selling octopuses and shellfish doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re back in business,&quot; said Sakurai, who has been working on boats since he was 10. &quot;This isn&apos;t a recovery, and won&apos;t be until we increase our catch and people around Japan start eating it again.&quot; The total haul on a recent afternoon stood at five tonnes of octopus and a tonne of whelks, but that is less than a tenth of the overall catch Soma&apos;s fishermen brought in daily before the tsunami. &quot;We want to get back to those days as quickly as possible, and this is the first step,&quot; said Haga. &quot;If we&apos;d only had to contend with the tsunami and not the nuclear accident as well, we&apos;d be much farther along the road to recovery by now. Radiation is our invisible enemy. All we can do is test and test again, and try to reassure people.

For weeks after the meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant last March, Sasaki believed her brewing business had met the same fate as her hometown, Iitate. The farming village lies just outside the 20km (12-mile) evacuation zone surrounding the plant, but was evacuated two months after the accident after independent monitors discovered dangerously high levels of radiation there. Sasaki, along with 7,000 Iitate residents, left the home she shared with her husband, son and grandson, and said a quiet farewell to her brewery, restaurant and the fields where she once grew organic rice and vegetables. &quot;When I think about my old house, I get a headache and can&apos;t sleep,&quot; she said. &quot;I took out millions of yen in loans to build my old brewery and restaurant, and I was on the verge of paying them off when the accident happened. &quot;Then I had to borrow more money to open this place. Tokyo Electric Power [the operator of the plant] has paid me some compensation, but it&apos;s a drop in the ocean.&quot; Almost a year and half later, Iitate&apos;s residents, now scattered around the region in temporary shelters and private accommodation, still don&apos;t know when they will be able to make a permanent return, although many are now permitted to visit during daylight hours. The uncertainty, and boredom with life as a nuclear evacuee, drove Sasaki, 66, to resurrect her business making unrefined doburoku sake at her new premises just outside Fukushima city. Standing in her way was a web of red tape. Japan&apos;s brewing laws are weighted in favour of large-scale producers, and Sasaki had only been given permission to brew the doburoku, which requires a special license, after Iitate was granted special economic status in 2006. As soon as she was evacuated, she effectively lost her right to work. Under pressure from the Iitate council, the authorities compromised, and Sasaki began brewing again with the last batch of the village&apos;s rice harvest from 2010. Last year&apos;s crop was never harvested due to fears over radiation, but what little was left of the previous year&apos;s supply went towards the production of six large barrels of sake, with the final product going on sale in May. From this year, she will use rice grown by relatives living in another part of Fukushima prefecture. &quot;I made far less than I used to,&quot; she said. &quot;I used to sell huge amounts for New Year&apos;s celebrations, summer festivals and social events. But now my old neighbours are scattered all over the place.&quot; Sasaki has returned to her old routine of visiting her brewery three times a day to monitor the sake&apos;s temperature. But her enthusiasm is tempered with resentment at the hand the nuclear accident has dealt her and her family. She visited her former home last winter to find that the bath, sink and toilet had cracked irreparably, and layers of ice on the floor where water had leaked through the roof. There were signs that wild animals had invaded the property. &quot;I can&apos;t think about the future at all,&quot; she said when asked about official promises that parts of Iitate could be inhabitable within two years. But after word spread about her sake venture, Sasaki quickly found herself running out of stock as old neighbours and new customers indulged their love of her cloudy, slightly fizzy tipple. &quot;If this can help lift people&apos;s spirits even just a little, then I&apos;m happy to do whatever I can to help.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;But maybe he was hoping that the major donor nations \u2013 ones like the US, Britain, Japan \u2013 would tell Karzai that if he tries to sack him and cannot replace him with a credible minister to follow up on [funding commitments from July&apos;s] Tokyo [aid conference], that funds may be reduced.&quot; Afghanistan&apos;s Tolo television station made allegations late last month that Zakhilwal had stashed large quantities of money overseas."], "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-09T18:33:27Z", "title": "Afghan finance minister breaks down in tears as he denies corruption", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/afghan-minister-tears-denies-corruption", "article": "Diplomats filing into the conference room at Afghanistan&apos;s finance ministry had expected a bland update on accountability targets from the finance minister. Instead, he brought out personal financial papers and begged for support in the face of what he described as politically motivated corruption allegations, eventually breaking down in tears. Hazrat Omar Zakhilwal, a young technocrat who has been lionised as a dynamic reformer by many western diplomats, said he had &quot;acted naively&quot; in his handling of $2m (\u00a31.3m) of campaign funds for President Hamid Karzai&apos;s re-election campaign in 2009, but denied any wrongdoing. He launched an impassioned 45-minute defence of his behaviour, waving bank statements and tax receipts, and said he feared for his life and his family&apos;s safety because of his role in trying to clear up a $900m banking scandal, according to sources who attended the meeting, or heard first-hand accounts. One diplomat described the meeting as &quot;more emotional than factual&quot;. Zakhilwal began weeping towards the end of the meeting and had to leave the room briefly, several sources said, but he returned to finish his presentation. Stunned diplomats, gathered from across the international community and including senior UN officials, made no comments and asked no questions. &quot;I don&apos;t think he necessarily expected support in the room,&quot; said one western diplomat. &quot;But maybe he was hoping that the major donor nations \u2013 ones like the US, Britain, Japan \u2013 would tell Karzai that if he tries to sack him and cannot replace him with a credible minister to follow up on [funding commitments from July&apos;s] Tokyo [aid conference], that funds may be reduced.&quot; Afghanistan&apos;s Tolo television station made allegations late last month that Zakhilwal had stashed large quantities of money overseas. But he has hit back with a formal request for the attorney general to investigate his finances, saying the money was earned legitimately from lucrative consulting work done before he took office in 2009, and real estate investments buoyed by Afghanistan&apos;s decade-long property boom. An aide, Najib Manalai, told the Guardian that descriptions of the minister crying in Wednesday&apos;s meeting were &quot;exaggerated&quot; and said he had not expressed concerns about his family&apos;s safety. Zakhilwal denied he had asked for support, or that he had admitted any mistakes in handling election funds. &quot;I have not asked donors for help, in fact don&apos;t need their help. I had invited them to brief them on what was going on and about my decision to ask the attorney general to investigate both the accusation against me as well as violations of my rights,&quot; he said in an emailed message. Diplomatic sources confirmed details, including Zakhilwal&apos;s tears. One said he wept in front of the ambassadorial corps. The $2m figure he cited in connection to the election, and the request for support, were also mentioned, said a diplomat. Many diplomats in Kabul, despite their commitment to fighting Afghanistan&apos;s rampant graft, recognise that it is difficult for senior officials to stay entirely clean in a system of patronage politics riven with corruption. Some take a pragmatic &quot;good enough&quot; approach to working with and supporting officials they consider relatively untainted. There is little doubt that Zakhilwal created enemies with his handling of Kabul Bank, a lender that nearly collapsed in late 2010 when it emerged that members of the Kabul elite had been treating it as a kind of private piggybank. The government&apos;s slow handling of the scandal jeopardised millions of dollars in aid last year and Zakhilwal played a key role in convincing international donors that Kabul was making progress. Officials argue they have now drawn up charge sheets and recovered tens of millions of dollars, but critics point out that there have still been no prosecutions. &quot;Kabul Bank, he said, is certainly a big factor in the smearing campaign,&quot; the aide Manalai said when asked about Zakhilwal&apos;s comments that he was being persecuted for his clean-up efforts. The question marks over Zakhilwal&apos;s job come just after parliament voted to unseat the defence and interior ministers, leaving the country without its two most important security officials in the middle of the fighting season. The defence minister, Abdul Rahim Wardak, who stepped down shortly after the vote, was another western favourite who had been in the job for eight years. Diplomats warned that his departure could complicated the handover of security from foreign to Afghan forces."}, {"sentences": ["Bars and restaurants in Tokyo remained open through the night to accommodate diehard fans who stayed up for the 3.45am kick-off."], "tags": ["Olympics 2012: football", "Women's football", "Japan", "Olympic Games 2012", "US news", "Sport", "World news", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-10T05:12:00Z", "title": "Japan comes to terms with Olympic women's football defeat", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/japan-olympic-womens-football-defeat", "article": "A bleary-eyed Japan has been left to come to terms with its failure to add an Olympic gold medal to its world cup title in women&apos;s football. Just over a year after Nadeshiko Japan \u2013 named after a colourful yet hardy mountain flower \u2013 beat the US on penalties to lift the world cup, the Americans exacted revenge, beating the Japanese 2-1 in front of a record 80,000 crowd at Wembley on Thursday. Japan had gone into the game believing they could do the double against the USA after some impressive displays on the way to the final.  Bars and restaurants in Tokyo remained open through the night to accommodate diehard fans who stayed up for the 3.45am kick-off. Having come close to levelling the score several times and dominating possession, Japan&apos;s disappointment was palpable. Several players were in tears as the Americans celebrated their third straight football gold, but they regained their composure, bowed to their fans and even managed a celebratory jig. Despite their disappointmen, Thursday was another historic night for women&apos;s football in Japan. The team have never won an Olympic medal and their display in the final will only have strengthened the affection with which they are regarded by their growing fan base back home. &quot;Given that the United States is such a good team the result is not surprising,&quot; Takeshi Sakata, a student who watched the match live, told Associated Press. &quot;Getting the silver is an impressive result at the Olympics and shows you how far Japanese soccer has progressed.&quot; The loss also marks a turning point for the team, who became national heroes after lifting the world cup last summer while Japan was still coping with the aftermath of the 11 March tsunami. Their coach, Norio Sasaki, who had used videos of the destruction to motivate his players during their world cup campaign, indicated after the Olympic disappointment that he would step down. &quot;Our goal was to win this game and be champions and although we couldn&apos;t achieve that objective, the players did ever so well and I want to tell them how grateful I am for their hard work,&quot; Sasaki told reporters in London, according to Kyodo News. &quot;I&apos;m immensely proud of them.&quot; The Olympic final was possibly the last Japan will see of its inspirational midfielder Homare Sawa, playing in her fourth Olympics.

The South Koreans relish any opportunity to embarrass their former colonial ruler in a fixture that has become Asia&apos;s fiercest footballing rivalry. Back in Seoul the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, added to the political symbolism by making a trip to a group of islands in the Japan Sea (or the East Sea if you&apos;re Korean) that is claimed by both countries. Whatever happens in Cardiff it looks like Japan&apos;s women won&apos;t have to suffer the indignity of 12 hours in economy class while their male counterparts relax at the front of the plane, as they did on their way to London.

Kenji Fujimoto was an invaluable source of information about the dynasty, that has ruled North Korea for more than 60 years, during his time there but after 13 years with the Kims, the sushi chef, who goes by a pseudonym, reckoned he had learned too much about the family that controls one of the most enigmatic countries on earth. In 2001, he fled to his native Japan \u2013 while he was supposed to be shopping for sushi ingredients \u2013 and built a second career writing bestselling books about his former employers. Despite claiming that his life was in danger, Fujimoto, who disguises himself with a bandana and sunglasses in public, returned to Tokyo from a two-week trip to North Korea, reportedly at the behest of Kim Jong-un. On his arrival in Beijing from Pyongyang, Fujimoto offered Japanese reporters a glowing appraisal of life in the north under Kim Jong-un, who came to power after his father, Kim Jong-il, died from a heart attack last December. Kim, he said, had &quot;grown tremendously as a person&quot;, and told Fujimoto he was &quot;always welcome whenever I visited North Korea&quot;, according to a report in South Korea&apos;s Hankyoreh newspaper. Fujimoto claimed that Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju \u2013 who he described as &quot;pretty and charming&quot; \u2013 had organised a reception for him, but added that they had not discussed politics. He was also reunited with family members, possibly including his North Korean wife, with whom he had a son and daughter. Fujimoto, who is thought to be in his mid-60s, gained credibility a few years ago when he correctly predicted that Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of Kim Jong-il, would be favoured over his two older brothers to succeed his father. In his bestselling 2003 book, Kim Jong-Il&apos;s Chef, Fujimoto described his first meeting with a seven-year-old Kim Jong-un, who was dressed in a military uniform. The boy &quot;resembled his father in every way, including his physical frame&quot;, he wrote. &quot;He glared at me with a menacing look when we shook hands. I can never forget the look in his eyes, which seemed to be saying, &apos;This is one despicable Japanese guy.&apos;&quot; Fujimoto would not be drawn on the purpose of the visit, and there is no way, at this point, that his account of the trip can be verified. That will have to wait until TBS, a Japanese TV network that reportedly funded the visit, releases a documentary about the trip. In Japan, the Mainichi Shimbun speculated that the purpose of the trip was twofold: to reinforce the idea that, under Kim Jong-un, North Korea is opening up; and to issue a gentle warning to Fujimoto not to divulge any more secrets about the communist world&apos;s only dynasty. Far from being declared an enemy of the North Korean state for his loquaciousness, Fujimoto at times sounded like a spokesman for the regime. &quot;Stores in Pyongyang were brimming with products and people in the streets looked cheerful,&quot; he said. &quot;North Korea has changed a lot since Kim Jong-un assumed power. All of this is because of leader Kim Jong-un.&quot; Writing in the Chosun Ilbo \u2013 one of the few newspapers Fujimoto has spoken to without demanding a fee \u2013 columnist Jeong Woo-sang said there could be some truth to the chef&apos;s gushing account. &quot;Fujimoto&apos;s comments may be calculated, but taken with a grain of salt, they could offer some clues about the reality in the North,&quot; he said."}, {"sentences": ["In Tokyo, the government&apos;s chief spokesman, Osamu Fujimura, described Lee&apos;s visit as &quot;extremely regrettable&quot;.", "Later, the government said it was ordering its ambassador in Seoul, Masatoshi Muto, to return to Tokyo to discuss the dispute."], "tags": ["South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-10T09:45:19Z", "title": "South Korea and Japan face off over disputed islands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/10/south-korea-japan-disputed-islands", "article": "Japan and South Korea were heading for a diplomatic showdown on Friday, after Lee Myung-bak became the first sitting South Korean president to visit a group of islands at the centre of a decades-old territorial dispute.

Officials in Seoul said Lee&apos;s visit was not designed to provoke Japan, with which South Korea enjoys close tourism and economic ties, albeit against a backdrop of resentment over Japan&apos;s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. An unnamed official said the trip was intended only to highlight the island&apos;s importance as a natural reserve. &quot;There shouldn&apos;t be anything unusual in a national leader visiting a place that is our territory,&quot; the official told Reuters. A freshwater lagoon helps sustain about 80 species of plants, and dozens of birds and insects. The meeting of cold and warm water currents has led to a profusion of fish and other marine life. The islands sit amid rich fishing grounds and, according to some reports, near frozen natural gas deposits that could be worth billions of dollars. A coastguard garrison has been stationed on Takeshima since 1954, and their only known civilian residents are Kim Seong-do, an elderly fisherman, and his wife, Shin-yeol. Lee&apos;s visit comes soon after Japan renewed its claim over Takeshima in its annual defence paper, and days before South Korea marks the anniversary of its liberation from Japanese rule at the end of the second world war. Some interpreted the move as an attempt by Lee to appeal to nationalist sentiment in the south and improve the chances of his party&apos;s candidate, Park Geun-hye, in December&apos;s presidential election. South Korea&apos;s constitution bans sitting presidents from seeking a second term. Lee&apos;s ruling New Frontier party said Lee had demonstrated South Korea&apos;s &quot;determination to protect our territory&quot;. But the main opposition Democratic United party said Lee should have used his final months in office to resolve longstanding disagreements over Japan&apos;s sexual enslavement of Korean women before and during the war, and the use of school textbooks glorifying Japanese militarism. The visit has also raised the stakes at the Olympics, where Japan and South Korea are due to play for the bronze medal in the men&apos;s football tournament in Cardiff on Friday. The Takeshima islands, comprising two small islands and more than 90 rocks and reefs, were made part of Japan&apos;s Shimane prefecture in 1905. The countries&apos; competing claims are mired in historical ambiguity, and complicated by several name changes and cartographical evidence from myriad Korean, Japanese and western sources stretching back centuries. In 2010, South Korea&apos;s media reported the discovery of a 1949 US military map that, according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, &quot;clearly states that Dokdo belongs to Korea&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["When the Guardian met him shortly before he left Tokyo, Dean was nursing a temperature and a cough, two days after he put on a public training session in the pouring rain for 80 Japanese reporters, cameramen and photographers."], "tags": ["Japan", "UK news", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: athletics", "Athletics", "Olympic Games"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-11T07:49:35Z", "title": "Japanese javelin star embraces British roots at London 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/genki-dean-japan-javelin-olympics", "article": "As the son of an English father and Japanese mother, Genki Dean is no stranger to the UK, the destination for numerous childhood holidays to the paternal family home in County Durham. Last month, though, he arrived in London as one of the youngest, and most popular, members of Japan&apos;s Olympic squad. On Saturday at the Olympic stadium, the 20-year-old has an outside chance of a medal in the men&apos;s javelin, having qualified for the final earlier this week with a throw of 82.07 metres. Dean burst onto Japan&apos;s track and field scene in 2010, when he won the silver medal at the world junior championships, going on to achieve the second-biggest throw ever by a Japanese athlete with an 84.28-metre effort this April. Since then, he has had to learn quickly about the minor drawbacks to being one of Japan&apos;s most sought-after Olympic athletes. When the Guardian met him shortly before he left Tokyo, Dean was nursing a temperature and a cough, two days after he put on a public training session in the pouring rain for 80 Japanese reporters, cameramen and photographers. Still, he summoned a broad smile, offered a predictably firm handshake and indicated that he&apos;d prefer to speak in English, although he considers Japanese his mother tongue. Dean secured his place in Japan&apos;s track and field team at London 2012 with a 84.03-metre throw at the Japan national athletics championships in Osaka in June. The throw set a record for the championships, ending his friend, rival and fellow London competitor Yukifumi Murakami&apos;s 12-year domination of the meeting. For Dean, it was the realisation of a boyhood dream. &quot;I&apos;m very happy,&quot; he says. &quot;Now I can repay my parents for all the help they gave me to get this far. Ever since I took up the javelin I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about how much I wanted to take part in the Olympics.&quot; He took up the sport relatively late, having competed in the shot put and discuss while at junior high school, where students are not permitted to take part in the hammer or the javelin. He was already 15 by the time he picked up a javelin for the first time, and immediately displayed a natural talent for the event. He was throwing well over 60 metres in his mid-teens and, in just five years, has emerged as Japan&apos;s best thrower. In the space of a few months, Dean has transformed from relative unknown to poster boy of Japanese track and field. He is photogenic, approachable, and given to celebrating successful throws with a grin and gestures directed at his growing army of fans in the stands. His father, John, is originally from Chester-le-Street, but Dean was born and raised in Japan and attended high school near Kobe - where his parents now live - before going on to study for a degree in sports science at Waseda University&apos;s Tokorozawa campus. He has made more than 10 trips to the UK, but has had to sacrifice summer travel in recent years to concentrate on training and the frenetic rounds of athletics meetings. &quot;I&apos;ve never lived in England, but I like it there,&quot; he says. &quot;I really like spending time in Chester-le-Street and Newcastle.&quot; Until recently, Dean divided his time between training and studying. Now, he admits, he is having to acquire a new skill: handling the media. &quot;I&apos;m surprised by all the attention ... I&apos;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; he says. &quot;Everything is changing fast, so I just have to keep my feet on the ground.&quot; The most frequently asked question centres, predictably, on Dean&apos;s medal prospects in London. He concedes he will have to produce something extraordinary - a throw of 86 or 87 metres - to challenge the Czech Republic&apos;s Vitezslav Vesely or Norway&apos;s Andreas Thorkildsen, who topped the two qualifying groups. &quot;When I&apos;m asked, all I say is that I&apos;ll do my best,&quot; he says. &quot;Winning a medal is not impossible, though.&quot; Dean has spent his time in London working on his back muscles - his &quot;weak point&quot;, he admits - honing his technique and preparing himself mentally for the biggest event of his career to date. At 1.82 metres in height and weighing 88 kg, he is smaller than many of his competitors. He is trying to increase his bulk, but while in London has tried to steer clear of the fish and chips - &quot;greasy but delicious&quot; - he remembers fondly from past visits to England - and stick to his usual diet of rice, grilled chicken, fish and fruit. Dean&apos;s father and mother, Hiroko, will be at the stadium this evening to watch their son compete on the biggest stage in athletics. Before he returns to Japan there should be time, too, to explore more of the country of his father&apos;s birth. &quot;I guess I&apos;ll just have to ask my dad what&apos;s worth seeing,&quot; he says."}, {"sentences": ["While not all the jurisdictions have exactly the same regulations and laws, regulators and lawmakers in financial centres from New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Johannesburg, as well as a number of smaller jurisdictions have all been saying: &quot;Banks, you are not above the law, you must make your businesses comply with our requirements \u2013 there is no debate \u2013 otherwise there will be consequences.&quot; I am certain that regulators are now looking at the global operations of big banks to make certain they have everyone operating to the highest standard."], "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Banking reform", "Financial sector", "HSBC", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-11T23:05:54Z", "title": "If banks played by the rules, New York politicians would have to fuel their ambitions elsewhere", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/12/banks-must-play-by-the-rules-comment", "article": "I couldn&apos;t help but cynically raise my eyebrows when Benjamin Lawsky, the state of New York&apos;s first superintendent of financial services, claimed Standard Chartered was a rogue institution for breaching sanctions on Iran. It was not because I have an informed view on whether or not Standard Chartered has been acting in such a grossly negligent fashion, but due to the fact that New York politicians have a long history of building their political careers off the backs of prosecuting the banking industry for misdeeds. The risk departments of all banks operating in the US zone are well aware of this fact and routinely report that such prosecutions could take place.So I guess Labour MP John Mann&apos;s suggestion that US regulators are out to get London as the world financial capital, in order to build up New York&apos;s reputation, has to be viewed with an equal measure of scepticism. Probably the better question for everyone is to ask: is it possible for cultures of big global banking groups to operate to a singular good business agenda? If not, is the enormous size of the banks that have caused so much havoc another reason to consider breaking up the large banks so that they can concentrate on performing certain financial services functions to the highest standards possible? What the various US regulators&apos; investigations into Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered have in common is that they involve numerous businesses operating all over the world. HSBC and Standard Chartered have found themselves in trouble through some of their subsidiary companies that have transacted business through the US. It is one thing to operate a bank in a single jurisdiction and comply with that country&apos;s regulations and law, but global businesses operating in a multitude of jurisdictions have an extraordinary web of requirements and legal codes to acknowledge in their decision-making. In my own career, the senior and mid-level management debates about how to comply with certain regulatory and standards began more than 20 years ago as many OECD-member nations and others began the first stages of a crackdown on banks used to launder drug money and proceeds of other crimes. More than 10 years ago sanctions against helping certain countries such as Iran carry out day-to-day business in the global financial markets became part of our working lives too, as did watch lists of politically exposed individuals. When these actions began in the 1990s, bankers would complain that it was insulting to ask a client for identification. They would say it was impossible to verify the address of residents of the Middle East because they only had post office boxes. Knowing the source of a client&apos;s funds became a huge issue and still is because money launderers are sophisticated and know the loopholes, and impatient bankers just want the accounts open so that business can be conducted and they can, in turn, earn bonus revenue. But still, any banking leader working in this industry for more than 20 years should be able to see that they can only earn revenue from good business and should have been actively working to shed themselves of any dodgy money associated with corruption, crime and terrorism. While not all the jurisdictions have exactly the same regulations and laws, regulators and lawmakers in financial centres from New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Johannesburg, as well as a number of smaller jurisdictions have all been saying: &quot;Banks, you are not above the law, you must make your businesses comply with our requirements \u2013 there is no debate \u2013 otherwise there will be consequences.&quot; I am certain that regulators are now looking at the global operations of big banks to make certain they have everyone operating to the highest standard. This is all the more reason why such large businesses might consider selling off or closing down the business lines that are too difficult to make compliant, no matter the consequence to a bank&apos;s income.

That curious hotch-potch of sport known as the modern Olympics is done and dusted for the 27th time (if we exclude the intercalated games of 1906 as all good statisticians should). As expected, the London 2012 medal table was led by the United States and China, but it goes without saying that the European community, had its member nations all been playing for the same team, would have comfortably beaten both, in fact surpassed the total of the US and China combined. Of course, the Olympic Games has always been, essentially, a European affair. Sixteen of those 27 editions have, after all, been held in Europe. To give the Olympic movement its due (which is not a phrase familiar to Olympic journalists), it has inched away from a Eurocentric games. But it&apos;s not a radical change and the induction of golf and rugby union to the 2016 Games in Brazil only amplifies the feeling that the United States-Europe TV axis is still driving the whole show. You always know a sport is a dubious recruit if it fails the pre-eminence test; that is, the Olympic competition is not the most-valued for that sport. As an example, no athlete would ever trade an Olympic gold medal for a world title. It&apos;s their most valued possession. But it doesn&apos;t work for tennis, say, where Andy Murray would swap his Olympic gold for Federer&apos;s eighth Wimbledon title in an instant. He would, trust me. So it is that golf and rugby waved into the Olympics for 2016 are sports that do not need the Games either. It&apos;s the wrong way forward. What the Games needs is sports that invest totally in the Olympic ethos, and sports that bring global diversity. How about these? Foot-volley            As baseball and softball found to their cost, the Olympics is full already, so for every sport that arrives, one must leave. They both went. There are other ways to make room, though. Merging sports is a progressive way forward. Football fails the pre-eminence test (see above), and beach volleyball fails on the grounds that any sport with beach in its title isn&apos;t really a sport. So the answer surely is to merge them and, as I&apos;m sure you know, the merged sport already exists. It&apos;s called foot-volley, was invented in Brazil in 1965, and was played by such footballing eminences as Romario and Ronaldo. Sepaktakraw            Another composite sport that bears consideration is sepaktakraw, which is either one word, two words or a hyphenated word (your choice). Sepaktakraw is somewhat similar to foot-volley, but played on an indoor court (or a beach, but we don&apos;t talk about that) with a rattan ball (made with palm leaves) and at a tempo that could best be described as prestissimo and some. It&apos;s compelling watching \u2013 bicycle kicks are de rigueur \u2013 but that&apos;s not the real reason for inclusion: Malaysia has attended 14 Olympics and still awaits its first gold medal. They would have a serious chance in this sport, though they wouldn&apos;t want to meet Thailand in the final. Capoeira            Not until the Tokyo Games in 1964, when judo joined the fold, did the Olympics embrace martial arts. Taekwondo, having twice been a demonstration sport, was the second to join in 2000. A third martial art has long been on the cards, with karate and wushu persistently arguing their corners. But capoeira has two distinctive claims: firstly that it is not Asian in origin (like judo and taekwondo), but South American; and secondly that it is performed to music. The Olympics is currently obsessed with music. It may seem the last thing a gymnast would need in those precarious moments on a 10cm beam is a rock&apos;n&apos;roll backing track, but that&apos;s what has been happening. A disco beat when you&apos;re triple-jumping; garage for dressage and hip-hop for the high jump. This is the new Olympic world and capoeira has its place in it. Dragon-boat racing            Water covers 71% of the Earth&apos;s surface, but only three Olympic sports take place on it: sailing, rowing and canoeing (well, if you exclude swimming, diving and a few horsey jumps that take place in it). There must surely be room for another sport on water, and one with a rich tradition and a theatrical flourish should surely prove irresistible. An ornate dragon&apos;s head prow, 20 or so paddlers in near-perfect unison, a drummer beating the stroke (think how good Redgrave and Pinsent would have been with that) and a sweep with a 10ft rudder steering the boat. It was good enough for the Asian Games, which adopted the sport in 2010. Kabbadi            For a country of its size and population, India has exceptionally poor return from its Olympic involvement: nine Olympic titles, eight of them from hockey. There would have been a few more had cricket (by far the most popular sport in India) been Olympic, but that, too, would fall down on the pre-eminence principal. Kabbadi is not the easiest sport to comprehend, and Channel 4&apos;s attempt sell it to the British public 20 years ago failed on those grounds, but clarity has never been a major concern of the IOC.

As we watch the calls for more generous space standards in the UK, we hope New York city&apos;s story\u00a0will serve as a cautionary tale.\u00a0 The road to space standards is always paved with good intentions.\u00a0New York developed America&apos;s first laws and codes\u00a0to\u00a0regulate housing density in response to the appalling squalor of the slums, conditions that even shocked Charles Dickens when he visited in 1842. These rules were expanded in the 1950s when the movement to keep middle-class families from moving to the suburbs was labelled as an attempt to eradicate housing options for single adults.\u00a0Minimum sizes for new apartments were established at roughly 40 square metres. Disincentives against the construction of studios and small one-bedroom apartments were introduced, and minimum standards were also set for individual rooms. By the time Bloomberg&apos;s administration predicted that our population would top nine million by 2030, it became clear that our 21st\u00a0century households were now severely mismatched with a housing stock largely designed for the nuclear family of the 1950s. Today, almost half of all adult New Yorkers do not live with a spouse or partner, which is similar to London. This demographic shift has transformed our households. The predominant household type in New York today is a single person living alone. Only 17% of the city&apos;s households are a traditional nuclear family with all children aged under 25. These trends are reflected all over the world.\u00a0Not only are we experiencing the rapid growth of single adults, new digital technologies have made our lives more efficient and redefined the idea of community. New York&apos;s plethora of space standards have kept new housing options frozen in the 1950s.\u00a0These regulations handcuff the private and social housing sectors from responding to demographic shifts and developing the kind of innovative design seen in cities such as Tokyo. They prevent the housing market from providing creative, affordable and safe housing choices that fit our lifestyles. Instead, illegally subdivided housing and informal sharing by single people has become so extensive that\u00a0the 2010 census resulted in an undercount of NYC&apos;s population by at least 250,000. This type of sharing has distorted the housing market as a whole, as unrelated singles band together to create combined household incomes that will gazump any family with their wageless children. The city government began to realise that our concept of space standards for housing needed to catch up.\u00a0It is now acting to\u00a0provide more legal and safe housing choices for single adults, and working to reform our old-fashioned housing codes. But once minimum standards are in place it is very difficult to remove them. New York has frequently looked toward the UK \u2013 especially London \u2013 as a kindred spirit on matters of social policy. Now we urge you to turn away from the path of new minimum space standards, regardless of your good intentions. Of course, we want to prevent mass development of low-quality housing, but that goal can be met through better construction codes for sound insulation, design guidelines for light and aid, and sound housing management practice. If you face a housing crisis, setting guidelines for minimum unit sizes\u00a0is not the answer.

The Guardian&apos;s Olympic editor Owen Gibson will be online from 2pm BST to take part in a live webchat.  Owen took the job as Olympics editor in December 2008 and will continue in the role through for Paralympics, which begin in two weeks&apos; time. If you have any questions for a man who has lived London 2012 for the past three and a half years, drop them into the comments section below.  In the meantime, here is Owen writing on the unexpected success of the Games: &quot;From tiptop venues to friendly volunteers \u2013 where did it all go right?&quot;  It began with fears that venues were sinking into the mud following weeks of rain, serious concerns over whether there would be enough security guards to keep the public safe and the biggest call on the army outside wartime. The reaction to the Olympic torch as it toured the nation had raised the hopes of organisers, but the last-ditch security crisis dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the \u00a39.3bn cost to the public purse grew louder. Just over a fortnight later, London&apos;s Games ended bathed in sunshine as the country giddily rose to acclaim a host of new sporting heroes amid hopes that it would lead to a new sense of ourselves and \u2014 in the words of a Locog slogan that once seemed cloying but now feels appropriate \u2014 &quot;inspire a generation&quot;.    1.57pm: Owen will be along to answer questions soon, but while you&apos;re waiting here is his pick of the best moments of the Games:  Mo Farah&apos;s 10,000m triumph  The first time I entered the Park to be greeted by witty, smiling volunteers and professional, charming soldiers was a big moment \u2013 you realised this was going to work after all. But amid a ludicrously crowded field, the first half of Mo Farah&apos;s historic double edges it as a standout sporting memory. You can ladle all the meaning on to it you like \u2013 and the sight and sound of middle England collectively losing its marbles for a Somali-born, west London-raised man of the people was something to behold \u2013 but at its core this was simply an imperious sporting feat. No British man had won the event and there had not been a non-African winner since 1984. Farah tore up the rulebook, working with his American training partner, Galen Rupp, to deal with each surge as it came, refusing to panic and striking for home with supreme confidence at 600m as the noise reached wild levels. The wall of sound in that intimate yet imposing bowl contained a note of disbelief, as if a crowd who had only just seen Jessica Ennis cross the line and Greg Rutherford jump to an unlikely gold could not believe what they were seeing. By the time Farah crossed the line to cap 47 minutes that will go down in British sporting history, there was barely a dry eye in the Olympic Stadium. Unfinished Sympathy, the Massive Attack song that was playing as Farah charged round his final lap, will never sound the same again.   2.11pm: Owen is now in the comments sections answering questions. peteC58 starts us off with a question about the lack of Olympic spirit, to which Owen replies:  Hello all. Hope you&apos;re not feeling too bereft. There&apos;s still the Paralympics to look forward to. In answer to @peteC58, glad you had a great Olympics. I agree on your first point. Generally, thought the presentation of the sport was first class and made a real effort to include those who didn&apos;t usually follow them without alienating the purists. But it was a shame that they didn&apos;t find time to introduce every athlete before every race. Sometimes it was entirely random - the announcers would get halfway through the field and have to stop because the gun was going off. Saw plenty of spontaneity on the podium (what about the Farah/Bolt moment?) but agree that biting your medal is becoming a bit passe. Perhaps we can persuade medal winners to come up with something new for 2016? Supporters from some nations were certainly rowdier than others (the Lithuanians gave particularly loud and well-refreshed backing to their basketball players) but in the main I was struck by how sporting the crowds were. Even when Greg Rutherford was leading the long jump, there were still loud cheers for his opponents. In the team sports (and the boxing arena) the atmosphere was more raucous - but in a good way. Can&apos;t comment on that particular incident with the Poles though I&apos;m afraid.   2.16pm: markgreenwood asks a questions about the fairness of the ticketing process: &quot;You say that you think the ticket allocation process was probably the fairest way of distributing tickets I still feel this was the one thing that Locog got completely wrong. Their system encouraged people to bid for far more tickets than they really wanted. It encouraged the rich, the gamblers, the credit-card-junkies to go for broke and commit thousands of pounds. These people were usually rewarded with success, for some, fistfuls of tickets. Their system specifically discouraged anyone who was more careful.&quot; Owen replies:  Compared to a first come, first served system (the only real alternative), I still think a ballot was the best approach for the first batch of ticket sales. Locog have figures that they claim show no one really ended up with fistfuls of tickets - the average successful applicant got four costing \u00a3275. But - and it&apos;s a big but - there were many other aspects of the ticketing process they got wrong. There should have been a stricter limit on how many tickets a single applicant could apply for. Ticketmaster&apos;s system simply wasn&apos;t able to cope with the demand and seemed unnecessarily unwieldy. Many people spent many frustrating hours waiting to be told the tickets they wanted weren&apos;t available. Ben Marsh, with his amazing online ticket tracker, managed to do what the world&apos;s biggest ticketing company failed to do and find a way of checking which tickets were actually available at any one time. I also feel Locog should have been upfront about roughly how many tickets would be available for each session at each price point. Both the IOC and Locog admit there are lessons to learn from the ticketing process - not least for the way the IOC divides up its tickets between the host, the International Olympic Committees and the sponsors.   2.22pm: On Guardian Sport&apos;s Facebook page K.k. Kaushik asks when will India have a chance to host the Games. Owen replies:  You could ask the same question of the middle east and Africa. The fact the IOC will go to Rio next time, the first ever Olympics in South America, shows it is willing - and keen - to take the Games to new territories. But it was notable that Baku and Doha both dropped off the longlist for 2020 (leaving Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid) and president Jacques Rogge has a long list of logistical and practical concerns about the middle east. India is an interesting one - the Delhi Commonwealth Games was seen by many as the proof of concept for an Olympic bid, but didn&apos;t go so well. A solid bid for 2020 did not materialise. But there is no doubt that in sporting and economic terms it is a huge market - even if Olympic sports are not traditionally very strong. There are also issues around how a bid would be structured and funded. 2024 could be a possibility.   2.26pm: ExtraConnect asks about the handover between Games: &quot;Any idea why the &quot;Olympic Movement&quot; do the Olympic handover ceremony at the end of the main Olympics and not after the paralympics? Surely the Games are over / shouldn&apos;t hand over until after both events are finished, or are the Paralympics not officially under the IOC banner?&quot; Owen replies:  The Olympics are held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee. They then pack up their Louis Vuitton suitcases and leave Park Lane, before the International Paralympic Committee (based in Bonn and headed by Brit in Sir Philip Craven) roll into town. Locog, however, organise both events as an integrated whole - they have been held in parallel with the Olympics since 1988 in Seoul.   2.29pm: OllyWinkles asks about the TV coverage of future Games: &quot;It seems entirely likely that the BBC will not be able to afford rights to broadcast future Olympics. The thought of watching the games on Sky Sports fills me with dread. Is there anything the Government can do to make sure the Olympics remain on free-to-air television in perpetuity?&quot; Owen replies:  Rest easy, the BBC has rights through to 2020. The BBC certainly had a good Games, with almost universal praise for its coverage (if not its full spread of presenters)...   2.33pm: beninho asks about the use of background music at the track and field events: &quot;Seb Coe said he thought is was &apos;appropriate&apos; but his body language was not convincing. Since it was not discernable via TV and I didn&apos;t attend any live events, I have no strong view, but don&apos;t much like the way music has crept into football (e.g. when a goal&apos;s scored). What do you think about it?&quot; Owen replies:  It was certainly one of the talking points of the Games for those of us in the stadium. On the first night of athletics action, as Dibaba surged to victory in the women&apos;s 10,000m there was extremely loud European dance music playing and it seemed entirely incongruous. Locog admitted they&apos;d got that wrong and turned it down a bit. But, to my own surprise, I found that once they had done so the music actually added to the atmosphere - particularly in morning sessions that are traditionally flat affairs but in London were attended by noisy fans who seemed excited to be there. Not sure Seb, a track and field purist, was massively convinced but most seem to like it. I agree with you about music after goals in the football though - Middlesbrough and Wigan among the worst offenders.   2.38pm: HarryPalmer42 asks about the legacy of the Games and how the media will cover some of the sports that have been popular during the past two weeks: &quot;Having seen the public interest in these sports raised over your stint as olympics editor what will your recomendation be to the Guardian senior management in relation to future coverage of the smaller sports? As I fear the back pages and content of the website will soon be Football, Football Football as before.&quot; Owen replies:  It&apos;s a very fair question - if largely above my pay grade. There&apos;s no doubt that many of those watching (and many of those covering) the Olympics welcomed the respite from the national obsession/sport. It&apos;s a simple fact that for many people these sports exist only once every four years, but I agree the media also has a responsibility to provide a spread of coverage. But with the best will in the world, it&apos;s going to be hard to find space for sports in which we&apos;re unlikely even to qualify in 2016. The likes of rowing, triathlon, taekwondo, equestrian are a slightly different case - it&apos;s up to those sports to capitalise on the boost in profile and popularity the Olympics brings and bring their sport to a wider audience. If there is a genuine appetite for coverage (and with web analytic tools we can see exactly how popular different sports are) then we will provide it. Cycling is a good example of a sport that really broke through in Beijing and has capitalised since - there were days during the Tour de France when we filled page after page of the sport section with it, often at football&apos;s expense. But for all everyone is slightly down on football at the moment, you can bet that within a fortnight everyone will be back on board with the soap opera.   2.45pm: mullets is curious about the Olympic village: &quot;Were athletes able to come and go freely? Would they be able to leave and go for, say, a meal with their families on an evening? Was there a guest house-like curfew? What about during the day on non-competition days?&quot; Owen replies:  Athletes could come and go from the Village at will, but individual teams would all have had their own policies regarding curfews etc, especially while still in competition. Kim Collins fell foul of his team&apos;s rules and was barred from competing in the 100m. Team GB officials said their athletes were all disappointingly well behaved. German discus gold medallist Robert Harting, on the other hand, celebrated victory by tearing off his vest and running down the hurdle track. He then got drunk on a German cruise ship moored in Docklands, lost his accreditation, failed to get back into the village and spent the night at a train station. Needless to say he looked a bit sheepish at his medal ceremony the next day.   2.48pm: AndyMitchell asks about the TV coverage of the Games: &quot;Am I being unreasonable or do you agree the Olympic Broadcasting was a bit under par in places?&quot; Owen replies:  Interesting you should say that @AndyMitchell. Although the BBC&apos;s coverage was generally widely praised (not that I saw much of it for obvious reasons), there were some grumbles about OBS - the IOC-owned broadcaster that provides the feed. There was a huge row during the cycling road races about their inability to provide split times, making the race difficult to follow (which prompted a blame game between OBS, the BBC and Locog). Neither were the various intricacies of the controversies in the velodrome (most obviously Victoria Pendleton&apos;s elimination) made very clear. I suspect it is one of the issues that will form part of the debrief - after Locog did such a good job of presenting the sport in the venues, it was a shame that OBS couldn&apos;t always capture that.   2.52pm: JacksonPollocksNo5 wants to know about the volunteers and how many of them were paid: &quot;I know of someone who was going to do it (but be paid) but despite being paid for training and getting his uniform etc. was refused to be allowed to do it as he didn&apos;t turn 18 until his first day of work. He says that everyone else he knew was essentially paid to stand about all day. How can you tell the difference between the two? I often saw groups of seven+ volunteers stood about. Which ones were doing it for free?&quot; Owen replies:  Hi @JacksonPollocksNo5 (good name, btw. I was lucky enough to see the Stone Roses with Bradley Wiggins et al during the Games - definitely an Olympics highlight). Anyway, the 70k Locog volunteers - the Games Makers - were all unpaid, they just got their purple uniform and a travelcard. Likewise Boris&apos;s army of 8,000 London Ambassadors (the ones in the garish pink). But other staff were paid - the G4S security guards (in bright lime green - garish colours apparently being a 2012 prerequisite) and the TfL advisers in stations and tube stations.   2.55pm: bromley asks about the future of the Olympic stadium: &quot;How are they going to reduce the capacity by 20,000 and provide a roof over all the seating for football? It will be a huge shame to lose the character of the place.&quot; Owen replies:  It remains to be seen. There still hasn&apos;t been a final decision on the stadium, with negotiations between the London Legacy Development Corporation and West Ham ongoing. There should a final conclusion to the long running saga/fiasco by October. I suspect West Ham will still get the nod, but there is much negotiation still to be done. I agree that it was a fabulous sporting arena. It&apos;s likely that the reduction in capacity will come from the addition of hospitality boxes between the two tiers and spacing out some of the remaining seats. But the sight lines and intimate atmosphere that made it so special as an athletics stadium should remain. The sound system sounded great too so it should work for big concerts. Whether it will work for football? For me, the jury is still out.   2.58pm: IanB4 would like to know more about the Olympic Park: &quot;Owen, do you know how soon the park will open to the public? It is going to be a superb attraction - I can&apos;t wait!&quot; Owen replies:  The north park (the bit by the velodrome and the handball arena) will reopen on July 27 2013 - exactly one year after the opening ceremony. The rest won&apos;t reopen until easter 2014.There has been some talk of trying to reopen the Orbit earlier than that but health and safety issues may preclude it.   3.04pm: MitchellStirling has some praise for the Gamers Makers but wants to ask about the change in mood that occurred during the Games: &quot;Before the Opening Ceremony what fears did you have that didn&apos;t come to fruition and at what point did you start to think that you could stop worrying?&quot; Owen replies:  Hi @MitchellStirling. Seconded on the Games Makers - they were superb and, er, made the Games. Before the opening ceremony I guess my fears were the same as everyone else&apos;s - that the transport wouldn&apos;t cope, that the atmosphere in the venues would be flat, that some terrible unforeseen security breach would overshadow the Games. The transport fears receded fairly quickly once it became clear that the TfL information campaign/scare tactics had worked, the security fears were allayed as soon as I met my first Marine manning the searches and any fears over the atmosphere were definitively answered by the opening sessions in each venue. Looking back, it&apos;s amazing how much the triumph of Danny Boyle&apos;s clever, funny, moving opening ceremony set the tone for what followed.   3.13pm: ThePlusOne shares an intriguing point about the Sydney Games and asks: &quot;Do we judge a successful Olympics by slightly different things over time, and if so, what has London 2012 achieved uniquely that other future hosts would hope to match and emulate?&quot; Owen replies:  I think there&apos;s something in that. Certainly, there were big fears before the Games (fuelled by the government and organisers) that these Olympics would take place in some sort of militarised zone and feel oppressive and overly corporate, with long queues and endless search points. Warships in the Thames, rocket launchers down the road from my house in Oxleas Wood and fighter planes flying overhead in the days before the opening ceremony didn&apos;t do much to change perceptions. In the event it didn&apos;t feel like that at all. Once hundreds of thousands of people flooded the venues they changed the atmosphere entirely, aided by the brilliant volunteers and - ironically - the 18,000 troops drafted in. I was happy to be proved wrong.   3.16pm: Owen is signing off now. Thanks for your comments and questions. Feel free to keep the discussion going below, or take the opportunity to reflect on the best moments of the Games.  3.24pm: Thanks for all your comments and questions. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian&apos;s writer in Brazil, will be joining us for a live webchat tomorrow lunchtime, when we&apos;ll be looking forward to the 2016 Games in Rio."}, {"sentences": ["I do remember having a drunken lurch to this in a club in Tokyo at something o&apos;clock in the morning of my 30th birthday back whenever that was, so it qualifies by default."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Adam Ant", "Mark Lanegan", "New Order"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-15T09:07:00Z", "title": "Six Songs of Me: Si Forster from 6 Days from Tomorrow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/aug/15/six-songs-me-si-forster", "article": "Si Forster blogs about music at 6 Days from Tomorrow. What was the first song you ever bought? Adam and the Ants \u2013 Stand and DeliverI bought this from Boots in Stockport, at a time when it seemed like everywhere sold records. I still have it, too. I was a bit too young for punk and what followed (I would have been 10 at this point), but this sort of poptastic version of it appealed to me greatly, and I spent many days with a white painted stripe across my nose, much to the disappointment of my dad. What song always gets you dancing? New Order \u2013 Blue MondayA slight lie as I have neither the ability nor the inclination to dance (when I try, extra knees seem to appear unbidden). I do remember having a drunken lurch to this in a club in Tokyo at something o&apos;clock in the morning of my 30th birthday back whenever that was, so it qualifies by default.            Reading on mobile? Watch here What song takes you back to your childhood? Hot Butter \u2013 PopcornThis is my earliest memory, going back to when I was a toddler. This song had the magical effect of transforming me from a screaming, miniature tyrant into a grinning, dancing idiot. It still makes me grin now, and it remains a calming influence to my occasional tyrannical hissy fits. Doesn&apos;t make me dance any more (see above), and &quot;idiot&quot; is standard issue with me now anyway, possibly due to overexposure to this. What is your perfect love song? Dragonflies \u2013 Red House PaintersYeah, a bit miserable. But it&apos;s achingly beautiful with it, and nobody said that the perfect love song had to have a happy ending. I could have picked anything off Red House Painters&apos; Rollercoaster album for reasons too personal to divulge, but I plumped for this one as it applies to the memories of not one, but several &quot;where are they now?&quot; reminiscences.

Boards of Canada \u2013 Dayvan CowboyI&apos;ve absolutely no religious leanings and am not expecting to be swept off into any sort of afterlife, but on the off\u2013chance that I do get carted off to some sort of suburban Valhalla, this is the perfect way to go. It&apos;s chilled, it wordlessly suggests a journey, and it&apos;d probably raise fewer eyebrows among the sparse congregation (and later awkward reunions, should certain theories about death be proved correct after all) than H\u00fcsker D\u00fc&apos;s Never Talking to You Again, which was my original choice. Time for the encore. One last song that makes you, you Borracho \u2013 Mark LaneganI cheated. I asked my friends. I was suggested this as being &quot;me&quot;. One of my favourite songs from my favourite album by my favourite artist, it&apos;s a song that bounces between calm and rage, redemption and rejection, dark and light. I suppose this mean that my friends think I&apos;m a bit ambivalent. Or maybe just a bit of a lush. Either way, it&apos;s a song from a time when music was absolutely everything to me, when seemingly every new thing was absolutely brilliant and I couldn&apos;t be happier with this choice. \u2022 Listen to Si&apos;s six songs and join in the project by telling us which songs mean the to most to you at sixsongsof.me."}, {"sentences": ["Taking the cities of New York and Tokyo as its starting point, the show contrasts the approaches of two pioneers of impressionistic urban photography.", "The images in Love Hotel were taken in 1978 from sex tapes made by clients of one of Tokyo&apos;s infamous book-by-the-hour hotels."], "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Barbican", "Culture", "Tate Modern", "Art"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-16T15:04:00Z", "title": "Political, provocative, personal: photography to look forward to", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/16/photography-preview-autumn-winter-2012", "article": "August is a quiet month for photography shows, so here&apos;s a preview of some of the exhibition highlights for the next few months.     Elsa Maxwell's Tory ball, New York, 1955, by William Klein    The most anticipated London show is surely Tate Modern&apos;s ambitious double header William Klein/Daido Moriyama, which opens on 10 October. Taking the cities of New York and Tokyo as its starting point, the show contrasts the approaches of two pioneers of impressionistic urban photography. It considers the influence of Klein&apos;s seminal 1956 book, Life Is Good and Good for You in New York, on Japanese photography, and Moriyama in particular. The prodigiously productive Moriyama was a founder of the radical Provoke movement in Japan and, alongside previously unseen vintage prints, the exhibition explores photography&apos;s role in the representation of protest movements and civil unrest. This is an ambitious show that will be a chance for many of us to see lots of Moriyama&apos;s images outside of book form for the first time. I, for one, cannot wait.     Yokosuka 1970/2003 by Daido Moriyama    The other big London exhibition is the Barbican&apos;s group show, Everything Was Moving: Photography from the 60s and 70s, which opens on 13 September. This survey show reflects on the radical cultural shifts that took place around the world during the two decades. It shows work by well-known names such as William Eggleston, David Goldblatt, Boris Mikhalov and Bruce Davidson alongside the likes of Graciela Iturbide, Shomei Thomatsu and Raghubir Singh. Iturbide&apos;s work was one of the highlights of last year&apos;s Rencontres d&apos;Arles and Thomatsu is arguably Japan&apos;s most influential postwar photographer, so this show promises to be intriguing, if only for the range of styles on display from a seemingly disparate bunch of innovators.     From the series Mothers of Martyrs by Newsha Tavakolian    In November, the Victoria and Albert Museum hosts Light from the Middle East, the first major show of contemporary photography from the region. This intriguing exhibition brings together 30 artists from 13 different countries, including Abbas, Yousssef Nabil and Shadi Ghadirian. I am most looking forward to Newsha Takavolian&apos;s provocative series Mothers of Martyrs, which may divide opinion, but is undeniably powerful in its evocation of belonging, belief and mourning. Elsewhere, Amsterdam hosts the first international Unseen Photo Fair from 19 to 23 September, which will feature previously unexhibited work by emerging photographers. The aim is to give &quot;new photography the platform in deserves&quot; and, to this end, more than 50 galleries from around the globe will be showing work from their most promising new talents. Four hundred lucky visitors have already been given \u20ac1,000 each to spend on photography courtesy of the Dutch cultural lottery. There will be work for sale by the likes of Alex Prager, Pieter Hugo, Alessandra Sanguinetti and Richard Mosse. A place for the curious as well as the committed collector to look at \u2013 and buy \u2013 photography. Plus, it will be interesting to see just how far the galleries go in interpreting the definition of Unseen. Also in September, as part of Liverpool Biennial, the Open Eye gallery presents two controversial series by the Japanese photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki: The Park and Love Hotel. Both investigate the seedier side of sex \u2013 and both precipitated furious debates in Japan about the blurred line between reportage and voyeurism. The Park, already a cult photobook, is the end result of Yoshiyuki&apos;s participation in the nocturnal goings-on in Shinjuku&apos;s Chuo Park in the early 1970s, when he photographed voyeurs who lurked in the bushes to spy on couples having furtive sex on the grass. The images in Love Hotel were taken in 1978 from sex tapes made by clients of one of Tokyo&apos;s infamous book-by-the-hour hotels. Both series are grainy and indistinct, but undeniably evocative. And provocative. In London on 12 October, the Photographers&apos; Gallery presents a long-overdue retrospective of the Irish-born photographer Tom Wood, who has been working for the last 25 years in and around Merseyside and Liverpool. He also shot the unforgettable Looking for Love series in a &quot;disco-pub&quot; in Chelsea Reach in London in the 1980s. His book Photie Man \u2013 the name given to him by the kids he photographed on Merseyside \u2013 is the best introduction to his work, which skirts street photography, portraiture and reportage, but cannot really be classed as any of them. Great to see the work of a singular photographer who doesn&apos;t fit in neatly to any tradition being celebrated by the Photographers&apos; Gallery.     Naval Base, Galley (Canteen) from Edmund Clark's Guant\u00e1namo: If the Light Goes Out    The fifth edition of the Brighton Biennial takes place from 6 October to 4 November in venues across the city. It&apos;s titled Agents of Change: Photography and the Politics of Space, and will feature artists including Omer Fast, Julian Germain, Trevor Paglen, Jason Larkin, Corinne Silva and Edmund Clark, whose project, Guant\u00e1namo: If the Light Goes Out, is shortlisted for this year&apos;s Prix Pictet Prize. The winner is announced at London&apos;s Saatchi Gallery on October 9, and a show of the shortlisted artists runs there from 10-28 October. Finally, and staying in London, the Taylor Wessing Photographic Prize Exhibition is at the National Portrait Gallery from 8 November to 17 February 2013. As one of this year&apos;s judges, I can&apos;t say much more about it at present, but will be commenting on it from the inside when the shortlist is announced in September. Watch this space. Now see this From 18 August, Third Floor Gallery in Cardiff is showing Encuentro by Irish photographer Maurice Gunning. It focuses on the Argentine-Irish community in Buenos Aries, descendants of the original immigrants that arrived there in the 1800s. Gunning&apos;s poetic, fragmentary style is perfectly suited to the kind of visual storytelling that draws on memory, text and longing to at once evoke the past and the present. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2012. The original said that 40 visitors has been given \u20ac1,000 to spend on photography at the Unseen Photo Fair. This has been corrected.

It will have a clear sense of its social mission, which means it will know what difference it is trying to make, who it aims to help, and how it plans to do it. It will bring in most or all of its income through selling goods or services. And it will also have clear rules about what it does with its profits, reinvesting these to further the social mission. Workshops and networks: We are working at the moment with partners including the Asia Europe Foundation on a network of social entrepreneurs. We&apos;ve held three workshops, which combined training, networking and ideas incubation, in Thailand, Burma and Vietnam. British and European entrepreneurs also took part. We try to build strong international networks and support them in supporting each other. NGO to social enterprise: A lot of the organisations we work with are supporting NGOs in transition to social enterprises. It&apos;s not often cut and dried \u2013 in the first few years at least, they are still in receipt of charitable donations or other sources of funding.\u00a0Other NGOs I have seen start up an enterprise of some sort \u2013 perhaps a charity shop, or some other sort of trading arm \u2013 as an additional source of income. A couple of organisations I recently visited in Burma fit these descriptions - FXB Myanmar and Proximity Design. Sustainability: If it&apos;s not possible to launch an enterprise without getting caught up in legal and regulatory issues, but you still want to create a social action project, then look to ways to make it more sustainable. Role of academics: Let&apos;s also not forget the role that can be played by the academic community. In Turkey, we have worked with Kadir Has University, now including social enterprise as part of their lifelong learning programme. Reasons for growth: In some places, social entrepreneurs are looking for more sustainable ways of tackling issues they face. They feel charitable donations or foundational funding don&apos;t offer stability, so they look for more reliable sources of income. In other countries, such as China, there is an interest (as there is in the UK), of delivering better public services (or trying to), by putting power in the hands of the people and communities in receipt of those services. Our work in China: Here&apos;s some information about our work in China \u2013 and here&apos;s some more! Young entrepreneurs: On the global scale, I would speculate that as young people now have a much greater understanding of the wider world around them. We seem to be seeing a generation of young people who want to embed their values and aspirations in their working lives, and not have them as an adjunct. The ability to measure social impact is key: It&apos;s certainly vital in seeking finance \u2013 investors want to know that their money is being well managed and that the organisation is achieving its stated goals. But in addition, I think being able to demonstrate social impact \u2013 people being brought out of poverty, young people having new skills, jobs being created, pollution diminished, whatever the aim of the social entrepreneur \u2013 is crucial to show the world that this is not &quot;business as usual&quot;. Agricultural projects have potential: If new technologies and access to state of the art skills and tools could be made affordable and available to greater numbers, then many lives would be enhanced. Proximity Design in Burma is trying to do just that, using local know how about the land, and local engineering skills, combined with expertise in design and innovation, to bring effective and affordable tools to local farmers. Umbrella organisations: There is the umbrella organisation route, where social enterprises fund a central body to represent them, offer support and so on.\u00a0We are trying to create more opportunities for entrepreneurs in the UK and the rest of the world to engage, share practice and have dialogue on policy, so keep an eye on the International Hub. Petra Kroon, owner of bureau goedgeefs, Netherlands Defining social enterprise: The rather classical one that states that a social entrepreneur is somebody who wants to solve a social problem \u2013 whether it&apos;s people or planet \u2013 in an entrepreneurial way. At least 50%, and some even say 75%, of the revenues are own income \u2013 so no grants or subsidy. Others define &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; in the same way as Melinda Gates did at TEDxChange: using entrepreneurial strategies to solve a social problem. Budget cuts: As budgets are being cut at this very moment, they turn to institutional grants as a solution. But that is not an entrepreneurial attitude, that&apos;s just replacing subsidies for grants. In Holland there is still the attitude that you earning money by doing good isn&apos;t the right thing. So, in order to survive I think they need to have a more entrepreneurial attitude, be more pro-active and be more open-minded. NGOs to social enterprises: In Holland subsidies to NGO&apos;s are being cut and they&apos;re all thinking about how to survive. I think many people need to learn from others who made the switch from NGO to social enterprise. Organisations working in social entrepreneurship: There are not so many organisations that are involved in social entrepreneurship. There used to be the Dutch Foundation of social entrepreneurship but because of a lack of money and a lack of interest it was shut down. I think for over 10 years Ashoka tried to enter Dutch market, but it didn&apos;t succeed. But for some time now some people are working on the introduction of Social Enterprise NL, an initiative that focuses on helping and promoting social entrepreneurship. It looks really promising and it is set to launch in September. Financial crisis a good thing? I must say, I sometimes praised the crisis. Because it made people think of how they can work in an social entrepreneurial way. It made them look at the real problems, not at the problems the grant-takers or governments want to solve. So the crises also gave a boost to social enterprise, to the people who were already involved and also to the idea and image of social enterprise. More focus on social innovation: In Holland there is a focus on ecological or green innovation while social innovations is left behind. But with government backing in this area, it will develop. Lack of legal structure: In UK you can register as CIC, in US as B Corps. Here in Holland we are a bit jealous about that. Scaling up: It&apos;s an important issue. In Holland there are no large social enterprises. I have several discussions about scaling up. Of course, as a social enterprise you want to scale your social impact. But do you scale by having more employees in a quantitative way, or do you scale in a qualitative way? In other words, staying small but improving your service or product. Foundations and enterprises: In Holland there is a big difference between foundations and enterprise. As a foundation it is almost impossible to get investments because you&apos;re obliged to use your profits to fulfill your mission. As a foundation you are not allowed to pay it to your shareholders. Meanwhile, as an enterprise it is very hard to find any grants or subsidies because the grant-makers state that they don&apos;t want their money to be used to develop an enterprise that is going to make profits. Nadya Saib \u2013 Wangsa Jelita, Indonesia Defining social entrepreneurship: I personally would go with Professor Yunus on his book &quot;Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism&quot;, here I quote: &quot;any innovative initiative to help people may be described as social entrepreneurship. The initiative may be economic or non-economic, for-profit or not-for-profit&quot;. I once wrote about this on my blog, but of course\u00a0it&apos;s not the defining that matters, it&apos;s the doing to create the better world that is much more important. NGO support: There are a lot of foreign NGOs trying to support local social entrepreneurs. In Indonesia for example, when I started to form my social enterprise I was supported by a program initiated by British Council Indonesia and Arthur Guinness Fund. It was a huge stepping stone for us to develop our business and at the same time tackling social problems. Connecting with the community: One of the biggest challenges I face is engaging the community. It took us more than a year to finally convince them to collaborate with us. The first time we talked to farmers about value added production in making soaps out of roses it did not go that smoothly. But when we demonstrated how it works they understood how it helped them become less dependent on the middleman.\u00a0 Lack of professional skills: None of the founders of Wangsa Jelita had a background in business or management. In dealing with this we are helped by being mentored or coached from someone who is expert in certain area that we want to work on. Richard Catherall, founder of Katarsis Ventures, Cyprus Business modelling: This is just as relevant to non-profits as it is for profit focused organisations. It can help people start to broaden what they think about that evil word! For example, social profits, financial profits, environmental profits. Fundamentally modelling helps them to put all the essential elements of a focused enterprise together. This overtakes the focus on profit or non-profit and allows impact and customer orientation to emerge. Value of internships: Quite a broad partnership here in Cyprus has started with action around internships. Early findings have provided rich insights into the culture change required within companies and with students. Some really interesting ideas emerging about life-long networks and associations that could support very talented people to start an international career while keeping their unique island home as the hub. CSR strategy: Employability and employment are emerging as the principle CSR activity. What I love about here, is that, from whatever sector, the focus is always on the issue. So with CSR they are focused on the problem, being creative about how each sector can play a role. Then, when there is excitement and clarity, the companies are willing to invest alongside others. This includes NGOs and social enterprises committing their own resources. They believe they have to have a CSR strategy rather than believing they should be someone else&apos;s CSR strategy. So for example, instead of working up a project on employability and trying to raise project funds, they collaborate earlier and then engage in what is created by those stakeholders. The largest companies accept a role in holding court over these developments including some of the development costs. The success is everyone playing their part based on what they have, rather than competing for a role they want. Support for managers: Linked to employability there is also an acceptance that, in lieu of having had this effort in place there is a generation of managers that also need support. So this then links to efforts to build capacity of managers and leaders within organisations. This is something that we have just started to target. Investment culture: There is investment here into family firms and groups of companies, there are also some small foundations, which are not as apolitical as they could be. There may be an opportunity under the banner of sustainable investment to keep a useful link between investment in companies and investment in social enterprises and NGOs. I don&apos;t mean one size fits all, I mean a strategic approach to sustainable investment which is tailored for each sector. Investment readiness: I have worked with organisations that were almost born investment ready and organisation that will never be investment ready. The investment readiness process we use was tested as part of a programme with NESTA and the Cabinet Office. The process of getting investment ready \u00a0took consideration of the fact that the organisations are most likely to be already a going concern, rather than a start up.  CIC model is great: My partner in Radical Capital was instrumental in encouraging a greater dividend limit. This is because the original (5%) would have blocked out more social investors. It is a bit like our definition debate though. Just because you have a useful structure doesn&apos;t make you a great enterprise. I have worked with excellent social enterprises using &apos;for-profit&apos; structures that have been able to access capital and move money for reinvestment more easily than they would as a CIC. Growing in underdeveloped markets: They will be challenged to become market makers and that is something we will become involved in. This is not just a test of their business model, but how their commitment to achieving the goal informs their ideas for educating stakeholders, customers and investors. Social enterprises and enterprising NGOs will engage with businesses in the commercial sectors differently. In lieu of project funding and programmes, some may lay solid foundations by doing business together. Manju George, co-founder and head of corporate development at Intellecap, India Farming and social enterprise: Agriculture and rural business is one of the sectors we focus on and we have an awards track dedicated to this sector in our annual forum. A community based example is the Masutha producers company (created by PRADAN, the NGO). A slightly more commercial example can be INI Farms, a company that does commercial pomegranate cultivation. There are also efforts to increase land productivity. NGOs shifting to social enterprise in India: Most microfinance institutions in India started at NGOs in the 1990&apos;s and early 2000&apos;s and by 2005 almost all made the shift to a for-profit legal structure. Those that came after started as for-profits directly. Water-focused social enterprises: Community based water treatment plants, initially a largely NGO led activity, is now adopted by many for-profit models. Education, largely the domain of NGOs now have many private players \u2013 affordable private schools, night schools and remedial education, alternative curriculum developers and so on. Vocational skill training is another area where there is a huge shift to private sector activity. Support is always needed: Anybody trying to promote and catalyse social enterprise activity needs to make sure that they make available a variety of support that the social enterprises need. This includes money, connections, advice, hand holding, visibility and information. A narrower approach will not really move the needle. There needs to be an &apos;ecosystem&apos; of people, tools and policies that support them. One organisation may not be able to do all; but multiple organisations complementary to each other can create this ecosystem. Eco-problems: When we talk of the ecosystem, it is also important to recognise that there are some industry/market level challenges that need to be dealt with beyond direct support to the social enterprise \u2013 for instance the lack of awareness about off grid and renewable energy solutions, lack of access to consumer and SME finance and lack of quality assurance and standards are common challenges that multiple energy social enterprise face in India. There has to be intervention that try and tackle these, help &apos;build the market&apos; and make it easier for the social enterprise. This is where philanthropic capital can play a significant role to play (for example IFC&apos;s Lighting Africa program and the recently launched Lighting India program). For-profit structures have better prospects: Not surprisingly, social enterprises with for-profit structures have access to a larger and diverse pool of capital that can fuel their growth and impacts much faster. Most NGO-microfinance to for-profit microfinance transformations saw this happen. Growth of microfinance in India between 2005 and 2011 was phenomenal. However, it also brought along with it the debate on &apos;how much profits is good and acceptable&apos;. How to balance making money for the investors and deepening social impact? Financial crisis has increased focus on social enterprise: I was at the Davos Forum earlier this year and of course the dominant theme was the need to &apos;reimagine capitalism&apos; and to find a &apos;new economic models that is inclusive and responsible&apos;. Many seem to highlight social entrepreneurs and their work as pioneering in this regard and as proof that you can do good and well. The need to go mainstream: Most social enterprises remain small, doing work in local communities, lack access to resources and find it difficult to scale their operations and are no way comparable to mainstream business corporations. The idea is still not as &apos;mainstream&apos; as I would like it to be. Awareness of CSR is encouraging: We are also encouraged by the growing interest from large corporations simply because we need them to address the magnitude of development challenges we face in countries like India. Social enterprises can&apos;t do this alone. Last year we started some work with DFID managing their Business Innovation Facility in India; we work with large corporations here and many are looking to get involved. However, the general risk tolerance is definitely much lower than a social enterprise. They will not put big money in without the business case being absolutely clear. Social enterprise in India is rapidly on the rise: In our annual awards forum, we get close to 60 new social enterprise applications every year. And many are significantly larger than employing 250 people. We recently surveyed 100 social enterprises in India and at least one third of them are operating in over 100 localities and touching more than 50,000 base of the pyramid lives annually. Before the microfinance crisis in India in 2010, the largest MFI has over 40,000 employees including field staff. So certainly the scale is much larger, but not enough as we still have 300-400 million people below the poverty line. Yoshiaki Ishikawa, social agenda lab manager at the Entrepreneurial Training for Innovative Communities (ETIC), Japan Social enterprise and disaster recovery: I&apos;m in Sendai, where is a capital city around the disaster area. This year we&apos;ve started a social entrepreneur incubation program for disaster recovery. Many young entrepreneurs are trying to transform old traditional industry such as agriculture and fisheries. This is also a good opportunity to re-construct disaster area. On the fringes: &apos;Social enterprise&apos; is not very common yet, especially outside of Tokyo. If you pick people in crossroad of Shibuya (where our office locates) and ask if they know about social enterprise, only 1-2% would know. But innovators know what they are and corroboration between social enterprises and companies is getting more and more common. Triple crisis not financial crisis encouraged social enterprise: 2008 crisis pushed issues but didn&apos;t empower social entrepreneurship nor the companies to be more social. Some of them reduced their CSR budget. What did change people&apos;s perceptions was the triple crisis of 2011. Fellowship program for the next generation: We&apos;ve done it with more than 4,000 college students throughout Japan. And last year, we started to involve young professionals to support disaster area too. We&apos;ve sent over 100, and it&apos;s a bit contributing changing mindset and attitude or &quot;work&quot; in Japan. Drew Tulchin, managing partner of Social Enterprise Associates, US Defining social enterprise in US: There is not one definition in the US but generally it means that a company creates a positive impact by doing business. So also a market-based approach by practitioners. Alternatives to Wall Street: I don&apos;t know if there actually are more social enterprise in terms of numbers because of the financial crisis. But it probably has lead to new forms of social enterprises and topics for them like Slow Money NYC who state &quot;We hope to reshape roles for investors and extend the definition of investment, providing alternatives to Wall Street.&quot; Legal status: In the US there actually is a legal status (B Corp). It&apos;s quite new and was first introduced by the State of New York and now passed in eight or nine States. It&apos;s also a result of the financial crisis, which also emerged because of the need to increase shareholder value. The new legislation allows B Corps to prioritise stakeholder value (social and environmental). Bharti Patel, headed Society for Voluntary Actions Revitalisation and Justice, India Business acumen is crucial: There is an urgent need for such input \u2014 writing a good business plan for a social and green enterprise can go a long way towards achieving the desired results and sustainability. It also helps to convince banks to provide the necessary credit. A suggestion to create a local voluntary time bank where such expertise can be tapped into by the entrepreneur. Double crisis: there are two crisis which need to be considered in the modern definition of business. 1) no doubt the financial crisis but increasingly it is 2) the crisis of depleting natural resources which are affecting business globally. But disproportionately those whose livelihood is directly impacted by changes in land, water and eco-system. The recent debate on green economy is important in the context of new social enterprise. India needs leadership: The social impact of the organization together with the environmental best practices /impact gives a true picture of the social enterprise in the modern global economic development paradigm. I do believe India can and should show real leadership here. Here&apos;s my article highlighting India&apos;s traditional practices have done much, but their efforts are dismissed as small scale and backwards. Laura Fedorciow, co-founder of Vertigo Ventures, UK Vocational training: Interesting point about vocational training. Here in the UK we have seen that some charities have started providing training on their core skills to generate their own revenue. LeapCC is one such example. Some small to medium charities are evolving particularly at the moment as donations have slowed here. Philanthropy is rife: When we were in New Orleans, we were amazed by the number of graduates from across the USA who moved down there to help with the clean up for a period of time. Even more surprising was how they were staying and setting up lives there. The AmeriCorps were also supportive in sending volunteers which may be a useful model? See the St. Bernard Project. Partnering with businesses: In the USA we saw this a lot, where companies such as Macy&apos;s would help build a social enterprise building at a University or perhaps sit on their social enterprise company board to provide commercial advice to the team. Being open to new/different ways of engaging with social enterprises is key to supporting the ecosystem and its development as there are commercial lessons to be learnt as well. Rathish Balakrishnan Student fellowships: One of the trends in India is for students to apply for &quot;fellowships&quot; which are often one to two years of immersive experience in a social setting where they work with the community to come up with solutions to social problems.

It was the small but key part of Ma Kent, the childless farmer&apos;s wife who adopts a foundling baby and names him Clark. Together with her husband (Glenn Ford) \u2013 both made intentionally to resemble the couple in Grant Wood&apos;s American Gothic painting \u2013 they bring up the abnormally physically gifted boy until he&apos;s ready to fly off &quot;to fight for truth, justice and the American way&quot;. At one stage, she tells him: &quot;We Kents don&apos;t like show-offs, ain&apos;t that so? A body&apos;s got to be humble even if he knows that he&apos;s better&apos;n his neighbours.&quot; A fragile beauty, Thaxter was never a show-off, but made an impact in a gentle way, frequently portraying wholesome, devoted wives and girlfriends. She shared that quality with the likes of Margaret Sullavan, June Allyson and Teresa Wright, though without having their star power. She was born in Portland, Maine, the daughter of a US supreme court judge. Her mother, who had been on the stage, encouraged her daughter to take up acting. Thaxter started to appear in summer stock, before making her Broadway debut, aged 19, in Robert E Sherwood&apos;s There Shall Be No Night (1940), which starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and the 20-year-old Montgomery Clift. Thaxter&apos;s theatre work led to her being offered the role of the pregnant wife of the second world war pilot played by Van Johnson in Mervyn LeRoy&apos;s excellent war drama Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944). Although she had only a few scenes, Thaxter made enough impression to gain an MGM contract. According to the New York Times critic: &quot;Phyllis Thaxter is surpassingly affecting as the wife of Captain Lawson. Her comparative newness as an actress and a wistful voice give her a rare advantage.&quot; The role, more or less, set the pattern for her film career. However, she had a rare chance to play against her nice-girl persona in Bewitched (1945). Described on the posters as &quot;Darling of society, Cruel love killer, She lived two amazing lives&quot;, Thaxter played a schizophrenic \u2013 both a femme fatale and a good girl, female archetypes of film noir. She is a sweet young thing, who literally hears an evil voice within her, urging her on to murder. But it was back to pure pure sweetness and light in the all-star Week-End at the Waldorf (1945), in which she wrongly believes her fiance to be in love with a film star (played by Ginger Rogers), until persuaded otherwise. In Living in a Big Way (1947), she is a pretty war widow with three children who offers comfort to unhappily married Gene Kelly, and in Tenth Avenue Angel (1948), she is the doting mother of Margaret O&apos;Brien, the little girl who infects everyone, except the audience, with her faith and joy. Thaxter&apos;s last movie for MGM was Fred Zinnemann&apos;s Act of Violence (1948), in which she tries to be the voice of reason to stop an embittered ex-PoW played by Robert Ryan from wreaking revenge on his commanding officer (Van Heflin), who betrayed him to the Nazis. Before taking up a contract with Warner Bros, Thaxter appeared in Robert Wise&apos;s noir western Blood on the Moon (1948) for RKO, where she is a wealthy cattle baron&apos;s daughter, sorely used by baddie Robert Preston, who promises her marriage. Her first role for Warners, in The Breaking Point (1950), a remake of To Have and Have Not, based on the Ernest Hemingway short story, was one of her best. Made to look dowdy, she is remarkably effective as the practical wife of a charter boat captain, played by John Garfield. Trying in vain to convince him to sell his boat and make a steady living, she tells him, &quot;Pop says you can have a job anytime on his lettuce ranch in Salinas.&quot; Worried that he might be attracted to the blonde Patricia Neal, Thaxter desperately lightens her hair. Unfortunately, the studio didn&apos;t offer her anything better, with not much to do other than nobly stand by her man: Randolph Scott in Fort Worth (1951), Burt Lancaster in Man of Bronze (aka Jim Thorpe \u2013 All American, 1951), Gig Young in Come Fill the Cup (1951), Ronald Reagan as a put-upon professor in She&apos;s Working Her Way Through College (1952), and Gary Cooper as a Union officer facing a court martial for southern sympathies in Springfield Rifle (1952). It might have been much of the same, had she not contracted a form of polio. Although she recovered relatively quickly, Warners terminated her contract. With few further film roles offered to her, Thaxter took to television in the 50s and 60s. Her film comeback in Superman was brought about by Ilya Salkind, the executive producer on the film, who was Thaxter&apos;s son-in-law. He was married briefly to the actor Skye Aubrey, Thaxter&apos;s daughter by James T Aubrey, a president of CBS-TV and later MGM. Thaxter and Aubrey divorced in 1962, and she married the publisher Gilbert Lea, who died in 2008. She is survived by her daughter, and her son, James Aubrey. \u2022 Phyllis Thaxter, actor, born 20 November 1919; died 14 August 2012"}, {"sentences": ["The Thief by Fuminori Nakamura, translated by Satoko Izumo and Stephen Coates (Corsair, \u00a39.99) The first novel by the celebrated Japanese author Nakamura to be translated into English, The Thief is a minimalist sliver of Tokyo noir."], "tags": ["Crime fiction", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-17T21:55:03Z", "title": "Laura Wilson's crime fiction roundup \u2013 reviews", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/crime-fiction-roundup-laura-wilson-review", "article": "A Killing in the Hills by Julia Keller (Headline, \u00a314.99) The first crime novel from Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Keller is set in Acker&apos;s Gap, West Virginia, in a &quot;shabby afterthought of a town tucked in the notch between two peaks of the Appalachian mountains&quot;. The scenery is stunning, but the community is trapped in a hopeless cycle of poverty and drug abuse. At the start of the novel, three elderly men are gunned down at the local diner, witnessed by Carla, daughter of prosecuting attorney Bell Elkins. This novel may have run-of-the-mill ingredients \u2013 Attorney Elkins, the protagonist with a troubled past; rebellious Carla, who attempts her own investigation; a mysterious &quot;Mr Big&quot;, who gets a young hoodlum to do his dirty work, and so on \u2013 but they are brilliantly presented. The quality of the writing lifts it far above standard fare. Vengeance by Benjamin Black (Mantle, \u00a316.99) Benjamin Black is the nom de crime of the Booker prize-winning Irish author John Banville, and Vengeance is his fifth book to feature the Dublin-based pathologist Quirke. Like its predecessors, it&apos;s set in the 50s; Black has succeeded in creating a definitive Irish form of period noir, permanently overcast by clouds without, cigarette smoke within, a ubiquitous air of melancholy, and a supporting cast of lonely, available and preternaturally forgiving women. The book begins with the suicide at sea of prominent company director Victor Delahaye, witnessed only by the son of his partner Jack Clancy. Despite a long and successful association, the two families are at loggerheads, fighting over control of the business. The plot is fairly straightforward, and neither Quirke nor his policeman colleague Hackett do much detecting, but the characters keep one&apos;s interest, and the writing, as always, is lovely. The Thief by Fuminori Nakamura, translated by Satoko Izumo and Stephen Coates (Corsair, \u00a39.99) The first novel by the celebrated Japanese author Nakamura to be translated into English, The Thief is a minimalist sliver of Tokyo noir. Told in the first person by an anonymous pickpocket, expert in targeting rich marks in the crowded city, it&apos;s the story of a man with few emotional connections. His only real engagement is with a young boy who, forced into stealing by his mother, is a would-be shoplifter&apos;s apprentice. His past catches up with him when an old acquaintance offers him a lot of apparently easy money to join a gang burgling a rich man&apos;s house. There&apos;s plenty of reflection about the meaning of life on the margins, theft as metaphor and the like. This isn&apos;t for those who prefer the conventional crime novel. It is, however, an intelligent, compelling and surprisingly moving tale, and highly recommended. Safe House by Chris Ewan (Faber, \u00a312.99) To an outsider, the things that spring to mind in connection with the Isle of Man \u2013 motorcycles, flogging, Norman Wisdom and tailless cats \u2013 add up to an odd, probably outdated picture, but not an obvious location for a high-octane thriller. In Safe House, Ewan&apos;s first standalone book after a series of comic crime novels, blokey TT racer Rob Hale\u00a0comes round after a bike accident to be told that Lena, the woman who was riding pillion when he crashed, is a figment of his imagination. With help\u00a0from gung-ho London-based PI Rebecca Lewis, on the island to investigate his sister&apos;s recent suicide, Rob tries to find out who Lena is and where she&apos;s gone.

In 1908, Professor Kikunae Ikeda of the University of Tokyo unlocked the scientific secret of a flavour he named &quot;umami&quot;. It had been around forever, of course, but had yet to be defined. It was the palate-sating, savoury essence that Auguste Escoffier (in whose etymological honour we &quot;scoff&quot; our food) had used to revolutionise French cuisine a few decades before Ikeda&apos;s discovery. A subtle taste that is hard to detect on its own, umami mixes well with other flavours, which it expands and lends a satisfying depth and complexity. Umami is what makes food sink-back-in-your-seat-and-close-your-eyes delicious. (Breastmilk is loaded with umami, which may explain our penchant for it.) It is also the flavour of autumn. Of broths and stock and Parmesan, of meat and red wine. So, as autumn approaches, this week&apos;s column is dedicated to that taste&apos;s place in our wardrobe. It goes without saying that clothes which mix well with stuff you already have are the holy grail of shopping. In addition, autumn clothes should be as satisfying as a\u00a0hearty roast dinner (this is the season to find lasting love, not a one-night-stand dress) and comforting, too. It can&apos;t be coincidental that year upon year the autumn/winter collections contain Proustian touchstones to fondly remembered times: weathered leather, retro prints, traditional fabrics\u2026 It&apos;s umami fashion. With this in mind, here are a\u00a0few items to complement the existing flavours in your wardrobe, making you look delectable. Back-to-school shoes I have my eye on some lovely Boden loafers, which have the scholarly appeal of a new pencil case; or splash out on heart-motif ones from Opening Ceremony, or a fringed pair by Chlo\u00e9. Snuggly cashmere Johnstons of Elgin has been around since 1717 and is still the best in the business (it also has a\u00a0lovely tearoom if you happen to be close enough to visit the Hawick factory). Throw on its comforting grey jumper when the temperature drops. Supercool dress There&apos;s an LnA number that is easy to wear and will layer a treat. Saving for a Mulberry Bayswater? Might take a while. In the meantime, try a retro-leather satchel from Stylistpick. Stompy boots Acne Pistols are My-Wardrobe&apos;s bestsellers and make anything you pair them with look considerably cooler. Perfect for autumn. Note that the heel is not high enough to inhibit leaf-kicking.

The Chinese foreign ministry rebuked Tokyo after campaigners arrived on the East China Sea islet, waving Japanese flags. Activists from Hong Kong visited the islands last week to press China&apos;s\u00a0claim, but were arrested and deported by Japan. Japan controls the archipelago, which it calls the Senkaku, but the islands are also claimed by China and Taiwan, which know them as the Diaoyu. The East China Sea contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and the row is complicated by long-running historical tensions. Many in China complain that Japan has failed to fully acknowledge or atone for wartime atrocities; in Japan, there is growing anxiety over China&apos;s increasing military might. Up to 2,000 people with Chinese flags and banners protested in the southern city of Shenzhen, overturning Japanese cars, attacking Japanese restaurants and burning images of Japanese flags. Qingdao, Taiyuan and Hangzhou also saw protests, while smaller\u00a0ones took place in several more cities across China, from far northern Harbin to south-western Chengdu. In Guangzhou and Shenyang,\u00a0protesters gathered at the Japanese consulates. There were similar protests two years ago after Japan detained a Chinese captain when his fishing boat hit one of its patrol vessels. But Sunday&apos;s outcry appeared to be the largest since 2005, when tens of thousands marched over several weekends. Chinese authorities have been markedly more tolerant of nationalist protest than of other activism in the past. The protests came after about 10 Japanese nationalists from a flotilla of 100 boats swam ashore at Uotsori, one of the islands, and waved Japanese flags. &quot;Four days ago there was an illegal landing of Chinese people on the island and as such we need to solidly reaffirm our own territory,&quot; Koichi Mukoyama, a conservative MP aboard one of the boats, told AP. &quot;This is a way of saying to not mess around,&quot; Toshio Tamogami, one of the group&apos;s leaders, told Reuters. The Japanese government had denied the group permission to land on the islands. Coastguard vessels were nearby and officials later questioned the activists. The territorial dispute heated up after the nationalist governor of Tokyo proposed that the city buy the islands, which are privately owned. The central government then said it would buy them. China&apos;s foreign ministry said it had strongly protested to the Japanese ambassador about the landing. &quot;The illegal behaviour of Japanese rightwingers has violated China&apos;s territorial sovereignty,&quot; it said. In a commentary, state news agency Xinhua warned: &quot;Sunday&apos;s landing, along with a barrage of other provocations, has poisoned the atmosphere of the Sino-Japanese relations and constituted another setback for both countries&apos; efforts to further their political and economic ties.&quot; Taiwan summoned Japan&apos;s representative in Taipei to lodge a protest over the &quot;provocative&quot; act, it said. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, is under pressure to take a tough stand in the row and a similar dispute with South Korea over islands in the Sea of Japan known as the Takeshima or Dokdo. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, visited one of them earlier this month, in what many saw as a bid for nationalist support ahead of elections later this year, and 30 of his compatriots held a ceremony on Sunday to unveil a monument there."}, {"sentences": ["To outsiders, it might seem as if this is a relatively new dispute, which started with the Tokyo governor&apos;s recent announcement in April that he would purchase the rocky islets.", "On a strategic level, concerns about China&apos;s rising military and economic power have prompted Tokyo to broaden its regional network by engaging Pacific countries and multilateral forums such as Asean, while strengthening its own defence capabilities and stepping up security co-operation with the US.", "While neither Beijing nor Tokyo desires a large-scale conflict, there is deepening pessimism on both sides over the prospects of a peaceful settlement to the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute.", "While Japan&apos;s leaders are navigating a fragmented and shifting political landscape, the Chinese leadership is steering a delicate power transfer, limiting the capital available to either Tokyo or Beijing to go significantly against populist or nationalist sentiment."], "tags": ["China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Senkaku Islands"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-20T15:20:01Z", "title": "China and Japan's simmering island row is threatening to boil over | Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/china-japan-diaoyu-senkaku-islands", "article": "Chinese and Japanese nationalists are actively asserting their country&apos;s claims over the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, sparking protests and a heated diplomatic row between the two countries. To outsiders, it might seem as if this is a relatively new dispute, which started with the Tokyo governor&apos;s recent announcement in April that he would purchase the rocky islets. In fact, tensions have been brewing since at least September 2010, when a Chinese fishing boat rammed Japanese coastguard patrols and unleashed a bilateral crisis. That same year, China started to take a more assertive approach towards Japan by increasing its aerial and law enforcement presence in disputed waters to demonstrate its sovereignty. Many Chinese strategists perceive Japan to be a former empire continuing on a downward slide while China&apos;s star is rising, and the rise of hardline voices in Japan has led many Chinese analysts to call for more resolve in Beijing. From the Chinese perspective, the time is right to respond resolutely and stake its ground in this dispute with its eastern neighbour. In Japan, public attitudes towards China deteriorated drastically in 2010, in what is known there as the &quot;China shock&quot;. It happened when China eclipsed Japan to become the world&apos;s second-largest economy, and began to adopt a more hardline approach to maritime disputes. This resulted in an upsurge in Japanese nationalist sentiment, culminating in campaigns to name, and more recently to purchase, disputed islands. On a strategic level, concerns about China&apos;s rising military and economic power have prompted Tokyo to broaden its regional network by engaging Pacific countries and multilateral forums such as Asean, while strengthening its own defence capabilities and stepping up security co-operation with the US. Chinese hardliners see these moves as Japan&apos;s willingness to act as a proxy of the US in its efforts to contain China&apos;s rise and expand US presence and influence in the Asia-Pacific region. In Japan, what is perceived as China&apos;s determination to restructure the regional landscape is fuelling nationalist anxiety about Japan&apos;s ability to defend its territory against a Chinese expansion. Nationalism makes sovereignty in the East China Sea a highly explosive issue, much more so than the South China Sea for example. Due to the link with atrocities committed during the Japanese invasion, sentiments over the status of the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands run deeper in the Chinese psyche than any other territorial dispute in modern Chinese history. Japan, on the other hand, feels threatened by China&apos;s rise, and fears that its territorial sovereignty might be eroded. Therefore, incidents surrounding these islands strike directly at historical wounds, stirring national pride and constricting the already narrow space for diplomatic manoeuvre. Public opinion is a double-edged sword, particularly for China. Beijing tries to use it to justify assertive actions and coax other countries to compromise, but it also faces the tricky dilemma of satisfying increasingly outspoken and critical citizens. Last week&apos;s dramatic landing of Hong Kong activists on the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands was widely applauded on microblogging sites, which soon called for more anti-Japanese protests. But other internet users also raised doubts about the Chinese government&apos;s determination and capability to protect its territorial claims, going so far as to ask for military intervention. China fears these protests could turn into criticism of the government, as has happened in the past. While neither Beijing nor Tokyo desires a large-scale conflict, there is deepening pessimism on both sides over the prospects of a peaceful settlement to the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute. And the deep strategic mistrust that characterises relations between the two countries is currently aggravated by their respective domestic political turmoil. While Japan&apos;s leaders are navigating a fragmented and shifting political landscape, the Chinese leadership is steering a delicate power transfer, limiting the capital available to either Tokyo or Beijing to go significantly against populist or nationalist sentiment. Neither side is willing to initiate the much-needed call on the bilateral hotline established precisely for this type of situation. The longer the two sides let the tension brew, the harder they will find it to prevent the dispute from boiling over."}, {"sentences": ["From Asia, we look at the issue of asylum seekers in Australia, consider a Tokyo-Beijing territory dispute that is sparking protests in China, and meet an ambitious ethnic Chinese politician in Indonesia who hopes the world&apos;s most populous Muslim nation is poised for its &quot;Obama moment&apos;."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2012-08-21T15:59:24Z", "title": "Inside the 24 August edition", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/21/weekly-editors-blog-somalia-future", "article": "August has certainly broken from the news norm, when analysis of world events tend to slow as many in the northern hemisphere take a holiday.

The Japanese and Chinese nationalists squaring up over disputed islands in the East China Sea are in the grip of geopolitical rivalries, jockeying for position on the new map that China&apos;s rise has created. Their deeper animosity goes back into the misuse of their troubled, shared history. When China&apos;s climb out of the economic trough began in the 1990s, the US was the world&apos;s biggest power, Japan the second biggest economy, and the Soviet empire recently deceased. Today, China is the world&apos;s second largest economy, Japan has stagnated for two decades, and US power looks less impressive than it did. As China flexes its muscles, the US shift in focus to the Pacific has come not a minute too soon for some of Beijing&apos;s nervous neighbours. Asia&apos;s maritime borders, and ownership of the oil and gas beneath the East and South China seas, are disputed between Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea, China and Japan \u2013 but as China grows, so does its unilateral assertion of claims. Two years ago it announced the South China Sea was a &quot;core interest&quot;, in an unsuccessful attempt to stick a &quot;keep out&quot; sign on the dispute for the US to read. In July, Beijing elevated an island-based military garrison to city status, unilaterally giving it administrative responsibility over the entire South China Sea. In the East China Sea, things have been equally tense. In April Shintaro Ishihara, Tokyo&apos;s governor, provocatively announced a public fund to buy several of the islands from private Japanese citizens. His action embarrassed the government and inflamed Japanese sentiments, provoking a reaction from Chinese nationalists: on 15 August, the anniversary of Japan&apos;s 1945 surrender, a group of Chinese citizens landed and raised Chinese flags on the islands. They were swiftly deported to Hong Kong, precipitating the worst anti-Japanese demonstrations since 2004. The animosity is much older. For centuries China saw Japan as a vassal state and loftily accepted tribute from a people they regarded as inferior. In the 19th century, when Japan cast off its feudal system and modernised, the shock to China was the greater because of its historic contempt. When, in 1894, Japan defeated China militarily, the humiliation was felt across the nation. China set out to learn from Japan&apos;s transformation but was powerless to prevent Japan&apos;s imperial expansion and brutal occupation. Even after Japan&apos;s defeat in 1945, Japan&apos;s economic success and close relationship with the US perpetuated Chinese resentment. That Japan is the focus of popular rage in China today is less surprising, given this history, than the fact that until the late 1970s visiting Japanese were greeted in China with professions of friendship. It was only after the Chinese regime sent tanks to crush the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989 that nationalist animosity became official policy. In the version of history elaborated after 1989, malign foreigners are China&apos;s enemy and the cause of the century of &quot;national humiliation&quot; from the 1840s to the founding of the People&apos;s Republic in 1949. &quot;National humiliation&quot; is now commemorated in scores of freshly built museums and taught to successive generations of school children. Among China&apos;s enemies, Japan occupies a special place as a brutal territorial aggressor. China complains constantly, and unfairly, that Japan has failed to apologise for its war crimes; the visits of successive Japanese leaders to the Yasukuni shrine, with its unrepentant imperialist message, infuriates China every year. Both sides distort history. Japan&apos;s notorious school textbooks are vague on war crimes; Chinese accounts of Japanese atrocities in films and school history books spare no gruesome detail. Japan as the source of inspiration and finance for a generation of Chinese political reformers, including Sun Yatsen, China&apos;s democratic revolutionary leader, is all but forgotten. Both the Chinese nationalists (the Kuomintang) and the Communist party claim to have defeated Japan in the war of resistance; the larger theatre of the second world war, the role of the US and the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki take a back seat. Both governments have stoked nationalism for domestic purposes. Now they risk being held hostage to the indignation of the street. As Asia&apos;s geostrategic map shifts, such incidents, demonstrations and provocations will recur, stimulated by false histories and present ambitions. These are dangerous games, and both governments should ensure that more sober stories prevail. These maritime disputes are a test of Asia&apos;s capacity to co-operate for mutual benefit.

The Bain Files: inside Mitt Romney&apos;s tax-dodging Cayman schemes &gt;&gt; Gawker  Gawker has obtained a massive cache of confidential financial documents that shed a great deal of light on those finances, and on the tax-dodging tricks available to the hyper-rich that he has used to keep his effective tax rate at roughly 13% over the last decade.

Helen Edwards: TripAdvisor and the looming decline of user-generated content &gt;&gt; Marketing Blogs  The decline is yet to come - but here&apos;s what the scholars will tell: the flaws of the user-generated model were the inverse of its strengths, with the seeds of decline sown into the model itself.  User-generated sites such as TripAdvisor eventually begin to sag under the weight of their own banality. Millions of offhand comments - &apos;the breakfast was nothing special&apos; - become digitally ossified in the ever-sprawling tentacles of the site.  There they stay, creating an uncomfortable temporal tension. Whereas no-one would take seriously a guide book from 2002, there is something about the immediacy of the internet that lends unjustified currency to decade-old reviews.

Sedate, sleepy even, with quiet tree-lined streets flanked with semi-detached houses. There is little to indicate the extraordinary story that unfolded here in the years following the second world war. But it was in the Stoke Mandeville hospital \u2013 the last refuge for servicemen paralysed in battle \u2013 that the maverick neurologist Dr Ludwig Guttmann revolutionised the treatment and perception of spinal injury victims and laid the foundations for the modern Paralympic Games. On Tuesday night, his story \u2013 and the birthplace of the Paralympics \u2013 will be celebrated as the Stoke Mandeville stadium hosts a unique ceremony to create the Paralympic flame before it is carried into London via a 24-hour relay in time for the opening ceremony on Wednesday night. &quot;We have a unique heritage here and a responsibility to tell people about it,&quot; said Martin McElhatton, the chief executive of WheelPower, the national organisation for wheelchair sport based at Stoke Mandeville stadium. &quot;We know what our heritage is, we are proud of it \u2013 and London 2012 is a chance to celebrate it. We should be very proud as a nation that we gave the Paralympics to the world.&quot; Standing by the modest, but pristinely surfaced, running track at Stoke Mandeville where the flame will be lit, he explained that Tuesday&apos;s ceremony is a celebration not just of Stoke Mandeville&apos;s history but also its present. The stadium is still closely linked to the adjacent National Spinal Injuries Centre, one of the oldest and largest spinal injury centres in the world. &quot;Rehabilitation is still an essential part of what goes on here,&quot; he said. &quot;Not everyone can be a sporting star, but if a newly disabled person coming to terms with their injury can see people taking part in sport here it can inspire them and shows them what they can do.&quot; It is difficult to underestimate the impact Guttmann had on the treatment of spinal injuries. The doctor, who was Jewish, was the top brain surgeon in Germany before he was banned from practising medicine in 1933. After fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939 he set up the first specialist treatment centre for servicemen in 1944 at Stoke Mandeville hospital at the request of the British government, which anticipated a sharp increase in the number of men left paralysed after the D-Day landings. At a time when disabled people were shut away in residential homes, when soldiers paralysed in the war were brought to the ward in coffin-like boxes and left to die from infected bedsores and urinary tract infections, Guttmann \u2013 called Poppa by his patients \u2013 revolutionised treatment, introducing sports into rehabilitation and activities such as watch repairs and typing to prepare patients for productive lives in the outside world. &quot;He had a twinkle in his eye but he was very stern. You didn&apos;t get on the wrong side of him but underneath it he was very kind,&quot; said a former patient, Sally Haynes, who was paralysed from the waist down after a horse-riding accident when she was 18. &quot;He watched over you like a father in a way, to see your progress. He worked you out mentally.&quot; After her accident Haynes was put in a full plaster cast for two months before coming to Stoke Mandeville. With the help of Guttmann she went on to win a gold medal in fencing at the 1968 Paralympics. There is no doubting Guttmann&apos;s ambition for his patients. On 28 July 1948 \u2013 perhaps not coincidentally the opening day of the London Olympics \u2013 he chose to host a little-noticed archery and javelin competition for 16 paralysed men and women at the hospital. &quot;Small as it was, it was a demonstration to the public that competitive sport is not the prerogative of the able-bodied,&quot; he later said. From that point competitions were held every year, growing progressively larger, until war veterans and disabled people from around the world began taking part in what were known as the Stoke Mandeville Games. And in 1960, a week after the close of the 17th Olympic Games, the first Parallel Olympics \u2013 which would become the Paralympics \u2013 were held in Rome. &quot;We were guinea pigs. If you were in a wheelchair you didn&apos;t get on a plane,&quot; said Haynes, who went as a reserve to the first games and competed in the second in Tokyo in 1964. &quot;Guttmann was always telling us we were pioneers, we were leading the way.&quot; Once in Japan the team had fun \u2013 on one occasion convincing locals that the hokey-cokey was Great Britain&apos;s traditional dance \u2013 but the Games attracted little attention. When Haynes asked a BBC journalist why they did not cover the Games, he replied they were in bad taste. &quot;They didn&apos;t want to watch a bunch of cripples,&quot; she said. &quot;There is no comparison to now. In those days being in a wheelchair was a constant struggle, you just had to accept you couldn&apos;t do a lot of things or go to a lot of places.&quot; Reflecting on the competition that will start on Thursday \u2013 which will see 4,200 athletes from 165 nations compete \u2013 she said: &quot;I think the world has accepted us now. I didn&apos;t ever think we would get this far.&quot; Sport remains a key part of rehabilitation at the National Spinal Injuries Centre, according to Claire Guy, the rehabilitation programme lead. Where Guttmann started with 26 beds, the unit now has 114 and supports around 5,000 outpatients. &quot;The legacy we really hold on to is the sport. That hasn&apos;t really changed a huge amount since Guttmann&apos;s time,&quot; she said. When Daniel Alaile was admitted in 2010 after being stabbed in a gang-related fight in east London, the then 16-year-old had lost five stone, could barely move and was in constant pain. Now, sitting in the buzzing unit with its parallel bars, massage tables and walking frames, he is full of confidence, thanks in part to his rehabilitation, which included wheelchair basketball. &quot;I guess it gave me hope,&quot; he said. &quot;Like, OK, I&apos;m in a wheelchair, but there is still stuff I can do. I just don&apos;t feel sorry for myself. Crying ain&apos;t going to make things any better. You just have to take all the opportunities that are given to you.&quot; London 2012 is a powerful reminder of Guttmann&apos;s legacy, said Guy. &quot;In 1949, Guttmann said his aim was that the Stoke Mandeville Games be alongside the Olympics in level of importance and I think in London 2012 that has finally happened. This is what he wanted \u2013 sport and rehabilitation hand in hand. That is our legacy here.&quot; Guttmann, knighted by the Queen in 1966, died in 1980 but he would be bursting with pride at the prospect of the London 2012 Paralympics, according to his daughter Eva. &quot;He would see that for the first time they truly are the parallel games. It would be his dream realised,&quot; she said. &quot;It is very emotional for me, there will be a lot of tears, but they are tears of happiness. My father is not there tonight, but he will be there in spirit.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["If you&apos;re up to the task, then this week a subversive new computer game called Tokyo Sin SS: Deadlight District, in which players are tasked with murdering Nazi prostitutes, threatens the school&apos;s moral fibre."], "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-27T19:00:02Z", "title": "TV highlights 28/08/2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/27/islam-the-untold-story", "article": "Accused9pm, BBC1 For once largely eschewing social realism, there&apos;s more than a hint of Tales Of The Unexpected about the latest offering in Jimmy McGovern&apos;s drama series.

It&apos;s the same stadium and the same format, but these parallel games come with even greater ambitions. The vision of the Paralympics&apos; founder, Dr Ludwig Guttman, began with the commitment to show injured D-day veterans what they could still do \u2013 a contribution celebrated at Stoke Mandeville on Tuesday night, when the Olympic flame left his old hospital for the 24-hour journey to the Olympic Park. But now, Sir Philip Craven, the president of the International Paralympic Committee, would rather the word disabled was not used at all. A movement that sprang from one man determined to transform the self-belief of its participants now aspires to transform attitudes among the spectators. The athletes themselves might be out there to win a gold medal, but they are participants in an even more ambitious project. Timing, location and razzmatazz will all sustain the sense that the next 10 days are on a par with the Olympics. It is the first sell-out Paralympics. Only the lack of interest among the world&apos;s broadcasters betrays the distance still to travel to change the way the world thinks of people with disabilities. Yet if progress seems slow, look how far the movement has come: back in Tokyo, in 1964, the sight of &quot;cripples doing sport&quot; was considered too embarrassing to report. Now competition among sportsmen and women in wheelchairs or using prosthetic limbs is taken for granted. There is even overlap with the other Olympians, with both Oscar Pistorius and the Polish table tennis player Natalia Partyka competing in both forms of Olympics. There is a danger that the mechanics of the process will come between the competitors and the fans. There is an unavoidable commodification of limb use and torso power as committees debate the intricacies of categories of disability; there is, inevitably, some gaming of the criteria by the athletes themselves as they try to line up against others who look easier to beat. And sometimes, as the mechanical details are lovingly described, it can seem as if the contest is between prosthetic rivals rather than sporting ones. But for many disability activists the real target remains the idea that motivated Dr Guttman: how to turn the question of what can&apos;t be done into what can be. Paralympian crossbench peer Tanni Grey-Thompson fought for the cause unsuccessfully in debates earlier this year on the Welfare Reform Act, which is likely to lead to deep cuts in disability benefits when it&apos;s introduced in 2013. She argued that benefits should be understood as support to allow an individual to lead a productive and fulfilling life, not a system of compensation for what they can&apos;t do. If there can be a dividend from the growing number of young men and women who return from war zones missing arms and legs, or come through potentially limiting birth disorders like Lady Grey-Thompson herself, this is a change already overdue. The next 10 days will offer powerful stories of adversity overcome. Every Paralympian has, simply by being in London E20, triumphed in a way that deserves honouring. Their histories matter more than most. These extraordinary tales \u2013 equestrian Lee Pearson&apos;s long journey to nine gold medals, or the swimming prodigy Ellie Simmonds&apos; remarkably short one to Beijing glory \u2013 are what make them, to the rest of us, more than the sum of their disabilities. Of course, It is not possible to mitigate all the physical and mental impacts of severe illness or accident. But the impossibility of doing everything should not be a barrier to doing as much as possible. Take accessibility: a real victory would be the commitment to make all public transport work for everyone. That kind of major infrastructure investment rests on the transformation of public attitudes. It is time to take off the blinkers and see the talent. If the Paralympics do one thing, they will surely do that."}, {"sentences": ["The latest attempt was announced at a celebration of the series&apos; 25th anniversary in Tokyo on Wednesday."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "Film", "Film adaptations", "PlayStation", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-30T09:35:08Z", "title": "Metal Gear Solid movie announced", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/30/metal-gear-solid-movie-announced", "article": "After years of rumours and aborted projects, a Metal Gear Solid movie has been officially announced. Columbia Pictures has taken on the hit video game series, with Avi Arad set to produce. The Metal Gear games have long been acclaimed for their cinematic qualities, and series creator Hideo Kojima is a self-confessed movie geek. However, attempts to bring the futuristic stealth adventure to the big screen have so far failed. Boogie Nights and Moneyball producer Mike De Luca was working on an adaptation back in 2008, but that fell through two years later. The latest attempt was announced at a celebration of the series&apos; 25th anniversary in Tokyo on Wednesday. According to US game site, Kotaku, Arad, who founded Marvel Studios and produced the hugely successful Iron Man and Amazing Spider-Man movies, took to the stage during the event to announce the project. He told audiences that he saw video games as the comics of today, and that Columbia would take its time to ensure its movie captured the nuances of the Metal Gear universe.  Game adaptations do not have an illustrious history \u2013 to put it politely. From the risible Super Mario Bros and Street Fighter tie-ins of the early nineties to the excruciating straight-to-DVD travesties of German director/producer Uwe Boll, video game licenses have often been seen as a quick and easy way to make cash.  However, Hollywood has made many many millions over the past five years by taking comic books seriously \u2013 and now that it is running out of major superhero characters to bring to screen, it may well turn its gaze to video game brands. Arad already has two other big game adaptations on his books: the action adventure Uncharted and the sci-fi shooter inFamous. The Metal Gear series, which started out on the cult MSX computer in 1987, but became world famous when it hit PlayStation in 1998, would seem to be highly suitable for movie adaptation. The games are known for their long cinematic story sequences and film references. Plus, the convoluted plot, which involves espionage agent Solid Snake battling terrorist groups and rogue government agencies, is ripe for a long-running movie franchise.  Currently, the Metal project has no director and no actors attached, although Kojima expressed his admiration for Christopher Nolan.

It is clear to me that the coalition of 50 nations with troops in Afghanistan today will face formidable challenges over the next few years. However, there has been measurable and substantial progress in three specific areas. First and foremost, Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists, which was a primary goal of Nato member states. Second, Nato forces in Afghanistan have been training and operating alongside Afghan national security forces (ANSF) for many years now, and these efforts are delivering tangible results. Three-quarters of Afghan citizens now live in areas increasingly protected by Afghan army and police \u2013 who number today close to 350,000. Indeed, the capability and confidence of the ANSF has improved markedly over the last 18 months, to the point where it is making significant gains in the fight against the Taliban. As a result, this has been a particularly difficult summer for the insurgency, which has seen the elimination of two top-level commanders in the past few days alone. Over the next 28 months this progress will be expanded and solidified, so that the Afghan government will be fully in the lead for security by the end of 2014. This effort is on track and will succeed. Thirdly, the entire international community has made specific pledges to partner with Afghanistan over the long-term. At the recent Tokyo conference on Afghanistan, over 80 nations made significant commitments to finance the ANSF beyond 2014, and a generous programme of development and support will continue over the next four years. Afghan society is changing for the better every day. Today, there are more than 8 million children in 15,000 schools across Afghanistan, up from less than 1 million under the Taliban. Of the 8 million, 37% are girls; and of the 175,000 teachers, 30% are women. Mobile phones number over 18m, up from essentially zero under the Taliban. The economy has been growing by 5% annually for the past five years. At the recent Chicago summit, heads of state and government also confirmed that Nato will stay involved in Afghanistan (in a much smaller but vital training and mentoring role) post-2014, and planning is ongoing now to fulfil that commitment. All of these efforts will provide a firm platform of security and governance upon which the people and government of Afghanistan can build. I have no doubt that there will still be difficult days ahead. Recent attacks conducted from within the Nato-Afghan security partnership are certainly troubling. That is why we are taking concrete action to ensure we reduce the potential for these incidents in the future. But to put this issue in context, the vast majority of our soldiers continue to have a very different experience on the ground. Every day, over 100,000 coalition forces work successfully alongside their 350,000 ANSF counterparts without incident. The vast majority confirm a solid rapport between partners, and many call each other friends. Side-by-side, Afghan and international security assistance force troops are working to build lasting peace and stability for the people of Afghanistan. Challenges still lie ahead for our mission here, but the progress in terms of expanding and professionalising the ANSF is indisputable. We are executing this plan together with the Afghans, who are steadily taking charge, and we remain committed to following through with financial and training support post-2014. For these and many other reasons I firmly believe that, despite the many challenges, we will succeed in Afghanistan."}, {"sentences": ["He wants the European Central Bank to make good on a pledge to buy Spanish and Italian sovereign debt to reassure global markets that it will protect all 17 members of the eurozone Reuters reported that Tokyo spent a record \u00a58tn (\u00a364bn) in unilateral intervention in the currency market last autumn when the dollar hit a record low of \u00a575.31, and another \u00a51tn later in that year on undeclared forays."], "tags": ["Economics", "Business", "Japan", "World news", "Yen"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-31T11:48:00Z", "title": "Falling bond buying and rising yen present Japan with age-old problem", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/aug/31/japan-yen-bond-buying-problem", "article": "Japan is a safe haven for global investors. So much so that the yen has soared in value. Government pride that the country is loved by currency traders is offset by the resulting high value of the yen. Exports are already being hit. On a visit to London this week, Japan&apos;s top currency official said the time may have come to intervene. Takehiko Nakao, vice finance minister for international affairs, said in a speech in London: &quot;Exports have been influenced by supply chain changes and problems in Europe, some advanced economies and also in China. And we are also suffering from a very appreciated yen ... If needed we will take very decisive action in the market, that is our stance.&quot; Nakao is upset that the euro, which once challenged the yen and dollar as a safe haven, is now considered a joke. He wants the European Central Bank to make good on a pledge to buy Spanish and Italian sovereign debt to reassure global markets that it will protect all 17 members of the eurozone Reuters reported that Tokyo spent a record \u00a58tn (\u00a364bn) in unilateral intervention in the currency market last autumn when the dollar hit a record low of \u00a575.31, and another \u00a51tn later in that year on undeclared forays. The yen has risen almost a third since 2007, Nakao said. The dollar has lost around 7.5% against the yen in the last five months alone. Exports of Japanese manufactured goods are already expensive compared with Chinese and Korean equivalents. A high yen compounds the problem. One of Kyocera&apos;s solar panels can set back an environmentally conscious consumer twice as much as a Chinese rival. It will have 25 years of quality control tests behind it and a longer guarantee, but the up-front cost can be the difference between a sale and no sale. One response by ministers has been to subsidise local purchases. Solar panels are a case in point. With nuclear out of favour, the government has embarked on a huge solar panel installation programme. It&apos;s a fantastic plan from an environmental point of view, and probably helps Kyocera&apos;s profits, but needs to be paid for. The Japanese have proved reluctant to agree to rises in taxes since the 1990 property crash and have only just conceded to a rise in VAT from 5% to 8%. A lack of tax revenue to fund investment has forced the government to run up higher debts. Japan&apos;s debt to GDP ratio is the highest in the developed world at more than 200%. Luckily for the government it has an implicit, unwritten agreement with Japanese families, which is that all the money they don&apos;t pay in taxes must be invested in government bonds. Thereby government spending is not financed by tax revenues but from IOUs to Japanese investors. But this scheme is running out of steam. The ageing population is drawing more from its pensions and savings than it is squirrelling away. Therefore the capacity of Japanese households to buy bonds is diminishing. Nakao says the answer is monetary intervention in the form of currency selling to drive down the price. But yet again we are listening to an official reaching for a monetary policy solution when there are more fundamental reasons for the high value of the yen. They need to think of another way to organise the economy than via an export drive that recycles the profits into state spending via government bond buying."}, {"sentences": ["Following the Tokyo court decision, Samsung said in a statement it &quot;confirmed our long-held position that our products do not infringe Apple&apos;s intellectual property&quot;."], "tags": ["Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "iPhone", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Smartphone patent wars"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-03T08:04:32Z", "title": "Apple pushes for Samsung Galaxy S3, Note and Tab 10.1 tablet ban in US", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/03/apple-galaxy-samsung-us-ban", "article": "Samsung&apos;s flagship Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note smartphones, and its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet, could be banned in the US after Apple asked a federal court there to ban them as part of an ongoing lawsuit it is bringing against the South Korean company. The iPhone maker has added the phones to a case which is running in parallel to its just-concluded patent infringement case, where a jury awarded Apple $1.05bn in damages after deciding a number of Samsung phones and tablets had infringed various software patents as well as mimicking the iPhone&apos;s appearance. Meanwhile in Japan, Apple lost a claim against Samsung, where it alleged similar infringements, providing a welcome relief for Samsung, which has had few outright wins in the dozens of cases being fought in courts around the world between the two. In February, Apple alleged in a US case in northern California that at least 17 Samsung products infringe its patents. In a court filing made in San Jose federal court on Friday, Apple added four more products to the list of allegedly infringing products that have been released since the beginning of August 2011. A ban on the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Note would be a publicity hit for Samsung, for which the phones are high-profile emblems of its ambitions. Samsung is said to be the world&apos;s largest maker of both smartphones and mobile phones, and the Note and S3 phones have been big sellers and revenue-earners. Following the Tokyo court decision, Samsung said in a statement it &quot;confirmed our long-held position that our products do not infringe Apple&apos;s intellectual property&quot;.

For Robson to beat two former grand slam champions in Kim Clijsters and Li Na and then give Sam Stosur, the US Open title holder, the fright of her life, all in the space of a few days, nervelessly and with a joyous muscularity that only teenagers are wholly comfortable with, was a remarkable achievement. It exceeded her own expectations, took the tournament by surprise and gives her the sort of locker-room cachet that should be worth a point or two, at least, when she embarks on the Asian leg of her season in a week&apos;s time \u2013 although she dismisses that notion. What was most impressive about her Flushing Meadows adventure, paradoxically, was that she was disappointed in losing to Stosur, rather than satisfied with merely creating a stir with two upset wins, even though she will forever be remembered as the player who sent Clijsters into retirement. None of that mattered to a player who, impressively for an 18-year-old, can already see beyond the immediate horizon. It was a revelation to hear her put her achievements in perspective as, already, she is mentally packing her bags. &quot;I felt like I didn&apos;t play as well as I did in my last three matches,&quot; she said, and she was right \u2013 although her grit in saving eight match points belied the notion that she was merely hitting and hoping. That rearguard action towards the end of the second set, when she extended one game to 19 minutes and temporarily halted Stosur&apos;s hitherto untroubled march to victory, showed true character. If she can do it once, in the fourth round of a major, she can do it again; it was money in the bank. Her faults are still there to be corrected. She has improved her sluggardly movement quite a lot but knows there is more work to do. Her instinct to go for the early winner will often get her into trouble against quality players who can anticipate her stroke before she even makes it but it will also punish the meek. Robson has more power in her whipped forehand than most fully matured players in women&apos;s tennis and her serve grows stronger by the match, so those are weapons to be feared at any level. A little variety in a game that operates almost exclusively from the baseline would not hurt; her one attempt at a drop shot, and even then only rushing forward to reply to a neat chip by Stosur, dribbled into the net, evidence that it is not something she has given much attention to in training. Perhaps her new coach, Zeljko Krajan, who said beforehand that Robson &quot;doesn&apos;t even know herself how good she is&quot;, will attend to that. Maybe he will get her to impart more cut and slice on her defensive shots. But what he ought not do is tamper too much with the essence of her tennis. Robson is a teenaged force of nature, someone who loves belting the cover off the ball. &quot;I&apos;m just going to play my shots,&quot; she said before each of her giant-killing tasks here and she was as good as her word. As Stosur predicted, she came out swinging, not always judiciously but always with\u00a0menace. There was another aspect to her game that impressed as much as her power: her composure under pressure. Even when defeat looked certain and her game began to grow ragged, she showed no sign of imploding. To Robson this was still just a game of tennis, albeit the most important one of her career so far. Indeed it was the 28-year-old Stosur, who has a grand slam title to her name and has been playing at this level for 12 years, who appeared the more jittery when it looked briefly as if the match might go to a third set. Robson&apos;s demeanour hardly changed at all. After the euphoria comes the familiar grind of the circuit. She will take a week off, playing with her dogs, going through her shopping haul, taking calls from her friends and generally being a teenager before hitting the practice court again, then heading for the delights of a $220,000 tournament in Guangzhou, followed by Tokyo, Beijing and Osaka. But every day she will surely spare a moment to remember her extraordinary week in New York."}, {"sentences": ["21 September Tokyo Jungle (PS3 \u2013 digital only) Created by Sony&apos;s Japan studio with indie developer Crispy&apos;s this is easily the weirdest game on the list \u2013 and hopefully that won&apos;t put you off.", "Set in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo the game gets you to choose an animal from a large selection (including dogs, kangaroos, birds and big cats) and then simply survive on the mean streets, finding food, battling other critters and looking for mates."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "PlayStation", "PS Vita", "PS3", "Sony", "Nintendo", "3DS", "DS", "Wii", "Microsoft", "Xbox", "PC", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-04T11:06:00Z", "title": "The best games to play in autumn 2012", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/sep/04/best-games-autumn-2012", "article": "As you may have seen yesterday, the newspaper&apos;s G2 section featured an excellent autumn arts preview, featuring the best books, films and dance events to look forward to in the coming months.

So, on the off-chance there are people out there more likely to be looking forward to Assassin&apos;s Creed III than Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Royal Opera house, here are the big titles of this autumn&apos;s release schedule. We&apos;ll be doing an indie and smartphone round-up at some point too, but that takes longer because those crazy kids don&apos;t believe in release schedules. For now, though, get your Amazon wish lists ready, here are the mainstream treats of the autumn. Borderlands 2 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) The maniacal &apos;looter shooter&apos; returns with a new bunch of mercenaries raiding the planet Pandora for all its treasures while an evil corporation seeks to clear our all the undesirables. That&apos;s you by the way. Beautiful cell-shaded visuals mix with anarchic humour and a huge range of weapons to produce entertainingly eccentric carnage. Yes. Yes please. 21 September F1 2012 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) Codemasters has reinvented the concept of the motorsports simulation with its enthusiastic, knowledgeable and exciting F1 titles and this year&apos;s instalment should continue the good work. Along with all the cars, drivers and circuits from the 2012 season, F1 2012 boasts a Young Driver Test which teaches newcomers the basics of F1 driving. Luckily, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a theory test. 21 September Tokyo Jungle (PS3 \u2013 digital only) Created by Sony&apos;s Japan studio with indie developer Crispy&apos;s this is easily the weirdest game on the list \u2013 and hopefully that won&apos;t put you off. Set in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo the game gets you to choose an animal from a large selection (including dogs, kangaroos, birds and big cats) and then simply survive on the mean streets, finding food, battling other critters and looking for mates. It&apos;s an astonishing mix of genuinely grim sci-fi adventure and cutesy pet sim. 26 September  Fifa 13 (3DS, PC, PS3, Vita, Wii, Xbox 360) The behemoth of the sports sim calendar returns with some major mechanical tweaks including improved close-control and greater physicality. If you&apos;re connected to the web, it will also pull in real-world footie news and use it to colour your virtual experience. And of course, all the players, major teams and key world leagues are in place. 28 September Resident Evil 6 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) Survival horror returns in this &apos;something for everyone&apos; adventure, which provides three separate stories based around a worldwide zombie virus outbreak. Favourite characters such as Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield return, all of them showcasing different playstyles from Resi history. Could be an all-encompassing return to form, or a big pile of zombie droppings. We&apos;ll play it anyway. 2 October War of the Roses (PC) A cult hit at several gaming events over the summer, War of the Roses is a squad-based medieval combat sim, in which players join either the House of York or their Lancastrian rivals and indulge in tactical melee combat. The visuals are astonishing and while the multiplayer is clearly going to be bloody awesome, the single-player campaign promises depth and variety too. 2 October Dishonored (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) We called this dark steampunk adventure a game-of-the-year contender when we previewed it last month, and we&apos;re sticking with that. Created by some of the key people behind Deus Ex and Half-Life, it&apos;s an open-world adventure in which a betrayed assassin seeks revenge in a sprawling quasi-Victorian city. And you can posses rats. 12 October XCOM: Enemy Unknown (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) Back in the early nineties, the XCOM turn-based strategy games gave players the chance to command a secret government agency against alien attacks. Now Firaxis, the developer behind the famed Civilization series, has re-invented this tense and engaging experience for the modern era. It looks and plays beautifully, and will see off plenty of those long sodden November evenings. 12 October Fable: The Journey (Xbox 360) Peter Molyneux has now left Lionhead, but his final project at the studio was this much-debated Kinect-only fantasy road movie. Lead character Gabriel must travel across the dangerous land of Albion to rediscover his lost tribe and save a fair maiden. Along the way, he gets to look after his horse, using motion controls to ride and interact with it. Sort of a pet sim RPG then. What could possibly go wrong? 12 October Skylanders Giants (3DS, PS3, Wii, Xbox 360) Last year, Activision scored a massive hit with its ingenious Skylanders game, which combined collectible toy figures with an approachable family RPG. This time, they&apos;re adding a new bunch of \u2013 yes \u2013 giant figures, as well as a larger world and other extras. If you&apos;re the parent of a Skylanders fan, you&apos;re already being nagged about this. 19 October Forza Horizon (Xbox 360) A fresh take on the leading Xbox driving game series, swapping circuit-based thrills for a more rangey, open structure. The action takes place in and around a fictitious racing event in Colorado, where AI drivers can be challenged to competitions on the spot. To underline the festival feel, the soundtrack has been curated by Rob da Bank, so expect plenty of dubstep with your exotic vehicles. 26 October Lego Lord of the Rings (3DS, DS, PC, PS3, Vita, Wii, Xbox 360) Yep, another action adventure in the seemingly endless Lego series, but this one has a slightly darker feel and it cleverly uses dialogue from the movies to bring some authenticity to the setpiece-hopping narrative. We played it at E3 and enjoyed the ensemble feel with Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir all taking part on screen. 26 October Medal of Honor: Warfighter (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) This hyper-earnest military shooter has angered some by seeking to portray real-life combat zones and a range of authentic spec ops units. However, developer Danger Close is obsessed with respecting the lives and roles of the combatants it depicts and we&apos;re hoping that the game&apos;s apparent attempts to show the cost of warfare on the families of the soldiers is revealing and not mawkish. Expect top-end visuals and multiplayer, too. 26 October Assassin&apos;s Creed III (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) The time-spanning assassination adventure returns, this time bringing its blend of acrobatics and swordplay to the American revolution. The new lead character, Connor, is half British, half Native American, which puts him in an interesting position when the fight to control the continent begins. Expect lavish set-piece battles, beautiful visuals and some interesting multiplayer options. 31 October Need For Speed: Most Wanted (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) In 2010, Guildford-based developer Criterion revolutionalised the Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit series, adding gorgeous visuals, a sexy handling engine and the brilliant Autolog system, which let friends leave highscores for each other within the game world. Most Wanted is updating all the social elements, as well as providing a huge open city to explore and race in. And the multiplayer challenges are enormous fun. 2 November Halo 4 (Xbox 360) Bungie has gone and now Halo development duties are with Microsoft&apos;s own 343 Industries studio \u2013 so can the spirit of Master Chief survive? The jury is out at the moment, but with an epic story featuring the long dormant Forerunners, and an interesting multiplayer structure that ties the action closely to the campaign missions, this is an interesting attempt to kickstart a whole new Halo trilogy. 6 November Paper Mario: Sticker Star (3DS) Nintendo&apos;s cutesy handicraft role-playing series returns, this time in semi-glorious 3D, and with a fresh new gameplay element that challenges you to peel off and collect colourful stickers from the typically adorable environments. The 3DS needs some true must-have titles this Christmas and surely little Paper Mario can be posted in that pigeon hole. 11 November Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) Okay, okay, so this series has some serious detractors \u2013 and Treyarch&apos;s decision to set a Black Ops sequel in a near-future America under attack from its own drone army, has been questioned. But, hey, there do seem to be some genuine attempts to update the multi-million dollar recipe with some strategic gameplay and refreshed multiplayer. And might this be the last major Call of Duty title for this console generation? 13 November Hitman: Absolution (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) Square Enix may have shot itself right in the foot with that controversial &apos;sexy nun&apos; trailer, but a new instalment in the Hitman series of stealthy assassinate-&apos;em-ups will always pique the interest of fans who remember the glory days of Agent 47. Can the bald killer overcome sexism to reinstate his murderous gaming regime? Don&apos;t bet against him. 20 November Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) While the first title had some interesting ideas, melding a platforming adventure with painting elements and Disney history, it was let down by a roving camera and some repetition. This time, developer Junction Point says it has fixed the broken stuff and added a co-op element that sees Mickey teaming up with his predecessor Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. One for the family to snuggle around this winter. 23 November Far Cry 3 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) On the face of it, this looks like yet another shooter sequel with a superhuman lead character and dozens of faceless, vaguely ethnic enemies. But Ubisoft Montreal is promising that its island-based adventure, mixing open-world exploration with bizarre characters and a strange colonial story, is something much more offbeat and interesting. Heart of Darkness: the video game? 30 November New Little King&apos;s Story (Vita) Released on the Wii in 2009, the original Little King&apos;s Story was a glorious combination of real-time strategy, RPG and life sim, with players controlling a new monarch in a rich fantasy kingdom. Its enduring cult success has led to the promising Vita remake, featuring a more naturalistic art style and a refreshed story. TBA November Football Manager 2013 (PC/Mac) You know what to expect, of course. A huge database of players and teams as well as an intricate simulation of the manager&apos;s life, from training and tactics to coping with player meltdowns and media scandals. Expect the core engine and visuals to be overhauled at the very least, but I predict some more dramatic additions this time round.

Not, of course, that this would make deceptive practices, sexual exploitation or child abuse any less culpable. But why were intelligent, well-educated young people joining the movements in droves? One answer was heard more than any other. Our youth had not chosen to convert to a new religion; they had been brainwashed into leaving their universities, abandoning promising careers, and severing ties with their families in order to live in secluded communities, working long hours for their &quot;puppet masters&quot; and, in the case of those who came to be called &quot;Moonies&quot;, getting married by a Korean messiah in a mass wedding along with thousands of other couples to someone they had never met before and might not even speak English. Clearly, it was claimed, these were the victims of well nigh irresistible and irreversible mind-control techniques. With hindsight, some of our views of these cults need correcting. Although the colourful devotees and sannyasins and the persistent Unificationists were highly visible in public places, people were not joining in anything like the numbers that were being alleged. While estimates of the number of Unificationists in Britain topped a million, there were in fact fewer than 150 in 1976. It is true that thousands attended one or other of the residential weekends where the &quot;brainwashing&quot; was said to occur, but 90% did not join as a result. Of those who did, the majority left within a couple of years. Much as the movements tried to persuade people to join their ranks, and much as they would have like to have had greater persuasive powers, they demonstrably did not have access to the irresistible or irreversible techniques they were reputedly wielding. But things have changed. It is not that there are not still thousands of new religious movements to be found around the world \u2013 there are. Inform, the government-funded organisation that provides information on minority religions, has on its files over a thousand new religions that are currently active in the UK. But most people would be hard pushed to name more than a handful of these. Why? First, since 9/11, the public is now more concerned about Islamic terrorism than about cults. Second, although young (and older) people are still wanting answers to all sorts of questions about God, spirituality, the state of the world and their relations with others, they are less likely to turn to a new religion for their answers. Next, the movements themselves have changed quite radically. Those that caught the public&apos;s attention during the latter half of the past century (and are now well into a second- or even third-generation membership that is no longer so concerned with recruitment but, more frequently, with getting on in the outside world). Then the new ones that have since emerged tend to be more spiritual and far less institutionalised than the earlier movements. The Children of God no longer &quot;flirty fish&quot;; the vast majority of Krishna devotees are people of Asian origin who have found a place to carry out their traditional worship. Most Unificationists now live with their families and work independently of the movement. Those second-generation members that have stayed in the movement (although the majority have left) are likely to be married to someone their parents suggested, often with quite a bit of input from their children. Scientology is, perhaps, one of the few &quot;bogey cults&quot; that remains in the public eye, due partly to the number of high-level members who have recently left, and, no doubt, to the high-profile antics of Tom Cruise. Perhaps The Master, Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s acclaimed new film on the origins of Scientology, will provide us with some further understanding of &quot;the cult experience&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, raised the possibility of bringing the Senkakus under state control after Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, launched a controversial campaign in April to buy them.", "&quot;We are negotiating with the owner while we try to grasp where the situation stands between [the central government] and the Tokyo metropolitan government,&quot; said Japan&apos;s chief government spokesman, Osamu Fujimura.", "Ishihara&apos;s bid to bring the islands under the control of the Tokyo metropolitan government attracted more than 1.4bn yen in donations from the public, and threatened to inflict serious damage to Sino-Japanese ties.", "Ishihara, who has earned a reputation as a China-baiter, said the Senkakus&apos; owners had told him no deal had been finalised, while Tokyo officials said the governor was expected to visit the islands in the coming weeks."], "tags": ["Japan", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Senkaku Islands"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-05T14:24:27Z", "title": "Japan stokes tensions with China over plan to buy disputed islands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/japan-china-disputed-islands", "article": "Japan has set itself on a possible diplomatic collision course with China after agreeing to buy three islands in the East China Sea that are at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute with Beijing. Japan&apos;s media reported that the government would purchase three islands belonging to the Senkaku chain \u2013 known as Diaoyu in China \u2013 from private Japanese owners for 2.05bn yen (US$26m). The reports drew an angry response in China, which called the move illegal and invalid. &quot;For them to nationalise the Diaoyu islands seriously violates China&apos;s sovereignty and hurts the Chinese people&apos;s feelings,&quot; Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing. &quot;I stress again that any of their unilateral acts with the Diaoyu islands are illegal and invalid. China&apos;s determination will not change in terms of safeguarding its territory. China is observing the situation and will take necessary measures to defend its sovereignty.&quot; The uninhabited islands, which have been administered by Japan since 1895, attracted Chinese interest in the 1970s after studies suggested they could sit amid potentially huge deposits of oil and natural gas. They are also near vital sea lanes and surrounded by rich fishing grounds. The Senkakus are also claimed by Taiwan, but it is the competing assertions of sovereignty by Japan and China that have come to the fore in a summer of territorial tensions in east Asia. China has angered its neighbours, including Taiwan and the Philippines, with aggressive claims to islands in the South China Sea. Japan, meanwhile, has been locked in a separate disagreement with South Korea over a pair of islands located in the Japan Sea, known as the East Sea among Koreans. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, raised the possibility of bringing the Senkakus under state control after Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, launched a controversial campaign in April to buy them. Reports said the government and the owners are expected to sign a contract by the end of the month, following secret negotiations between a senior member of the family and the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Hiroyuki Nagahama. The government had previously leased three of the five islands comprising the chain. &quot;We are negotiating with the owner while we try to grasp where the situation stands between [the central government] and the Tokyo metropolitan government,&quot; said Japan&apos;s chief government spokesman, Osamu Fujimura. An announcement would be made &quot;when we reach a result after completing the process&quot;, he said. The dispute made international headlines in September 2010 when a Chinese fishing vessel collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the islands. In an attempt to prevent the row from escalating, Japan released the captain of the fishing boat without charge. Ishihara&apos;s bid to bring the islands under the control of the Tokyo metropolitan government attracted more than 1.4bn yen in donations from the public, and threatened to inflict serious damage to Sino-Japanese ties. Despite the nationalisation plan, Noda appears determined to lower tensions by agreeing not to build a jetty or other facilities on the island. Ishihara, by contrast, had hinted he would approve construction of a weather observatory and dock, adding that the Senkakus needed protecting from Chinese aggression. Ishihara, who has earned a reputation as a China-baiter, said the Senkakus&apos; owners had told him no deal had been finalised, while Tokyo officials said the governor was expected to visit the islands in the coming weeks. The most recent tussle ignited nationalist sentiment in both countries. Japan detained a group of Hong Kong-based activists after they landed on one of the islands last month, and there were protests in several Chinese cities after a group of Japanese nationalists did the same several days later."}, {"sentences": ["After the US Open, Murray will have ranking points to defend \u2013 he claimed a clean sweep in Asia last year winning in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai \u2013 before he heads back to London."], "tags": ["Andy Murray", "ATP World Tour Finals", "US Open Tennis 2012", "US sports", "US Open tennis", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-06T14:09:00Z", "title": "Andy Murray's US Open progress secures place in ATP World Tour Finals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/06/andy-murray-atp-world-tour-finals", "article": "Andy Murray&apos;s US Open quarter-final victory over Marin Cilic has guaranteed him a place in the ATP World Tour Finals at the end of the year.

Taras Grescoe is proud to be \u2013 in Thatcher&apos;s estimation, at least \u2013 a failure. Although he can drive, the Canadian author, who is in his mid-40s, has never owned a car. And he is not alone. Half the population of cities such as New York, Toronto and London do not own cars. Every day some 155 million people take the underground. And although being a straphanger in North America may be,\u00a0as Grescoe shows, a &quot;depressing experience&quot; due to underfunding and bad planning, elsewhere public transport \u2013 particularly in cities \u2013 is enjoying a renaissance. The heyday of the car has passed. In this passionately argued and important book, Grescoe takes the reader on a whistle-stop tour of world cities and their transport systems. He accuses the private car of destroying cities, turning streets into kill-zones for the vulnerable, polluting the air and burning up increasingly scarce fossil fuels. Although the scope of Straphanger is global, it clearly targets car-loving, gas-guzzling North America and the statistics he cites are truly shocking. In the US \u2013 &quot;the most extravagantly motorised nation in the history of the world&quot; \u2013 vehicles now outnumber drivers by five to four. Los Angeles, once hailed as an &quot;autopia&quot;, is now the most congested city in the US with drivers wasting 72 hours a year stuck in traffic jams \u2013 Americans now spend nine years of their lives sitting in their cars, and the pollution they produce kills 30,000 US citizens each year. But change is in the air. In 2009, the total number of cars in the US shrank. In its early days in office, the Obama administration conjured up visions of a new golden age of public transport, offering funding for ambitious rail and subway schemes. Streetcars, which used to be the main mode of public transport in American cities, are being reintroduced in such unlikely places as Houston and Denver and, in 2010, public transport use reached a 54-year high. In this suburban nation, people are also moving back into the cities. Recently released figures from the 2011 US census show that many of the largest cities are now growing faster than their suburbs, the first time this has happened in a century. This trend is being led by young Americans, many of whom are also choosing not to learn to drive but are instead relying on bicycles and public transport. Even New York&apos;s billionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is now known as the &quot;straphanger mayor&quot;, riding the subway a couple of times a week. Although, as Grescoe notes, he is taken to the subway stop by chauffeured SUV. Surprisingly for a book about public transport, London is not one of the cities Grescoe visits. Indeed the city is only mentioned for its &quot;criminally expensive&quot; tube tickets, the failed experiment of privatisation in 2003 and the lack of air conditioning (&quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;). Today more than a billion passenger journeys a year are made on the London Underground, a figure equalled by the subway system of New York and the Paris M\u00e9tro. Although Shanghai didn&apos;t open its first line until 1995, its rapidly expanding metro has now become the longest subway network in the world and Moscow&apos;s underground is one of the busiest, carrying nine million people a day, a figure matched only by Tokyo. Grescoe stops off at all these cities. It was in Paris that Blaise Pascal invented modern urban public transport in 1662 with the &quot;carosses \u00e0 cinq sols&quot;, carriages that ran along five fixed routes in the city, although sadly only for the gentry. Today the M\u00e9tro &quot;is the most ingenious and efficient transit network ever built&quot;. Parisian subway trains have been using autopilot technology since the 1970s but now fully automatic trains are being introduced. Grescoe is impressed by Shanghai&apos;s subway. Yet above ground the people have swapped bikes for cars, as they embrace a consumerist lifestyle. The result is congestion and pollution: the air in the city&apos;s streets has become a health hazard. Moscow&apos;s roads are also choked: it is &quot;traffic hell&quot;. But its palatial Metro, built in the 30s, is &quot;designed to ennoble and uplift the long-suffering straphangers of the world&quot;. In the Russian capital it&apos;s the only way to travel. In Tokyo he visits Shinjuku, with some 3.5 million commuters passing through every day. In comparison, the busiest station in the US is New York&apos;s Penn Station which handles a paltry 600,000 commuters. Grescoe is right to marvel at the &quot;fantastic clockwork&quot; of Tokyo&apos;s transport system: it is &quot;the world&apos;s best example of a transit metropolis \u2026 a city built, and now kept running, by its trains&quot;. Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, former mayor of the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1, which revolutionised its public transport with a bus rapid transit scheme, makes a powerful point to Grescoe: &quot;I believe a city is more civilised not when it has highways but when a child on a tricycle is able to move about everywhere with ease and safety.&quot; In too many places multi-lane highways have sliced through the cityscape, destroying communities and creating barriers between districts. But the act of driving also fundamentally changes the way people use the city. Inside cars, people are insulated from the sights and sounds of the city and isolated from other citizens. By contrast, public transport is a democratic and a social experience. In Tokyo someone tells Grescoe: &quot;To use public transport is to know how to cooperate with other people, how to behave in a public space.&quot; Good public transport is essential to the success of any world city. Grescoe argues that North America has fallen far behind Asia in its public transport infrastructure, and it &quot;will be paying the price, in terms of lost competitivity, for decades to come&quot;. This is a warning for every city. But even in North America a quiet revolution is taking place in the way people travel. And this is happening in cities everywhere, as people from Philadelphia (the city with the highest percentage of Americans who commute on foot) to Copenhagen (&quot;the world&apos;s most bikeable city&quot;) realise that the car is no longer an indispensable part of urban life in the 21st century. \u2022 PD Smith&apos;s City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age is published by Bloomsbury."}, {"sentences": ["\u2022 \u20ac899, eurospyshop.com What&apos;s new     Shibuya district, Tokyo, Japan.", "The seven-night stay in Tokyo (pictured) includes an introduction to Japanese culture and a tour of the city, as well as assistance with finding a work placement, long-term accommodation and a\u00a0language school."], "tags": ["Travel", "Highlands holidays", "Tangier holidays", "Yoga holidays"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-07T21:45:04Z", "title": "Travel news roundup: yoga in Scotland and jazz in Tangier", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/sep/07/corkboard-yoga-scotland-tangier-morocco", "article": "Escapism Daily downward dogs are just part of the story at EcoYoga, an off-grid retreat in Argyll, Scotland.

The findings are published in the 2013 London edition of Zagat, the &quot;burgundy bible&quot; and restaurant guide which claims to be most comprehensive survey yet. It notes that after numerous closures forced by economic gloom, the revival has been sparked by a trend away from formal fine dining towards value-for-money eating out. Popular but notoriously expensive restaurants such as Dinner by Heston Blumenthal and Gordon Ramsay at Claridge&apos;s are rated highly for making their food affordable through fixed price lunches. While The Wolseley has been voted the most popular in London, the Knightsbridge-based Dinner entered the top 10 most popular restaurants at number nine. A meal here featuring the chef&apos;s trademark molecular gastronomy \u2013 including his legendary meat fruit \u2013 will give you little change out of \u00a3100. The guide admits: &quot;The cost is substantial, but odd as it may be to say it&apos;s good value considering you won&apos;t get this experience anywhere else.&quot; It hails the fixed price lunch as &quot;a stunning bargain&quot;. Others in top ten include Hakkasan at number two, followed by stalwarts Le Gavroche, The Ivy, RiverCafe, Ledbury, Gordon Ramsay, J Sheekey and Gordon Ramsay at Claridge&apos;s in tenth spot. With a record 1,995 restaurants rated and reviewed by another record 9,583 surveyors \u2013 diners who submit reviews \u2013 this is Zagat&apos;s biggest survey of London&apos;s culinary scene. Its participants sampled 1.1m meals over the past year \u2013 nearly 3,000 a day \u2013 rating them on food, decor, service and cost. Among the restaurant openings in the last year are high-profile newcomers such as Pitt Cue Co, Dabbous, Pizarro, Burger &amp; Lobster and Cut at 45 Park Lane, which have all made their mark by achieving very high ratings soon after opening. Pitt Cue Co and Burger &amp; Lobster are among the many American-inspired debuts and carnivores&apos; delights \u2013 the former a Soho-based restaurant of &quot;serious BBQ meat action&quot; and the latter with no formal menu and just one price for \u2013 of course \u2013 a burger or toothsome lobster with fries. Many more openings are due this autumn, including big names from New York \u2013 Balthazar, La Esquina, STK and Standard Grill. Other high profile debuts include The Delaunay and Brasserie Zedel \u2013 opened by the restaurateurs behind The Wolseley. Among other pedigreed premieres from British chefs are Mark Hix&apos;s Hix Belgravia and Tramshed, and Jamie Oliver&apos;s Union Jacks. The high standard of food and service offered by the 62 &quot;notable new entrants&quot; has led 40% of the guide&apos;s reviewers to claim that the quality of the capital&apos;s culinary scene is higher than it was a year ago., while only 3% said that it had got worseOn a 30-point scale, London is rated overall 25 for culinary diversity, 22 for creativity, 14 for hospitality and only 13 for table availability Zagat \u2013 which began modestly in New York 33 years ago \u2013 was acquired by Google last September. Co-founder Tim Zagat said the new ownership would lead to Zagat being further expanded to cover reviews of restaurants in the whole of the UK: &quot;This is a tremendously exciting time for us and we look forward to getting more people involved in reviewing beyond the London area. There is a lot to report. As this year&apos;s guide shows, people no longer care about fancy white tablecloths and crystal when it comes to eating out. There are some fabulous new restaurants out there \u2013 many of which started out doing street food \u2013 serving fantastic food at a great price.&quot; Despite the ongoing economic downturn and the squeeze on spending, diners say they are spending 30% more in the capital&apos;s restaurants this year than last. But they are still eating out an average of 2.2 times a week \u2013 the same as last year and well below the rates in New York, Paris and Tokyo, which run from 3 to 4 times a week. When it comes to what Londoners want to eat, the flavour of the year goes to Italian cuisine (25%) followed by French (17%) and Japanese (14%). Ironically, Londoners rate French restaurants more highly than Italian but they eat far more frequently in Italian establishments. But there&apos;s a thumbs-down for British cusine, with only 1 in 10 diners naming it as their favourite.

And they confirm growing competition for international students \u2013 and reliance on their fees - in leading universities all over the world, not just in the traditional host countries. Even some universities in the top 100, like Cambridge, that have registered modest increases in overseas student numbers, have been overtaken on this measure. The top 500 universities in the QS rankings have added no fewer than 120,000 international students in the latest edition. The figures demonstrate why universities of all types were so concerned at the UK government&apos;s tightening of visa regulations, culminating in the suspension of London Metropolitan University&apos;s licence to sponsor students from outside the EU. University College London, which has overtaken Oxford to move into fourth place, has almost 10,000 international students. It is growth in international faculty that accounts for MIT&apos;s move to the top of the rankings for the first time, however. The university has overtaken both Cambridge and neighbouring Harvard to take first place, having led 11 of the 29 subject rankings published by QS in June. MIT is one of a number of universities specialising in science and technology to improve their positions this year. Nine of the top ten technological universities have moved further up the rankings, with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology enjoying the biggest rise in the top 100. Scores in the QS rankings comprise an equal balance of expert opinion and data on staffing levels, research citations and international students and faculty. More than 46,000 academics and 25,000 employers have contributed their views in the most extensive polling ever undertaken on global universities. American universities dominate the QS rankings, as they have every year since they were first published in 2004. US institutions occupy six of the top ten places, 13 of the top 20 and 31 of the top 100 \u2013 the same numbers as last year. Harvard, in third place, remains the favourite of both academics and employers. It also tops four of the five broad faculty rankings published with the institutional ranking. The UK is again the next most successful country, although it has lost one university from the top 20, one from the top 100 and one from the top 200. Its four universities in the top ten and 18 in the top 100 show a system continuing to punch well above its weight. The strong performance of UK universities will surprise some observers but, with research funding protected in cash terms and revenue from international students rising, the leading institutions have not experienced the level of cuts suffered by some of their competitors. Even the wealthy US Ivy League institutions have reined back spending as they tried to repair the damage done to their endowments during the recession. Academics and employers continue to rate UK universities highly and the leading institutions have begun to make significant progress on the key measure of research quality \u2013 the number of citations per academic. All but three of the top 20 UK universities achieved higher citation rates than last year, although they still have ground to make up on their American counterparts. The results will give little encouragement to those predicting a wave of UK student emigration to the universities of Continental Europe, where fees are much lower than in England. The nine leading French universities have all dropped down the ranking, while there are no German or Dutch universities in the top 50. ETH Zurich is by far the highest-placed Continental university, at 13th. Canada has two universities in the top 20 for the first time, with Toronto joining Montreal&apos;s McGill University among the elite. But Australia again has more universities in the top 100 than any country outside the US and UK. Asian universities continue to make progress up the rankings and to attract more international students, rather than simply being the favoured recruiting ground of Western institutions. Hong Kong University, the National University of Singapore and the University of Tokyo all appear in the top 30. A record 72 countries are represented among the 700 universities that will feature in the full ranking. The six leading universities in the Middle East have all improved their positions and there has been a big increase in the number of Latin American universities ranked globally. Overall, the institutional ranking is more stable than it has ever been. There is only one new entrant to the top 20 and the average movement in the top 100 is 4.6 places, while in the top 200 the average is 9.1. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

We sent samples out - there was a lot of work that went into just getting the samples across to Japan - and we won the taste test over there. We then had to fill out a load of paperwork for them which we went about more efficiently than other companies. The firm&apos;s president came over in January to look around the brewery, look around Yorkshire and then they went away and placed the order with us and so far more than 1,000 kegs have been sent out. We now represent the UK in the World Beer Museum under the new Skytree tower in Japan. The English beers are served with traditional English dishes such as fish and chips and we have just sent out some Yorkshire pudding trays!

The venue will host a permanent display of paintings by the late Ian Stephenson RA, as well as regular exhibitions and also concerts and performances. Originally built as a Presbyterian church in 1848, the turretted building on the south bank of the Tweed was, more recently, the Kingdom Hall of the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses, who blocked up all the windows. Kate Stephenson, widow of Ian Stephenson, and the developer of this centre, has re-opened many of the original windows, letting in plenty of natural light, and created a huge rectangular hall which will act as both art gallery and performance space. She insists that the name refers to Bob Dylan&apos;s All Along the Watchtower song, and not to the Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses&apos; magazine. Downstairs is a fully equipped sound-proofed digital recording studio and a practice room which will be available to local musicians and bands.     One of Ian Stephenson's paintings    High on the walls on the main hall are a series of large-scale works by Ian Stephenson, who died in 2000. These are here to stay \u2013 as the art critic William Feaver said at the official opening this week:   They needed scaffolding to put up, and they&apos;re not coming down again any time soon.   Stephenson was an abstract pointilliste painter whose works are in the Tate, as well as in the Arts Council and British Council collections. He was one of the first abstract artists to be elected to the Royal Academy, and his works feature in Michaelangelo Antonioni&apos;s cult 1960s film Blow Up. Stephenson created his works using a spray with specks and dots of paint falling onto a horizontal surface, building up layers of colour and pattern. His Polychromatic G was acquired by the Tate when the artist was only 28, and there are now 17 of his works in the Tate collection. He had a major solo exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in 1977. As well as being an artist, he was also influential as a teacher at Chelsea School of Art and at Newcastle University. Since his death, exhibitions of his work have been mounted at the Baltic and at the De La Ware Pavilion, as well as at the Berwick Gymnasium Gallery.     Mali Morris' Hoopla, 2008    As well as Stephenson&apos;s paintings, the gallery is showing many works from his own collection. These are an eclectic mix, from abstract works by John Hoyland, to paintings, prints and drawings by Hockney, John Bellany, Richard Hamilton and many others, and also many 19th century watercolours and oils of local scenes \u2013 Bamburgh Castle, Lindisfarne and so on.     Stephen Lewis' Pressure Drop    In the main space, at eye-level, there will be regularly changing exhibitions. In the first, Lancashire-born Stephen Lewis&apos; steel sculptures stand on plinths in the main section of the gallery, with abstract paintings by his partner Mali Morris, RA, on the walls underneath the huge Stephenson works. Lewis has exhibited in Holland, Germany and New York as well as extensively in the UK, while Mali Morris, who was a student at Newcastle University when Ian Stephenson was teaching there in the 1960s, was elected to the Royal Academy in 2010. She has had three solo shows in Tokyo and two in New York. Mark Irving&apos;s &quot;Glimpses&quot; can also be seen, in a single-storey section underneath the mezzanine gallery. The Berwick-based artist recently won an award from the Royal Society of Wildlife Artists and has exhibited at the Society of St Ives Artists&apos; Open and at the Royal Scottish Academy.     A seascape by Mark Irving    Next week the front of the building will be the screen for a projection of work by photographer Amit Madheshiya as part of the Berwick Film &amp; Media Arts Festival, which runs from September 18-23. The next exhibition at the Watchtower will be the Berwick Open Art Exhibition in October. According to Kate Stephenson:   We will be running a Best in Show competition voted for by visitors, the prize for which will be entry into the selection process for next year&apos;s summer show at the Royal Academy of Art in London.

And rightly so, because the story of how British sport staged a startling turnaround in just 16 years is not only fascinating in its own right, but instructive in thinking about how we rebuild a shattered economy. The story can be briskly told: after Britain scored a solitary gold at Atlanta in 1996, lottery money was pumped into elite sports, with special regard for how many medals could be won per pound spent. Around the same time, the Manchester velodrome and other world-class facilities sprang up and top-drawer coaches, such as cycling&apos;s Dave Brailsford, were brought on board. Physios and psychologists were laid on for the athletes; engineers and technologists streamlined the kit. The results we saw at the London Olympics: the best British performance in any Games for over a century. And, without wishing to take anything away from Mo Farah and other sporting heroes, such across-the-board outperformance was largely thanks to record investment, gimlet-eyed targeting and dogged planning. Compare this tale of triumph to the sorry story of Britain&apos;s industrial base. Since the 80s, even to mention the need for an industrial strategy was to risk dismissal from mainstream politicians as picking winners. Labour was as guilty of this as any son-of-Thatcher. It was pious nonsense, of course: politicians would love to pick winners; it&apos;s being lumbered with losers they can&apos;t stand. But the result has been to leave Britain as the only major economy without an industrial strategy, the only G8 country without a national investment strategy, and pretty much the only advanced country without a serious regional development policy. Britain is virtually the only big country in the world that thinks it can grow industry without having an actual strategy to do it. And the results of that neglect have been brought home in the wake of the banking crash, which has shown up the lopsidedness of Britain&apos;s boom-time economy. It&apos;s against that background that Mr Cable&apos;s intervention should be understood. The Lib Dem is by instinct a deregulator (which isn&apos;t necessarily the same thing as trashing employment rights, whatever the Conservative right may like to think); indeed, just a few years ago he called for the abolition of the same Whitehall department he now heads. Yet on Tuesday he called for a government strategy to develop new and existing industrial strengths. This was a bold move which deserves wider encouragement. A full-fledged Wiggo plan it is not: the government has no idea how much any of its schemes will cost, nor where the money will come from. Apart from aviation, cars and pharmaceuticals, there are frustratingly few specifics about which sectors should benefit. Most crucially, Mr Cable did not spell out what an industrial policy is for. To provide good new jobs? His speech did not so much as mention the words, yet jobs should surely be front and centre in any such plan. To diversify sources of tax revenue? Surely vital. To provide for future social needs? That would imply, say, improving care for the elderly \u2013 just as Japan plans to in its latest industrial strategy \u2013 but such activities do not fall into the category of &quot;knowledge-intensive services&quot;. Such questions can&apos;t be addressed in a single day. Labour&apos;s Chuka Umunna, who has made thoughtful contributions to this debate, is also a long way from setting much down in policy. But the risk is that other countries are much further down this road. Tokyo has not only identified key sectors; it has thought about how to direct monetary policy to help them. The US has a full-blown venture capital sector \u2013 and state finances on hand too. Joining up Britain&apos;s future needs and opportunities with its present capabilities is a job that will probably pay little reward to the politicians who begin it. For that alone, Mr Cable deserves commendation. But he and the rest of our political class also need to be pushed much further and much harder."}, {"sentences": ["In one work conflating art history with recent news stories, nude figures recalling traditional Japanese erotic prints stretch their limbs around a map of Tokyo&apos;s subway \u2013 a place notorious for sexual harassment."], "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "Maps"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-12T09:33:20Z", "title": "Artist of the week 207: Adam Dant", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/12/artist-week-adam-dant", "article": "Adam Dant&apos;s hyper-detailed drawings are like objects magicked out of a fictional realm. With their ornate borders and trompe l&apos;oeil crinkled edges, his fantastic maps, books and charts navigate worlds whose strange territory seems to depend on figures of speech or even hallucinations. His Bureau for the Investigation of the Subliminal Image included studies of self-portraits supposedly hidden in paintings in the Louvre. Dant meticulously documented these concealed images, apparently rendered subconsciously by artists, as if they were part of orthodox art history. Elsewhere, he has turned categorisation itself on its head with &quot;underneathism&quot;, painstakingly depicting from below everything from supermarkets to beach life. His peculiarly British wit extends to social satire: the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie are among the tabloid favourites whose public personas Dant has imaginatively unpicked, earning him comparisons with Hogarth. Furthermore, his works \u2013 especially Donald Parsnips Daily Journal, one of his first projects \u2013 frequently resemble the output of an 18th-century press. They&apos;re more like pamphlets to be pored over in coffee shops, not galleries. Trained as a graphic designer, Dant is an adept practitioner of traditional printing methods, a skill he acquired almost by chance when he took a student exchange place at an Indian university in the 1980s, and was surprised to find himself presented with wood and chisel, unaware that graphic design in India then meant print-making. In the late 1990s, he handed out 100 copies daily of the Parsnips journal to an unsuspecting readership in London, Paris, Cairo and beyond. His latest works go back further, to Renaissance analogies between the body and cities and architecture. Meanwhile, From the Library of Dr London consists of huge drawings depicting maps in antique books. They chart the world&apos;s major metropolises not as grids of streets, but in terms of what they make us think of. In one work conflating art history with recent news stories, nude figures recalling traditional Japanese erotic prints stretch their limbs around a map of Tokyo&apos;s subway \u2013 a place notorious for sexual harassment. In another, the main thoroughfares of Paris, a city whose guidebook splendour belies revolution-era France&apos;s socialist ideals, are mapped on to the bones of Liberty. Why we like him: For British Drinking, depicting revelry on Shoreditch&apos;s Redchurch Street. Dant has witnessed this little road around the corner from his studio grow into a hub for East End nightlife, and here he packs it with characters who each embody slang for getting drunk, including badgered, mullahed and Dot Cotton (rhyming slang for rotten). A dishevelled Boris Johnson is &quot;drunk as a lord&quot;. Weird science: Dant is a member of the London Institute of &apos;Pataphysics, a continuation of Alfred Jarry&apos;s &quot;science of imaginary solutions&quot;. Members of its European equivalents have included Umberto Eco and one of Dant&apos;s big influences, the literary group Oulipo. Where can I see him? At Hales Gallery, London, to 6 October.

Fascinating curiosity \u2026 The Bear Fight, 1974, by Sigmar Polke. Photograph: The Estate of Sigmar Polke    A section of works by South African David Goldblatt seems to go on for ever. Always worth returning to, Goldblatt is, however, extremely well-known. A second South African, Ernest Cole, covers the apartheid era from a black perspective. Cole, who died in poverty and exile in Sweden, richly deserves his presence here. The late German artist Sigmar Polke&apos;s 1974 series of a bear being baited by dogs, surrounded by grinning Afghanis, is a fascinating curiosity. The greyed and blotched photographs are startling things. They have been seen as premonitions of Afghanistan&apos;s looming war with the Russian bear, but like much of Polke&apos;s work, their meaning remains elusive. This is surely part of Polke&apos;s point (he was probably a tad unhinged when he made these, while on his drug-addled Grand Tour, and the images evince a kind of muzzy, stoned paranoia). The way they deal with danger and violence could not be more unlike British photojournalist Larry Burrows&apos; large-scale and filmic scenes from Cambodia and the Vietnam war.     A work by Boris Mikhailov. Photograph: Boris Mikhailov    One of the questions the show raises, says curator Kate Bush, is whether we are prepared to erase the distinction between art and documentary photography. I, for one, have never worried too much about such things. Going from William Eggleston&apos;s photographs to Bruce Davidson&apos;s of the civil rights era, you ask what the link might be. Perhaps what Eggleston photographs, intuitively and beautifully, is a kind of southern mindset and emotional tenor; a sort of deep background to the situations Davidson records. But the comparisons don&apos;t tell us very much, nor do the differences between approaches and subjects. Everything Was Moving is better as a book than a show, and better taken as a series of solo exhibitions \u2013 most of which don&apos;t go deep enough. There is an enormous gulf, say, between Burrows (who died in Laos in 1971) and the black-and-white portraits by the wonderful Graciela Iturbide; a total change of register and intent. Burrows&apos; photograph of a US soldier crying in shock, and Iturbide&apos;s portrait of Our Lady of the Iguanas, a proud woman whose head is covered by live reptiles, are worlds apart. For me, Iturbide is one of the discoveries of this show. Is there a connection between a jukebox on a wall in Los Alamos, shot by Eggleston, and a soldier&apos;s helmet to which the skull has fused, in a photograph by Tomatsu? If there is, it has nothing to do with photography, though it might have something to do with Los Alamos, where the atomic bomb was developed, and Nagasaki, where it was dropped. We scuttle back and forth, in time and space."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest after surveillance ships entered the area around the island group \u2013 known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan \u2013 which is controlled by Japan.", "It became even more fraught when Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara said the city would buy and develop the uninhabited islands from their private owners, who are Japanese."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "Japan", "Commodities", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-14T10:15:11Z", "title": "China and Japan relations tense after standoff over disputed islands", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/china-japan-senkaku-diaoyu-islands", "article": "A standoff between Chinese and Japanese ships in disputed waters claimed by both countries has increased concern about the growing tensions in a long-simmering territorial row in the East China Sea. Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest after surveillance ships entered the area around the island group \u2013 known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan \u2013 which is controlled by Japan. Vessels from the two countries radioed each other with warnings to leave the waters. There were signs of the row spilling over at street level: a Japanese man in Shanghai was reportedly injured when hot noodles were thrown into his face\u2013 the sixth such attack in recent days. Brad Glosserman, executive director at Honolulu&apos;s Pacific Forum CSIS, told Reuters: &quot;The dangers of miscalculation are real.&quot; Taylor Fravel of the security studies programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: &quot;Neither side wants to see the situation spiral out of control, but both felt that they had to act. We should be concerned, but it has not yet crossed a point of no return.&quot; The island group is surrounded by rich energy resources and fisheries. The sovereignty dispute reignited when both Chinese and Japanese activists landed there last month and protests broke out in several Chinese cities, with attacks on Japanese cars and businesses. It became even more fraught when Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara said the city would buy and develop the uninhabited islands from their private owners, who are Japanese. The central government then arranged to buy them, despite Beijing&apos;s protests. &quot;From the Japanese side it was the best outcome\u00a0\u2026 Ishihara is extremely rightwing and ultra-nationalist and if he controlled these islands there is no telling what he might do with them. It seems almost like he wants to provoke China on this. The Japanese government clearly does not,&quot; said Ian Storey, an expert on maritime issues at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Although Chinese vessels have entered the area before, their voyages have not been announced. This time the foreign ministry in Beijing said the ships were there to conduct maritime surveillance and that China was carrying out a mission of &quot;law enforcement over its maritime rights&quot;. Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told reporters: &quot;We lodged a strong protest and also we made a strong case that the Chinese side should leave from the territorial waters around the Senkaku islands. &quot;I&apos;d like to underscore that we should never let the situation escalate and we have strong hopes for the Chinese to respond in an appropriate and calm manner.&quot; Kyodo news agency reported that the Chinese ships withdrew from the disputed waters on Friday afternoon. China is Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner. But deep-rooted popular mistrust endures, fuelled by memories of the brutality of the Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. Complicating matters further is the impending leadership change in China and a looming election in Japan. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, warned that the possibility of military conflict could not be eliminated. &quot;Chinese leaders actually talk tough and act carefully, but sometimes it&apos;s out of your control. Chinese public opinion has become so powerful. They have to talk very, very tough. By doing so, they will help enhance the tensions,&quot; he told AP. With popular feeling running high, Beijing saw small scale anti-Japanese protests on Thursday and Friday. One shopping centre in the capital was showing images of anti-Japanese demonstrators and the Diaoyu islands on its giant screen, rather than the usual entertainment videos. The phrase &quot;the Diaoyu Islands are China&apos;s&quot; appeared almost 2.5m times over 24 hours on the popular Sina Weibo microblog, although it was outnumbered three-fold by references to the iPhone 5. Earlier this week, one man even set fire to his own Honda vehicle in protest against Japan. Some Chinese travel agents have reportedly cancelled tours to Japan and Japanese businessmen told Reuters that officials have asked firms to cancel or postpone public events and major sales promotions.

Japan, the world&apos;s third biggest user of nuclear power before the disaster, had planned to increase nuclear&apos;s share of the energy mix to 50% by 2030. But the country&apos;s attachment to nuclear power was severely weakened after the Fukushima accident sent radioactive materials into the ocean and atmosphere, contaminated the food and water supply, and forced the evacuation of 160,000 residents. &quot;Based on facing the reality of this grave accident and by learning lessons from the accident, the government has decided to review the national energy strategy from scratch,&quot; read a policy document released on Friday. &quot;One of the key pillars of the new strategy is to achieve a society that does not depend on nuclear energy as soon as possible.&quot; The decision comes after two months of public consultations and the largest anti-nuclear demonstrations Japan has ever seen.

In the short-term, however, the shift will force Japan to increase its already heavy dependence on oil and natural gas, calling into question its ability to reach internationally agreed CO2 emissions targets. &quot;This is a strategy to create a new future,&quot; a policy statement said, after key ministers finalised the decision on Friday. &quot;It is not pie in the sky. It is a practical strategy.&quot; The report says Japan should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% from 1990 levels and to reduce energy consumption through greater efficiency by about 10% from 2010 levels. Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision, but said the phase-out should have come much earlier. &quot;The government&apos;s strategy involves a nuclear phase-out nearly two decades later than needed,&quot; said Kazue Suzuki, Greenpeace Japan nuclear campaigner. &quot;It also provides clarity for the business community that renewable power, not nuclear, is the future. &quot;For too long Japan&apos;s leaders have ignored their people and gambled the health, safety and economic stability of every citizen on nuclear power, and as the people of Fukushima continue to suffer, so does the rest of our country. This announcement must become law, otherwise it will be seen as nothing but lip service to buy votes before the coming election.&quot; The report does not specify how the expensive shift to renewables would be funded, or how to minimise the environmental impact of greater fossil fuel use. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, will be hoping that the decision boosts support for his unpopular administration ahead of a general election expected in November. Recent opinion polls showed most Japanese preferred a phase out over two other options proposed by the government that gave nuclear a limited role. &quot;We are only at the starting line,&quot; Noda said. &quot;Now we are going to begin an extremely difficult challenge. No matter how difficult it is, we can no longer put it off.&quot; However, if, as many expect, Noda&apos;s party is replaced by a more conservative administration after the next election, there is no guarantee that the no-nuclear policy will survive. Japan was briefly without nuclear power earlier this year after all 50 working reactors were closed for safety checks. No restarts were permitted until the reactors passed stress tests introduced in the wake of the Fukushima crisis and gained the approval of local authorities. The move away from nuclear has caused concern among Japan&apos;s allies. Japan provides nuclear technology expertise to companies in the US, while France and Britain, which reprocess its spent nuclear fuel, have sought assurances that it will continue to accept high-level radioactive waste created by reprocessing. In June, Noda approved the restart of two reactors in western Japan amid fears that the country would experience power cuts during the summer. He has come under sustained pressure from business leaders not to abandon nuclear, amid warnings that power shortfalls and the high cost of renewables could stifle production and derail attempts to kick-start the country&apos;s export-led economy. But some analysts said a serious shift towards renewables could benefit the economy. &quot;A total exit from nuclear is positive for the economy, on balance,&quot; said Andrew Dewit, a professor at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. &quot;It incentivises Japan&apos;s political economy to focus on efficiency and renewables. Japan lags in both these areas and they offer the greatest opportunities for growth.&quot; The phase-out will be achieved by retiring reactors, which were built between the early 1970s and 2006, when they reach the end of an agreed 40-year life span. The report said, however, that some could be restarted before they are closed permanently provided their safety is confirmed by a new regulatory body. &quot;We will launch all possible policy measures to achieve a nuclear-free society by the 2030s,&quot; the report said. &quot;Until the total phase-out we will only use nuclear reactors that are confirmed safe.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The oldest woman is Koto Okubo, a 114-year-old resident of Kawasaki, just outside Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Older people", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-14T17:02:43Z", "title": "Japan's centenarian population reaches more than 50,000", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/japan-centenarian-population", "article": "That Saburo Shochi completed a round-the-world trip using only public transport was impressive enough; that he did so at the age of 106 was even more remarkable. Yet in his native Japan, there is no shortage of contemporaries with whom he can celebrate his feat. According to government data released on Friday, he is one of more than 50,000 Japanese people aged 100 or more. The health and welfare ministry survey shows the number of centenarians will rise to 51,376 by Saturday, up 3,620 from last year. The figures, released before the country&apos;s annual respect the aged day on Monday, reinforce Japan&apos;s reputation for longevity, although its women recently relinquished their place at the top of the global life expectancy table to their counterparts in Hong Kong. On Monday, those who reached their 100th birthday in the past year will receive a silver cup and a congratulatory letter from the prime minister. The average lifespan of Japanese women fell by 0.4 years to 85.9 in 2011, putting it behind that of women in Hong Kong, who averaged 86.7 \u2013 a shift A slight fall in female life expectancy in 2011 was attributed in part to the large number of elderly victims of the 2011 tsunami in north-east Japan. Women account for more than 87% of Japan&apos;s centenarians, although its oldest resident is a man, 115-year-old Jiroemon Kimura, who lives in Kyoto prefecture. The oldest woman is Koto Okubo, a 114-year-old resident of Kawasaki, just outside Tokyo. When the survey began in 1963, Japan was home to just 153 centenarians, and the number stood at just 10,000 as recently as 1998. Experts attribute the dramatic rise of the 100-plus generation to older people&apos;s fastidious attachment to the traditional low-fat Japanese diet, strong community ties, affordable healthcare and generous pensions. The explosion in the population of Japanese over 65, coupled with a shrinking workforce, is expected to put unprecedented strain on the country&apos;s pension system in the decades to come. Japan&apos;s oldest citizens were at the centre of a scandal in 2010 after it emerged that at least 200 centenarians had gone missing from local government records. In some cases, people who had died were still listed as alive, including a woman mistakenly recorded as having reached 125, whose registered home was turned into a park in 1981. Shochi, whose trip around the globe has been recognised as a Guinness world record, travelled through North America, Europe and Africa as part of a series of lecture tours on child education and health he began several years ago. To achieve the record, he used scheduled, not chartered, public transport, including planes, trains, boats and buses. Returning from a tour last month, the professor emeritus at Fukuoka University of Education said he intended to live even longer. &quot;In my entire life, I&apos;ve never said I am tired,&quot; he told reporters."}, {"sentences": ["These 1970s images of public sex in a Tokyo park, at night, are more funny than salacious, and shown in a blacked-out room."], "tags": ["Art", "Liverpool", "UK news", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-14T17:37:01Z", "title": "Liverpool Biennial 2012: lost in exhibition space", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/14/liverpool-biennial-2012-exhibition-space", "article": "Two days isn&apos;t nearly enough time to get to grips with the current Liverpool Biennial, which opens on Saturday. I hurried through the John Moores Painting Prize exhibition, now in its 50th year. Very little rubbed off on me. Lost in the exhibition City States, which takes us from Birmingham to Gdansk, from Greenland to Taipei, and occupies a vast acreage of Liverpool&apos;s former postal sorting office, I could have been anywhere. Here I spent about half an hour circumnavigating a humongous inflatable black pillow, wedged between floor and ceiling, by a collective from Vilnius. The bloated black form might signify the big sleep. Around a corner are versions of Morris Louis&apos;s 1960&apos;s drip-and-pour paintings, executed, inexplicably, by North Korean weavers. Why, you ask. The answer is very long indeed. Every few hours, I slipped down to the waterfront, to check if Anthony McCall&apos;s much anticipated column of cloud had yet ascended across the Mersey. Wind and weather and technical glitches have meant that this, the most spectacular of the biennial&apos;s works, has yet to take off. Of such mysteries and expectations biennials are made, from Liverpool to Sydney. Since its inception in 1999, the Liverpool Biennial has itself struggled to take off. Under the new artistic directorship of Sally Tallant, it is trying to refocus. The overall theme, hospitality, is more complex than it sounds, though whether it helps us cross and recross the city in search of its roster of 242 artists in 27 locations, is moot. Better to sit in a room and think. But not perhaps in Finnish artist Markus K\u00e5hre&apos;s fake hotel suite, on the 1st floor of the Monro pub. Everything, from the table lamps to the windows, walls and doors, is a perfect simulacrum, fabricated by the artist. We take it all as real, until we look in the mirrors on the wall, which reflect everything except ourselves. This is disturbing and uncanny, unless you happen to be a vampire or a ghost. Even the daylight is fake. K\u00e5hre&apos;s work is perfectly in tune with the title of the biennial&apos;s main exhibition, The Unexpected Guest. In art, we are used to expecting the unexpected, though genuine surprise is rare. Biennial after biennial, the same fashionable names with their familiar stratagems appear. Here comes Dora Garcia, who&apos;s always everywhere, there goes Argentinian Jorge Macchi, who &quot;questions our ability to locate ourselves in space&quot;, by way of bent iron bars, which intend to simulate the effects of refraction in water. It doesn&apos;t work. I much prefer the games room set up by Pedro Reyes at FACT. Somehow, I ended up playing a sexed-up version of snakes and ladders with the Mexican cultural attach\u00e9, while small children milled about, whacking each other in a pillow fight. Sometimes I felt less a guest, more an ingrate, especially as I queued to get into the non-existent nightclub behind Elmgreen and Dragset&apos;s freestanding VIP door in the Liverpool ONE shopping precinct. A genial but unmovable doorman tells anyone who asks that they&apos;re not on the guestlist. There are plenty of such lighthearted works here, from the multi-coloured plastic pigeons roosting at the entrance to the Walker Art Gallery (a work that rips-off Maurizio Cattelan&apos;s stuffed pigeons that have been in at least two Venice Biennales), to Superflex&apos;s Liverpool To Let, a bunting of estate agents&apos; signage, which festoons part of the enormous ground floor space of the Cunard Building, which few artists occupy with any real presence. Althea Thauberger&apos;s video staging of Peter Weiss&apos;s 1963 play Marat/Sade, and Sylvie Blocher&apos;s video reworkings of speeches by the likes of Angela Davis and Karl Marx, had a real spring and surprise. Marx has never sounded so good as declaimed by a semi-clothed Russian punk rapper. We are less guests than voyeurs to Japanese photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki&apos;s famous but rarely seen The Park, at the Open Eye Gallery. These 1970s images of public sex in a Tokyo park, at night, are more funny than salacious, and shown in a blacked-out room. You search for the images with a torch, and become one with the furtive spectators spying on all the goings-on. People like to watch, and others like to be watched, and some like to listen. Doug Aitken&apos;s The Source, in a building especially designed by David Adjaye, presents a series of interviews with major creative figures about the sources of their creativity. The sound levels are too low and the videos are screened simultaneously about the circular space. It is almost impossible to concentrate on William Eggleston&apos;s ruminative mumble, or to focus on Mike Kelley in probably his last interview before his suicide earlier this year. The interviews are great, but Aiken has turned them into a sort of cocktail party babble. The best work in the biennial is undoubtedly John Akomfrah&apos;s The Unfinished Conversation, a three-screen video based on the life, work and talk of the incomparable Jamaican-born thinker Stuart Hall, at the Bluecoat Gallery. Much more than biopic, Akomfrah juxtaposes archive news footage, readings of William Blake, Dickens and Virginia Woolf and most of all Hall&apos;s own voice, to describe the world&apos;s tumbling. Hall&apos;s thoughts about identity, immigration and selfhood, evolve through a roar of telling images. Akomfrah&apos;s film, like the essence of Hall&apos;s work, is about the conundrum of being in the world, and is as unexpected as it is brilliant."}, {"sentences": ["Jobs The official &quot;Hello Work&quot; job centres in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya help foreigners find jobs.", "Cost of living Notoriously high, particularly in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Work & careers", "Job hunting", "Graduate careers", "Moving overseas", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-14T21:58:18Z", "title": "Working abroad: what countries offer the best job prospects for UK graduates?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/14/working-abroad-best-job-uk-graduates", "article": "After months of searching for work since graduating in June from the University of Kent, Lindsey Kendall has had enough. Next week, the 21-year-old from Bishop&apos;s Stortford in Hertfordshire will be boarding a plane to New Zealand, leaving behind the gloom of Britain&apos;s jobless economy. Kendall joins an exodus of 10,000 Britons to New Zealand this year, plus many more who are heading to Australia and Canada and less-traditional destinations for emigrants, such as Germany and Singapore. &quot;The only available jobs I could see were hospitality or general low-entry jobs \u2013 nothing for a graduate. So I decided that if I&apos;m going to work in a bar or on reception, I might as well do it in a new country as part of a new experience. I&apos;m heading to New Zealand to start my working holiday visa, and hopefully it shouldn&apos;t take me too long to find a job.&quot; Kendall says that few of her fellow leavers have had much luck landing a graduate job. &quot;There&apos;s only one I\u00a0know who has got what you might call a proper graduate job. Everyone else is still looking.&quot; Youth unemployment in the UK has reached one million and is continuing to rise, with figures this week showing 1,017,000 16-24-year-olds now claiming\u00a0benefit. Sitting out the UK recession by heading to a stronger economy will give graduates new life skills and experiences that, when they return, may help them land a better job. A lucky few may also obtain high-paying graduate-style jobs in their chosen country \u2013 but don&apos;t bet on it. Online forums used by Britons on visa programmes for 18-30-year-olds warn others not to expect it easy when they arrive abroad. One commenter on Backpackerboard.co.nz says: &quot;My girlfriend and I arrived in Auckland with just more than \u00a310,000. The accommodation costs are expensive, food is expensive too. Jobs are hard to find this year. We went everywhere in Wellington and Auckland with our CVs \u2026 I don&apos;t have a full-time job yet after one month of looking, but my girlfriend luckily does. Don&apos;t be too confident about getting jobs and don&apos;t bring too much luggage.&quot; Earnings are never going to be that high. Don&apos;t expect to get much more than \u00a310 an hour in &quot;hospitality&quot; jobs, though it may be a little more in jobs in the construction industry. After its earthquake last year, Christchurch in New Zealand is going through a rebuilding boom, although most of the vacancies are for workers in skilled\u00a0trades. Many individuals, such as Kendall, are happy to head out alone, but others will want help from travel agencies that assist in putting together visas, bank accounts and accommodation. Lucy Fenwick, 20, from Hampshire, has spent a year in Australia, which was partly organised by STA Travel. &quot;I started in Sydney and worked in a restaurant as a waitress for a few months, which gave me the chance to see the city through the eyes of a local. I moved from Sydney and worked behind a bar in Melbourne and in a clothes shop in Brisbane. &quot;I loved feeling part of the community rather than just another young Brit passing through on her travels, and the experience has totally boosted my confidence. I&apos;ve got a far broader outlook on life and hopefully it will make me stand out a bit from the other thousands of graduates.&quot; But although Australia and New Zealand play host to the bulk of Britons heading abroad for short-term work \u2013 not least because they speak English and offer more generous working visa programmes than other destinations \u2013 other countries may provide just as many opportunities, and will prove to employers you&apos;re not just a semi-permanent gap-year traveller. Canada&apos;s economy is relatively strong: it didn&apos;t suffer the banking crash that affected Europe and the US, and young British people can work there for two years on the International Experience Canada programme. According to the Canadian high commission, the programme has been very popular this year. &quot;There are opportunities in a number of sectors for graduates, specifically in the hi-tech gaming industry, and there is always a high demand for workers in construction and hospitality,&quot; a commission spokeswoman says. Visa restrictions effectively make the US off-limits to British graduates seeking work, and elsewhere job seekers will run up against language barriers. One traditional route is to obtain a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (Tefl) certificate, then head to Spain, Italy or Japan for work. But there is a sting in the tail for already debt-laden graduates heading overseas: many countries demand evidence that you have enough money\u00a0in the bank to look after yourself. Japan wants to see \u00a32,500 in cleared funds before admitting you, while in New Zealand you need to have NZ$350 per month of your stay. This represents around \u00a3180 a month. Staying for a year would require more than \u00a32,100. So what are the rules and prospects for young people heading abroad? Guardian Money looked at some of the leading, and less obvious, destinations Australia Visa restrictions Up to 12\u00a0months for people aged 18 to 30 interested in a working holiday. Apply online (A$280/\u00a3190 fee) at immi.gov.au. You can do any kind of work in Australia, but can only be with the same employer for six months. You may be asked on arrival to prove that you have\u00a0&quot;sufficient funds&quot;, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Anything less than A$3,000 (\u00a31,950) is considered risky. Jobs The greatest demand is in Western Australia, home to the mining boom. A cafe job in Sydney will pay about A$18 (\u00a311) an hour. Head to the outback to try your hand as a jackaroo (boys) or a jillaroo (girls) working on a sheep or cattle farm. Roles may include caring for livestock, maintaining the cleanliness of the farm or even &quot;mustering&quot; (rounding up) on horseback. Full-time work could pay as much as \u00a3300 a week and accommodation is often provided. Cost of living For a one-bed apartment you might pay between \u00a3750 and \u00a31,000 a month depending on if you are in a city centre or not. Generally, the cost of living is slightly higher in Australia than in the UK, something that is worth considering. New Zealand Visa restrictions There are two options: a 12-month visa or a 23-month visa for UK citizens aged 18 to 30. Apply at immigration.govt.nz. With either option you are only entitled to work for 12\u00a0months, and each is based on certain\u00a0requirements \u2013 one being access\u00a0to \u00a3180 (NZ$350) per month of your\u00a0stay. Jobs The usual hospitality roles in Auckland, Wellington and Queenstown. Construction jobs in Christchurch. Seasonal fruit-picking is ideal temporary work and can be done all over the north and south islands. It is hard-going and not especially well paid, but you could earn up to \u00a310 an hour for your toil. On the upside, agricultural work is a chance to get up close and personal with the stunning landscapes of New Zealand. Cost of living The New Zealand dollar, as with the Australian dollar, has soared in recent years against sterling, so food and drink is on a par with, or indeed above, the UK. But rents are still affordable: accommodation in the form of a one-bed apartment might be about \u00a3450 a month. Canada Visa restrictions Working visas available to adults aged 18 to 35 under the International Experience Canada programme. Apply at international.gc.ca/experience (\u00a390 fee). Unfortunately, applications for 2012 have already closed (there was a quota of 5,350 for the UK), but will open for 2013 later this year. You will also need to demonstrate cleared funds of C$2,500 (\u00a31,600). Jobs The usual hospitality and construction jobs, but the high commission in London says jobs in the hi-tech gaming industry are aplenty. If you want a job in the public sector you will need decent French language skills. And don&apos;t be put off by the cold winters; you could turn it into\u00a0an opportunity. A ski instructor in\u00a0Whistler \u2013 a job with perks such as a free\u00a0lift pass \u2013 might earn you up to \u00a3500 a month with food and accommodation included. Cost of living Canada is another country whose currency has appreciated strongly in recent years. Vancouver often appears in lists of the most expensive cities in North America. US Visa restrictions Very stringent. There is no working holiday visa programme of the type UK citizens enjoy in Australia and New Zealand. You need to have a job offer in place before even applying for a visa. Jobs One option is the &quot;J-1&quot; visa, which allows those between the ages of 18 and 26 to work as an au pair for up to 12\u00a0months, with the possibility of an extension if all goes well. You will be provided with food and board to work at least 45 hours a week, but must also complete certain courses before you are eligible. Cost of living Generally, the cost of living is similar to that of the UK, but it can be cheaper depending on where in the US you are. Accommodation costs are extremely varied. A one-bed apartment in suburban New York will be well over \u00a31,000 a month, and \u00a32,000 in town, but elsewhere in the country will be much lower. Germany Visa restrictions None. All EU nationals, including those from Britain, have the right to look for work in Germany. The country is a much better bet than Spain or Italy (suffering from high youth unemployment) or the Nordic nations (which suffer from high\u00a0living costs). Jobs Unemployment is lower than Britain, at about 7%, but while jobs are available they could not be described as plentiful. Search for work at the arbeitsagentur.de, Germany&apos;s job centres. Head to Bavaria where unemployment is less than 4% rather than the old East Germany where unemployment is widespread. Speaking German helps \u2013 so why not perfect your German as a tour guide? There are plenty of travel companies that will be happy to have you, and your job will undoubtedly expose you to some of Germany&apos;s finest attractions. Don&apos;t expect to get rich, though: rates of pay will not be much higher than \u00a310 an hour. Cost of living Less than in the UK, and surprisingly so in high-profile places such as Berlin. A one-bed flat can be in the region of \u00a3300 a month. Japan Visa restrictions Under the Working Holiday Scheme, a limited number of British citizens aged 18 to 30 may be granted a visa that allows them to enter Japan and work for up to a year. You must have \u00a32,500 in cleared funds and have the last three months&apos; bank statements to hand to show to immigration officials. Jobs The official &quot;Hello Work&quot; job centres in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya help foreigners find jobs. Most British graduates heading to Japan find work as English teachers. Cost of living Notoriously high, particularly in Tokyo. Look to arrange accommodation before you arrive in the country. Singapore Visa restrictions Graduates up to the age of 30 will need to secure a place on the Work Holiday Programme, which entitles them to work in Singapore for up to six months. This visa comes with an issue fee of about \u00a375. Jobs With more than 110,000 expatriates and 7,000 multinational companies operating in Singapore, the opportunities for career advancement are good. ContactSingapore.sg is a good place to start.

Riot police with shields and batons sealed off the compound, sporadically clashing with demonstrators who chanted and waved Chinese flags and placards. A handful rushed past a police barricade but were quickly removed by plainclothes officers. Hundreds took to the streets in other cities around China, with reports of attacks on Japanese-owned businesses. Japan already controls the uninhabited islands, which it refers to as the Senkaku and China calls the Diaoyu, but announced plans to buy them from their private owners this week. Hundreds of paramilitary police, ordinary officers and security guards initially struggled to maintain order at the embassy in Beijing, but later marshalled protesters into smaller groups that marched up and down the closed-off road, chanting anti-Japanese slogans and pumping their fists.

Japan invaded China and killed a lot of Chinese. We will never forget,&quot; protestor Liu Gang told Reuters. While China rarely allows street protests, it has a history of tolerating anti-Japanese demonstrations. &quot;I think the government is encouraging this,&quot; one protester, who gave his name as Uda Chen, told Reuters. &quot;They could have stopped all of us approaching when we were at the subway station. The government has taught us to be anti-Japanese at school, so if they want us to stop it would be like slapping their own mouths,&quot; he added. Around the corner, police guarded Japanese restaurants, which had hung up Chinese flags and signs reading: &quot;The Diaoyu Islands belong to China&quot;. China&apos;s state news agency Xinhua and Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency reported sizeable protests in cities, including Xi&apos;an, Nanjing, Qingdao and Kunming. Microbloggers and Japanese media reported outbreaks of violence, including attacks on a Japanese-owned department store in Changsha and restaurants in Hangzhou. In Shanghai, police sealed off the consulate but allowed small groups at a time to approach and protest. Protests broke out in China last month after Chinese and then Japanese activists landed on the islands. But tensions escalated when Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, announced a plan to buy the islands and build on them. The central government then said it would buy the group but leave them undeveloped, hoping to stave off conflict with China. Both governments face popular nationalist pressure, particularly given the impending elections in Japan and this autumn&apos;s leadership transition in China. But experts say both are keen to avoid a major confrontation. While China sent surveillance vessels into disputed waters on Friday, it withdrew them after a few hours.

The diplomatic row has spilled over into the countries&apos; close economic ties, amid warnings by the US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, that the spat could deteriorate into armed conflict. &quot;Obviously we&apos;re concerned by the demonstrations and we&apos;re concerned by the conflict that is taking place over the Senkaku islands, and the message that I have tried to convey is a message that we have to urge calm and restraint on all sides,&quot; he told reporters before leaving Tokyo for Beijing earlier on Monday. While it sanctioned the demonstrations, the Chinese government on Monday attempted to dampen anti-Japanese sentiment, removing provocative online comments and photographs of the protests, and threatening to arrest anyone found to have broken the law.     Location of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands.     Chinese authorities said 10 people had been arrested for attacking cars or vandalising shops, while arrests were also reported over an arson attack on a Japanese electronics factory and car dealership. In some of the worst of the weekend&apos;s protests, demonstrators hurled bottles and other items at the Japanese embassy in Beijing and attacked Japanese restaurants and other businesses in at least five cities. Toyota and Honda said arsonists had badly damaged their dealerships in Qingdao in eastern China, while Panasonic said one of its plants had been set alight. The electronics giant said the factory would remain closed through Tuesday, when China marks the anniversary of the start of Japan&apos;s occupation of parts of the country. Canon said it would also close three of its four factories in China for the next two days, while All Nippon Airways reported a spike in cancellations on flights from China to Japan. Meanwhile, Japan&apos;s Fast Retailing said would close 19 of its Uniqlo clothing stores in China on Tuesday as it expects the anti-Japan demonstrations to escalate. Asia&apos;s largest apparel retailer shut seven stores on Monday. In the southern city of Shenzhen, police fired teargas and turned water cannon and pepper spray on thousands of protesters attempting to occupy a street. On Sunday, Panetta said he was concerned that other countries, including the US, could be dragged into any conflict over the islands. Washington has declined to take sides in the Senkaku row, but acknowledges that under the US-Japan security treaty it is required to come to its ally&apos;s aid if it is attacked. Japan&apos;s foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, who met Panetta in Tokyo on Monday, said it was &quot;mutually understood between Japan and the United States that [the Senkakus] are covered by the treaty&quot;. Panetta said the US did not take a position on the sovereignty claims, but added: &quot;Having said that, we expect that these issues will be resolved peacefully and although we understand the differences here with regard to jurisdiction, it is extremely important that diplomatic means on both sides be used to try to constructively resolve these issues. &quot;It is in everybody&apos;s interest for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation.&quot; The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, called on the Chinese authorities to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens and businesses. &quot;Regrettably, this is a problem concerning the safety of Japanese nationals and Japan-affiliated companies,&quot; he told broadcaster NHK. &quot;I would like to urge the Chinese government to protect their safety.&quot; China described Japan&apos;s decision to buy three of the uninhabited islets, which are thought to be surrounded by huge deposits of natural gas, as a violation of its sovereignty. Japan says the islands have been an integral part of its territory since the late 19th century, claiming that China had only shown an interest in them after studies pointed to the presence of potentially valuable natural resources nearby. Chinese state media and online activists united in calling for a boycott of Japanese goods, while Chinese tourism authorities ordered travel agents to cancel package tours to Japan during a week-long national holiday next month. One newspaper warned Japan that it could face another &quot;lost decade&quot; of economic stagnation if trade ties are affected. China replaced Japan as the world&apos;s second-biggest economy in 2010, but analysts said that both sides would suffer from a prolonged trade spat. China is Japan&apos;s single biggest trading partner and bilateral trade was worth a record $345bn (\u00a3213bn) last year. &quot;How could it be that Japan wants another lost decade, and could even be prepared to go back by two decades,&quot; said a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of the People&apos;s Daily, a Communist party newspaper. The paper said China had always exercised caution over &quot;playing the economic card&quot;, adding &quot;but in struggles concerning territorial sovereignty, if Japan continues its provocations, then China will take up the battle&quot;. Other recent outbreaks of anti-Japanese sentiment, in 2005 and 2010, ended with short-lived protests and minor disruption to trade."}, {"sentences": ["JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesFancy Books \u2013 Sister Carry StarsSaitama duo Fancy Books takes a lot of cues from groups currently generating buzz in Tokyo, especially blog-approved outfits Jesse Ruins and Sapphire Slows, whose sounds swirl dance music with unsettling ambient touches."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Electronic music"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-17T12:02:00Z", "title": "September's best music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/17/music-alliance-pact-september", "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the whole 38-track compilation through Get it here.

Since then, coming and going between Chaco and the capital, she adopted the Sobrenadar identity, developing it through two LPs and three EPs, self-released digitally. 1859 is her latest album, and the highest point of that constant evolution. Released through Bandcamp during the first half of this year, it has already obtained several reviews that name her as one of the most promising new local electronica artists. The song 1859 is a bonus track from a special reissue by Mamushka Dogs Records.  AUSTRALIA: Who the Bloody Hell Are They?Bad Dreems \u2013 Too OldAny of our overseas friends who are fans of the Twerps, do tune in. Sydney via Adelaide four-piece Bad Dreems are one of the best Australian bands at the moment (in our humble opinion). Too Old is about a fizzling relationship, with a nod to the humdrum routine somewhere in between. Its delivery is anything but boring, though. Loose treble riffs, vocalist Ben Marwe&apos;s casual drone and arguably the catchiest hook being passed around all make this track so great. If only everyone else took a cue from these guys and stopped trying so hard to sound good. Downer-pop at its best.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigDust Covered Carpet \u2013 Fragile Soul/Heavy Heart&quot;A rooftop above concrete or a cliff above the shore or an accident on the street.&quot; The first lines of Fragile Soul/Heavy Heart set the tone for the rest of this strangely calm, reduced and peaceful song that is, after all, about suicide. It is no surprise, then, that Dust Covered Carpet are based in a city with a well-known affinity for all things morbid: Vienna.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoDibigode \u2013 Mariposa (A Lagartixa E O Urubu)Dibigode is a creative band formed by five young multi-instrumentists who make post-rock music full of melodic lines and dynamic sounds. This version of Mariposa (A Lagartixa E O Urubu) is part of the new remastered version of their debut album, Naturais E Id\u00eanticos Ao Natural De Pimentas Da Jamaica E Preta, available for free download at the band&apos;s website.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsEvening Hymns \u2013 ArrowsOn his second album as Evening Hymns, Jonas Bonnetta has made public his very private and personal response to his father&apos;s passing. There are moments of sentimentality and sweetness, and there are times when raw nerves are exposed, stinging with pain and heartache. Arrows is a touching, haunting song about the ghosts that linger long after a loved one has passed away.  CHILE: Super 45Ases Falsos \u2013 La Sinceridad Del CosmosAses Falsos present their debut album, Juventud Americana (Arca Discos), a collection of songs that refer to the Latin American ideology yet manage to sound contemporary at the same time. The classy use of synthesizers, the meticulous vocal harmonies and the melodic wrapping are, along with irony-filled lyrics with a strong political and social meaning, the highlights of this work. Our pick is La Sinceridad Del Cosmos (&quot;The sincerity of the cosmos&quot;), a song that questions police brutality \u2026 from an animal&apos;s point of view.  CHINA: WooozyBaby Formula \u2013 Warm SongBaby Formula, currently the only shoegaze band in Beijing who play dream pop live, are formed by an artist who dedicates himself to being a loser, a senior who doesn&apos;t know where to get a master&apos;s degree and a writer who hasn&apos;t sold any work yet. Their music is influenced by a wide range of bands from Slowdive to The Radio Dept.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloBomba Est\u00e9reo \u2013 Pa&apos; RespirarAfter four years of waiting, electro-cumbia group Bomba Est\u00e9reo return with a more reflective album in which they explore their essence, but without forgetting their Caribbean power. Pa&apos; Respirar means &quot;to breathe&quot;, a theme that reflects the band&apos;s new vibe, where you can feel the world they inhabit.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianIndianna Dawn \u2013 I Always Miss YouThere&apos;s been a new wave of Americana and country music sweeping Denmark in the past few years (I say &quot;new&quot; \u2013 I don&apos;t really think there&apos;s ever been one before) and one representative of this is the quintet Indianna Dawn, centered around singer and songwriter Dianna D\u00f8nns. MAP exclusive download I Always Miss You is from their great debut album, Somebody&apos;s Dead.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraDuluc \u2013 La Mano Part\u00edaFrom the depths of rural laments, La Casetera&apos;s first MAP submission is all about Dominican folklore. Jos\u00e9 Duluc is part of our musical history, playing alongside iconic rock star Luis &quot;Terror&quot; D\u00edas for many years. His nostalgic approach to peasant work on his latest song, La Mano Part\u00eda, makes us contemplate the aspirations of the less fortunate and their longing to be generously rewarded someday.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogWoodpecker Wooliams \u2013 CrowWoodpecker Wooliams, aka Brighton girl Gemma Williams, is a 27-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, and for once that term is true: the former midwife plays harp, kora, omnichord, keyboard, harmonium, electric organ, accordion, penny whistle, clarinet, bells, glockenspiel, electric shruti box, recorder and drums. She&apos;s also more Bj\u00f6rk than Beyonc\u00e9, a kookstress with a high chirrup of a voice and a backstory involving a bird obsession and a bee fetish. Don&apos;t expect wall-to-wall cute, though. On Crow, one of several avian-related titles on her The Bird School of Being Human album, she sings about building &quot;a great funeral pyre&quot; as the music becomes increasingly clanging and industrial. Prepare to be haunted long after it ends.  FINLAND: GlueSkip Zone \u2013 Leaving Planet BoredomSkip Zone are a six-piece folk-rock band from Helsinki that perform mid-tempo cosmic Americana songs with some outstanding vocal harmonies and catchy pop melodies. A little bit early Wilco here and a little bit Ryan Adams there makes for well-crafted songs. Skip Zone&apos;s debut EP can be heard on SoundCloud in its entirety.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredAud \u2013 VioletsAud is a folk-pop duet hailing from Nancy, heavily influenced by Patrick Watson, Sufjan Stevens, Beirut and other indie acts. Their first EP, Origami, released in 2010, brought them much success, and Violets is taken from their second one, The Death of the Stag God, released on 14 September. Not only are they brilliant lyricists, they&apos;re also exceptional musicians, who use guitars, drums, pianos, glockenspiel and harmonica to create a diverse spectrum of sounds and feelings.  GERMANY: BlogparteiStabil Elite \u2013 HydravionLet&apos;s conclude our series on new Kraut with this fine trio from Duesseldorf, whose debut Douze Pouze had quite an impact on German music scene. They combine the charm of monotony and repetitive patterns with distinctive lyrics reminiscent of Neue Deutsche Welle. But Stabil Elite is not just one of those retro bands \u2013 it&apos;s mature, handmade music with great range and originality.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnMonotown \u2013 Can DenyMonotown just finished their debut album in a collaboration with four-time Grammy-winning mixing engineer Michael Brauer. While the album&apos;s narrative may have roots in their motherland, its sound will be equal parts American western film score and Beatles psychedelia, flavored with haunting textures reminiscent of contemporary indie-rock bands.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarBrilliant At Breakfast \u2013 Gundala Putra PetirBrilliant at Breakfast are one of this country&apos;s finest indie-pop/twee-pop bands. Hailing from Yogyakarta, they already enjoy a global reach, distributing their records around the world via Apple Crumble (Japan), Hands and Arms (France), Susy Records and many more. Enjoy their heartfelt tune Gundala Putra Petir.  IRELAND: Nialler9Forrests \u2013 TarifaThe duo of Paul O&apos;Reilly and Owen O&apos;Mahony only have two Forrests tracks available online but form from their other band, Channel One, and a couple of super live shows have confirmed them as a vital prospect. Their music reaches for the night sky, a la M83 or Fuck Buttons, with a crisp digital sheen and warm breaths. Tarifa is a beauty.  ITALY: PolaroidGo Dugong \u2013 White Sun (feat. Welcome Back Sailors)Listening to this song in September may be painful: the level of nostalgia for the summer that just faded away (at least on this side of the globe) can become dangerously high. In any case, the music Go Dugong makes is so good it&apos;s worth it \u2013 sunny synths, samples lost in the echoes and lots of beats. Go Dugong is the solo project of Giulio Fonseca (from the brilliant band K\u00f8benhavn Store) and he just released his first EP on the Czech label AMDISCS.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesFancy Books \u2013 Sister Carry StarsSaitama duo Fancy Books takes a lot of cues from groups currently generating buzz in Tokyo, especially blog-approved outfits Jesse Ruins and Sapphire Slows, whose sounds swirl dance music with unsettling ambient touches. Sister Carry Stars, though, leans closer to pop, with a jaunty melody and sweet vocals that sound inviting. Still, Fancy Books take an otherwise summer-friendly number and turn it woozy with their synths.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaTollens \u2013 Beautiful DayTollens (real name Ryan Formosa) bought his first guitar at age 13, but it was only recently that he started recording proper songs. He came up with the name as a nod to Bernhard Tollens, the German chemist. After unleashing his first EP on SoundCloud to good feedback from friends and even people he&apos;d never met, he decided to take it further. Beautiful Day is taken from the EP Drowning in a Dream \u2013 a proverbial bedroom-pop rollercoaster, available as a free download from Bandcamp.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaEddie Mercury \u2013 In MexicoMexico&apos;s National Day falls on 15 September, and to set the mood for a party we&apos;ve brought in local Electrique Music genius Eddie Mercury. On this eight-minute bouncing trance, a digitally bloated voice emphasises he wasn&apos;t born in New York, Chicago or Detroit\u2013 he was born &quot;In Mexico&quot;. So let&apos;s dress in red, white and green and insanely dance to this new national (house) anthem.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Spilt Milk \u2013 Our Despised DecayDuring the dark days of December 2011, Amsterdam-based quintet Spilt Milk found comfort in the first eight published poems by American modernist poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955). Gathered under the title Carnet De Voyage (&quot;Travel Notebook&quot;), these songs are full of stars, sunsets, landscapes and rivers. Although Stevens&apos;s poetry may not be the easiest or permeable, listening to Spilt Milk&apos;s drone-folk adaptations makes entering his Buddhist-like, abstract view of the world a rewarding experience.  PERU: SoTBThe Cocainers \u2013 Let&apos;s DanceAlthough The Cocainers&apos; career is very new - they formed only five months ago in Lima - it looks very promising. They are in the process of making their first album, but already we can find songs at the level of Let&apos;s Dance. With its old school rock, vibrating vocals, electro touches and an inherent indie flavor, it&apos;s a powerful song which will make your muscles move without you noticing.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogMuzyka Ko\u0144ca Lata \u2013 Dok\u0105dOK, so this track might be from 2011 and the name of the band means &quot;music of the end of the summer&quot;, but Dok\u0105d is earning international fame, having been voted Song of the Summer 2012 in a contest run by popular Seattle-based podcast Too Beautiful To Live. Muzyka Ko\u0144ca Lata is influenced by bigbit - a popular genre in Poland in the 60s - and you can check out the beautiful lyrics of Dok\u0105d here.   PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Minta &amp; The Brook Trout \u2013 FalconMinta &amp; The Brook Trout are one of the most interesting Portuguese bands around. They were first in MAP in December 2010; Now they are back with their new album, Olympia, out on September 17. To celebrate the release, here&apos;s the first single, Falcon.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieDandy And The Walkers \u2013 Video HoOut of the blue, Dandy And The Walkers broke into the Puerto Rican independent scene late this summer with this single, Video Ho. A shared love of The Shirleys and The Ronettes brought Michelle Fern\u00e1ndez, Melissa Collazo and Enrique Olivares together, while their sonic exploration led them to recruit Laira D\u00edaz, C\u00e9sar Jim\u00e9nez and Juanto Arrroyo. Mario Negr\u00f3n (of psych-rockers, Fantasmes) got them to record at Casa Fantasmes, producing this track which showcases the raw talent and contagiously fun vibe the ensemble is able to create. Dandy And The Walkers are currently recording their first album.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoisePopa Sapka \u2013 Stinky BastardsThe music of Popa Sapka, heavily influenced by Balkanic melodies and rhythms, is a mix of ska, pop, punk, gypsy, reggae, folk and the traditional music of &apos;mother Russia&apos;. Their lyrics, originating from the band&apos;s multicultural background, present a twisted mix of English, Russian, Romanian and Gagauzian languages. The light-heartedness and sincerity of their songs are what makes Popa Sapka so appealing.  RUSSIA: Big EchoFPRF \u2013 Crystallization PointNovosibirsk-based shoegaze band FPRF prepares for its next full-length release with Crystallization Point, a calm and beautiful slow-burning jam backed with remixes by beats producer Ta-ku and future garage from Nocow.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopSiobhan Wilson \u2013 All Dressed UpSiobhan Wilson&apos;s music pursuits have taken the 24-year-old from her native Scotland to a surprise pop career in France, back to Scotland and now London, where she finds herself charming all-comers with her folky, jazzy bilingual storytelling and cartoon-like glamour. Unrequited love is the dish of the day in All Dressed Up, the captivating standout track of her just-released mini-album Glorified Demons.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...FAUXE \u2013 Be My LoveA mysterious force has been brewing in Singapore, bubbling beneath the shiny veneer of saturated city lights. The glitchy imperfections of static haunt the corridors of abandoned buildings, a sign of life from androids realising self-awareness. FAUXE leads a charge into this unknown realm, stirring up quite the storm with his debut EP Ubuntu and letting his music trickle down your window panes on a rain-sodden day.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Al Bairre \u2013 Youth De FreitasSymphonic indie-rock band Al Bairre was formed at the begining of 2011, drawing influences from bands such as Arcade Fire, Ra Ra Riot, Vampire Weekend and Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. The five-piece have seemingly perfected the indie-dance genre, combining cello, violin, keys, Fender guitars and ukulele to produce an exciting sound that has seen them scale the local scene.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieBig Baby Driver \u2013 My GoodbyeAfter many years of crafting lovely music, singer-songwriter Big Baby Driver recently rose to fame after having a few songs featured in Korean television drama series A Gentleman&apos;s Dignity. Last month she released a collaboration single with former MAP artist Kim Mokin. My Goodbye, with its bossa rhythms, is Big Baby Driver&apos;s contribution to the release.  SPAIN: MusikornerNaturalesa Salvatge \u2013 Sota L&apos;aiguaNaturalesa Salvatge are a five-piece from Barcelona who make melancholic but dreamy melodies. Their main influences are The Smiths, Teenage Fanclub and The Radio Dept. Formed during a national lo-fi explosion, Naturalesa Salvatge have shown they&apos;re not as ephemeral as similar acts, most of them now defunct.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaCaviare Days \u2013 You&apos;ll QualifySwedish sisters Lina and Maja Westin formed Caviare Days in New York, which isn&apos;t at all surprising since one could easily compare them to a couple of other female-fronted garage bands linked to the city&apos;s scene. This is a good thing, of course. Their 60s-inspired psychedelic rock is as refreshing as it is really, really good. The duo&apos;s self-titled debut LP is out now in Sweden and will be released in North America on October 9.  SWITZERLAND: 78sFai Baba \u2013 Peach Orchard MamaThe first time Fai Baba was on a stage he had just come back from a spiritual journey through India. Then he picked up his guitar, wrote a few songs and played his ass off in cellars, whisky bars and squatted houses. His psychedelic blues-rock is best enjoyed during live shows, they tend to get ecstatic. His debut album Snake Snake was released in August.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATOn Your Horizon \u2013 Untitled #1On Your Horizon is a four-piece experimental post-rock gathering from Eskisehir and Istanbul. Their album Home is a DIY production released for free in 2010 via Bandcamp. Having made a tremendous impact, the band&apos;s self-confident has increased and their new track Untitled #1 is an ironclad song which builds splendidly.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouSeamonster \u2013 Normandy LandscapeThe music of Seamonster is a slow-moving invasion of simple yet powerful movements of sonic exploration that ultimately transports the listener to another world. Every layer upon layer reveals itself slowly until every instrument is swirling and floating above. Melt into this track, let itself wrap around you and take over.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sHolySexyBastards \u2013 Getting Over YouWhen we decided to include HolySexyBastards in this month&apos;s MAP, they were just another competitor in Festival Nuevas Bandas, one of the biggest new music festivals in Venezuela. Today, this power trio formed in Valencia are the winners (along with Okills, who were on MAP in January 2012). HolySexyBastards offer us the track Getting Over You, included on their self-titled album released in May."}, {"sentences": ["The latest, dangerous standoff between Japan and China, which brought violent protests across China, was sparked by Tokyo&apos;s decision to &quot;nationalise&quot; a chain of disputed, gas-rich islands in the East China Sea.", "A long, sorry history of conflict ensued, and many decades after Japan&apos;s defeat in 1945 Chinese commentators continue to complain that, unlike Germany, Tokyo has never fully come to terms with its wartime actions, let alone shown genuine remorse.", "Rows erupt periodically over the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which, in Shinto belief, houses the spirits or souls of soldiers who died fighting for the emperor.", "While claiming he was not taking sides, Panetta confirmed in Tokyo that the islands were covered by the Japan-US security and defence treaty.", "When Clinton declared two years ago that freedom of navigation in the South China Sea was a US &quot;national interest&quot;, Beijing viewed it as an outrageous provocation, just as it now views Tokyo&apos;s &quot;intolerable&quot; decision to purchase the Senkakus."], "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-17T13:50:09Z", "title": "China and Japan: a dangerous standoff over the Senkaku islands | Simon Tisdall", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/china-japan-dangerous-standoff", "article": "The latest, dangerous standoff between Japan and China, which brought violent protests across China, was sparked by Tokyo&apos;s decision to &quot;nationalise&quot; a chain of disputed, gas-rich islands in the East China Sea. But the row is just one manifestation of a deeper, multi-faceted, and almost institutionalised confrontation pre-dating the second world war. Coincidentally, Tuesday marks the anniversary of an infamous event that raised the curtain on the modern era of Sino-Japanese tensions. The Mukden, or Manchurian Incident of 18 September 1931, became the pretext for Imperial Japan&apos;s invasion of northern China. The dynamiting of a section of track belonging to the Japanese-owned South Manchuria railway near Mukden (now Shenyang) was blamed by Japan on Chinese insurgents. In truth, the Japanese military had itself deliberately staged the explosion, a tactic copied by Hitler before he attacked Poland in 1939. Within months, Japan had created a puppet state in northern China. A long, sorry history of conflict ensued, and many decades after Japan&apos;s defeat in 1945 Chinese commentators continue to complain that, unlike Germany, Tokyo has never fully come to terms with its wartime actions, let alone shown genuine remorse. Rows erupt periodically over the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which, in Shinto belief, houses the spirits or souls of soldiers who died fighting for the emperor. Past visits to the shrine by senior Japanese politicians invariably aroused Chinese fury. The sharpening dispute over the Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China, is the most recent product of this old narrative of violence, hatred, fear and grief that continues, sporadically, to obstruct both nations in their efforts to forge a more stable, trusting relationship. But understanding its roots does not render it less potent. The Americans, who still view themselves as the Asia-Pacific&apos;s leading power, are increasingly nervous. Leon Panetta, the US defence secretary, currently visiting Japan, pointedly warned that &quot;provocative behaviour&quot; by either side could lead to misjudgments, violence and, potentially, open warfare. &quot;It is in everybody&apos;s interest \u2026 for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation,&quot; Panetta said. In this he echoed Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, who this month stressed the need for restraint and dialogue between China and several south-east Asian countries with which Beijing has territorial disputes. China&apos;s unhappy legacy of foreign occupation and its sense that an unrepentant Japan is party to a US-orchestrated geo-strategic conspiracy to contain or limit its development as a great power also form part of the backdrop to the Senkakus standoff. While claiming he was not taking sides, Panetta confirmed in Tokyo that the islands were covered by the Japan-US security and defence treaty. That means, in theory at least, that Washington is bound to help Japan defend territory that China says has been illegally seized. The Obama administration&apos;s pivot towards Asia, its concern to defend itself and its friends against nuclear-armed North Korea, China&apos;s ally, and its active pursuit of expanded security and commercial alliances embracing countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia are all factors influencing the way China&apos;s leaders think about their country&apos;s security and relations with Japan, Washington&apos;s key regional partner and military springboard. When Clinton declared two years ago that freedom of navigation in the South China Sea was a US &quot;national interest&quot;, Beijing viewed it as an outrageous provocation, just as it now views Tokyo&apos;s &quot;intolerable&quot; decision to purchase the Senkakus. When this or similar disputes have flared in the past, days of rage, such as were suffered by Japanese nationals living in China&apos;s cities at the weekend, have invariably been followed by gradual de-escalation and diplomatic fence-mending. The Chinese government&apos;s apparent ability to turn street protests on and off has often given an air of artificiality to such episodes. Hard-headed self-interest and pragmatic considerations, such as $340bn-worth of annual bilateral trade and the dreaded possibility (for the Beijing leadership) that Chinese street protesters might turn on their own government, usually prevail in time, and tempers cool. This time it may be different, mainly because of political shifts inside Japan. The Senkaku dispute has been close to the boil for months. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, took the decision to buy the islands to head off a more destabilising but popular proposal not only to acquire them but also to begin their active development. China&apos;s reaction, including unleashing mass protests, sending ships to the area and threatening trade sanctions, was harsh but not unusual. Under pressure from nationalist opinion, Noda has taken a surprisingly inflexible public position: &quot;There can be no doubt that the Senkaku islands are part of Japanese territory, both under international law and from a historical point of view. The Senkakus are under the effective control of our nation, and there is no territorial issue with any country over the islands,&quot; he told the Yomiuri Shimbun in July. He is now calling on China to return to &quot;calm&quot; dialogue, without offering any concessions. &quot;The confrontation between Japan and China \u2026 has escalated to a truly dangerous level,&quot; wrote the former US diplomat Stephen Harner in Forbes. &quot;Objectively it must be stated that it has been Japan that has done the most to raise tensions. Further escalation cannot be in the interests of either side. While his [Noda&apos;s] leadership in domestic policy matters has generally been laudable, even brilliant, in relations with China on this issue he seems captive to interests that would lead Japan into a trap.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["One of those is the son of the governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, whose plan to buy the islands in April led to the crisis."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-17T22:35:33Z", "title": "Japan and China: ghosts of the past | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/sep/17/japan-china-ghosts-of-the-past-editorial", "article": "Left to their own devices, relations between Japan and China are bound to improve. Both economies need each other. China is Japan&apos;s single largest trading partner and bilateral trade hit a record $345bn last year. But things in the East China Sea are rarely left to their own devices. A move by the Japanese government to defuse an attempt by nationalists to buy disputed islands in fish- and gas-rich seas, by buying them itself, has led to six days of demonstrations in China. Japanese cars and car dealerships have been attacked, factories have been torched or broken into. Hundreds of Japanese companies and offices have been forced to suspend operation. And the biggest wave of protest since the two countries normalised relations in 1972 \u2013 there were demonstrations in 70 Chinese cities \u2013 is not over yet. Tuesday is the anniversary of the Japanese attack on China in 1931 that led to the invasion and occupation lasting 14 years.

As 1,000 fishing boats were on their way to the islands the Chinese know as Diaoyu and the Japanese call the Senkaku, the People&apos;s Daily warned on Monday that\u00a0the incident could lead to a full-blown trade boycott. Below the surface, the politics of these mass demonstrations are a good deal more complex. They are undoubtedly officially sanctioned and serve as a useful outlet for popular rage. But whether the protests are more than just diversionary, whether they are an expression of some crisis going on in the transfer of power from one generation of leaders to another, can not be said with any confidence. It is therefore hard to predict with any accuracy just how far China will take this. Thus far, the flag-waving on the high seas has been ritualistic. Three Chinese marine surveillance ships entered Japan&apos;s territorial waters but withdrew again afterwards, and no landings were attempted. In Japan, which is facing its own general election soon, there is a good deal of anxiety. On the one hand, history teaches them that similar anti-Japanese protests in China in 2005\u00a0and 2010 were short-lived. On the other, the current prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, who is unpopular over tax increases, faces his own pressures from those who say Japan should be more forceful in defending its territorial rights. One of those is the son of the governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, whose plan to buy the islands in April led to the crisis. Nobuteru Ishihara is one of five candidates for the leadership of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. What both Japan and China\u00a0lack is a functional mechanism for dealing with these incidents. It is high time one was created."}, {"sentences": ["But even so, Tokyo Jungle reaches a whole new level of sheer, delicious nuttiness.", "Tokyo Jungle is a proper sandbox effort with an irresistible premise: something has happened in Tokyo that has caused its entire human population to disappear.", "Your mission is to traverse Tokyo district by district, surviving as long as possible.", "As you make progress through Tokyo&apos;s different districts, you find memory sticks (bizarrely, given that they&apos;re of no earthly use to animals) which fill in details of the back story explaining why the humans disappeared, and which open chapters of the story mode.", "Tokyo Jungle    These are essentially set-pieces confined to small areas of the game \u2013 for example, you start off as a Pomeranian which must leave its ex-owners&apos; flat and start to fend for itself in the wild.", "As you may have guessed, Tokyo Jungle doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously \u2013 and it sometimes makes you laugh despite not intending to.", "But despite its tongue-in-cheek nature, Tokyo Jungle is a superb game.", "If you fear that modern games play it too safe, Tokyo Jungle will restore your faith."], "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PS3", "PlayStation", "Sony", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-18T10:27:41Z", "title": "Tokyo Jungle \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/sep/18/tokyo-jungle-game-review-ps3", "article": "Sony&apos;s Japan Studio has a reputation for making completely out there games, and never more so than when they are designed to be downloaded from the PlayStation Network. But even so, Tokyo Jungle reaches a whole new level of sheer, delicious nuttiness. After it first surfaced at E3 2012, it swiftly became known as &quot;the dog-shagging game&quot; and while it does indeed feature dogs and they do, ahem, couple, any attention-seeking that implies shouldn&apos;t be allowed to detract from its considerable merits as a game, which include originality and a fearsome level of addictiveness. Tokyo Jungle is a proper sandbox effort with an irresistible premise: something has happened in Tokyo that has caused its entire human population to disappear. So the city has been left to the animals, and the law of the (urban) jungle applies. Initially, you can choose between two animals to play as: a cute Pomeranian, representing carnivores, or a Sika deer, representing herbivores. Your mission is to traverse Tokyo district by district, surviving as long as possible. As a carnivore, you progress by killing animals (a matter of sneaking up behind them and timing your attack to when a purple icon showing a pair of jaws goes red) and marking out your territory via pre-positioned flags. Once you&apos;ve marked all the flags in a given district, you can procreate: the map shows you where potential female mates are, and you must take them to a designated nest. Once there, when you press the Mate button, you&apos;re treated to an animation showing some exploratory bottom-sniffing, followed by the initial stages of a mounting \u2013 before the camera discreetly pans out. On top of the simple premise, there are plenty of embellishments. For example, potential mates are rated between Desperate and Prime, and it&apos;s dead handy to find the latter as they will produce more offspring, thereby giving you a pack of siblings to mooch around with. The latter are necessary since the more territory you conquer, the greater the threats you encounter, and no matter how dexterous you are, it requires a pack to survive a pack attack. And when the animal you control dies, you&apos;ll automatically acquire control of another pack member. Controlling a herbivore brings completely different gameplay. While you can attack predators by kicking them, it&apos;s more sensible to proceed stealthily, hiding yourself in long grass or underneath plastic containers. You can only eat plants, but you can run faster and jump higher than the carnivores. As you make progress through Tokyo&apos;s different districts, you find memory sticks (bizarrely, given that they&apos;re of no earthly use to animals) which fill in details of the back story explaining why the humans disappeared, and which open chapters of the story mode.     Tokyo Jungle    These are essentially set-pieces confined to small areas of the game \u2013 for example, you start off as a Pomeranian which must leave its ex-owners&apos; flat and start to fend for itself in the wild. Story chapters are checkpointed, but the main survival mode isn&apos;t: when you die, it&apos;s back to square one. There are also objects (in gift boxes) to find throughout the districts, which can be handy items such as food or medicine, or preposterous clothes with which to dress up your Pomeranian. More or less all animal life is in the game \u2013 you unlock new species by performing specific challenges in survival mode and encounter everything up to dinosaurs as you roam around. As you may have guessed, Tokyo Jungle doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously \u2013 and it sometimes makes you laugh despite not intending to. Once you become accustomed to its peculiar logic, you can do things such as create killer Pomeranians \u2013 I had one which took out an entire population of alley-cats, before succumbing to a panther. It constantly plays incredibly cheesy music, and bleeps when you level up in the manner of a retro arcade game. And there are some annoying aspects \u2013 the map, for example, is more or less useless, and you need to accumulate certain objects before even attempting the more difficult areas, such as the more or less food-free sewers beneath the city. But despite its tongue-in-cheek nature, Tokyo Jungle is a superb game. It feels quite unlike anything else (the best description of it would be a stealth-action-survival-RPG), it&apos;s laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly moreish. And because of its rigorous, sandbox construction, it&apos;s unusually meaty for a download game, with plenty of replayability. If you fear that modern games play it too safe, Tokyo Jungle will restore your faith. \u2022 Game reviewed on PS3"}, {"sentences": ["Washington has not taken sides in the sovereignty row but is bound by its security treaty obligations with Tokyo to come to Japan&apos;s aid if it is attacked."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-18T11:45:00Z", "title": "China-Japan row over disputed islands threatens to escalate", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/china-japan-row-dispute-islands", "article": "Anti-Japanese protests are continuing across China as the countries&apos; competing claims to a group of islands threatened to escalate. There were reports that a large flotilla of Chinese fishing boats was due to arrive in the area later on Tuesday. Hundreds of Japanese firms closed their businesses, as demonstrators took to the streets to mark the anniversary of the start of Japan&apos;s 14-year occupation of northern China in 1931. As the region braced for the possible arrival of up to 1,000 fishing boats in waters near the disputed Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 Beijing reacted angrily to reports that two Japanese activists had briefly landed on one of the three islands that the Japanese government bought from their private Japanese owners last week. &quot;The unlawful landing of the Japanese rightwingers on the Chinese territory of the Diaoyu islands was a gravely provocative action violating Chinese territorial sovereignty,&quot; Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said in a statement. At least two of 11 Chinese ocean surveillance and fishery patrol ships sailing near the islands have entered what Japan considers its territory, the public broadcaster NHK said, quoting Japan&apos;s coastguard. China&apos;s national defence minister, Liang Guanglie, said Beijing reserved the right to take further action against Japan over the dispute. It was hoped the countries could reach a negotiated solution, but the Japanese government should &quot;undo its mistakes and come back to the right track of negotiations&quot;, he said. The Japanese activists briefly landed on one of the islands \u2013 which are thought to be located amid huge natural gas deposits \u2013 after swimming ashore from a dinghy, then returned to their boat, NHK said. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted an aide to Yoshihiko Noda, the Japanese prime minister, as saying that the possible arrival of the fishing boats would take the dispute to a &quot;new stage&quot;. He told the paper: &quot;The government is taking a wait-and-see approach for the moment. But we will not be able to sit by idly if fishing vessels reach the Senkaku islands in large numbers. It could lead to a new stage.&quot; The coastguard could be forced to arrest the captains of any Chinese vessels that enter Japan&apos;s territorial waters, in a repeat of an incident that soured relations between the two countries in 2010. If the coastguard is unable to cope, some have speculated that the defence forces could become involved. The Japanese activists&apos; landing and the presence of Chinese ships in the area heightened tensions days after protesters set fire to Japanese factories, attacked other businesses and hurled objects at the Japanese embassy in Beijing. Tuesday&apos;s demonstrations reportedly spread to 100 cities, but there were no reports of violence amid a much heavier police presence. The Chinese authorities have endorsed the popular outpouring of anti-Japanese sentiment \u2013 now in its eighth day \u2013 but have warned marchers not to break the law. Wang Guoming, a retired soldier, said anger towards Japan had prompted him to travel to Beijing from his hometown in Shanxi province. &quot;I came here so our islands will not be invaded by Japan,&quot; Wang told the Associated Press. &quot;We believe we need to declare war on them because the Japanese devils are evil. Down with little Japan!&quot; In central Chengdu, around 1,000 demonstrators waved Chinese flags and chanted, but appeared outnumbered by the massed ranks of paramilitary, uniformed and plainclothes police. A note left on a Japanese-made police car nearby read: &quot;Reject Japanese products. Don&apos;t dig your own grave.&quot; The Chinese government moved to dampen the fervour of the protests late on Monday after signs that some of the demonstrators&apos; anger was being directed towards their own government. Authorities in China are normally quick to prevent even small protests, but have a history of tolerating mass anti-Japan protests for a few days before stepping in to tone them down or stop them, aware of the potential for the mood to turn against them. Some human rights activists have already sought to take advantage of the rare chance to take to the streets: one protestor told the Guardian three of his friends had been detained by police after 10 of them marched with a banner reading &quot;Democracy, human rights, constitutional government&quot; at a demonstration in Shenzhen this weekend. They were released with a warning. &quot;We saw the anti-Japan protests online and joined because China rarely gives people a chance to take part in protests,&quot; the man said. &quot;Police said we had disturbed social order and could not have the protest because it was not harmonious with the other protesters.&quot; China&apos;s state news agency, Xinhua, announced that Beijing had expressed &quot;strong dissatisfaction&quot; after one of its consulates in Japan was attacked with smoke bombs. The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, repeated calls for both sides to prevent an escalation in the crisis amid calls for a boycott of Japanese goods that could harm ties between two important trading partners. Washington has not taken sides in the sovereignty row but is bound by its security treaty obligations with Tokyo to come to Japan&apos;s aid if it is attacked. &quot;We hope that the US will truly abide by the principle of not taking sides over the question of who the Diaoyu islands belong to,&quot; China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. The Japanese airline All Nippon Airways reported more than 18,000 cancellations from passengers in the coming weeks, most for flights from China. While there have been no reports of violence against Japanese citizens, some expatriates voiced concern about their safety. Many stayed at home on Tuesday on the advice of their employers and the Japanese government. There are no signs at this stage that Japanese companies are preparing to withdraw from China, although analysts say they may reconsider future investments there.

Four days of large-scale and sometimes violent protests in cities across China appeared to have reached their conclusion on Tuesday, the anniversary of the 1931 incident that launched Japan&apos;s occupation of northern China. Authorities strengthened their presence in protest areas and made it clear further demonstrations would not be tolerated. The island group, known to China as the Diaoyu and to Japan as the Senkaku, is surrounded by fisheries and environmental resources, but the conflict is also fuelled by historical grievances over Japanese brutality in the 1930s and 1940s. The Japanese mission sent an email to China-based citizens, saying: &quot;It seems the protests in front of our embassy have subsided.&quot; It cited a message from Beijing police urging people not to protest in the embassy district.

Although later searches showed the fault had been fixed, initially the mapping service was unable to plant a pin on one of London&apos;s main railway stations. Tokyo station, one of the world&apos;s largest train terminuses, has also disappeared. British users reported whole towns missing or relocated. Shakespeare&apos;s birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon, was nowhere to be found while the Welsh town of Pontypridd had been transplanted six miles north-west and placed where Tonypandy should be. Eccentric spellings have also appeared, such as Duncaster for Doncaster, while Ukrainians were surprised to find their capital city has been renamed Kylv. Apple has so far refused to comment. Carolina Milanese, technology analyst at research firm Gartner, said: &quot;Apple needs to resolve this very very quickly. I think they need to say something. This is not the quality people were expecting.&quot; Apple Maps replaces Google Maps as the default map service on the latest version Apple&apos;s iPhone and iPad software. And because Google has not yet created a standalone mapping app that can be downloaded to the phone, those updating their software to iOS6 will be left without Google Maps. Apple revolutionised first the music industry and now personal computing, but its foray into cartography looks likely to be less of a success. The service was created in collaboration with directories business Yelp and TomTom, the satellite navigation device maker, which has provided the turn-by-turn navigation technology and some of the mapping data. It draws on many other sources, including OpenStreetMap, Ordnance Survey and satellite images from Nasa. A spokesman for TomTom told the BBC its maps provided only a foundation to the service: &quot;The user experience is determined by adding additional features to the map application such as visual imagery. User experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make.&quot; John Walton of the website Australian Business Traveller observed that at least some locations were correctly mapped: &quot;If being able to navigate is important to you in the near term, we&apos;d recommend that you consider not upgrading to iOS6. The only way that iOS6 Maps is an improvement is if you&apos;re looking for an Apple Store. These are more prominently displayed than just about anything else in the cities where they appear.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Human figures crouch and kneel on the grass and behind bushes in a Tokyo park at night prying on couples having furtive sex on the ground.", "When his photographs were first exhibited in Tokyo in 1979, he wanted to capture the surreptitious nature of the project so visitors to the gallery were given torches in order to view them at close range in half-darkness."], "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture", "Exhibitions", "Liverpool", "Festivals"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-20T15:23:00Z", "title": "Park life: how photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki caught voyeurs in the act", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/20/kohei-yoshiyuki-voyeurs-liverpool-biennial", "article": "As Tate Modern&apos;s big 2010 exhibition, Exposed, showed, photography has always had a complex relationship with voyeurism. Brassai famously photographed the prostitutes of Paris at night in the 1920s. Helmet Newton&apos;s fashion photography was unapologetically voyeuristic as were some of Robert Mapplethorpe&apos;s more hardcore images of gay sex. In all of these cases, though, the subjects were aware of the presence of the camera and, to various degrees, responded to it. What, though, to make of Kohei Yoshiyuki&apos;s series, The Park, which is currently on show at the Open Eye Gallery in Liverpool as part of the city&apos;s art biennial? Raw, grainy and oddly lit, the images look seedy even before you realise what exactly Yoshiyuki&apos;s camera has captured. Then, they become seedier still, but oddly compelling. Human figures crouch and kneel on the grass and behind bushes in a Tokyo park at night prying on couples having furtive sex on the ground. Here, the voyeurs are caught in the act by another voyeur with a camera. And, as we look at these images \u2013 even in a gallery context \u2013 do we become voyeurs too? Yoshiyuki began making his series in the early 1970s, having literally stumbled on a couple having sex on the grass while he walked though Chuo Park in Shinjuku one summer night. He then noticed another couple crouching behind a tree clandestinely watching the couple on the ground. Intrigued, he spent the next six months befriending the Peeping Toms in the park before photographing them in action using infrared flash bulbs. He later said: &quot;I went there to become a friend of the voyeurs. To photograph the voyeurs, I needed to be considered one of them. I behaved like I had the same interest as the voyeurs, but I was equipped with a small camera.&quot;     Kohei Yoshiyuki, Untitled,\u00a01972, from\u00a0The Park. Photograph: Kohei Yoshiyuki, Courtesy Yossi Milo Gallery, New York     Yoshiyuki claimed that, in most instances, the couples having sex were unaware of the presence of the voyeurs or, indeed, of him. Often the watchers crept very close to the couples or even tried to touch them. Sometimes there were scuffles and fights. Yoshiyuki captured these elaborate nocturnal games of risk and sexual prying from the inside. When his photographs were first exhibited in Tokyo in 1979, he wanted to capture the surreptitious nature of the project so visitors to the gallery were given torches in order to view them at close range in half-darkness. At Open Eye that voyeuristic ambience is approximated in the usually bright gallery space but as yet, there has been no echo of the fierce storm of protest and angry debate that the original exhibition precipitated in Japan. Yoshiyuki&apos;s photographs seemed to touch a collective nerve. But did they say something about Japan&apos;s underground sexual culture or simply offend the morals of a rigorously respectable nation that considered the subject matter unfit for the gallery wall? Whatever, there are several precedents for Yoshiyuki&apos;s clandestine approach, including Weegee, who shot couples kissing in darkened cinemas with a hidden camera in the 1930s and 1940s and the eccentric Czech amateur photographer, Miroslav Tichy. In the early 1970s Tichy began making crude homemade cameras to surreptitiously shoot women sunbathing or bending over, or lounging in swimsuits at the local pool in his hometown, Kyjov. Tichy was considered a harmless loner with a pretend camera but he amassed a huge archive of badly printed, often indistinct, images which were purely for his own titillation. He has since become recognised as photography&apos;s equivalent of an outsider artist, with his work being shown in major galleries and lauded by critics.     Kohei Yoshiyuki, Untitled,\u00a01973, from\u00a0The Park. Photograph: Kohei Yoshiyuki, Courtesy Yossi Milo Gallery, New York     Closer still to Yoshiyuki&apos;s voyeuristic vision is the series Dirty Windows by the American photographer, Merry Alpern, first shown to considerable controversy in 1995. Alpern shot her clandestine photographs from an apartment window opposite the bathroom window of a low-rent sex hotel situated near Wall Street in Manhattan. Through the dirty windows, she caught photographic glimpses of various intimate exchanges including clients and call girls undressing, engaging in sex and taking cocaine. Like Yoshiyuki, Alpern is a kind of photographic stalker as well as a voyeur, but her images are mysterious and tantalising, hinting at, rather than revealing, the bigger picture. Yet, the same questions resound in her work as in Yoshiyuki&apos;s \u2013 in looking at her pictures, do we too become voyeurs? Or does the print and the gallery \u2013 and the passing of time \u2013 make the photographs somehow less transgressive, more artful? Now see this There&apos;s Something Happening Here is an intriguing title for an intriguing group show at Brancolini Grimaldi, London.

Vodafone customers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa experienced difficulties with BlackBerry Messenger, email and the internet for more than four hours from 8am (BST), with owner RIM admitting that difficulties with its smartphone continued until about 12.30pm. The company tweeted: &quot;Some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa are experiencing issues with their BlackBerry service.&quot; And an hour later it tweeted again: &quot;We are investigating and apologise for any inconvenience.&quot; Service was fully restored about 12.30pm, four-and-a-half hours after the BlackBerry service went down, the company said. &quot;Our apologies to any customers impacted by the BlackBerry service issue today. We can confirm that services have been restored and are now operating normally,&quot; RIM said in a statement. The glitch was only affecting Vodafone users, a RIM spokeswoman in London said. &quot;We are currently experiencing a BlackBerry service issue impacting some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa. All relevant support teams are working to resolve the issue. We apologise to any customers who may be affected.&quot; The outage was not expected to be as damaging as the one RIM suffered last year when BlackBerrys were hobbled for several days. But the timing is far from ideal as Apple continue to lap up worldwide publicity with the much-hyped launch of its iPhone 5. In a now familiar global ritual, Apple fans queued outside shops from Sydney to Tokyo to pick up the tech juggernaut&apos;s latest iPhone. Eager buyers formed long lines on Friday at Apple stores in Australia and Japan to be the first to get their hands on the latest version of the smartphone. In Hong Kong and Singapore, buyers had to sign up online for the chance to pick up the device at a prearranged time. The first customers in Hong Kong were greeted by staff cheering, clapping, and chanting &quot;iPhone 5! iPhone 5!&quot; and high-fiving them as they were escorted one-by-one through the front door. Apple&apos;s new smartphone is also being launched in the US, Britain, Canada, France and Germany. It will go on sale in 22 more countries a week later. The iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, has a taller screen, faster processor, updated software and can work on faster fourth generation mobile networks. The iPhone 5 has become a hot seller despite initial lukewarm reviews and controversy over its decision to dump Google Maps from its standard collection of pre-loaded apps and replace it with its own map app which has been criticised for losing towns, moving zoos and renaming key locations such as Paddington railway station in London. Apple received 2m orders in the first 24 hours of announcing the iPhone 5 release date, more than twice the number for the iPhone 4S in the same period when that phone launched a year ago, and analysts estimate it will ship as many as 10m by the end of September. The controversy over the decision to drop Google Maps is threatening to overshadow the launch as complaints flood in from users. Google is said to be working on a separate map app that iPhone users can download."}, {"sentences": ["Typically, Physarum set out from Beijing and hooked up with oat flakes in Seoul and Tokyo, before colonising both Koreas and Japan in less than a day."], "tags": ["Microbiology", "Biology", "Science", "Animals", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-21T14:51:38Z", "title": "If slime mould ruled the world | Ian Sample", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/sep/21/slime-mould-world", "article": "One question never far from scientists&apos; minds is how events might unfold were a giant slime mould to emerge in the Far East and embark on global domination. History tells us what happened when restless humans set out into the world. Kingdoms rose and fell as wars raged. Urban centres grew and connected. Trade networks spread, first across countries, later spanning whole continents. But slime mould is a different beast. Would the same scenarios play out as it colonised the world? After a series of simple experiments involving agar, a globe, a bag of oats, and an obliging slime mould, an answer, of sorts, is now at hand. Andy Adamatzky, director of the Unconventional Computing Centre at the University of the West of England in Bristol, picked slime mould \u2013 an amoeba-like, single-celled organism, Physarum polycephalum \u2013 as a harmless and friendly creature to work with. In its vegetative phase, it goes in search of food by extending &quot;protoplasmic tubes&quot;, which transport nutrients and metabolites through the organism&apos;s body. Left to their own devices, slime moulds establish protoplasmic networks that maximise the nutrients they can draw from nearby food sources. This ability makes them natural path-computing machines, says Adamatzky. In the arcane language of the field, he says the organism &quot;acts like an amorphous massively parallel computer, with distributed inputs, or sensors, decentralised information processing and decision making and parallel actuation.&quot; The impressive behaviour of P. polycephalum has been likened to a primitive form of intelligence. The Japanese scientist Toshiyuki Nakagaki at Hokkaido University has reported &quot;smart behaviour&quot; in a slime mould that solved a maze after morsels of food were placed at the start and finish points. The slime mould grew through the maze, stumbled upon the food and then withdrew its protoplasmic tubes from dead ends. Not bad for a creature with no brain. Adamatzky took a different tack. &quot;I poured hot agar gel on a globe to make several good layers, then cut out continents and removed agar corresponding to oceans, seas, and large lakes. Then I placed oat flakes in the locations of the most populated cities and inoculated slime mould in Beijing.&quot; That&apos;s a globe of agar continents with oat flakes in place of major conurbations, and a starter colony of slime mould in the capital of China. Science is not for the impatient. Covering a globe with agar takes time. You have to pour it on layer by layer and let it cool. Then you have to cut round the continents and peel off the seas. And that&apos;s before you even get started. It takes over a week for slime mould to colonise a 15cm-diameter globe. &quot;The real challenge was to be patient,&quot; says Adamatzky. Typically, Physarum set out from Beijing and hooked up with oat flakes in Seoul and Tokyo, before colonising both Koreas and Japan in less than a day. From there it moved on to Hong Kong and Hanoi. A short branch would link up with Ho Chi Minh and Jakarta, and occasionally bridge over to New Zealand and Australia. The main branch pressed on, from Hanoi to Kolkata, Delhi, Tehran, Istanbul and London. Most surprising to Adamatzky were the patterns that emerged over time. The slime mould recreated more than 76% of the Great Silk Road trading routes and parts of the Asian Highway Network. &quot;It is not just [taking] the shortest path,&quot; said Adamatsky. &quot;The slime mould&apos;s behaviour is affected by a combination of chemo-attractant gradients released by several metropolitan areas and shapes of continents.&quot; Here&apos;s an early version of the paper, due to be published in the International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos. And what does all this tell us? Adamatzky thinks we have plenty to learn from these brainless organisms. He wants the work to inspire fresh thinking on how ancient roads came to be. But that&apos;s not all. The creature&apos;s behaviour might spur unorthodox approaches to planning future traffic routes, or predicting the spread of global disease. In taking over the planet, slime mould might help us find our own way in the world."}, {"sentences": ["Hopefully next time I play in a final I&apos;ll be a little more ready for it, and hopefully it won&apos;tbe so humid.&quot; Robson had planned to play in Tokyo but missed out because of her performance in Guangzhou."], "tags": ["Laura Robson", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-22T18:54:33Z", "title": "Laura Robson moving up in tennis world despite defeat in WTA final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/22/laura-robson-tennis-wta-final", "article": "Laura Robson has set her sights on breaking into the top 50 by the end of the year after narrowly missing out on winning a first WTA Tour title.

Teams who look relegation certainties before a ball is kicked win two of their first four games. Other sides, more fancied, unravel inside a month. Previously unconsidered contenders for national recognition suddenly become the urgent answer to England&apos;s prayers, at least for a week or two. The trick, for coaches, players and pundits alike, is to recognise the difference between a flash in the pan and a longer-term asset. We can only assume Sale&apos;s chief executive, Steve Diamond, is blessed with appropriate psychic powers to make that crucial distinction. Even by the standards of Lord Sugar, the firing of the Sharks&apos; forwards coach, Steve Scott, at the weekend, four matches into the new season, was as brutal \u2013 or desperate \u2013 as it gets. Diamond is basically inviting us to believe that Scott, who was hired only in December 2010, has gone from quality Premiership coach to clueless muppet inside three weeks. How else to explain the managerial thinking that believes everything is ready for a top-four finish on 1 September and then abandons the plan on 22 September, having called an emergency meeting for all staff? It is not often Gary Barlow gets a mention on the Guardian&apos;s rugby pages but maybe the pre-match DJ at Salford City Stadium should give Patience by Take That a spin prior to the next home game. Scott can hardly say he was not forewarned. He would have known about Diamond&apos;s itchy trigger-finger from the abrupt departure of Tony Hanks as coach in March after a heavy home defeat by Saracens. Losing badly in front of Sale&apos;s own supporters, as happened again against London Welsh on Friday, clearly drives Diamond, and the club&apos;s owner, Brian Kennedy, to distraction. What happens next will be fascinating. &quot;There are people who are wanting to have a go at me and the team and I don&apos;t mind that because I know where we are going over the next three, four or five years,&quot; stated Diamond, fully aware that his new head coach, Bryan Redpath, has been back at the club for only a few months himself and cannot be held entirely responsible for the squad he has inherited. &quot;I have got total confidence in Bryan and, let&apos;s be honest, I put all of that team together that played on Friday, not Brush. So if anyone should take the flak for that, it should be me.&quot; But what price that still being the case if Sale keep on losing? Does the buck stop with Diamond, now coaching the forwards again, or Redpath? Not so long ago it was all Mike Brewer&apos;s fault. It is verging on a soccer-style soap opera, another example of the increasing footballisation (to use an appropriately ugly word) of rugby union. Olly Barkley&apos;s hasty switch from Bath to Racing M\u00e9tro reflects the same trend. One minute Barkley is the linchpin of Bath&apos;s backline and swearing undying love to his first senior club, having previously decamped to Gloucester and never settled. The next he is off to Paris with scarcely a backward glance. Professional sportsmen are perfectly entitled to earn a buck wherever they can but this particular deal has a collective whiff of knee-jerk about it. If Barkley can land in France mid-season and make an instant success of things, good luck to him. I fear it is more likely both he and Bath will ultimately regret their abrupt parting. As for Racing&apos;s seeming inability to rear, or produce, their own homegrown players, it implies a club where desperation for success is outpacing common sense. There are already mutterings from within the Bath dressing-room about the surfeit of coaches analysing their every move. &quot;You can&apos;t do anything at training without someone standing behind you,&quot; one Bath player told me recently, painting a not entirely flattering Big Brother-style portrait of the working environment. Nor were Barkley and the ex-England defence coach Mike Ford bosom buddies back in the days when the former was in the national set-up. Perhaps the fly-half needed less financial persuasion to swap the Avon for the Seine than people imagined. Either way, it is clear rugby clubs do not resemble most normal offices. Those in charge must surely recognise by now that constant tinkering is counter-productive. Freddie Burns, Luther Burrell and Tom Savage, by way of example, are all young players who have made an excellent impression in the season&apos;s early weeks. More top-level evidence is required, though, before Stuart Lancaster can start getting really excited. Identifying the right players \u2013 and coaches \u2013 in the first place and then sticking with them through thick and thin is the only surefire route to lasting success. Supporters of Bath and Sale can only hope those calling the shots appreciate this. If it is simply a case of change for change&apos;s sake, it will be years before either of the two clubs wins a trophy. Big in Japan Sometimes just one line in the paper can induce melancholy. In this instance it was the following: &quot;Former All Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams has scored his first try since his high-priced move to Japanese rugby.&quot; The piece went on to report that Williams&apos; Panasonic Wild Knights had gone down 32-22 to Toshiba Brave Lupus in Tokyo. Apparently Williams is set to earn about \u00a3750,000 for playing 12 games in Japan&apos;s Top League. What a waste, not for him but the rest of us. Williams could be playing for his country in their historic first Rugby Championship visit to Argentina this weekend. Instead the most talented midfield back that rugby union has seen in ages is battling forlornly against the Brave Lupus. But hold on. Maybe Sonny Bill, and his agent, are ahead of the game. Japan is staging the 2019 World Cup and it is in everyone&apos;s interest for rugby in Asia to grow in popularity. Signing the king of the offload will certainly assist that. So instead of lamenting what might have been, we should all be wishing Sonny Bill well. The more tries he scores in Japan, the better for the sport in the long term. Hold on tight for \u2026 Argentina v New Zealand in Buenos Aires this weekend. The Pumas are a different proposition at home and not many teams come away victorious. They are also due to play the Springboks in Rosario the following week, another potential cracker. The All Black game should be some fiesta, particularly if Argentina score early."}, {"sentences": ["Sniggering, my classmates told me this dish was known as &quot;Bombing Tokyo&quot;."], "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-25T10:00:00Z", "title": "Revolting names for delicious dishes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/sep/25/revolting-names-for-delicious-dishes", "article": "Browsing a menu during a recent visit to Taipei, the name of one particular dish leapt out at me: &quot;spicy fried fly heads&quot;. I ordered it, and sure enough, it did look as though a few flies had fallen into the wok, visually ruining an otherwise delightful stir-fry of flowering chives with minced pork and chilli. However, the &quot;fly heads&quot; were fermented black soya beans used to give the chives a bolt of umami flavour, and the dish, served in the Five Dime restaurant, was delicious. It was the first time I&apos;d eaten spicy fly heads, but it reminded me of the &quot;squashed fly&quot; biscuits I ate as a child, in which dark, squishy currants were sandwiched between rectangles of sweet pastry. Familiarity usually blinds us to the revolting names of favourite dishes. &quot;Toad in the hole&quot;, for example, might not be the first choice of a foreign tourist struggling to read an English menu, but every Brit thinks of it simply as sausages baked in a batter pudding. Nigella Lawson may invite her readers to thrill and horrify children at a Halloween Party with newly-invented recipes entitled &quot;blood clots&quot; and &quot;pus&quot;, but who blinks at a Bloody Mary cocktail with its allusions to vampirism and a monarch who burned hundreds of people at the stake? And while most westerners are appalled by the consumption of dog meat in parts of East Asia, does anyone think twice about scoffing a hot dog? Some foods are named after human body parts, including ladies&apos; fingers, for okra, nipples of Venus (Capezzoli di Venere) for an Italian sweetmeat, and ladies&apos; thighs (kad\u0131nbudu k\u00f6ftesi), for a Turkish minced-meat kebab. Most such dishes seem to be inspired by the female anatomy: don&apos;t we ever eat men? There are names that sound offensive in one culture but not in another, like the Sichuanese &quot;Pock-Marked Old Woman&apos;s Tofu&quot; (mapo tofu). The Chinese tend to take a no-nonsense approach to personal remarks (my Chinese friends often greet me with a cheery smile and the exclamation: &quot;ni pang le!&quot; - you&apos;ve really fattened up!). Calling a dish after a woman&apos;s disfiguring facial scars is meant, and said, affectionately. &quot;Ants climbing a tree&quot; (mayi shangshu), a tangle of beanthread noodles speckled with ant-like morsels of minced pork, is another Sichuanese dish that might not sound too appealing to foreigners who haven&apos;t been won over by Noma&apos;s appetiser of real, live ants. And then there&apos;s just bad taste. One dish I learned to make at cooking school in Sichuan consisted of a sliced pork and vegetables in a scalding-hot sauce that was taken to the table and poured over a pile of deep-fried crispy rice with a violent sizzling and a cloud of steam.

In what will be viewed as an attempt to rebuild confidence in financial markets, the banking lobby group is to be replaced by a formal regulator that will oversee the rate that is used to set prices on $300tn of financial products from New York to Tokyo. Libor, formally known as the London interbank offered rate, is a measure of the price banks have to pay to borrow from each other but was barely known outside financial markets until June when Barclays&apos; attempts at manipulation were revealed. The scandal eventually led to the departure of the chief executive Bob Diamond and other senior figures at the bank. The rate is currently set by a panel of banks being asked the price at which they expect to borrow over 15 periods, from overnight to 12 months, in 10 currencies. It does not ask the price at which they have actually borrowed. It is then used as the basis on which banks decide to lend to their customers. They usually quote a percentage over Libor for loans to businesses and use the rate to calculate mortgage and credit card costs. The BBA has been involved with the Libor rate setting since 1986. It has now emerged the system has been vulnerable to manipulation since at least 2005. The end of the current Libor regime is expected to be formally announced on Friday by Martin Wheatley, the top City regulator appointed by the Treasury to review the way the market operates. He has already branded the existing system &quot;no longer fit for purpose&quot; and is expected to recommend changes to the way the rate is calculated. The scale of the manipulation of the rate from 2005, and then during the 2008 banking crisis \u2013 when regulators were closely monitoring the rate for signs of banks being in distress \u2013 has proved to be vast. Regulators published email exchanges in which Barclays staff were offered bottles of Bollinger champagne to change the rate in the run-up to the crisis so that traders could make bigger profits \u2013 and bonuses. When the 2008 financial crisis set in, the bank artificially pushed down the rate it was being charged to borrow from other banks because it was concerned about its public image. Other banks are also braced for fines for attempting to manipulate the rate, including the taxpayer bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland. Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, said on Tuesday Libor and other misconduct would cost the bank &quot;a lot of money&quot;. The Financial Services Authority has said seven financial institutions, apart from Barclays, are being investigated. The BBA&apos;s council voted a fortnight ago to give up its role in setting the rate. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the BBA said only that it was &quot;working with&quot; the Wheatley review team, and added: &quot;If Mr Wheatley&apos;s recommendations include a change of responsibility for Libor, the BBA will support that.&quot; Wheatley, who is to head the Financial Conduct Authority when it is spun out of the FSA next year, has reached his conclusions after a month-long consultation in which he considered whether the individuals involved in setting Libor should be formally regulated by the FSA. This would make it easier to fine and reprimand any wrongdoing. He may also change in the way Libor is calculated in an effort to make it more difficult to manipulate. While the BBA has published the rate, it has never been directly regulated, despite the special role it has in being used as a benchmark against which banks decide to lend to companies and individuals. The BBA became involved in 1984, when the City was experimenting with new ways to price interest rates, and the first official rates were published in 1986. The banks which are members of the BBA had asked the lobby group to set the rate, although the organisation has been trying to encourage more formal regulation since 2008."}, {"sentences": ["A Hong Kong-Chinese film has been withdrawn from the Tokyo international film festival owing to ongoing political tensions between China and Japan, reports Screen Daily.", "&quot;It is with great regret that we have to announce the cancellation of the scheduled screening of Floating City at the 25th Tokyo international film festival owing to certain reasons on the production side,&quot; a statement read.", "The move to withdraw Floating City countered suggestions by Tokyo international film festival chairman Tom Yoda last week that political tensions would not affect the festival.", "The 25th Tokyo international film festival is due to run from 20-28 October."], "tags": ["Film", "World cinema", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "Festivals", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-26T10:16:04Z", "title": "Chinese film pulled from Tokyo film festival over row with Japan", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/26/floating-city-tokyo-international-film-festival", "article": "A Hong Kong-Chinese film has been withdrawn from the Tokyo international film festival owing to ongoing political tensions between China and Japan, reports Screen Daily.

The move to withdraw Floating City countered suggestions by Tokyo international film festival chairman Tom Yoda last week that political tensions would not affect the festival.

The long-running territorial dispute has escalated dramatically in recent weeks, with violent anti-Japanese protests in China over the uninhabited islets, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Koichiro Gemba urged Beijing to exercise restraint when he met his counterpart, Yang Jieshi, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Tuesday, according to Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency. Xinhua, China&apos;s state news agency, said Yang reiterated that the East China Sea islands had been the country&apos;s &quot;sacred territory since ancient times&quot;.

China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman said they discussed issues &quot;frankly and deeply&quot;. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, north Asia director for the International Crisis Group, welcomed the discussions as a positive step. &quot;It&apos;s a good sign that they&apos;re talking, but it&apos;s difficult to see how either one is going to be able to substantially walk back their positions,&quot; she said. &quot;One hopes they will be able to exercise the leadership and vision necessary, but there are domestic challenges in both countries which make it very difficult for the leaderships to be seen as weak on this issue. The status quo was broken by Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands and China&apos;s announcement of the baseline.&quot; China is preparing for the handover of power to a new generation of leaders, while in Japan the unpopular ruling party will soon face an election. Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands came after the nationalist governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, said the city would buy them. The central government feared that would spark greater conflict. The islands are surrounded by fisheries and potentially valuable energy resources, but the dispute is also fuelled by long-running historical tensions over Japan&apos;s brutal occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as Japanese anxieties over China&apos;s growing might. Analysts say neither side wants the matter to escalate \u2013 particularly given the risk of further damage to crucial economic ties. But there are concerns that an unintended collision or a misjudgment in a standoff between vessels from the two countries in the waters around the islands might spark a more serious clash. Reuters reported that Japanese carmakers Toyota, Nissan and Suzuki are already cutting back on production in China after the mass protests closed dealerships and dimmed sales prospects. Xinhua said over 52,000 seat reservations have been cancelled on flights between the two countries between September and November, citing All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. On Monday, the Japanese coastguard used water cannon to disperse dozens of fishing boats from Taiwan \u2013 which also claims the islands \u2013 from disputed waters. A spokesman for Beijing&apos;s state council Taiwan affairs office said that Chinese vessels would be ready to offer help to both Taiwanese and mainland vessels fishing around the islands, Xinhua reported on Wednesday. China is involved in several territorial disputes. Xinhua announced that officials plan a 10-fold increase in the maximum punishment for failures to map it in full. Current regulations stipulate a fine of up to 10,000 yuan for those who fail to include the country&apos;s entire territory, but the new law would increase the maximum penalty to 100,000 yuan."}, {"sentences": ["Every year I take 20 year 11 and 13 students out to Tokyo for the two week annual exchange to Kanto Daiichi Senior High School, in Edogawa ward, Tokyo."], "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Schools", "Secondary schools", "Primary schools", "Teaching"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-26T15:00:00Z", "title": "International lesson ideas: bringing a world view into the classroom", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/sep/26/international-lesson-ideas", "article": "Crispin Chambers, head of Japanese, Tavistock College, Devon We connect with one of our former pupils who works at a junior high school in the Miyagi prefecture in Japan, one of the many schools directly affected by the tsunami, last March. In response to her appeal, our year 8 and 9 students each wrote a letter in Japanese introducing themselves and asking how we could help. The response was amazing with the English teachers allocating a letter to each of their Japanese students. We received very moving accounts of the personal experiences of the Japanese pupil including photos of the school gymnasium used as temporary accommodation to over 100 people who had lost their homes. This exchange of letters has been ongoing and helped our pupils understand the terrible reality of the tsunami. The Japanese pupils and teachers expressed their appreciation at our concern and put up our colourful posters on their classroom walls wishing them well. We also have Japanese lessons that we give to our feeder primary schools, cultural talks to people in residential homes, Japanese lessons for parents and a year 7 calligraphy club. Every year I take 20 year 11 and 13 students out to Tokyo for the two week annual exchange to Kanto Daiichi Senior High School, in Edogawa ward, Tokyo. Jo Speak, assistant headteacher and international co-ordinator, Cookridge Primary School, Leeds One of the most inspiring things we have done is the work with our partner school in Mexico, Colegio Esperanza, and when the Mexican teachers visited we planned a project about inspirational women face-to-face. We started it on Human Rights Day and used the Peace Jam site to look at women of inspiration around the world. Then we looked at women in our own localities who had done inspirational things and we focused on the stories of two women. The Mexican school did the same. To reflect this we have made a cloak that will be split in half - and half of it will be sent to Mexico. It started as a whole school project with each class producing some art work which will be part of the cloak; there are printed pieces, sewed objects and laminated pieces which all form part of it. Our art group has also helped bring all the pieces together and the whole thing will be shared between the two schools. Another thing we do is to hold a yearly event called International Cookridge Week. It&apos;s based on the cultural experience of students at the school and we involve our partner schools. Most of the week is run by the parents. We have a lot of children here from the Middle East and last year we had a group of Arabic-speaking mums who looked at how they could support learning during that week. So they buddied up with a class teacher to read a book in English and Arabic and then we also had a cultural cabaret and world cafe. The world cafe saw parents bringing in dishes from Libya, Iran and so on and we fed the entire school. The children learn a lot about culture through the food. Nicola Starke, year 6 teacher, St Helen&apos;s Junior School, Barry, South Wales We have children at school from India, Philippines, Hungary, France, Germany and Malta. The International Primary Curriculum is helping us to draw these countries into our learning and, as a result, it&apos;s giving our international children a chance to come to the forefront, creating real purpose for them to talk about themselves and their families. For example, one of our families, from Kerala, went home to India for the holiday and came back with a photograph showing the girls holding a big cacao pod from their grandmother&apos;s garden. This fitted perfectly into our unit on chocolate. All of a sudden it wasn&apos;t just a cool photograph, but a photograph that was adding value to everyone&apos;s learning. This was hugely empowering for those girls; making them feel special because they could add something to the learning that no one else could. As part of the holiday unit, the children had to become travel agents for the day. They were given plenty of notice to prepare for this and as a result they went to the maddest lengths to get artefacts to support their table-top displays. Several children selected places they had visited on holiday in order to use souvenirs and photographs they had at home. Others picked countries where their extended family lives. Such activities also get the parents involved in the learning process which has had a very positive effect. Anthony David, headteacher of St Paul&apos;s CE Primary School, Mill Hill, London The most interesting way we have used international collaboration in our school has been partnering with another London school and the International School of the Hague (ISH) and holding joint school council meetings. We discuss a common theme like the playground. We link up using Skype and the first thing I usually hear from the pupils in my school when they see the ISH pupils is &quot;they&apos;re not wearing school uniform!&quot; Our common language is English and although it is early days for us in doing this it is vital in building relationships so that going on we can discuss more delicate things like behaviour management. St Paul&apos;s is a one form entry school but we have 50 plus nationalities and so we also celebrate a country of the month. It ties into our learning objectives - for example we have been doing fashion and we held a Ghanaian fashion event. We had a parent provide 40 or so different costumes and we all wore Ghanaian dress - including myself. It was fantastic. The school is an international London school, it was founded by Sir William Wilberforce, if that doesn&apos;t make the school international I don&apos;t know what does. Andr\u00e9e Jordan, international co-ordinator, Ravensbourne School, Bromley, London A really good lesson for international collaboration, for use in religious studies or in many other subjects for anything from year 6 to post 16, is based on a resource called The Peace Room. The idea is that students nominate someone for entry into the Peace Room for the good work they have done. To do this, they have to research the person they think has made a positive difference to the world and to write something that persuades others to nominate their entry. Within the class, there can then be a meeting. There has to be a chairperson and one by one, students submit their nominations by telling the rest of the class who they have nominated. The student explains why their person should be allowed into the Peace Room. The chairperson then invites comments from the other students. Everyone listens and then votes on the nomination. If there are video conferencing facilities, like Skype or Flashmeeting, this can be done together with a group from somewhere else in the world. Students can then upload their nominations to the actual website, and others can vote for them. If they get more than 10 votes, then they get put into the Peace Room and the writer is sent a certificate as a world e-citizen. Kieran Walsh member of senior leadership team and year 6 teacherRoskear Primary School, Camborne We have a partnership with a school in Uganda (St Joseph&apos;s) and we do lots to link with them; we share all sorts of PE resources and we have even sent out old laptops to help with their IT. All of our topics we try and link with Uganda and think what we can do with them. We have been studying rivers as part of the IPC (International Primary Curriculum) and we located the source of the Nile in Uganda and the children in Uganda sent us live videos of it and pictures of the animals in the surrounding area, which really made it come to life in class. It made the learning very, very real for the children. It&apos;s a really lovely link. Our next topic is a bit more tricky because it is on space and so we are going to do some work that can tie in with their curriculum because basically they just do maths, English and RE. We will make some space resources and now they have laptops we can send over some PowerPoints. Our children in Cornwall are really cut away from the rest of the country and so it is not a culturally diverse place and so the work we have been doing with the school in Uganda makes the children look at the differences between them and also the similarities. They all love football. Joy Pearson, foundation stage teacher, Kingsway Primary School, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottingham Last year year 5 focused on Peter and the Wolf with our partner school in Spain. The teacher in Spain is basically an artist so the pupils there did this amazing collage with seeds and beans. Usually we send work over to each other when it is completed but that one didn&apos;t get sent. Here we focused on the music of Peter and the Wolf in Spanish and the children learnt about all the instruments in the orchestra and we played games and so on to help with that. They also made a class book and sent copies of that to Spain. In foundation stage we did The Gingerbread Man and that was great as the Spanish pupils made some gingerbread men and sent them over and we did lots of work in Spanish looking at how things travel from one place to another.

This is a gorgeous furry teacup of a film, preposterous and filled with secrets; it is itself one big secret. Holy Motors is simultaneously immersive and alienating. The audience is forever being encouraged to forget about narrative sense and slip into a warm bath of unreason, but persistently jolted back out of it with non-sequiturs, accordion interludes, gags and unexpected chimps. \nThere is something very mad about this film, consumed with a ferociously eccentric need to let no windmill go&nbsp;untilted-at. When so many film-makers are content with what Peter Greenaway identified as pre-cinematic products \u2013 films that look like staid adaptations of novels or plays, whether&nbsp;they are or not \u2013 Carax really wants to use the freedom and evolved fluidity of the cinema. When I&nbsp;first saw this, I wrote that it had an inspired touch of dishevelment and derangement. It makes most other films look very buttoned-up. \nCarax's star is his longtime collaborator Denis Levant, playing Monsieur Oscar, an enigmatic businessman employed by a shadowy organisation run by a moustachioed boss (Michel Piccoli), who makes a brief and disgruntled appearance. Oscar is being ferried around Paris in the back of a white stretch limo; at the wheel is his trusted driver, C\u00e9line, played by Edith Scob. Levant's face is as inscrutable as Buster Keaton's, but its unreadability is all his own: it is a ruined-cherub face, or the face of an alien possessed of unearthly powers. Monsieur Oscar has a number of \"appointments\" to complete by the end of the day, whose specific needs he assesses by scanning various case folders. For each appointment, he gets into a new disguise: the back of the car is like a theatrical dressing room, and like Jim Phelps in TV's Mission: Impossible, he uses latex face masks. \nBut what on earth are these appointments? For one, he dresses as an old beggar woman, shambles around for a bit \u2013 apparently without talking or making contact with anyone \u2013 and then climbs back into the car. For another, he becomes a motion-capture acrobat, dressed in a skintight black catsuit with white balls, contorting around a hi-tech studio with a red-leather-clad woman in a daring and erotic routine that morphs into the very on-screen CGI animation they are creating. In another guise, he becomes \"Monsieur Merde\", the priapic, green-suited, flower-munching imp Carax and Levant created in a short piece for the 2008 portmanteau film Tokyo. Merde kidnaps an unsmiling fashion model played by Eva Mendes and holds her captive in a cave. He even has a poignant, even tragic encounter with Eva, a woman who appears to be his lost love \u2013 a stylish yet gentle singing performance from Kylie Minogue. \nCarax gives us cinephile allusions to Jean Cocteau, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Demy and Georges Franju in the course of the film; with a chilling mask, Scob reprises her own famous persona from Franju's 1960 film Eyes Without a Face.&nbsp;But more potent influences are perhaps JG Ballard, Lewis Carroll, Fritz Lang or David Lynch, whose Eraserhead and Inland Empire hover over the weird introduction, in which the director himself awakens and wanders through a darkened cinema auditorium accompanied by the unsettling sound of seagulls. Perhaps Oscar's guises are an exhibition of grotesques, a satirical commentary on our yearning for logic&nbsp;and progress in our lives, a yearning for&nbsp;stability and identity, or&nbsp;the exact opposite, a yearning to escape the prison of identity. It could be punk Buddhism, a set of wacky reincarnations, or maybe the film is in fact a literary adaptation of two lines from TS Eliot's Prufrock: \"There will be time/ To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet.\" \nYet the absurdity and dream anti-logic give an unexpected force to the serious and passionate moments, which are the more moving and disturbing because they come out of nowhere and are so overwhelmingly real. At one moment, Oscar is a dying, wealthy old man making a tragic farewell to his devoted great-niece L\u00e9a (Elise Lhomeau), whom he has made rich, but in so doing evidently caused her to attract a man who has broken her heart. In another gripping scene, Oscar becomes a grumpy dad, picking up his unhappy teenage daughter from a party. His treatment of her is one of the scariest things I have seen at the cinema all year. \nHoly Motors could be a multiple-personality disorder of the spirit, a tragicomic shattering of the self, caused by some catastrophe that has happened just out of sight, just beyond the reach of memory. But it's quite possible it's just bravura, imagination, fun. This is the theory I favour. It's pure pleasure."}, {"sentences": ["They were the &quot;juggernaut leading the Korean Wave across Asia, the embodiment of the ultra-slick choreography and catchy pop songs that earned K-pop its reputation&quot;, says Robert Poole, chief executive of SomethingDrastic, a Tokyo-based Asian music promoter."], "tags": ["K-pop", "Pop and rock", "South Korea", "Music", "Culture", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Psy", "Gangnam Style"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-28T08:59:00Z", "title": "K-pop stars: the lowdown on South Korean pop", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kpop-stars-lowdown-south-korean-pop", "article": "     His quirky dance steps and unforgettable sing-a-long chorus have given us the smash pop hit of the year. By the weekend, Psy, the podgy antihero behind the Gangnam Style phenomenon, is expected to make history by becoming the first Korean to reach No 1 in the UK charts, having already risen to the top of the iTunes download charts here and in the US. Other South Korean artists may have mixed feelings about the astounding success of Gangnam Style. Riding the crest of the &quot;Hallyu&quot; wave that has already swept across much of east Asia, the highly stylised, impeccably sculptured boy and girl bands made the leap to the US and Europe the hard way. Then along comes a chubby 34-year-old armed with a catchy tune, an endearing, if hopelessly daft, dance, and becomes an overnight viral sensation. In the space of a few weeks, Psy has made Gangnam Stylists out of everyone, from Britney Spears to the US navy. His words \u2013 surely unintelligible to most of the people behind the 290mn views his YouTube video has attracted \u2013 have been pored over for what they say about the shallowness of modern South Korean society. One Guardian columnist wondered if Psy, rather than breaking the K-pop mould, had reinforced stereotypes of socially challenged, middle-aged east Asian men. Other K-pop artists might feel aggrieved at his rapid, effortless rise, appearances on the US TV chatshow circuit and myriad copycat routines. But they also have reason to be grateful to Psy, aka Park Jae-sang. He has shoved open the door for other Korean pop artists hoping to turn regional stardom into international success. Some have already penetrated the US market, and most are household names in Japan, but few register among British music fans. Who, then, should we be looking out for to take up Psy&apos;s mantle? 2NE1            2NE1 \u2013 &quot;to anyone&quot; or &quot;twenty one&quot;\u2013 were born to crack the west,&quot; according to Mio Scobie, overseas editor of Us Weekly magazine and a self-confessed K-pop addict. Their appeal lies in their refusal to be bound to the musical style of other K-pop girl groups. Unlike their saccharine Japanese counterparts 2NE1 don&apos;t attempt to hide their sexuality, but balance it with an &quot;assertiveness&quot; that Scobie likens to the Spice Girls, &quot;minus the bad singing&quot;. Will.i.am is producing their debut US album, so, Scobie adds, &quot;be prepared for a hip-hop infused electro feast to soon dominate the airwaves&quot;. Big Bang            Big Bang, stablemates of 2NE1 at the hugely successful label YG Entertainment, owe nothing to the accessible charm and androgynous features of your typical boyband. Each of the five members has his own individual look, and their musical range is equally eclectic, covering R&amp;B, hip-hop, house, electro and pop. Having conquered Korea and Japan (where they were named &quot;Korean group Japanese fans want to see most&quot;) the band went on to win best worldwide act in the Asia-Pacific category at the 2011 MTV Europe music awards, and their YouTube channel has received more than 400m views. Big Bang are now on their first world tour, taking in 25 cities in 16 countries. Girls&apos; Generation            This girl group have matched their stunning physical presence \u2013 they have perhaps the longest legs in K-pop \u2013 with a string of hits and recognition across Asia and, more recently, the US. They were the &quot;juggernaut leading the Korean Wave across Asia, the embodiment of the ultra-slick choreography and catchy pop songs that earned K-pop its reputation&quot;, says Robert Poole, chief executive of SomethingDrastic, a Tokyo-based Asian music promoter. In less than five years, the nine-member group have amassed sales of more than 30m digital singles and 4.4m albums. Girls&apos; Generation exemplify the global ambition of K-pop&apos;s wily promoters: their 2011 single The Boys was released in Korean, Japanese and, for the first time, English. This year they became the first Korean act to perform on The Late Show With David Letterman, and the first on syndicated TV in the US. In 2011 they earned more than US$88m for their label, SM Entertainment, and are expected to earn double that this year. U-Kiss            The clue to U-Kiss&apos;s ambition is in their name: Ubiquitous Korean International Idol SuperStar. They are considered the underdogs of the Korean boyband scene, but their following overseas is &quot;something else&quot;, according to Scobie. Their fans, known as KissMe&apos;s, have turned to social media to spread the group&apos;s name, resulting in concerts in France, Thailand, the US, Colombia and Cambodia. Like many of their K-pop contemporaries, U-Kiss have a loyal following in Japan. If, as some expect, they make it in the US, chatshow appearances shouldn&apos;t be a problem: several members of the band speak English, including AJ, who recently took time off to study at Columbia University. Their new single, Stop Girl, released this month, was recorded in Korean and English, and is being promoted in 10 countries, including the US, China and Japan. Sistar            These relative newcomers to the K-pop scene have already made one comeback since their debut in 2010. &quot;In a sea of bubblegum-cute popsters, Sistar stand out for their cool and sexy image,&quot; says Scobie. The band&apos;s eagerly awaited summer single, Loving U, immediately topped major online music charts in South Korea, although they have yet to make much of an impact internationally. That could all change soon, though: the group&apos;s lead singer, Hyorin, has been likened to Beyonc\u00e9 for her husky voice, incredible range and soulful contributions to songs that, unusually perhaps for this genre, deal as much with falling out of love as falling in love. The group were the centre of controversy when their saucy &quot;butt dance&quot; for How Dare You was banned on South Korean TV. Beast            The six-member boyband came in for some unkind press coverage when they debuted in 2009. South Korean media pointed out that the members had all had solo careers or been part of other, unsuccessful, groups. Despite their status as a &quot;recycled&quot; act, Beast set about proving their doubters wrong with a combination of self-belief and sheer hard work. Past failures aside, Beast are a talented bunch. They wrote all of the songs on their newest album, Midnight Sun. Their summer smash hit, Beautiful Night coincided with a successful world tour. The single, says Scobie, &quot;wouldn&apos;t feel out of place in a London nightclub&quot;. Wonder Girls            They are veterans of K-pop, having made their debut in 2007 and racking up a string of hits since. Their foray into the US market was a resounding success when they became the first Korean group to make it on to the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2009, the year they also supported the Jonas Brothers on tour. This year, Wonder Girls collaborated with the rapper Akon on Like Money, and appeared in an eponymously titled movie on the Nickelodeon TV network. Rumour has it that next year will bring more collaborations with US artists and possibly their own reality TV show. Their 2009 hit, Nobody, was the first K-pop song to get radio airplay in the US and one that every K-pop fan knows off by heart. Super Junior            The group have been around since 2005, so some members are about to reach the ripe old age of 30 \u2013 normally grounds for retirement in the youth-obsessed world of K-pop. Yet far from going gracefully, the boyband continue to churn out hits with unforgettable hooks, and their photos still adorn the walls of teenagers&apos; bedrooms across Asia. The band&apos;s 10 members specialise in high-energy dance routines and addictive choruses. Their 2012 summer EP, Sexy, Free &amp; Single debuted on the iTunes top 10 pop albums chart at No 1 in Japan and No 6 in the US, and also earned top 10 places in France, Australia and Canada. Their world tour this year included a sellout concert in Paris. 2PM            These are the alpha males of the K-pop world, but with a twist. The proud owners of impressive six-packs, 2PM do sensitive Boys II Men-style harmonies just as well as their edgier rap repertoire. Heartbreak is the thread that runs through most of their music, but they have been known to produce a catchy party anthem or two. The band comprise Korean, Korean-American and Thai members, most of whom speak English, and are represented in the US by the same agency that looks after Mariah Carey, Kanye West and Justin Bieber. They are about to embark on a global tour, performing at venues in Europe, North America and Asia."}, {"sentences": ["&apos;&apos;What were we going to do, force (Apple) to include the software?&quot; Schmidt said in Tokyo on Monday, adding that Google has no plans at present to complete its iOS Google Maps app and submit it to Apple."], "tags": ["Apple", "Tim Cook", "Mapping technologies", "Computing", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Business", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "Digital media", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-28T14:12:40Z", "title": "Apple Maps: Tim Cook says he is 'extremely sorry'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-apology", "article": "Apple&apos;s chief executive, Tim Cook, has said he is &quot;extremely sorry for the frustration&quot; users have found with its new mapping service, adding that if they are dissatisfied they can use rival products. The dramatic move by Cook follows growing complaints about the quality of the data offered by the new Maps app which was introduced with iOS 6, the newest version of the mobile software powering the iPhone and iPad. Apple abandoned Google&apos;s offering because the two sides could not agree on licensing terms for Google&apos;s voice-directed turn-by-turn navigation \u2013 which Google had been offering on phones using its Android software since December 2010, and Apple saw as a key feature in the smartphone wars. Read: Apple&apos;s biggest mistakes, from maps to Newton Instead Apple has been working for more than two years on introducing its own service, using data from other providers. But the introduction last week \u2013 which did bring voice-directed turn-by-turn navigation \u2013 also caused an outcry over misplaced towns, misnamed suburbs, parks designated as airfields and the loss of public transport directions compared with the Google data offered on the previous version of iOS. &quot;We are doing everything we can to make Maps better,&quot; Cook wrote in a letter posted on Apple&apos;s site \u2013 a method frequently used by Cook&apos;s predecessor Steve Jobs to issue messages when Apple was facing criticism. Apple has apologised in the past for errors \u2013 though sometimes grudgingly. When Apple lowered the price of the original iPhone by $200 in September 2007, just weeks after it had gone on sale and thousands had been bought, Jobs offered aggrieved users a $100 voucher \u2013 but told them that &quot;this is the price of living in the technology lane&quot;. When Apple launched its MobileMe service, offering cloud-based synchronisation of emails and calendars, it was initially disastrous \u2013 leading Jobs to apologise publicly. When the iPhone 4 design turned out to have attenuation problems with its external antenna, Jobs was eventually moved to offer refunds and a free cover for the phone. Cook says in the letter that &quot;we wanted to provide our customers with even better Maps including features such as turn-by-turn directions, voice integration, [satellite view] Flyover and vector-based maps [which store data in a single file rather than needing repeated downloads to work]. In order to do this, we had to create a new version of Maps from the ground up.&quot; Although iOS 6 was only released formally on 19 September, Cook says there are now more than 100m devices using it with the new Apple Maps, &quot;with more and more joining us every day.&quot; He said that users &quot;have already searched for nearly half a billion locations&quot; and that such feedback will improve the quality. Unusually, Cook recommends that users who are dissatisfied with Apple&apos;s offering should try rival services. These include apps by MapQuest, Waze and Microsoft&apos;s Bing, or maps from Google and Nokia via web browsers. However, Google&apos;s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, indicated earlier this week that the search giant is not presently developing an app for iOS. &apos;&apos;What were we going to do, force (Apple) to include the software?&quot; Schmidt said in Tokyo on Monday, adding that Google has no plans at present to complete its iOS Google Maps app and submit it to Apple. That decision lies with Apple, Schmidt said. &apos;&apos;We think it would have been better if they had kept ours.

It flew in the face of convention and expectation. This seems to be Hughes&apos;s chosen flight-path, so if (like me) you were half-hoping for more of the same, forget it. Its follow-up is a dark, explicitly violent, manga comic in prose. The narrator is Yukio, a parentless but privileged 14-year-old who lives with his distant, aristocratic grandmother. His best friends are Hiroshi and his sister Miko, with whom Yukio is tentatively in love. These innocent siblings are ensnared by sinister teenagers related to the feared Tanaka, a powerful Tokyo yakuza clan. Shamed by what they are forced to do, they kill themselves. Yukio, a kendo expert, vows to avenge them. And he does \u2013 bloodily, using his venerated grandfather&apos;s sword. It doesn&apos;t end there, though. Yukio, kill-happy, declares war on the whole yakuza clan. He cites the samurai saying &quot;Fall into the pit of hell and find the true self within&quot;, but he doesn&apos;t find, he loses. He devolves rapidly from avenging angel into psychopathic assassin. The wicked and the innocent \u2013 even the saintly \u2013 alike fall victim to his slashings. For a while, it seems that he might be redeemed by his young female cousin Mikazuki (aka the Lump), an aphasic sleepwalker with a luminous soul. But no. The last two-thirds of the book are as messily gory as an explosion in a black-pudding factory. Hughes takes a number of enormous risks with this novel, and I admire him for it. One has to do with voice. While the action is savagely compelling, Yukio speaks with a weirdly numb banality. &quot;It was a nice morning,&quot; he tells us before his first murder. Seriously hurt himself, he says &quot;Oh, the pain!&quot; After a particularly shocking killing &quot;I felt miserable.&quot; There&apos;s a narrative reason for this Tamazepam diction, although you have to reach the last chapter before discovering it. It also mimics the distancing stylistics of manga comics as well as suggesting the short-circuitry of the psychopath. It&apos;s rather brilliant. It&apos;s also alienating. Hughes is betting the farm (with a covering bet on bloodlust, maybe) on the reader&apos;s willingness to cope with this emotionally stunted narration. I struggled with it at first. Taboo in teenage fiction is almost a thing of the past, with various forms of sexuality all over it and the word &quot;fuck&quot; settled into its lexicon. Death is fine, as is cancer \u2013 even religion is OK, if you&apos;re careful. But the adult arbiters of teen fiction \u2013 librarians, critics, Carnegie judges \u2013 still insist on optimistic closures, emotional healing, redemption and hope. And if you visit blogs and websites \u2013 American ones especially \u2013 you soon discover that the ultimate sin is &quot;negativity&quot;. The pressure to be morally didactic is not always external; most writers of teen fiction \u2013 including those whose material is grotesquerie and horror \u2013 have a pastoral instinct. Gregory Hughes has had the courage, or recklessness, to raise two fingers to all that. Although Summertime of the Dead leaves Yukio incarcerated in torpid resignation and regret, the only way you can find solace in this novel is to read it Japanese-style from back to front. Hughes is going to get some stick: I hope his kendo skills are up to it. \u2022 Mal Peet&apos;s Life: An Exploded Diagram is published by Walker."}, {"sentences": ["1 Edinburgh 2 Bath 3 York 4 Liverpool 5 Cambridge Best overseas city     Tokyo was voted your favourite overseas city.", "Photograph: Jose Fuste Raga/Corbis    Tokyo retains its title for the third year running, despite the fact that it faced one of the biggest challenges in its history, persuading tourists to return in the wake of last year&apos;s devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit the north-east of the country.", "1 Tokyo 2 San Francisco 3 Seville 4 Berlin 5 Cape Town Best European country Iceland wins the crown this year, no doubt attracting visitors intrigued by all the footage of a landscape evolving and forming before our very eyes following the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in 2010, whose ash cloud forced the closure of European airspace."], "tags": ["Travel"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-29T02:00:00Z", "title": "Travel Awards 2012 winners", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/sep/29/travel-awards-2012-winners", "article": "Best UK city For some, 13 is an unlucky number.

Best ethical travel award \u2013 chosen by Guardian Travel editors     Best ethical travel award goes to Wild Frontiers, who run trips to some of the most exciting and difficult-to-reach places in the world, such as Afghanistan. Photograph: Ric Ergenbright/Corbis    Winner: Wild Frontiers Having worked with Wild Frontiers on many stories over the years we were amazed to realise they hadn&apos;t yet won one of our editorial awards. Where were our manners? Here is a tour operator offering some of the most fascinating, unusual and carefully executed adventures on the planet, and one which cares deeply about the impact its tours have on the regions and people they encounter. Founded by Jonny Bealby in 2002, the operator quickly amassed a team of like-minded travel obsessives and employed truly special local guides, with the primary aim of enabling passionate travellers to visit the most spectacular but difficult-to-reach corners of the world, in comfort and safety. To learn what astounding times can be had on these holidays, you only have to read the features we have run over the last year or so, about horseriding in Georgia, desert-camping in Oman, or, from the new family-friendly Wild Child collection, a Maasai-run safari in Kenya that writer Kevin Rushby and his young daughter adored. That many of Wild Frontiers&apos; most exciting destinations \u2013 Syria, Yemen, Libya, \u2013 have recently been inaccessible is a tragedy, but we know the company and its devoted clients will be one of the first to jump back in to help those whose tourism businesses have been damaged or lost. Indeed it was the first back to Pakistan after 9/11, the first back into Kashmir, and the first to run commercial trips into Afghanistan, where it offers a tour of the Band-i-Amir lakes by pedalo among other things \u2013 just one example of the unique yet authentic and, of course, joyful experiences this company can provide. As he has launched new trips, Jonny has frequently linked up with local NGOs, such as the Hope Foundation in Calcutta, the Mines Advisory Group in Cambodia and Children of the Caucasus in Georgia. To help facilitate the company&apos;s ethos of responsible and sustainable travel, which it has been committed to from the off, it established the charitable Wild Frontiers Foundation in 2009, to channel funds to these projects and its own. Clients can visit these projects if they want to, and Wild Frontiers automatically carbon offsets every client&apos;s international flight, when booked through them. Best UK hotel This category has been dominated by UK-based boutique chains Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro and Malmaison for the past decade as well as the Hoxton, which has won for the past two years but now slips out of the top 20.

The Russian writer was talking about the futility of pondering the meaning of life, and Appleyard uses the quote to say that breaking something down doesn&apos;t always help define it. Consciousness can&apos;t be reduced entirely to brain goo, however closely we study MRI scans; and computer-modelling the atoms of a carrot won&apos;t help when it comes to gardening. This, roughly speaking, is complexity.

It&apos;s an enticing room. It feels like somewhere you&apos;d like an hour or two alone to rummage round. It&apos;s pleasing that Jones&apos;s office is as full of ideas and beautiful objects as the collections he creates as style director of Louis Vuitton menswear. Not too long ago, after all, luxury menswear displayed little thought or beauty, consisting, as it mainly did, of suits, suits, suits and the odd blazer. But it&apos;s an area of fashion undergoing major reinvention, and Jones&apos;s instalment at LV is an important part of that. Recent figures show that menswear makes up 40% of the global fashion market; men now spend \u00a3155bn a year on high-end clothes and accessories. You can&apos;t spend that much on tweed and brogues alone, and this increase has coincided with a flurry of creativity in luxury menswear. Ever since Marc Jacobs was installed as artistic director in 1997, Louis Vuitton&apos;s reinvention from makers of fusty handbags to the world&apos;s most valuable luxury brand has been phenomenal. It is currently valued at $25.9bn. Kim Jones has basically been put in charge of one of the strongest growth areas for one of the biggest fashion brands in the world. A position by which the 35-year-old British designer, sitting in his office dressed in grey sweatshirt, chinos and trainers, seems cheerfully unfazed. &quot;I started buying the brand in 2002,&quot; says Jones. &quot;If I&apos;d worked and saved up a bit of money, I&apos;d buy something by Louis Vuitton. No one else really had it, even though it&apos;s a big brand, because everything&apos;s made in limited qualities. So if you want something different, it&apos;s actually a good place to go.&quot; Ten years ago no one would have imagined Jones would end up as creative director of the brand he saved his pennies for. Not because he wasn&apos;t talented, it&apos;s just that his reputation was established, straight off his Central Saint Martins MA in menswear, in casual clothing. Jones&apos;s name was made by his skill for subverting tailoring. He took traditional cuts and reinvented them as streetwear for the fashion-conscious. &quot;I was thinking about college the other day,&quot; he says. &quot;Someone asked me how I got into fashion, and I suddenly remembered that John Galliano bought half my graduate collection. It was a big deal, I guess, but I didn&apos;t realise at the time. I was just upset because I wanted one of the jackets he bought for myself; it was hard to make and I didn&apos;t get to keep it.&quot; Jones launched his own menswear label in 2002 \u2013 which found a loyal following, particularly in Japan \u2013 but unlike other young designers keen to make their name, he concentrated on collaborating with established brands instead. The list seems almost random \u2013 everyone from Topshop to Alexander McQueen, Umbro to Mulberry. He worked on Pastelle, a label for Kanye West (who&apos;s a friend of his). He dabbled in art direction for magazines such as Dazed &amp; Confused and Arena Homme +. &quot;I like working with people,&quot; is his simple explanation, &quot;getting a team together of different people working in different capacities. Designing clothes is just the job I do. I&apos;m not in this to be famous or for my name to be recognised \u2013 I don&apos;t want that. I&apos;ve lived with people who are famous and it&apos;s not nice to go out the front door and have your photo taken. I like to be able to toddle down to the corner shop.&quot; So he worked on projects that interested him. He made imaginative clothes for British football casuals and Japanese fashion addicts and anyone who shopped on the high street. He went out, had a lot of fun. He had been part of the straight-edge hardcore-punk scene when he studied graphic design in Brighton; when he moved to London it was the club scene in Hoxton, a passion he paid homage to in his 2004 collection called Subtle Rave. Then in 2008 he surprised the fashion world when he joined Dunhill, one of the stuffier heritage brands, but the combination worked: he won the British Fashion Council&apos;s menswear designer of 2009. By the time his appointment at Louis Vuitton was announced in 2011, the mix of Jones&apos;s imagination and the luxury market seemed an excellent idea. He won the menswear designer award again in 2011 and he&apos;s been nominated this year, too. When Jones was interviewed in 2008 about the Dunhill job, he used a nice turn of phrase for the state of many luxury brands at the time. He said they were &quot;important in duty-free&quot;. It&apos;s a good way to describe those expensive labels that are kind of nice, but you only really buy them when they&apos;re discounted and you&apos;re bored, waiting to be somewhere else. Travel preoccupies Kim Jones, and at Louis Vuitton it&apos;s his theme. Not kicking-your-heels-in-the-departure-lounge tedium, but transcontinental, international culture. &quot;Louis Vuitton is about deep-seated, proper luxury. In every old romantic movie they have Vuitton luggage. Look at Liz Taylor&apos;s collection, the Duke of Windsor&apos;s. I think it still maintains that ethos.&quot; His first three collections have been inspired by different countries and their art and lifestyle. It&apos;s a concept that works for a brand that needs to feel cosmopolitan. &quot;When I first talked to LVMH, my presentation was all about travel and explorers. After all, it&apos;s a travel brand that started with a trunk.&quot; His debut for spring/summer 2012 was about Africa, where he spent his childhood, and the influence of 1970s fashion and wildlife photographer Peter Beard meant that club ties and suits appeared alongside scarves inspired by Masai blankets on the catwalk. Autumn/winter 2012 looked at Paris and Tokyo, examining the 19th-century European craze for Japonisme \u2013 something which influenced the LV logo \u2013 and the work of fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez, who lived in Tokyo in the 1980s. Elegant double-breasted suits featured traditional kimono silks. Lopez&apos;s feather-and-arrow motif appeared on bags and as pins. Next summer&apos;s collection (which showed in June) is all about water and boating, specifically yachting as enjoyed by Yves Carcelle \u2013 the CEO of Louis Vuitton who is cited as an influence in the show notes. Jones reworked the clich\u00e9 of the nautical theme with rubber-duck yellow anoraks, outsized rucksacks that looked like lifebuoys and dapper yachting blazers. All three collections show wit and skill and a voracious interest and insight not just in fabric and fit, but also in the art and cultures that informed Jones&apos;s work. &quot;I wanted to inject fun into the brand,&quot; he says. &quot;It has an optimism. Like with the last collection, it&apos;s the idea of a really rich guy on his yacht \u2013 having it.&quot; The idea of travel and moving between worlds comes easily to Jones. It&apos;s what he&apos;s done his whole life. His English father met his Danish mother in the Canary Islands, and though he was born in London in 1979, the family moved to Ecuador when he was three months old. He spent his childhood in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana and the Caribbean, moving on as his father&apos;s job as a hydro-geologist demanded. (His uncle is Colin Jones, incidentally, a photographer for the Observer in the 1960s who also worked for National Geographic and Life magazine.) &quot;It&apos;s amazing when you&apos;re a kid to have a great time out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by animals, to see how big and beautiful the world is and be excited by that.&quot; His first memory of clothing is of his favourite T-shirt when he was five in Botswana. It had to be washed each night so he could wear it every day. It was emblazoned with a\u00a0lion and the word &quot;lion&quot; was spelt out between the beast&apos;s legs, which he thought was very clever. The Africa years gave him a life-long love of animals; his hero is David Attenborough. Even though he&apos;s &quot;the coolest man on the planet&quot;, the naturalist will, sadly, never inspire a collection because he only wears blue shirts and chinos. To replicate that on the catwalk would be too conceptual. His big sister Nadia lived in England (their parents split when he was five) and he stayed with her as a teenager. Nadia was creative director for high-street brand Oasis for 14 years, then worked with Lily Allen on her Lucy in Disguise clothing line. She encouraged him to go into fashion, giving him her collection of The Face and i-D magazines when he was 14. &quot;I loved looking at the people in them, how cool they were. Now I know most of them.&quot; Emma Hill, head of Mulberry, is his sister&apos;s friend and she used to babysit Kim when he was a kid. &quot;It&apos;s funny, this little world of fashion.&quot; When we met in July he was heading off on holiday the next day. &quot;One of the nice things about working at Louis Vuitton is that you get five weeks off in the summer, just like school.&quot; He&apos;s heading to Nepal, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar then Suffolk. Will he miss Paris? He thinks for a bit. &quot;I have a lovely place and the team at work is brilliant. And now I know where I can buy Heat every week, and I&apos;ve found Marks &amp;\u00a0Spencer for food \u2013 that&apos;s made a difference.&quot; He may like his British comforts, but it sounds as if Jones will be in Paris for some time. &quot;I can&apos;t say often enough how great this job is,&quot; he reminds me. &quot;It&apos;s my dream job, and I&apos;ve got it just 10 years after I left college.&quot; When you get what you want so quickly, don&apos;t you have to wonder what&apos;s going to come next? Jones doesn&apos;t think so. He&apos;s got enough to keep him busy here. &quot;When travel is your resource, you can do anything. How many countries are there? About 200? Well, that&apos;s 200 collections, right there. I\u00a0can go anywhere in the world from here.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["He talked with enthusiasm about playing for an event for General Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo."], "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2012-09-30T16:55:52Z", "title": "Alan Carter obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/sep/30/alan-carter-obituary", "article": "My father-in-law, Alan Carter, who has died aged 87, spent most of his life in Saddleworth. To the end a &quot;denier&quot; of border reorganisation, he always saw Saddleworth as part of Yorkshire rather than Greater Manchester. He was born and schooled in north Manchester. The family returned to the Carters&apos; homelands in Saddleworth in his teens. His ancestors had moved there at the end of the 18th century from nearby Marsden. He served in the RAF XI squadron as a Spitfire pilot in Japan (1946-1947) and worked in a foundry and as a clerk on the railways, and then became an education welfare officer for West Riding under Sir Alec Clegg. Reorganisation saw him transfer to Oldham to maintain continuity of involvement with Saddleworth schools. Shortly afterwards, a career change led to him joining a friend who ran a plumbing business. Alan always showed an aptitude for learning new skills \u2013 including plumbing, carpentry, building and flying model planes \u2013 which he developed to a high level. In later life he became a piano tuner. All through his life, music had been important. Learning trombone with Dobcross Band Club, he joined a band in the RAF and played extensively in Japan. He talked with enthusiasm about playing for an event for General Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo. Back in the UK, he played banjo, guitar and double bass in folk dance bands, and double bass in Oldham Symphony Orchestra. Electronic keyboards fascinated him and one of his last performances was to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren at home to great applause. He was married from 1945 to 1969 to Audrey Buckley, with whom he had two children, my wife, Janet, and her brother, Geoffrey. After Audrey&apos;s death from a brain haemorrhage, he married Pat Higginson in 1973, having met through their joint work with children. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, and fostered children for several years. Family was at the core of Alan&apos;s world. A gentle man in every way, he had many talents and bore his problems in later life with great patience. Alzheimer&apos;s disease for four years, and latterly cancer, could not undermine his welcoming, friendly approach to life. He never forgot the Japanese he learned in the RAF and liked to surprise unsuspecting Japanese tourists with a greeting in their own language. He is survived by Pat, his children, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren."}, {"sentences": ["We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York."], "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Careers", "Advertising"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T11:18:00Z", "title": "Careers talk: Daniele Fiandaca, head of innovation, Cheil", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/01/innovation-advertising-daniele-fiandaca-cheil", "article": "Hi Daniele, can you tell us a little bit more about Cheil and your role there as head of innovation?  Until recently Cheil UK has been one of London&apos;s best-kept secrets. It&apos;s a 100-strong integrated advertising agency \u2013 my job there as head of innovation is to make sure we stop being a secret and grow beyond our original Samsung heritage with new clients. That means working hard to build a culture that fosters innovation and ideas. It also means staying on top of current trends, understanding any impact they could have on our clients and their communications issues, and consequently delivering better ways to solve problems for them. Before Cheil I ran a global digital marketing agency called Profero with two friends. We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York. I left to run my own consultancy for 18 months, and then joined Cheil. What does your average day look like? Fortunately, there&apos;s no such thing as an average day (one of the reasons I left Profero after 10 years is because all of a sudden I found I was constantly doing the same things). Now my days will comprise of anything and everything including work on client briefs, team brainstorms, new business meetings, internal team talks and external recruitment interviews. And I always make an effort every week to meet someone interesting, preferably at lunch or for a quick drink after work! What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them? My biggest challenge is figuring out where to focus my energy; my role inevitably means there&apos;s so much I could cover, but not enough time to cover it. Lists are my saving grace \u2013 I&apos;ve become much better at using them to prioritise, and working closely with my boss and peers to bounce ideas around also helps to maintain perspective. What first made you want to work in advertising? Not many people know this, but my first work in advertising was actually starring in a TV commercial (it was for a series of karaoke tapes from Italian publisher Fabbri Editori and I&apos;m thankful there was no YouTube in those days). That was my first taste of the energy that&apos;s inherent in this business, but my big break came when I was looking to leave PwC (I started my career as an accountant) and one of my best friends asked me to join his little digital advertising agency. I was extremely lucky to get that opportunity \u2013 that agency was Profero \u2013 and I&apos;ve never looked back since. What&apos;s do you think is the key to being a good at what you do as head of innovation? Innovation for me is about finding better ways to solve problems as well as opening up opportunities that weren&apos;t there previously. It&apos;s left brain and right brain working in sync to create compelling and practical solutions. My business background coupled with my agency experience allows me to really marry an idea with solving a business problem in that way. One of the big attractions of Cheil is that it&apos;s unavoidably integrated, which means ideas aren&apos;t limited by a media discipline or channel. The other key ingredient is an interest in people, something which I&apos;ve always had \u2013 it&apos;s this inherent curiosity about what motivates people to make decisions that also helps in my role. Finally, you need to be a self-starter because a lot of the time, it really is up to you to create opportunities. What would you say your management style is? When I was 18 years old my parents let me manage their restaurant for 6 months, with very little interference. That experience taught me a lot, with the most notable lesson being: give people the room and space to make their own decisions and mistakes while still giving them direction and support when they need it. I hope that&apos;s how I manage. My expectations are high, certainly, and I can be quite tough, but I always try to be fair too. This approach clearly isn&apos;t for everyone but I hope I foster good team communication, and people enjoy working with me. What online resource can you not do your job without? That&apos;s impossible to answer because I&apos;m constantly online and hungry for ideas and inspiration. But if push really came to shove, I&apos;d hate to lose the people I follow on Twitter. What in advertising is really exciting you the most at the moment? No question, it&apos;s the fact that social media has changed the communications landscape forever, and we still don&apos;t really know what the long term impact will be. The one sure thing is that ad land is going to have to change accordingly, despite the fact that insight into people and their behaviour, coupled with ideas and creativity, will always be at its heart. Where do you see advertising and digital marketing in the next 5 years? Wow! I&apos;m not sure I really know where it&apos;ll be in the next 6 months, but I am convinced that any distinctions between advertising and digital marketing will be gone forever \u2013 everything will be digital (in my mind, it already is). We&apos;re also going to have similar issues with the distinction between digital, mobile and social very soon. What three tips would you give to a advertising professional or graduate looking to get to where you are? Be curious, work hard (but have fun), and get out there and meet people Any last words?  I&apos;m with Confucius: &quot;Love what you do and you&apos;ll never work a day in your life.&quot; Daniele Fiandaca is head of innovation at Cheil \u2013 follow Daniele on Twitter @yellif To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, sign up for free membership to the Guardian Media Network.

The long-running dispute over the Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 intensified earlier this month after Japan nationalised the territories, resulting in violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in dozens of Chinese cities. Murakami, who enjoys a huge following in China, could have been expected to criticise the authorities there amid reports that they had banned the sale of Japan-related books, including his own novels. Instead, he called on Japan and China to wean themselves off the &quot;cheap alcohol&quot; of nationalism, as both sides refused to make concessions. &quot;When a territorial issue ceases to be a practical matter and enters the realm of &apos;national emotions&apos;, it creates a dangerous situation with no exit,&quot; Murakami wrote in a front-page opinion piece for the Asahi Shimbun. &quot;It&apos;s like cheap alcohol. It gets you drunk after only a few shots and makes you hysterical. It makes you speak loudly and act rudely\u00a0\u2026 but after your drunken rampage you are left with nothing but an awful headache the next morning. &quot;We must be careful about politicians and polemicists who lavish us with this cheap alcohol and allow things to get out of control.&quot; Murakami, Japan&apos;s best-known living author whose books have been translated into 40 languages, made the comments after Japan and China continued to trade verbal blows at the United Nations general assembly in New York. China&apos;s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said China considered the islands &quot;sacred territory&quot; and accused Japan of theft after it bought them from their private owners \u2013 who are Japanese \u2013 in a bid to derail a similar, and potentially more provocative, move by the rightwing governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara. The dispute risks souring diplomatic and trade ties between the world&apos;s second- and third-largest economies. Threats of a widespread boycott of Japanese imports have so far failed to materialise, although Japanese firms are reporting delays in processing paperwork for goods at Chinese ports. Chinese employees of Japanese companies have staged walkouts, demanding higher wages; carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan, have said they will cut production in China in anticipation of a fall in demand. &quot;It&apos;s almost inevitable that many Japanese business leaders [with investments in China] will say that enough is enough,&quot; said Tomohiko Taniguchi, a former foreign ministry spokesman who now teaches at Keio University. &quot;Wages in China are going up and other countries in the region, such as Burma, are looking more attractive. This dispute can only accelerate the business community&apos;s shift in another direction.&quot; Tens of thousands of flight bookings from China to Japan have been cancelled through to the end of this month. It marks a dramatic reversal in fortunes for Japanese tourist authorities, who had issued a record number of visas to Chinese tourists between May and the latest eruption of the Senkaku dispute. China has so far been the target of small demonstrations by Japanese ultra-nationalists, a few hundred of whom marched through Tokyo recently carrying banners calling for Chinese boats to be sunk and urging Japan&apos;s government not to give in to the &quot;terrorists&quot; in Beijing. No ban exists on travel to Japan, but the Chinese media have devoted coverage to the demonstrations and isolated incidents, such as a smoke-bomb attack on a Chinese consulate in south-west Japan. They have also made much of a recent poll in which only 3% of Japanese said they liked China, while 38% said they disliked the country. Opinion is divided on how much lasting damage a trade spat would inflict on the countries, whose bilateral trade ties were worth a record $345bn (\u00a3213bn) last year. But the dispute has ruined what was supposed to be a weekend of celebrations this week to mark 40 years of diplomatic ties. China abruptly cancelled a major event in Beijing to mark the anniversary, while Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, did not exchange congratulatory messages. About 40% of anniversary ceremonies due to be held in Japan were cancelled, according to Kyodo, with more than half called off at China&apos;s request. The cancellations were a sign of the dispute&apos;s impact on people-to-people ties, said Duan Yuezhong, the chief editor of a magazine for Chinese people living in Japan. &quot;We are working hard to promote private-level exchange, but our efforts have been spoiled. We feel helpless,&quot; he told Kyodo. Murakami said he was disappointed by reports that bookshops in China had been ordered to remove works by Japanese authors, as well as those about Japan by Chinese writers. The Beijing municipal bureau of press and publication has denied issuing the order, but there are widespread reports of shops clearing their shelves of books, including Murakami&apos;s bestselling trilogy 1Q84. The row has also affected the Chinese music and art world. The pianist, Yundi Li, reportedly came under pressure from the authorities in Beijing to cancel a solo recital tour of Japan due to start last month and the Hong Kong-Chinese film, Floating City, has been withdrawn from the forthcoming Tokyo international film festival at the request of the producers. Murakami urged Japan not to retaliate by, for example, banning Chinese books. &quot;Here is what I&apos;d say loud and clear,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Please don&apos;t retaliate against China for taking such steps. If we do, it becomes our problem, and it will come back and hit you.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Their delayed arrival in Okinawa, which hosts more than half of the 47,000 US troops in Japan, came after Tokyo said it was satisfied by Washington&apos;s assurances over the aircraft&apos;s safety record."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "US news", "Air transport", "US military"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T14:19:04Z", "title": "US helicopter fleet arrives in Okinawa despite safety fears", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/us-helicopter-fleet-arrives-okinawa-japan", "article": "A small fleet of US military aircraft have arrived in the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, amid protests by local residents who claim they are unsafe. Six MV-22 Osprey flew from Iwakuni base on Japan&apos;s mainland, where they have been waiting for deployment since arriving from the US in July to the Futenma marine corps base. Their delayed arrival in Okinawa, which hosts more than half of the 47,000 US troops in Japan, came after Tokyo said it was satisfied by Washington&apos;s assurances over the aircraft&apos;s safety record. The transport aircraft&apos;s tilt rotors allow it to take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like a plane. The US says the fleet at Futenma is needed to replace ageing CH-46 aircraft and improve its ability to respond to security crises in the Asia-Pacific region. Local campaigners insist the Ospreys pose a risk at Futenma, a sprawling marine corps base located in the densely populated city of Ginowan. Anti-base groups said crashes involving the aircraft in Morocco and Florida this year proved they were unsafe to fly in built-up areas. Local TV showed hundreds of protesters near Futenma&apos;s perimeter fence chanting and displaying banners opposing the deployment. On Sunday night, police forcibly removed residents and activists who had staged a sit-in in front of the base&apos;s main gate. The governor of Okinawa prefecture, Hirokazu Nakaima, said he could not understand why the Ospreys had arrived before local safety concerns had been addressed. &quot;It&apos;s extremely disappointing and regrettable,&quot; he said. Okinawa residents, many of whom want the Futenma base moved off the island altogether, believe it is only a matter of time before one of the aircraft crashes in a populated area. A university near the base was the scene of a crash involving a CH-53 helicopter in 2004; in 1959 a US fighter jet plowed into an elementary school in central Okinawa, killing 17 people, including 11 children. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said the aircraft was safe, and asked for Okinawa residents to recognise its role in safeguarding national security. But he added: &quot;We will work hard to share across the country the burden borne by Okinawa by taking steps towards transferring Osprey training to [Japan&apos;s] main island,&quot; he told reporters. The marines plan to deploy 24 Ospreys at Futenma by 2014."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo shows that it is possible for 30 million people to live in close proximity and relative harmony."], "tags": ["Population", "Ageing", "Biology", "Science", "Children", "Childbirth", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Older people", "Society", "Europe", "UK news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T21:00:02Z", "title": "Population: the future is caring | Danny Dorling", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/population-future-caring-ageing-good-news", "article": "A new report that came out on Monday from the UN focused, like most new reports, on something we already knew. The great news is that by 2050 there are expected to be more people aged over 60 than under 15. Something very big is going on, wrote Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general. He warned that the &quot;\u2026 social and economic implications of this phenomenon are profound, extending far beyond the individual older person and the immediate family, touching broader society and the global community in unprecedented ways.&quot; Demographic change on the scale we are currently experiencing does have a precedent. It was just a very long time ago: the Neolithic revolution. The population expansion and subsequent sustainability as humans first settled the land and established permanent villages is the nearest precedent we have for what we are currently living through. Today the shift is from village to city, rather than from nomadic existence to village. Again there has been a population explosion as part of the transition, and again we are facing the slow down following a period of rapid growth \u2013 a little like a human algae bloom coming to an end. So what will a stable and older population look like? Our best clues are those societies that have already made the transition: look at Japan over the past couple of decades. Life expectancy will be very high and, barring years of natural disaster, should be expected to continue to slowly rise. Couples will on average have fewer than two children, so the population will slowly decline in size. There will be less overcrowding as this occurs. Transport will be largely publicly provided, and a large majority of the population will live in cities. Tokyo shows that it is possible for 30 million people to live in close proximity and relative harmony. There are other models in Asia to consider as well. In Hong Kong and Macau fertility rates may be even lower than in Japan. Across the megacities of mainland China there are schemes in place to adapt cities to work without private cars and, since 2009, according to a Washington thinktank China has been leading the world in clean energy investments. China is preparing for the demographic transition and a future in which many groups of grandparents only have one grandchild between the four of them. Across almost all of Europe, other than in the UK, population numbers are either in decline, or the slow population growth which exists is decelerating. In Germany and Italy numbers have been falling for some time. Ageing is accelerating as a result. When this is badly managed, it results in the young deserting rural areas too quickly, for the lure of bright lights and more young people. Where ageing is managed well, people continue to mix. As Aneurin Bevan explained long before my grandfather [aged 96] became old: &quot;I hope the old people will not be asked to live in colonies of their own \u2013 they do not want to look out of their windows on an endless procession of funerals of their friends; they also want to look out at perambulators.&quot;The elderly require far less care than the young. Most people even in their 90s are still looking after themselves most of the time. It is the young, and especially the very young, who require intensive care and attention, particularly if they are to grow up well adjusted. At times, as Oliver James so clearly explains in &quot;love bombing&quot;, all of us as children need the kind of one-to-one attention over a long period of time that increasingly modern life appears designed to prevent. In this regard although we may sometimes talk with fear of entering a second childhood, the elderly are not at all like the young. And a growing number of elderly people provides more potential carers for the dwindling numbers of children in the world, the children who their children give birth to. This is part of the reason why 12,000 fewer children under the age of five died daily in 2010 than in 1990 \u2013 despite there being more children at risk, despite a billion still going hungry. Children in poor countries with surviving grandmothers nearby are far more likely to survive childhood themselves. As yet the benefits of grandfathers have to be proven, but hopefully they soon will. Finally, what of countries like Britain and the United States that continue to try to put off ageing through relatively high rates of fertility and in-migration of young people? It is most likely that people continue to be drawn into these two places because so many have English as a second language, and there is a surfeit of low paid jobs and other opportunities at the bottom of the economic scale. Delayed childbirth due to middle class women having to compete more for work for longer in these two more unequal affluent economies may have also played a part, but even here there is evidence that current demographics may help. UK public sector debt is forecast to soon exceed 80% of GDP. In July Britain&apos;s Office for Budget Responsibility produced estimates that this could fall to 40% by 2050 if migrants continued to arrive in similar numbers, and so share the debt burden. In contrast a zero net migration policy \u2013 this government&apos;s stated aim \u2013 would result in public sector debt rising to 120% of GDP by 2050. Over half the couples in the world are having fewer than two children each. This is partly because almost everywhere infant mortality is falling, globally faster today than at any time in human history. It is when this happens that people almost everywhere become brave enough to limit their families to an average of two or fewer children and so our average age increases rapidly. For a while in the rich world we need not age as quickly as we otherwise might.

The Scot struggled to find his rhythm in the opening set of his first-round match against Ivo Karlovic at the Japan Open on Tuesday , but eventually found his form to secure a solid, if unspectacular 7-6, 6-4 victory. Murray had had to contend with last-minute complications following the withdrawal of Ga\u00ebl Monfils with an injury to his right knee. The absence of the Frenchman, a former world No7 who has caused Murray problems in the past, presented an opportunity for Karlovic, a lucky loser from qualifying, to avenge his defeat by the Scot in the second round at Wimbledon this summer. Murray must have been grateful that the humidity that blanketed the Japanese capital after its brush with Typhoon Jelawat on Sunday had given way to a comfortable pleasant breeze when he stepped on to centre court at Ariake Coliseum. But in his first appearance since he broke Britain&apos;s 76-year men&apos;s grand slam drought against Novak Djokovic at Flushing Meadows in September, he initially struggled to deal with Karlovic&apos;s serve, and failed to capitalise on break points in the first and seventh games of the set. &quot;Playing against him you know it is going to be uncomfortable,&quot; Murray said after looking a little tired at times defeating the 6ft 10in Croat. &quot;He is a tricky player. &quot;Mentally I feel OK. It&apos;s always hard coming into your first match after a few weeks of not playing, and my opponent made it tougher still. But I came back [into the match] when I needed to. I&apos;m pleased with how I feel physically, even if my body might be a little bit stiff.&quot; The latter stages of the first set had failed to produce anything approaching a rally as both players doggedly held serve. The crowd, perhaps still recuperating after Japan&apos;s new men&apos;s singles hope, Kei Nishikori had beaten his compatriot Go Soeda in three sets in the previous match on centre court, summoned polite applause, but little in the way of encouragement. Murray, though, galvanised by the perceived injustice of a couple of questionable line calls, discovered a serve of a length and pace that began to trouble his opponent. Still, Karlovic came close to trading in his lucky-loser status for one as deserved winner with a string of aces, although Murray responded in kind with three consecutive aces in the eighth game to level at 4-4. Murray&apos;s frustration occasionally bubbled to the surface, and a weak return into the net produced the world No3&apos;s first audible self-admonishment. The tiebreaker looked to be slipping away at 7-6 to Karlovic. Encouraged by the crowd, Murray saved a set point and then completed his comeback with a passing forehand down the line that revived memories of him at his scintillating best in the summer. Tokyo, after all, was the world&apos;s first opportunity to examine Murray&apos;s physical state after a three-week break following his US Open triumph, and gauge any effect the end of his hunt for a grand slam title had had on his mental game. The 25-year-old conceded his recent success had brought with it a different kind of expectation in Tokyo. &quot;Maybe there is a bit more pressure,&quot; Murray said. &quot;During the year there have been certain matches in which I haven&apos;t done myself justice, so I felt after the US Open that it was time to reset some goals. &quot;I don&apos;t want to say I was obsessed with grand slams, but winning one was so important that I was always looking ahead and bolting on to the next grand slam. Now I hope I can concentrate better throughout the year and not take my eye off the ball in any of the tournaments I play in.&quot; With a difficult first opponent dispatched, he will test that new approach again on Wednesday as he continues his defence of the title he won last year against the Slovakian, Lukas Lacko, in the second round. Although Murray did receive treatment on his back and took a short medical break at the end of the first set, he insisted it was nothing more than a twinge. &quot;My back jarred a little bit, but it can happen when you start playing matches again after some time off,&quot; he said. &quot;I took a time-out at the end of the first set but it felt fine by the middle of the second set.&quot; That second set had begun in much the same way as the first, with both players holding serve until the tenth game. Murray, though, had returned to the court not just with a fresh shirt, but also with a renewed purpose. Having withstood 17 aces, he ended Karlovic&apos;s resistance when he found himself with three match points. Karlovic rescued two of them, but sent a forehand long to give the Scot a more comfortable victory than had seemed possible barely half an hour before."}, {"sentences": ["While Chlo\u00e9&apos;s spring/summer 2013 collection was unveiled in Paris during fashion week, an exhibition celebrating the label&apos;s 60th anniversary is currently showing at the French capital&apos;s Palais de Tokyo centre."], "tags": ["Paris fashion week autumn/winter 2012", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-02T10:05:00Z", "title": "Chlo\u00e9 at 60: the story of a fashion legend", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/oct/02/chloe-60-story-fashion-legend", "article": "While Chlo\u00e9&apos;s spring/summer 2013 collection was unveiled in Paris during fashion week, an exhibition celebrating the label&apos;s 60th anniversary is currently showing at the French capital&apos;s Palais de Tokyo centre. The timing of Clare Waight Keller&apos;s latest designs hitting the catwalk, coinciding with a look back at the history of the label she now runs in the Chlo\u00e9.Attitudes exhibition, serves as a reminder of the inspiring heritage of this Parisian fashion house. Stella McCartney, Phoebe Philo and Hannah MacGibbon all designed for Chlo\u00e9, but it is the Egyptian-born Gaby Aghion who began it all. She might not be a household name like her brand, but the 91-year-old is a pioneer when it comes to women designing for other women.     Chlo\u00e9's Rachmaninoff dress (Karl Lagerfeld, 1972) Photograph: Chlo\u00e9    Arriving in Paris in 1945, she became part of a postwar bohemian circle who gathered in Left Bank cafes, counting Picasso and Paul Eluard as friends. When Aghion wanted to set up the brand Chlo\u00e9 \u2013 named after a good friend Chlo\u00e9 Huysmans \u2013 seven years later, it was her friends she wanted to dress, not grandes dames more suited to rarefied designs peddled by 1950s couture salons. By contrast, Aghion championed simplicity \u2013 her first collection was a collection of six cotton poplin dresses. Peddled in a suitcase around the boutiques of Paris, they sold out everywhere they were stocked. A smart businesswoman, too, Aghion insisted on her own Chlo\u00e9 label in the back of the brand&apos;s designs, rather than the boutique&apos;s, as was customary in the 50s. If brand-awareness was one pioneering concept, Aghion has also been credited with inventing a luxe version of ready-to-wear \u2013 something that appealed to a growing demographic of working women who, even if they had the money, didn&apos;t have the time for couture&apos;s endless fittings. Instead, she advocated a concept we now take for granted \u2013 designer clothes sold off the peg, wearable that night. They were all about an easy chic; shirtdresses, blouses and neat cigarette silhouettes became Chlo\u00e9 signatures under Aghion. It was a capsule way of dressing, and you can see her influence over current female designers, and the Chlo\u00e9 alumni, Philo and McCartney. Once remarking that &quot;fashion should be as fresh as a salad&quot;, Aghion was a great supporter of emerging talent \u2013 hiring a young Karl Lagerfeld early in his career, as well as other designers including Martine Sitbon. Lagerfeld, however, is an exception that proves the rule \u2013 across the nine key designers covered in Chlo\u00e9.Attitudes, it&apos;s evident that this is brand that celebrates women designing for women. \u2022 Chloe.Attitudes is on until 18 November 2012"}, {"sentences": ["Blanchard made his comments on a Hungarian website Portfolio.hu ahead of the IMF meeting next week in Tokyo."], "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Business", "World news", "Economics", "Global economy", "Financial crisis", "Recession"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-03T18:17:51Z", "title": "No recovery until 2018, IMF warns", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/03/imf-global-economy-warning", "article": "The International Monetary Fund&apos;s chief economist has warned that the global economy will take a decade to recover from the financial crisis as the latest snapshot of the UK economy suggested that growth in the third quarter will be at best anaemic. Olivier Blanchard said he feared the eurozone crisis, debt problems in Japan and the US, and a slowdown in China meant that the world economy would not be in good shape until at least 2018. &quot;It&apos;s not yet a lost decade,&quot; he said. &quot;But it will surely take at least a decade from the beginning of the crisis for the world economy to get back to decent shape. Blanchard made his comments on a Hungarian website Portfolio.hu ahead of the IMF meeting next week in Tokyo. Germany is expected to defend its handling of Europe&apos;s debt problems at the meeting, but Blanchard said there was more that Europe&apos;s largest economy could do to support Spain and other struggling eurozone nations. In particular, he urged Berlin to accept a rise in inflation and wages that would make it less competitive with its trading partners. He said there was no risk of hyperinflation in Europe. Higher inflation in Germany, though, would be beneficial: a somewhat higher inflation rate in Germany should simply be seen as a necessary and desirable relative price adjustment, he said. Blanchard&apos;s comments came as figures from Markit showed that the UK&apos;s important services sector grew in August but slipped back by September as the Olympics factor waned. According to industry figures from Markit the services activity index dropped from 53.7 to 52.2 and employment fell, adding to gloomy surveys of the construction and manufacturing sectors earlier in the week. Markit, which compiles a monthly index based on figures from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said it was now clear that the bounce back from the slump in the first half of the year was weaker than expected and could result in the UK economy growing by just 0.1% in the third quarter. Hopes that the Queen&apos;s diamond jubilee and the \u00a39bn spent on the Olympics would lift sales over the longer term have largely been dashed as growth slows and the outlook, though robust with a growing order book, remains subdued. The Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee, which began a two-day meeting on Wednesday, is on Thursday expected to keep interest rates at 0.5% and maintain the stock of bonds in its quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. Most economists believe it is possible the lacklustre figures will persuade the MPC to add a further \u00a350bn at its November meeting when the first estimate of the third quarter figures is available."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking in Tokyo, ahead of Sunday&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, a relaxed Hamilton was happy to talk about the move."], "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Formula One 2012", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-03T22:00:01Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton insists he's moved for a new challenge not more money", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/03/lewis-hamilton-mclaren-mercedes-move", "article": "Lewis Hamilton has denied that his decision to switch teams from McLaren to Mercedes was for financial reasons. The British driver, speaking for the first time since signing a three-year deal with Mercedes that starts next season, was open about the challenge he faces with the German team but also said that he felt the split with McLaren was amicable and did not rule out a possible return to the team some time in the future. Speaking in Tokyo, ahead of Sunday&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, a relaxed Hamilton was happy to talk about the move. He will replace the seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher at Mercedes but, while previously tight-lipped during negotiations, he has now revealed that his choice to leave the team was no easy task. &quot;It was hard. Really, really hard. It was very, very stressful and then there became a crunch time where there was pressure from the team. I had a couple of deadlines, I didn&apos;t meet any one of them. There was one deadline and we didn&apos;t do anything with it. We just went on to another deadline. But then the decision was made. It really, really was tough but once I made the decision I was so much more relaxed.&quot; The question of whether McLaren and their team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, were not willing to match Mercedes in salary terms, widely assumed to be a central bone of contention, was rejected by Hamilton, who asserted that money was not an issue in his decision. &quot;It was not about the offer,&quot; he said. &quot;I had two offers on the table which were very, very similar. Martin asked me what more they could have done. I said: &apos;To be honest, Martin, it was about the new challenge and a step that I wanted to make.&apos;&quot; He insisted this step was a considerable personal wrench, moving from a team with whom he has grown up and unsurprisingly has an emotional connection that will not be easily forgotten. &quot;I had to try and separate my emotions from the decision but it was very difficult to do,&quot; he said. &quot;I have got nothing but love for Martin. When you are with a team for so long you generally learn to love them. I think I will always have McLaren at heart even when I am driving for another team down the line. I will still have a bit of my heart that is McLaren.&quot; The driver also reflected on what the move meant in terms of his personal development, above and beyond the expected possibilities for increasing his commercial potential that were widely seen to be limited within McLaren&apos;s corporate structure. &quot;I just know that everyone has to experience those things, working with new people and new environments,&quot; he said. &quot;That is just part of growing. It&apos;s my last step of independence I guess.&quot; In racing terms the most important part of that step is, of course, the question of whether Mercedes can give him a winning car. It seems unthinkable that he would have made the decision without some strong assurances of future improvements from the team principal, Ross Brawn. While acknowledging that both next year&apos;s car and the current iteration (which scored the team&apos;s only win of their three-year existence) were unlikely to challenge McLaren, he was confident that the silver arrows would deliver success. Brawn does have a superlative track record in building a race-winning team, proven during his time with Schumacher both at Benetton and when the pair brought Ferrari back to dominance in F1. &quot;I enjoy the challenge there \u2013 trying to develop the car,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;It was about Mercedes, a team which has not been that successful over the last couple of years but I know from past experience with them that they want to win. I know some of the greats have gone from a great car to not such a great car and have helped to develop a winning team. Michael [Schumacher], for instance, went from being a world champion to Ferrari. We haven&apos;t really got any other driver in Formula One who is known for that. To have that as a challenge \u2026 If that does happen, that would be amazing.&quot; Indeed it would be, and something that fans would no doubt love to see, not just because it is, after all, a German team actually based in Brackley, Northamptonshire, but because for Hamilton to do so would be an extraordinary justification of his decision. He also said that regardless of what happens his move does not mean, for him at least, that driving for McLaren again is out of the question. &quot;We have an incredible relationship and I don&apos;t feel as though I am going out of McLaren through the back door,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going out the front door happily. The way I look at it is that I am walking over that bridge and down a different path. If that path brings me back \u2013 then who knows?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["A spokesman at the Sharp site admitted there was intense speculation locally about what was happening following reports from Tokyo that the company, which had global losses of $4.8bn (\u00a32.9bn) last year, might decide to withdraw from production of photovoltaic modules in the US and Europe."], "tags": ["Green economy", "Environment", "Business", "Energy industry", "Energy", "Solar power", "Renewable energy", "Combined heat and power (CHP)", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-04T14:03:57Z", "title": "UK green energy sector suffers double blow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/ceres-power-shares-solar-panel-sharp-wrexham", "article": "Britain&apos;s nascent &quot;green&quot; business sector has hit trouble with a warning about the future of a pioneering fuel cell developer and of a solar panel factory in Wales.

Playoff baseball is upon us, meaning the regular season is complete - 162 games played by 30 Major League teams - which to some may seem like a lot, but to baseball fans is as perfect a number as you can get. It seems like it began yesterday, but strangely, at the same time, it also feels like a long time ago. Remember when the Miami Marlins were a big deal? When Mike Trout and Bryce Harper weren&apos;t playing big league ball? When Mariano Rivera was closing games? A long time ago. Then again, there is so much action over the course of a six month season that it can just fly by, that is, unless you are in Boston. We&apos;ve had perfect games, no-hitters, underdogs one-upping establishments, PED controversies, text message scandals, courtroom drama, blockbuster deals, a triple crown winner (a rarity regardless what you think of it), a four home run game, milestones, some incredible seasons from pitchers and the usual assortment of out-of-this-world defense mixed in with some wild comebacks.  That was yesterday, now we move to the next stage, the playoffs. For the first time we have ten teams, with the two wild-card teams playing a single game for the right to move on to the Divisional Series. It works, and it means that Friday is going to make for a phenomenal day of baseball. Before we get to the ten teams that made the initial cut, I just want to say one thing. There has been some talk that the best team in baseball is not in these playoffs. Yes, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are an immensely talented group of players, but they had 162 games to prove they belong in the postseason and they failed. How can you call a team like that the best team in baseball? I don&apos;t see them in the below matchups.  American League Wild-Card game - Friday 8:30PM ET Baltimore Orioles @ Texas Rangers ALDS Oakland Athletics vs. Detroit TigersNew York Yankees vs. winner of Wild-Card game National League Wild-Card game - Friday 5:00PM ET St Louis Cardinals @ Atlanta Braves  NLDS Cincinnati Reds vs. San Francisco GiantsWashington Nationals vs. winner of Wild-Card game Check out the full playoff bracket  And the full playoff schedule American League Preview Baltimore Orioles There were analysts chatting on a certain network, wondering on Wednesday how the Orioles would do in the playoffs because they are not a deep team, their starting pitching is poor, and, somewhat bizarrely, this duo kept on bringing up Nate McClouth as a weakness &quot;and they have Nate McLouth! Ha Ha.&quot; (.871 OPS in September, out of nowhere).  What? In case you haven&apos;t noticed, the Baltimore Orioles haven&apos;t had any of this stuff all season long, and now you want to start telling us what they don&apos;t have for the playoffs? Are you on serious? Of course they don&apos;t have any of that, that&apos;s why they are so amazing, because they win without.  This team is incredible, mostly because, as a good friend and longtime Orioles fan told me this week, &quot;This team could come back next year and lose 100 games.&quot; Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration for sure, but he&apos;s absolutely right. So much had to go right for Baltimore to win 93 games that it could very easily fall way down the hill in 2013. Yet this team has come together in 2012 in a way that no one, even the Orioles, could have possibly conceived back in April. The A&apos;s have all this incredible young pitching. What do the Orioles, a team that hasn&apos;t had a sniff of success since 1997, actually have? Answer - an amazing bullpen, particularly Jim Johnson, Adam Jones and a great manager. That and a lot of mojo has been enough for the Orioles to go 16-2 in extra inning games and a staggering 29-9 in one-run games. Virtually every move made by management this season helped Buck Showalter get a team that doesn&apos;t field well, that is eighth in runs scored and ninth in starting pitching ERA, into the playoffs, scaring the living crap out of the Yankees in the process, nearly overcoming a ten-game deficit in the AL East by going 20-10 down the stretch. It&apos;s a tough call for AL Manager of the Year with Bob Melvin out there but it&apos;s got to be Buck Showalter, only because he had less than Melvin.  Facts, as pointed out by the Oriole fan mentioned above: no one in their rotation would make the Yankees rotation, no O&apos;s outfielder would make the Angels outfield. Their best hitter, Nick Markakis has been out with a broken thumb since early September. There is no .300 hitter, no 40 home run hitter, no 13 game winner, never mind a 15 or 20 game winner. Jim Thome is their regular DH. Yet they win, all the time. If you want to doubt these guys now then go ahead, be my guest. I&apos;m done with that.  Texas Rangers Choke: To fail to perform effectively because of nervous agitation or tension, especially in an athletic contest. This seems to describe the Texas Rangers perfectly. When you have a five game lead on September 24 and then find yourself in second place on October 3, you choked, period, full-stop. I tell you what, this team is damn lucky that they didn&apos;t fall out of this thing completely - they could have easily been hanging out with the Los Angeles Angels right now, but instead, they have a chance to resurrect a season that is on the brink of being lost. They lost seven out of their final nine games, including five to the crazy people in Oakland, blowing a 5-1 lead on the final day of the season to the A&apos;s, handing them a division that has been theirs for back-to-back seasons.  All of this is exacerbated by that little el-choke-o they had back in Game Six of the World Series last year. If they can&apos;t beat Baltimore, people are going to start talking, and there will be a real danger that all the good that Texas have done to turn around this franchise will get tied up in supernatural sports conspiracy theories. In that sense, this game on Friday is bigger than any they played in the last two years - the reputation of the franchise is on the line. So, that offense which has been brought back to earth, the pitching (Yu Darvish will start vs. Baltimore) which completely collapsed over the past week better get it together, and fast.  Oakland Athletics What can you say - we gush over the Oakland A&apos;s. They play in a dump, in front of no one, for an owner the locals detest, one who is trying to move them away, they have no money, a tiny payroll, and they win. They win big. It&apos;s awesome.  The City of Oakland has always been a counter-culture kind of place, and that continues with this ballclub, and that&apos;s because for everything they don&apos;t have, they DO have Billy Beane, who has outdone himself - again. Bless his soul for turning the sport on its head, winning baseball&apos;s toughest division, with a bunch of kids, many of which he dealt for during a major re-structuring last winter. For sure, to be young and stupid can help. The A&apos;s squeezed 54 wins out of pitchers that are 25 years old or younger, many of them rookies, hurlers that were too naive to know they have no business unseating a team like the Texas Rangers. Not surprisingly, Bob Melvin&apos;s team never gave up, certainly not when they were 13 games out of first place on June 30, poised to resume their battle with the Mariners for third place, and certainly not in the 14 games they won in walk-off fashion.  Yes, there is a flare for the dramatic in Oakland for sure, winning the division on the final day of the season, a day they usually clear out their lockers. The young pitchers are bold and fearless, as are their hitters, so much so that they struck out 1387 times, the most in baseball. They are dangerous, even more so now that they&apos;re heading straight to an ALDS. Who wants to face the free-swinging A&apos;s, who also happen to hit a lot of home runs, in particular Josh Reddick, Yoenis, Brandon Moss. They have the starters in Jarrod Parker, Travis Blackley, Tommy Milone, A.J. Griffin, and the filthy relief core trio of Ryan Cook, Sean Doolittle and Grant Balfour - the veteran Australian closer. This team has it all, to the surprise of all, and the answer to the obvious question is, why not? New York Yankees Did you really think that they were going to blow it? Were the New York Yankees ever going to finish behind the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East? Of course not. The Bronx Bombers have won yet another Division title. I don&apos;t know how many they&apos;ve won because, well, you know, the Yankees don&apos;t really care about those, so why should I bother to look it up? Once the calendar flips to October, there is only one title that matters, and, as usual, the real season starts now for New York, and, as usual, it is one that can only be validated with a parade down Broadway.  New York is helped by having their ducks in a row heading into the postseason. Had any sort of AL East one-game showdown or wild-card game taken place, they would have been forced to blow their big guns, starting pitchers C.C. Sabathia and Hiroki Kuroda before heading into an ALDS. Instead, that duo with Andy Pettitte makes for a pretty good core, while their bullpen is good, but without Mariano Rivera, won&apos;t be great. Rafael Soriano had a superb season, but we are about to find out first hand just how valuable Rivera was, and don&apos;t think there won&apos;t be just a bit more sweat on Soriano&apos;s upper lip knowing the shoes he has to fill when it matters most.  Offensively, they are boom or bust. They can score in bunches, putting up the second most runs in the AL this season. However, they can also go missing for days, as they did in mid-September when the race for the division tightened up. Alex Rodriguez had a double on Wednesday night, his first since September 6. He&apos;s hit one home run since September 9. Mark Teixeira is back in the lineup after having calf issues, but he has underperformed this season. Ichiro has provided a boost, Derek Jeter has reversed his downward trend, and Cano has been superb. Curtis Granderson has 195 strikeouts, second only to Adam Dunn, but when he does make contact, it usually goes out of the park - he hit 43 homers, tied for second most in baseball. We won&apos;t know which Yankees offense shows up until game time of course, but for this aging crew, time is getting shorter.  Detroit TigersThe Tigers are another team that&apos;s lucky to be in the playoffs after a season that really never got going. Detroit won 89 games in a bad division, the AL Central, playing steady but not spectacular baseball since July. If not for the Chicago White Sox late-season slide they may have found themselves on the outside looking in. Now that they are in, they can&apos;t be ignored, certainly not with Miguel Cabrera, who secured the Triple Crown on Wednesday, Prince Fielder, Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer. The question is, after that crew, is the supporting cast powerful enough to propel them past a team that has worked up one heck of a head of steam in the A&apos;s? It will be difficult, as Oakland have been tested against the Rangers and Angels all year, while their stiffest divisional rival was Robin Ventura&apos;s team that defied expectations for most of the season. Then there&apos;s the other side of the coin: here&apos;s a team that was awarded the division in March played under immense pressure all season long, and now that they&apos;ve made it, maybe they won&apos;t grip the bat as hard, ease up and finally play the way they were expected to all season long. There&apos;s a slice inside many of all of us that roots for anything in Detroit to succeed, and that includes their baseball team, but anything less than an ALCS appearance, after Detroit invested heavily this winter, will be thought of as another sad Motor City failure.  National League Preview Washington Nationals So there&apos;s no Stephen Strasburg, this we know already. That won&apos;t stop manager Davey Johnson from mercilessly attacking his opponents with what he has left, which is quite a lot actually. The team does everything well - they are complete, and deserving winners of the franchise&apos;s first NL East title since the Expos won it back in the strike-shortened season of 1981. Six months ago the Nats were supposed to be taking that next step, instead, they have begun a new-era of winning baseball that could be very long and very fruitful. For evidence of that see Bryce Harper, who at 19 years of age was too young to celebrate with champagne when the team clinched the title.  The Nationals, who felt some heat down the stretch from Atlanta, but still finished with the best record in all of baseball, will play either St. Louis or Atlanta, but whoever it is, they will have a great shot of winning and moving on. The bats have pop, and they have the second most homers in the NL this season, improving overall in the second half with the help of Mike Morse and Danny Espinosa.  The pitching? Well, this is where the big advantage is, even without their ace. Gio Gonzalez and Jordan Zimmerman are as good a one-two punch as any in baseball, but it thins out from there, and at some point, there is a decent chance that Strasburg will be missed. However, if Ross Detwiler and Edwin Jackson can snap out of the funk they are in, who will be able to handle Washington? If there is a looming, potentially dooming factor out there, it&apos;s Tyler Clippard or Drew Storen in a big spot, and they will be in big spots this October, without a doubt.  Atlanta BravesAll arms, no sticks - that&apos;s the Atlanta Braves. They won 93 ballgames despite their inability to score runs with the best of the National League, and they can thank their pitching staff which was the second best in baseball in the second half, only to the Rays. A big part of that was Kris Medlen, who moved into the starting rotation on July 31 and really took this staff to another level after they had lost their best starter Brandon Beachy to season ending surgery. All Medlen has done is allow nine runs in 12 starts, which needless to say is completely insane. So is the bullpen, one that stars the devastating Craig Kimbrel.  This duo could win the game vs. St. Louis on their own. They may have to because the Braves just don&apos;t hit, at all. Not lately. Good old Bernie Miklasz of the St. Louis Post Dispatch laid out the Braves second half batting situation for us: \u2022\u00a0Jason Heyward has 13 homers, 41 RBIs and a .459 slugging pct.\u2022\u00a0Freddie Freeman has 12 homers, 45 RBIs and a .467 slug.\u2022\u00a0Chipper Jones has 8 homers, 29 RBIs and is slugging .432.\u2022\u00a0Martin Prado is batting .281 with a .334 OBP, .418 slug\u2022\u00a0Brian McCann is batting .210 with a .291 OBP and .348 slug.\u2022\u00a0Michael Bourn is batting .226 with a .324 OBP and 81 Ks in 266 at-bats.\u2022\u00a0Dan Uggla, benched for a time, is batting .217 with 67 Ks in 226 at-bats. In other words, Atlanta&apos;s offense sucks, but they may only need to get their pitchers one run, that&apos;s how good they&apos;ve been. Then again, this is the Cardinals we&apos;re talking about... St. Louis Cardinals Do you really think the Cardinals are capable of losing the wild-card game? Don&apos;t be fooled by their measly win total of 88 - they were amongst the unluckiest teams in baseball this season and that&apos;s because, as usual, the St. Louis Cardinals are saving all their luck for the postseason. They sputtered to the finish, nearly letting the sluggish Dodgers, not to mention the Brewers and the Phillies, back into the pennant race. They were just toying with us, again, as usual. Just because Tony La Russa is gone doesn&apos;t mean he hasn&apos;t installed his powers into new manager Mike Matheny. This team is good, real good, (except for the bullpen) and now they have Chris Carpenter back in their rotation. So, who will St. Louis start in the wild-card game? None other than Kyle Lohse, who shocked onlookers by transforming into an ace in 2012. Still, as good old Bernie points out, many Cardinals fans are unhappy that Matheny tapped Lohse for the big game over Adam Wainwright. They may have a point, but Lohse is a Cy Young candidate, even if you don&apos;t really believe it, and if you don&apos;t start a Cy Young candidate in a one-game playoff, well, then you are a fool. Can the Cardinals, whose high octane offense outscored the NL this season, get to Medlen? Well, if Carlos Beltran, Yadier Molina, David Freese, Matt Holliday and Allen Craig can&apos;t, who can? Because they have the bats, and Atlanta can&apos;t hit, and the Cardinals are the Cardinals, expect Atlanta to go home after just one game.  San Francisco GiantsGiants fans can thank Melky Cabrera for stoking a fire under this team. They were really, really ordinary until Cabrera got done for PED&apos;s, and then, just like flicking a switch, it was 2010 again. Oddly empowered by Cabrera&apos;s departure, San Francisco blew smoke in the face of the Dodgers new fancy owners and new fancy players, running away with the NL West, and, just for kicks, drove a stake into the heart of their rivals by beating LA on Tuesday, a loss which provided their fans with another Southern California season without playoff baseball. Now, up in Northern California, which, by the way, is the center of the baseball universe right now, the Giants are ready to try and avenge a sour 2011, and have a crack at winning a second title in three seasons, something many experts think is very possible. That&apos;s especially so with NL batting champion Buster Posey, who was out for most of last year after that traumatic incident at the plate, becoming a wild man in the second half, making the diamond his own, with an 1.110 OPS in the second half. And how about little Gregor Blanco, hitting .291 in September. Who needs Melky? Certainly not manager Bruce Bochy who turned down the opportunity to have him back for the post season should they have gotten to the NLCS. He&apos;s serious when he says that the Giants have moved on, and if you don&apos;t believe him, check the record. San Francisco are 30-14 since Melky left the team, and are without question the hottest club in the playoffs.  This is a different team to the 2010 champs, (which are similar to the 2012 Reds in some ways) one that can score runs easier, and one that has a harder time preventing them (see Tim Lincecum). The pitching is still good, but it doesn&apos;t resemble the dominant staff that guided the team to the title. Still, any team that has Matt Cain, who will start Game One of the NLDS vs. Cincinnati, Madison Bumgarner, and a resurgent Barry Zito who is making a bid for a playoff rotation spot, has enough pitching to win. Then there is the upside - Ryan Vogelsong, who has been poor for over a month, snaps out of his slump, while Tim Lincecum magically reappears. There is a lot of talent there, less in the bullpen, which are still without Brian Wilson of course. They face another pitching rich team in the Reds, one with an incredible bullpen. This is probably the best matchup of the playoffs.  Cincinnati RedsCincinnati is a small city in Ohio close to the border of Kentucky. Of all the teams in the playoffs, the Reds may be the team that inspires the least amount of feeling from a national audience. Luckily for them, success in the playoffs isn&apos;t based on a straw poll of coastal baseball snobs, rather, it&apos;s based in talent, and the Reds have their best team since they upset the A&apos;s in the 1990 World Series. In fact, Cincinnati put up the second best record in baseball, just a single game behind the Nationals.  First things first, Joey Votto. This man has an OPS of over 1.000 despite having hit just 14 home runs all season long. Granted, he missed over 50 games, but the staggering number here is 44 doubles - a lot of two-baggers in just 111 games. The Reds offense goes downhill from there, and it&apos;s really interesting just how much this team has transformed from a run scoring red machine in 2010, one that won the NL Central, to a club that has struggled to put runs on the board and now relies on its pitching. Back in 2010, their staff ERA was seventh in the NL, and the pitching rich Phillies were able to shut them down and score enough off their mediocre arms, sweeping the NLDS. I assure you, that no one will be sweeping the Reds this time around. The starting rotation led by Johnny Cueto has four pitcher&apos;s with ERAs under 4.00 - no easy task in their home run-happy ballpark. The five starters made every start except one, which is absolutely incredible. Even more shocking is the bullpen. Back in the spring when Ryan Madson went down for the season, no one could have imagined that the Reds would have one of the most dominant relief cores in the game, but that&apos;s what they have with Aroldis Chapman, Sean Marshall, and Jonathan Broxton. Despite their lack of offense, the Reds are capable, as their record shows. However, one note of caution. They beat up on sub-.500 teams this season, with seven more wins than the next best team against lowly opponents. That begs the question, how will the Reds fare against a higher caliber opponent now that they&apos;re are in the playoffs?

Having won his first grand slam title at the US Open last month, he knew that getting back into the swing of things on the regular Tour would take a bit of time and so it proved as the Scot suffered his first defeat since \u2013 a 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 loss to Canada&apos;s Milos Raonic in the semi-finals of the Japan Open in Tokyo. Murray had hammered Raonic on his way to victory at the US Open and it will have irritated him to let slip a match in which, having been outplayed early on, he had led 4-1 in the deciding set and held two match points at 6-5 on the Raonic serve. It will be a consolation that Raonic, who is ranked 14th, but who is an outside bet to clinch one of the remaining places for next month&apos;s Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London, played one of his best matches. The Canadian has been nicknamed The Missile for his huge serve and he deserved his win. &quot;He played well behind his first serve,&quot; Murray said. &quot;That made it tough for me. There was always going to be a bit of residue from the last few months.&quot; Murray missed a regulation backhand on the second match point that will have riled him, but it is unlikely to be a defeat that lingers long. The world No3 played well enough throughout the week to know his game is in good shape and, in the remaining weeks of the season, he intends to build on his triumphs in New York and at the Olympics, where he won gold. &quot;I&apos;m happy with the way I&apos;ve fought in my matches,&quot; said Murray, who was in a jovial mood throughout the week and whose game, for the most part, had the confidence of a man whose burden has been lifted. &quot;My focus has been very good. I wanted to make sure I kept the momentum going, I want to keep that up for the rest of the year.&quot; That focus slipped a little against Raonic, who showed why so many people believe he could be the next man to challenge the top four of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Murray and Rafael Nadal. The 21-year-old, who moved to Canada from Montenegro when he was three years old, did not let Murray dictate as he had done in New York; instead, he came forward whenever he could and grasped the initiative. Murray spoke this week about how satisfying his US Open triumph had been \u2013 and not just because the questions about emulating Fred Perry no longer apply \u2013 but because he had found\u00a0a way to win even when he wasn&apos;t playing at his absolute best. His final against Djokovic was played in cold, windy conditions, but Murray showed he could cope with the occasion. In the past, Murray has flip-flopped between trying to play well in every event or just focusing on the grand slams and felt people criticised him either way. The addition of Ivan Lendl as coach at the start of the year helped him to believe in himself more and now every time he steps on the court he wants to be ready to win the tournament. Murray hopes his new attitude will help him to claim more grand slam titles and, in time, the No1 ranking. His defeat in Tokyo cost him a few points but he still has 4,000 points to play for, up to\u00a0and including London, where he will be a favourite to win the title for the first time. The first task will come in Shanghai, where he arrived on Saturday, trying to win\u00a0the title for the third year in a row. Having got the soreness out of his body, he said he expects to play well in Shanghai, where he begins against either Bernard Tomic of Australia or Florian Mayer of Germany. &quot;When I haven&apos;t played for a few weeks, the first couple of matches seem to be a little bit harder, but once you get through them my body tends to feel better,&quot; he said. &quot;So I&apos;m glad I got a lot of matches in this week and I&apos;ll be feeling good for Shanghai.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Speaking in Tokyo for the first time since he announced the move, Hamilton seemed much happier than he has been all season."], "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-06T21:59:02Z", "title": "McLaren back in gear after Lewis Hamilton's decision to leave", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/06/mclaren-lewis-hamilton", "article": "For McLaren, the past two weeks have been difficult, perhaps even traumatic, in that \u2013 for all the attention to detail in Formula One \u2013 this is a team that prides itself on ensuring every aspect of racing, on and off the track, is maintained and managed to the highest level. It is part of what makes McLaren McLaren. Lewis Hamilton&apos;s departure was the unexpected, the unplanned \u2013 an anomaly on the curve. For an organisation where minutiae is all, this was an old-school spanner in the works. Yet here in Japan there is a very real sense that the storm has been weathered, equanimity restored and, with the furore dying down, there is the chance for everyone in the team to return their focus to the day job and the last six races of a world championship they believe can still be won. The question of whether Hamilton would stay at the team with whom he grew up had dragged on through the summer. He remained noncommittal and unwilling to discuss the matter, and this week revealed that the team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, had begun asking about renewing the contract as long ago as 2011&apos;s race in China. But there seemed little urgency. McLaren must have thought they would ultimately resolve any issues Hamilton had. Why would he leave a team that can virtually guarantee to provide a car with race-winning potential? Also, where would he go? The only real possibility was Mercedes should Michael Schumacher leave, but with the probability of taking a drive that was clearly off the pace. Yet then McLaren&apos;s finely tuned machine met Lewis&apos;s spanner and that was exactly what he did. Speaking in Tokyo for the first time since he announced the move, Hamilton seemed much happier than he has been all season. Mind made up, for him it was a chance to relax and pay attention to the racing. For his team, who signed Sauber&apos;s Sergio P\u00e9rez as his replacement, there were questions to be asked internally and answered externally while coping with the fallout, but come Suzuka they too were ready to move on and look to the future. In Saturday&apos;s qualifying \u2013 in which Sebastian Vettel took pole but only after a lengthy investigation by race stewards after Ferrari pointed out that he had appeared to block Fernando Alonso \u2013 Hamilton struggled with setup problems to qualify only ninth, but felt his return to the office and his close-knit crew, some of whom have been with him since 2007, was an example of how they have done so. &quot;It&apos;s been great, it really has been great,&quot; he said &quot;It is almost like nothing has happened. We are here to do the job that we have come here to do. I just told them that I wanted them to know I am still massively focused on doing this job until the end.&quot; He also reiterated his determination to win the title, the one absolute he has not had cause to debate all season. &quot;I am focused on this team and helping them win the championship,&quot; he insisted. Which is what the team want to hear, at the very least. A title is a title after all, and it would remain McLaren&apos;s when Hamilton has gone to Mercedes and indeed, long after he has hung up his gloves. He will, of course, want it for himself too. Not least because he has also been disarmingly honest this weekend about his chances with Mercedes next year, admitting that for the first time in his F1 career he goes into a season not expecting to win races. &quot;Absolutely not,&quot; he replied when asked if he thought he could win the title in 2013, adding: &quot;Races? I am not even expecting that.&quot; Which is a good indicator of the import of his decision, as he would have been made fully aware by Mercedes of expectations for their new car. He confirmed as much. &quot;It&apos;s long term. It&apos;s 2014-15 when I anticipate we will have most success,&quot; he said. Which is a problem his current team will not face. Hamilton has confirmed several times this weekend that he believes P\u00e9rez will be stepping into a very quick McLaren next year and he will, until his switch, have been involved with development of the new car. But even given that, the team are still concentrating on the immediate future. Whitmarsh acknowledged that the move had a variety of ramifications. &quot;Lewis has been part of the team for many years and I&apos;m sure in every individual there were elements of surprise, elements of disappointment as well as excitement at the idea of working with someone young and fresh like Sergio,&quot; he said. But he also believed that now the decision had been made everyone involved could set to the task at hand. There seems no doubt that McLaren wanted to keep Hamilton and his loss would have been keenly disappointing, but while they cannot have been happy he chose as he did, for Whitmarsh, at least the distraction is over. &quot;He&apos;s made a decision and in making that decision I think it occupied a fair bit of energy and thought and time,&quot; he said. Now that it had been made: &quot;That proportion of his energy, thought, time can be focused and channelled on each race. He likes winning, we like winning, so we&apos;re pretty in line,&quot; he concluded. It seems there is a confluence, then, between team and driver for the remaining races, one that Whitmarsh, who remains committed to fighting for the title, expresses in practical terms succinctly: &quot;We need to continue to develop the car and make it quicker, make sure we&apos;ve got the reliability and we need to maximise the points that are available to us each weekend. Three things.&quot; In other words, back to the details and business as usual at McLaren."}, {"sentences": ["Meanwhile, the group&apos;s annual bash, taking place in Tokyo this week, is no longer associated with dry communiqu\u00e9s obediently delivered by the world&apos;s financial leaders."], "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economics", "Greece", "Germany", "Eurozone crisis", "WH Smith", "Burberry", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-06T23:06:15Z", "title": "Conflict in the east, crisis in the eurozone.

Meanwhile, the group&apos;s annual bash, taking place in Tokyo this week, is no longer associated with dry communiqu\u00e9s obediently delivered by the world&apos;s financial leaders. Instead, delegates will concentrate on the more amusing diversion of appearing polite about rivals in public, while viciously kicking their shins when an opening presents. That&apos;s because the real issue is another old theme back in vogue \u2013 protectionism \u2013 and the list of likely spats is lengthy. They include a German-American attack on China for dumping solar panels on their domestic markets, plus a potential US bill allowing higher tariffs on imports from countries gaining an edge through currency manipulation (that&apos;s China, again). Meanwhile, Beijing will argue that quantitative easing in the west distorts the financial system, while also continuing its tiff with Japan, which accuses China of effectively allowing Japanese factories to be trashed in recent riots. And then there&apos;s the eurozone. IMF boss Christine Lagarde will need all her charm just to keep the boys in line. Goodwill ambassador Merkel heads to Greece The last time German chancellor Angela Merkel visited Athens, Europe was still in awe of all the Greek mythical figures that made up the country&apos;s finances. The financial system was then at the apex of the credit boom and Gordon Brown was a popular chap, having just wrested the keys to Number 10. So the world provides a far more cynical backdrop for her visit on Tuesday. Merkel will arrive just after Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has warned that his country will run out of cash next month without \u20ac31bn of aid. Some wags, by the way, reckon the trip could boost the Greek economy, with retailers doing a brisk trade in lighter fuel for burning German flags and black marker pens for defacing Merkel&apos;s image. Still, the visit represents a considerable turnaround for Samaras&apos;s reputation: he was once the butt of rampant disapproval in the eurozone&apos;s corridors of power. Merkel will be in Athens not to perform her usual trick of slamming the Greeks, but to soothe them, claiming that &quot;we&apos;re all in it together&quot;. This could still be an incendiary line \u2013 especially if she then fails to resist adding: &quot;But you&apos;re in it more than us.&quot; Swann still paddling profitably at WH Smith Nine years ago, when Kate Swann took over as boss of WH Smith, anybody foreseeing the retail backdrop she was to inherit would surely have sold their shares. Amazon had just started transforming the way we buy books, Apple was in the process of making the CD seem rather quaint, and supermarkets were competing on non-food items. We all know what that did to HMV and Waterstones (not to mention dear old Woolies), yet this seemingly unattractive retailer has produced steady growth in both profits and share price. And it goes on. This week Swann is expected to unveil pre-tax profits of \u00a3100m \u2013 the first time under her reign that they have broken that barrier \u2013 and a 20% bump in the dividend to around 27p a share. That news will coincide with next week&apos;s &quot;Super Thursday&quot; marketing fest \u2013 the day the book industry releases titles expected to be the most popular Christmas gifts. This should provide a positive narrative alongside inevitable questions about how long Swann&apos;s good luck can last. Her secret thus far has been diligent cost-cutting, though this has often resulted in grubby stores and long queues. Her decision to cut her stake by \u00a33m in the past year should be a sell sign \u2013 except the shares have since gained another 18%.

Still, after years of being considered a City success story, the company must face investors this week with news of its recent trading \u2013 the first time it&apos;s gone public since last month&apos;s profits warning. Despite clues that the rich aren&apos;t buying expensive threads, the shares slumped by 19%, suggesting the news shocked investors.

Growth has slowed from more than 10% to less than 8% over the past two years, but its rising population means that growth of between 6% and 7% is needed just to keep pace. In March, Beijing cut its growth target for the whole of 2012 to 7.5%. As any student of politics knows, a foreign dispute distracts attention from failing economic policies. But opting for a short-term boost in domestic popularity over a deterioration in long-term relations with foreign investors looks to be a huge mistake by the Beijing authorities. And the IMF understands that this local dispute has much wider ramifications: after all, Japan is the world&apos;s third-largest economy and China, its second-biggest, accounts for about a fifth of the world&apos;s total economic output. Any slowdown is going to hamper a global recovery. The Americans have already put the brakes on expansion in China, in reaction to general corruption and to the growing threat from intellectual property theft. European companies have also backed off, preferring to send in high-value goods made at home. Japan&apos;s economy is not in great shape either. This year, colossal spending on imported gas and oil will send the balance of payments into reverse for only the second time in three decades. The yen is at a historic high against the dollar, making Japanese products expensive abroad, and the political situation remains unstable, with the Democratic party government able to push through a VAT rise only on a promise of early elections. And let&apos;s not forget the eurozone crisis. That continues to provide plenty of food for thought for IMF officials, given the failure to deal with Spain&apos;s financial black hole and growing public unrest among southern Europe&apos;s increasingly desperate citizens. Yet it is the Japan/China dispute that is worrying them most. Japan believes the Chinese are wilfully making trouble: it has stressed that it bought the islands earlier this year to keep them out of the hands of the mayor of Tokyo, a Boris Johnson-style character with a populist enmity towards the Chinese community in Japan. Maybe Beijing thinks it can go it alone without Japanese investment. It would be wrong, and the decision could have implications for us all. Have women had their quota of being kept down? What does it take to get more women into the boardroom? Compulsory quotas? This is always presented as the nuclear option and women who have managed to bust through the glass ceiling are by and large against them. Last week, announcing her decision to leave Financial Times owner Pearson after 15 years in charge, Dame Marjorie Scardino said: &quot;I thought, in 1997, that by the time I left Pearson, things would be different in terms of the number of chief executives and board members who are women. It&apos;s not really too different and, for that, I&apos;m sorry.&quot; It had been hoped that Scardino, the first woman to run a FTSE 100 company, would be the first of many, but there have never been more than five female FTSE 100 bosses at any one time. Yet Scardino rejected quotas: &quot;You should choose people on the basis of their abilities. Not on the basis of things they can&apos;t do anything about.&quot; But doesn&apos;t the under-representation of women in the City \u2013 they still occupy fewer than one in five FTSE 100 boardroom seats \u2013 suggest their &quot;abilities&quot; are being overlooked? Last year, a government inquiry led by Lord Davies of Abersoch set a target of 25% female representation on FTSE boards by 2015. Companies were told to act or face eventual quotas. There was a flurry of appointments of women to FTSE boards, but a worrying proportion of them were in part-time, non-executive roles. Last month Royal Mail&apos;s Canadian boss, Moya Greene, told a conference that the pace of change in this country was &quot;glacial&quot;. When she started in the Canadian civil service, no woman taking a senior role could be married. Progress came thanks to quotas. &quot;Unless you have quotas and live by them,&quot; she said, &quot;you won&apos;t see change.&quot; Strong stuff. But the government is fighting an EU move to impose a 40% female quota for large company boards, arguing that national schemes should be given a chance. At what point should women start to lose patience? After all, 15 years is a long time. For BAE and EADS, two into three won&apos;t go So much for Tom Enders&apos;s and Ian King&apos;s vision that an EADS/BAE Systems combo would be a depoliticised company. For the past week, all the debate has been about how great a slice of the shares the French and German governments will retain, or at least control. &quot;A lot&quot; seems to be the short answer \u2013 maybe 9% each. By contrast, it is envisaged that the UK would rub along with only a golden share to protect national security and act as a veto on a change of control. Former chancellor Alistair Darling doesn&apos;t like the smell of it. &quot;We will be taken to the cleaners,&quot; he told the FT. &quot;I don&apos;t see how you could have a large new company like this with the French and German governments having large direct and indirect stakes and we have none.&quot; Darling is right. It is relatively easy to accept that BAE, in the face of shrinking defence budgets, needs to do something. The logic of a grand European defence-and-aerospace company is also sound. But a three-way alliance will work only if all three sponsoring governments have equal standing. Any other arrangement invites years of squabbling over jobs and investment and accusations of political interference. The two chief executives want a business that operates &quot;in a normal commercial manner and which confers the same rights on all shareholders, large and small&quot;. That won&apos;t happen if two governments, but not the third, have large shareholdings."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;In the old days nearly all our customers wore kimonos every day,&quot; says Yoshio Hada, who has worked in the kimono section of the Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo for 50 years.", "Ten years ago, Waraku, a glossy Tokyo-based magazine aimed at women in their 50s, introduced a simpler new style of kimono known as Iki."], "tags": ["Women", "Fashion", "Japan", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T19:00:05Z", "title": "Can Kate save the kimono?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/08/can-kate-save-kimono", "article": "First the Duchess of Cambridge did it on her first royal tour of Asia, then Prada followed suit just a few weeks ago \u2013 both offered a new take on the traditional Japanese kimono. Could this new prominence be a sign that an outfit that means &quot;something that you wear&quot; in Japanese is having a renaissance? Made from a bolt of cloth 12 metres long, the traditional kimono design, with typical geometric square sleeves, has changed little over the centuries. But its recent celebrity resurgence cannot hide the fact that the kimono industry is in decline as, outside a traditional geisha world known as &quot;flower and willow&quot;, most Japanese women have switched to wearing western clothes, only bringing out kimonos for formal occasions, if at all. &quot;In the old days nearly all our customers wore kimonos every day,&quot; says Yoshio Hada, who has worked in the kimono section of the Mitsukoshi department store in Tokyo for 50 years. &quot;Now there are very few.&quot; Cost, practicality and fashion have all had an impact on the popularity of Japan&apos;s traditional clothing. There are so many complicated rules for wearing kimonos that many Japanese women today have never learned how to do it properly and are fearful of getting it wrong. The largest customer base for these ornate and complicated clothes is the geisha community. Umeka says she ran away from home at 15 to become a maiko, or trainee geiko \u2013 as geisha are known in Kyoto \u2013 because she loved kimonos so much. She now owns 200 of them, many of them hand-painted with exquisite flowers, trees, birds, bridges, streams and mountains, and kimono-obi (sash) ensembles. Some of these pieces have price tags of \u00a350,000 or more, bought by wealthy clients and patrons, others she bought from the fees tea-house clients are charged for the pleasure of being entertained by &quot;a living work of art&quot;. Most geisha are concentrated in &quot;hanamachi&quot; or &quot;flower towns&quot; in certain areas of Japan, and in the Gion district of Kyoto. Only 12 teenage maiko are currently training to become geiko in the city&apos;s Kamishichiken flower district. In recent years, 19 of the area&apos;s 30 tea houses have closed, unable to compete with the karaoke bars and pachinko parlours that entertain men after work As kimonos have fallen out of fashion outside these flower districts, the number of companies making them has also dramatically reduced. Kihachi Tabata produces some of the finest hand-painted kimono fabrics in Kyoto. A single kimono can take him up to a year to make. He is the fifth generation of his family in the business, but none of his sons have followed him into the industry. &quot;You cannot make money from making kimonos,&quot; he says sadly. Ten years ago, Waraku, a glossy Tokyo-based magazine aimed at women in their 50s, introduced a simpler new style of kimono known as Iki. The magazine&apos;s editor, Kayo Igarashi, believes that the kimono industry needs to adapt and change in order to survive in a modern world. But although the Iki kimono is easier to wear, and more practical for urban working women, the price tags for these finely woven plain fabrics can be even higher than for elaborately patterned ceremonial kimonos. Mitsukoshi&apos;s kimono department had a bolt of this plainer kimono fabric for sale at \u00a370,000. Takao Watanabe, president of the Nishijin Textile Industrial Association, argues that being able to afford these staggering prices, and follow the kimono&apos;s elaborate rules are indications of a person&apos;s wealth and status. So\u00a0perhaps it was meant to survive to be modelled by princesses and couture clients. Despite her collection of 200 kimonos, Umeka admits to wearing western clothes when &quot;off duty&quot; and proudly shows me her Herm\u00e8s handbag. So does she think the traditional kimono can survive in a modern Japan? &quot;Of course it will, &quot; she laughs. &quot;Even if I am the last one, I will keep wearing kimono!&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s a tall order to win this world championship but its not impossible,&quot; he said in Tokyo last Wednesday."], "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One 2012", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T20:59:00Z", "title": "Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton admit McLaren F1 title hopes are over", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/08/jenson-button-lewis-hamilton-mclaren", "article": "The McLaren drivers, Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton, have admitted that their bids to win the world championship this year are over in the wake of a Japanese Grand Prix, where they only managed to finish fourth and fifth respectively. The race was won by Red Bull&apos;s Sebastian Vettel, who is now only four points behind the championship leader, Fernando Alonso. The Spaniard scored no points after suffering a puncture at Turn One when Kimi Raikkonen clipped the Ferrari&apos;s left-rear wheel, ending his race. Hamilton is now 42 points behind Fernando Alonso and Button is 63 in arrears, with five races remaining. Before the race Hamilton had been happy and relaxed, having finally settled his move to Mercedes and was optimistic that he could still fight for the title. &quot;It&apos;s a tall order to win this world championship but its not impossible,&quot; he said in Tokyo last Wednesday. &quot;The car&apos;s looking pretty awesome at the moment, so if we can improve on our reliability then it would be great to go out with a bang.&quot; However a late set-up change unbalanced his car for qualifying and he could only start from ninth on the grid. Then he struggled with understeer for half of the race itself before the car improved and he fought back to fifth. &quot;The car was very, very quick but something went wrong in qualifying. For whatever reason it came back in halfway through the race,&quot; he said. However, without taking a win and capitalising on Alonso&apos;s failure to score, Vettel&apos;s maximum had realistically turned the championship into a two-way title fight. &quot;Anything can happen but at the moment it kind of is a two-horse race because there are two guys there that are battling it out,&quot; said Hamilton. Button, who had qualified in third but started from eighth after a five-place grid penalty, was honest about his car&apos;s overall performance. &quot;I don&apos;t think we were quick enough this weekend. I think if we&apos;d started where we qualified, we would have finished on the podium,&quot; he said. &quot;I think behind the two Red Bulls, I reckon we would have got second at the start because our start was amazing. But that wasn&apos;t to be, we started down in eighth.&quot; He had chased down Sauber&apos;s Kamui Kobayashi to challenge for third at the death but ran out of laps to make the pass, which despite the British driver&apos;s affection for Japan and the home fans urging on the Japanese driver, was a move he would have made. &quot;I do love Japan but when you&apos;re out there you&apos;re out there to win, to do the best you can for yourself and the team. Your view doesn&apos;t change because you&apos;re racing on a certain circuit,&quot; he said. &quot;I still wanted to beat him. It&apos;s motor racing, it&apos;s what we do, but no, congratulations to him.&quot; After a strong start to the season, winning the opener in Australia and taking second at the race in China, it was the following races that cost Button dearly. After China he scored seven points in six races. Not enough, even given his strong scoring in the second-half of the season, to challenge Vettel and Alonso, agreeing \u2013 &quot;looks that way&quot; \u2013 to Hamilton&apos;s assertion that it was now a two-horse race. Equally, Kobayashi&apos;s podium was significant for Sauber but ominous for Hamilton. It was the team&apos;s 14th points-scoring position of the season and has moved them to within 20 points of Mercedes in the constructors&apos; championship, for whom the British driver will be racing next year. While illustrating how strongly Sauber have been performing this season it is also demonstrative of how far the German team have been off the pace. If Sauber pass them, Mercedes will finish sixth in the championship, not the position Hamilton has been accustomed to at McLaren. These last weeks with the team may yet be even more uncomfortable, meanwhile. Hamilton is already known for his erratic behaviour on Twitter, having upset McLaren at the Belgian Grand Prix when he tweeted a telemetry sheet, and on Sunday he may have made the relationship with his team-mate even worse. Led to believe that Button had unfollowed him on Twitter, Hamilton tweeted: &quot;Just noticed @jensonbutton unfollowed, thats a shame. After 3 years as teammates, I thought we respected one another but clearly he doesn&apos;t.&quot; continuing: &quot;Funny thing is, we are STILL teammates! All good tho, I plan on giving this team &amp; fans all I got til I cross the finish line in brazil!!!&quot; However, someone then pointed out to the driver that Button had, in fact, never followed him on Twitter, forcing him to back down: &quot;My bad, just found out Jenson never followed me. Don&apos;t blame him! Need to be on Twitter more!&quot; Back on the track, within the two-way fight that the two McLaren drivers have now acknowledged is the reality of the championship battle, the advantage lies firmly with Red Bull. New brake ducts and associated aero improvements brought to Suzuka, clearly paid off in downforce terms, while Ferrari are still struggling to improve their car which remains firmly behind both McLaren and Red Bull on pace. Vettel, however is remaining cautious of overconfidence. &quot;I am very careful. I think we had a long journey so far. It has been a tough year and there are still many races to go,&quot; he said. But the reality of this two-horse race is that Alonso&apos;s ride is most certainly not prancing while Vettel is certainly atop the thoroughbred."}, {"sentences": ["The Washington-based lender said at the start of its annual meeting, in Tokyo, that the &quot;downside risks are judged to be more elevated than in the April 2012 or September 2011 world economic outlook reports&quot;.", "It said: &quot;Staff research suggests that fiscal cutbacks had larger than expected negative short-term multiplier effects on output, which may explain some of the output falls.&quot; The World Bank, which is holding its annual meeting alongside the IMF in Tokyo, added to the gloom with a report that warned of a cuts in growth across the developing world."], "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Global economy", "Eurozone crisis", "Economics", "Business", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Euro", "Europe", "World Bank", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T21:29:01Z", "title": "IMF warns of fresh global crisis unless eurozone finds a fix", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/08/imf-warns-global-crisis-eurozone", "article": "  The International Monetary Fund has urged Eurozone leaders to act swiftly in response to the debt crisis in Greece and Spain, or risk dragging down the global economy with another financial crisis. The IMF warned that the situation was grave and could escalate into a wider downturn unless national leaders ended their disputes with a long-lasting deal. As eurozone finance ministers met in Luxembourg for crisis talks and the launch of the euro&apos;s permanent rescue fund, the IMF urged Europe and the US to promote growth to help major developing economies like China, Brazil and India . The Washington-based lender said at the start of its annual meeting, in Tokyo, that the &quot;downside risks are judged to be more elevated than in the April 2012 or September 2011 world economic outlook reports&quot;. The annual assessment of the global economic situation said it was not clear whether the situation was another bump in the road to recovery or a worsening of the situation. &quot;The answer depends on whether European and US policymakers deal proactively with their major short term economic problems,&quot; it said. The warning comes against a backdrop of slowing GDP growth across developed countries and much of the developing world as trade dries up and governments increasingly hide behind protectionist barriers. Although Britain was singled out by the IMF as one of the developed nations expected to grow next year, chancellor George Osborne was forced to concede in his speech to the Conservative party conference on Monday that lack of growth in the past two years meant austerity measures could last until as long as 2018. And the IMF admitted that it, like many other forecasting organisations, had underestimated the negative impact on growth of steep cuts in public spending. It said: &quot;Staff research suggests that fiscal cutbacks had larger than expected negative short-term multiplier effects on output, which may explain some of the output falls.&quot; The World Bank, which is holding its annual meeting alongside the IMF in Tokyo, added to the gloom with a report that warned of a cuts in growth across the developing world. Stock markets tumbled as the prospects for growth were trimmed by the bank, which mainly lends to cash-strapped poorer countries. The FTSE finished the day at 5845, down 26 points, while continental stock markets also fell. Figures showing German manufacturing has lost much of its vitality over the summer compounded gloomy assessments of the French economy to further depress markets. But eurozone ministers were adamant that Spain would not need a bailout and was capable of refinancing its banks and keeping within budget constraints without the need for a further EU funds. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said Madrid had made clear it wanted no help. &quot;Spain needs no aid programme. Spain is doing everything necessary, in fiscal policy, in structural reforms,&quot; he said as he arrived at the launch of the European Stability Mechanism in Luxembourg, which will eventually have \u20ac500bn (\u00a3405bn) at its disposal. Osborne told conference that he would need to make extra cuts in welfare spending until 2018 to reduce the UK&apos;s structural deficit. He blamed the slowdown in the global economy for the difficulties faced by the UK as it seeks to increase exports and rebalance the economy towards manufacturing. The global economy will grow at 3.3% this year and 3.6% next year, the IMF said, down 0.2 and 0.3 points respectively from forecasts earlier this year. The UK is expected to suffer a 0.4% reduction in national income this year before recovering to 1.1% next year. Only two years ago, world output was 5.1% and the recovery from the 2008 crash seemed under way. Since then a fall in demand across the west has forced China to cut production. Countries dependent on the sale of commodities have experienced falling prices, further eroding their capacity to pick up the slack left by indebted developed nations. The IMF&apos;s first deputy managing director David Lipton blamed much of the instability and fear in the global economy on the US, which he said needs to do more to show it is trying to address the expiring tax cuts and automatic spending reductions that will hit early next year unless Congress acts. While most of the focus has been on Europe, Lipton stressed that the US fiscal problems also posed a significant threat. &quot;We would like to see the United States lower the level of uncertainty by embracing more specifically the need to avoid the fiscal cliff and deal with the medium-term problems,&quot; said Lipton, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama."}, {"sentences": ["There&apos;s a little piece of Yorkshire in the heart of Tokyo where a thirst for great British beer is getting stronger.", "The deal with the Tokyo customer is the result of a decision to invest in the plant needed to supply a niche product to a far flung market."], "tags": ["Small business network best practice exchange shortlist", "Best practice: Exporting", "Best practice exchange"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-09T08:00:00Z", "title": "Keeping true to British roots gives an edge in foreign markets", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/oct/09/great-yorkshire-brewery", "article": "There&apos;s a little piece of Yorkshire in the heart of Tokyo where a thirst for great British beer is getting stronger. The World Beer Museum in the city&apos;s Skytree Tower district stocks such liquid delicacies as Two Pints and Monkman&apos;s Slaughter.  The company that makes them, The Great Yorkshire Brewery, was recently relaunched adding new lines created with overseas customers in mind. The deal with the Tokyo customer is the result of a decision to invest in the plant needed to supply a niche product to a far flung market. The Japanese company wanted an exclusive arrangement in the UK. The first step was to send samples for a taste test. A flurry of visits and paperwork followed and this year the Japanese customer placed its first order. No less than 1,000 kegs later, and the company&apos;s owner, Joanne Taylor, says: &quot;We love thinking of Japanese people sitting in a bar drinking Yorkshire beer.&quot; The clincher in winning the contract was the brewery&apos;s bold decision to make the major investment in equipment. A decision was made to outlay \u00a3100,000 for a kegging machine which allows the brewery to produce cask beer but export it in kegs. Taylor explains that cask beer is a &apos;live&apos; product which is too unstable to travel. The beer degrades during any significant journey. The company is one of one of few small breweries that produce cask beer with the capacity to put it into kegs, which means it can consistently supply high quality craft beer to customers overseas. This commitment was crucial in prising open export markets so the company also invested tens of thousands of pounds in 1,000 stainless steel kegs, ensuring the product reaches Japan in optimum condition. The Great Yorkshire Brewing Company has set its sights on other export markets, starting with Ireland. Taylor is attending an event there organised by UKTI which gives British producers a chance to showcase their products. She and her business partner, Phil Lee, also spent time in the US with a master brewer in Michigan to learn what was needed to produce and sell beer attractive to American consumers \u2013 a vastly different market to that in the UK. &quot;Every state has its own local beers and every state has different rules on what you can say on the label and how alcohol is sold, so we looked at equipment and talked about recipes and learned as much about that market as we could.&quot; Armed with that knowledge, they are working on a new product. &quot;A US contact told us that the American palate is for big &apos;hoppy&apos; beers and we started developing a lager that we think will export really well. It will be brewed as a lager, but with a big fruity flavour - unusual for a lager here.&quot; Perfecting the taste and honing logistics are essential to the export market, Taylor says, but giving the brand character is vital. The product&apos;s &quot;Yorkshire-ness&quot; is part of its appeal and the labelling and packaging are a clever nod to the brewery&apos;s heritage.  &quot;We hope that by drawing attention to where the beer comes from, we will stand out in a global marketplace,&quot; Taylor says.

Wait and see what happens next in Europe and wait and see how the US tackles its so-called fiscal cliff. Optimists at the top of the organisation believe an agreement on closer co-operation and debt sharing in Europe, alongside a congressional deal in the US to limit the impact of tax rises and spending cuts due in January, is possible and will put the world economy back on a path to growth and recovery. Olivier Blanchard, the IMF&apos;s chief economist, singled out Europe and the US for criticism during the annual conference in Tokyo, though as an optimist, he said there were signs that both were edging towards deals that would end the current uncertainty. The focus on Europe and the US is understandable. Despite talk of a globalised world, the crux of the dilemma faced by the Washington-based bank is that without growth in Europe and the US, every other country suffers. China is the prime loser from a slowdown in the west for the simple reason that it remains dependent on exports. While it has made efforts to develop a more rounded economy and bigger welfare state, Beijing depends on foreign buyers for its income. Yet the debts run up by Europe and the US since the financial crash leave them in a position where conventional wisdom says they must favour government spending cuts over measures to spur growth. The IMF is unrepentant in its view that governments cut public spending even though, for the worst hit nations like Britain, there is a direct impact on growth. Carlo Cottarelli, boss of the IMF&apos;s fiscal affairs department, was clear that anyone criticising the speed and depth of public spending cuts should consider the costs of not doing it, namely that international money markets would punish them with sky high borrowing costs. It is an argument we have heard many times. It is George Osborne&apos;s main defence when critics from the left accuse him of slowly sinking the economy under the weight of cuts that undermine confidence and private investment. But it is not one that rings true in the US or Japan, which have kept spending high and are still considered safe bets by the investor community. The UK has equally low borrowing costs. Is that because it also squeezes into the too-big-to-fail camp, or because it has pursued austerity? A quick look at the IMF&apos;s fiscal monitor shows the trade-offs between growth and deficit reduction have put the UK and US in roughly the same position as far as their annual spending deficits go. In the last two years, the US has grown consistently, but overspent more. The UK has not grown at all, but has cut further. The US is predicted to end 2012 with roughly the same annual deficit, but gets a bigger economy than it had two years ago, while the UK has shrunk. The US national income is greater than before the crash, the UK&apos;s remains 4% below the peak. So if a country can confront investors in a game of chicken and win, an expansionary policy makes sense. The benefits of higher tax revenues and lower unemployment costs help reduce deficits. Only anxious investors can spoil the party. The eurozone could pull off the same trick if countries could stick together. Two years ago there was an opportunity to follow the US. Hanging together would have kept borrowing costs low and allowed government to keep borrowing while private business recovered. There was general agreement except for Germany and a small cohort of right wing governments in Finland, Holland, and Austria. The IMF expects the eurozone to achieve the unity this year or next that it has failed to find in the last two. It cannot explain how, except to say that there appears to be more willingness to help each other. Unfortunately for Spain, Portugal and Greece, the northern eurozone members are the investor community. It is their banks that hold much southern European debt. They are the panickers. And only as long as the south is prepared to impoverish its people will they get solidarity. Setting aside the fact that this strange concept of solidarity is deeply flawed, mainly because it will take a huge amount of repression by Europe&apos;s elites to push it through, the IMF&apos;s optimism is based on Europe becoming, in the eyes of investors, too big to fail. So surely the IMF is in favour of battling the money markets to allow spending to increase? No, says Cottarelli, who was clear in his press conference that he could not think of any countries in a position to increase public spending. In answer to arguments put by economist Paul Krugman and others that cheap borrowing \u2013 because you are a country that is too big to fail \u2013 offers an opportunity to invest cheaply for future growth, he said the risk still existed that investors/lenders would panic at a later stage and jack up interest rates. So even if it is safe now, it may not be safe in a few years when total borrowing would be stratospheric and an increase in borrowing costs crippling. He said that for the US to borrow more would put the world economy on a knife edge. For the IMF to advocate that countries be scared of the markets is bizarre, when all that happens is that one country after another finds itself with such low growth that it needs a loan from the IMF. The US, the UK and most of the eurozone avoid this humiliation by printing money and devaluing their currencies. Yet even that is not enough and means all these vital economies will be borrowing more and IMF advice will exacerbate the problem."}, {"sentences": ["Explore our interactive, which looks at the latest UN forecasts on the growth of megacities, and includes videos from Lagos and Mexico City, and galleries from the world&apos;s first megacities: New York and Tokyo."], "tags": ["Al-Shabaab"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-09T13:30:51Z", "title": "Megacities rise, fertile land lies idle, and the UN calls for action on ageing", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/09/megacities-rise-land-idle-un-ageing", "article": "By 2025, there are expected to be 29 megacities in poor countries, which will have huge implications for the people living in them.

Investors, fearing the collapse of the eurozone, have pulled their money out of the financial system at vital moments, making it difficult for governments and businesses to meet the challenge of generating consistent growth. IMF director Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said: &quot;Faltering confidence and policy uncertainty have led to a pullback of cross-border private capital flows from the periphery \u2013 quite an extraordinary phenomenon within a currency union.&quot; The IMF calculated that total assets of EU banks could be forced to shrink by as much as $2.8tn, leading to a 9% reduction in credit. In an extreme scenario that figure could climb to $4.5tn. The IMF said eurozone policymakers have tried to give money markets some certainty, but it has proved inadequate and is encouraging flights of money from the periphery to northern Europe and to countries outside the currency union. The stock market has risen strongly since the summer, but the IMF is concerned the market could deflate if confidence evaporates. The authors of the report, Peter Dattels and Matthew Jones, said confidence in politicians has waned as each economic initiative fails to unite policymakers. A failure to tackle key financial decisions in Washington and Tokyo is also blamed for the increase in instability, but the governments are deemed less of a threat than the eurozone and are given years rather than months to sort out their problems. &quot;Despite significant and continuing efforts of European policymakers, which have been essential in addressing investors&apos; biggest fears, the principal risk remains the euro area crisis,&quot; Dattels and Jones said. &quot;Incremental policymaking has been insufficient to fully allay market tensions, despite the recent market rally since the end of July.&quot; They said problems in the US and Japan could be tackled over the next few months, and that it was a priority to agree a way forward for the eurozone. The Washington-based lender has warned before that the world economy is under threat from an unstable financial system, while eurozone leaders fail to agree terms for bailouts and monetary easing. European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi has garnered praise for his efforts to protect weaker eurozone countries in case they come under attack from nervous investors. Spain, Italy and Portugal have enjoyed lower interest rates as a result of ECB actions that cut borrowing costs. These moves have helped stave off a run on the currency. But Draghi has come under constant fire from politicians in Germany, Finland and Holland for creating unlimited rescue funds that could, they believe, rebound on the ECB. Earlier this week German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he believed Spain would survive without rescue funds from Brussels, contradicting most investor groups and City analysts who believe Spain can only survive if it accepts support from the EU. The IMF&apos;s global stability report argues that badly indebted countries need more support to alleviate the pressure from investors and create an environment that fosters confidence and growth. It says that while decisions are delayed, the assets held by banks also come under question and shareholders flee to hold safer assets. Banks in the eurozone periphery are known to hold billions of euros of bad debts that have yet to be recognised on their balance sheets. UK, French and German banks are also vulnerable to a downturn in the eurozone through their shareholdings and joint ventures with local banks in the periphery."}, {"sentences": ["In a speech to the IMF&apos;s annual meeting in Tokyo, Lagarde said banking regulators had told her that reforms of the financial system were incomplete and in many cases banks were as unsafe as before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.", "China&apos;s top central bank and finance ministry officials backed out of the meetings and sent deputies to Tokyo instead."], "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Christine Lagarde", "Eurozone crisis", "Euro", "Financial crisis", "Euro", "World news", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-11T07:25:00Z", "title": "Christine Lagarde: act bravely together to save world economy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/11/act-bravely-economy-christine-lagarde", "article": "The head of the International Monetary Fund has called on governments to co-operate to heal a fractured global economy or risk a further slowdown in economic growth.

She said policymakers needed to take immediate action to resolve issues hanging over from the financial crisis. Europe has come under fire for its failure to end the debt crisis in the euro currency union. Leaders in the US and Asia have become frustrated at delays in agreeing measures to bolster Greece, Spain and Portugal. Largarde avoided direct criticism of eurozone leaders but warned that only swift action could end the uncertainty that is hitting economies across the world. The IMF cut its global growth forecast this week for the second time since April. Lagarde said Asian economies had been some of the hardest hit by the slowdown that most analysts believe follows the failure of European leaders to deal with the debt crisis. Lagarde said: &quot;We expect action and we expect courageous and co-operative action on the part of our members.&quot; The IMF has expressed frustration with Europe&apos;s piecemeal response to its debt crisis and warned that a recent respite in borrowing costs for debt-laden countries such as Spain may prove short-lived unless eurozone leaders come up with a comprehensive and credible plan. Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s cut its crdit rating on Spain on Wednesday to a level just above junk territory, and Moody&apos;s may soon follow. The IMF itself has come under fire after it admitted in its World Economic Outlook report that officials underestimated the effects of austerity measures on economic growth. The report found that previous estimates that for every \u00a31 of spending cuts the economy shrank by 50p were wrong and the economy shrank by around \u00a31.30 instead. The IMF was a strong supporter of austerity measures adopted by Western countries, including the UK, in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Most countries that adopted austerity programmes have missed their deficit reduction targets after a sharp slowdown in economic growth hit tax revenues and private sector activity. The IMF has U-turned in recent months and urged government to allow their austerity reforms to be planned over a longer period to lessen the impact on growth. The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to admit next month he has missed at least one of his key deficit reduction targets at his Autumn Statement. He has already announced an extension of the government rolling five-year austerity regime to 2018. Lagarde said she backed the IMF&apos;s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who argued it was necessary to pursue government spending cuts or risk a backlash from international money markets and a rise in borrowing costs. Oxfam said there was a danger that the IMF&apos;s focus on the eurozone risked losing sight of the effects of the economic slowdown on the poorest. &quot;It&apos;s imperative that the poorest countries are not overlooked at this meeting. Europe&apos;s crisis needs to be fixed because the fallout is seriously threatening developing countries. &quot;Oxfam&apos;s research shows a Eurozone breakup could cost the world&apos;s poorest countries $30bn in lost trade and foreign investment. The IMF must work with poor countries to keep their fragile growth going, and to boost counter-cyclical spending essential for social stability and growth.&quot; The IMF is also under pressure from member states in the developing world who want greater representation on its governing board. Its 188 member countries meet on Friday and Saturday, and are expected to fall short of a goal to implement voting reforms that would give large emerging economies greater say and elevate China to the number three spot in IMF power. A territorial dispute between Japan and China added another element of disharmony. China&apos;s top central bank and finance ministry officials backed out of the meetings and sent deputies to Tokyo instead. China has objected to the purchase by Japan of the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which it has claimed since the 1970s. Lagarde said she hoped the world&apos;s second and third-largest economies could resolve their differences &quot;harmoniously and expeditiously.&quot; &quot;I think they lose out by not attending the meeting,&quot; she said of the Chinese officials. &quot;And they will be missing something great.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["These include 4,200 hotels and just shy of 2,500 restaurant tips across the world \u2013 from hotdog stands in New York to high-end cuisine in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Assured by Two Tomorrows", "Sustainability: living our values", "Editorial"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-11T16:34:00Z", "title": "Why readers make good travel writers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-editorial-travel", "article": "In 2005 I was working on a redesign of the travel section to go into the first edition of the Guardian&apos;s Berliner newspaper format. We wanted to make our coverage more inclusive, more fun, and more relevant to our readers&apos; lifestyles and interests. Instead of high-end safaris in Africa and sailing jaunts to the Caribbean, we would be recommending hidden restaurants where the locals eat, music festivals across Europe, and budget accommodation from \u00a35-a-night hostels to family-friendly campsites.  After I finished presenting my ideas to editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger, he asked me what I thought about getting our readers to write the Guardian&apos;s travel content, citing Wikipedia&apos;s user-generated example. Seven years on, the idea of readers contributing comments, ideas, tips and stories doesn&apos;t seem quite so radical \u2013 but it has become one of the central strands in our travel coverage.  Our collection of reader contributions has grown to well over 30,000 tips on Been There. These include 4,200 hotels and just shy of 2,500 restaurant tips across the world \u2013 from hotdog stands in New York to high-end cuisine in Tokyo. Before the addition of reader contributions, travel assignments tended to involve sending a journalist to a city to review a handful of hotels, or hoping one of our journalists was based in that city and could file a story. With our readers \u2013 and locals across the world \u2013 contributing, suddenly we dramatically broadened and improved our coverage. In the years that followed, as the online travel community blossomed, we directed our readers to local blogs around the world, connecting them to in-the-know residents whose fingers were more on the pulse than any of the traditional guides to a city.  We also invited these bloggers to comprise the bulk of our city guide coverage \u2013 an interactive online series that has covered 13 cities to date \u2013 and to contribute to our growing Guardian Travel Network. In 2009, when Twitter first burst on to the social network scene, writer Benji Lanyado put his travels entirely in the hands of live tips from the Twittersphere, visiting Paris and following hundreds of tips from locals and enthusiasts, in real time.  So began the first of 17 hugely successful live Twitter trips covering the UK and Europe, directing Benji to secret music performances in Cologne, forgotten communist cities on the outskirts on Krakow, via backstreet pubs in Nottingham. And what&apos;s the benefit of all this? Well, in my opinion, it makes the Guardian&apos;s travel coverage a lot more inclusive, better informed, up to speed with changes, and considerably more authoritative. Finding travel stories used to be about one man in an office making all the calls... now we&apos;ve got locals and readers chipping in, it&apos;s a much broader experience."}, {"sentences": ["Speaking at its annual meeting in Tokyo, IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that only with greater co-operation and courage could governments hope to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis."], "tags": ["Christine Lagarde", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Spain", "Europe", "Economics", "Business", "World news", "Mariano Rajoy"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-11T18:13:21Z", "title": "Spain resists pressure for bailout as IMF calls for firm action", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/spain-resists-pressure-bailout", "article": "Spain defied renewed pressure to accept an international bailout on Thursday, a stance that could last for several more weeks or even months despite the humiliation of having its credit rating cut to near junk status.

Moody&apos;s said it may soon follow suit. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy, however, struck a defiant tone when he said that tough labour reforms and the rebuilding of its tarnished banking sector meant the IMF&apos;s dire forecast for Spain&apos;s economy would not be realised. &quot;If we follow that strategy \u2026 we&apos;ll see that the reality turns out to be better than the forecasts,&quot; he said. Rajoy&apos;s position was strengthened as Spain&apos;s key 10-year bond yield remained unchanged on Thursday despite the S&amp;P move. He is thought to want to wait at least until after regional elections on 21 October to ask for aid and even later if the European Central Bank&apos;s bond buying keeps borrowing costs down.

A few days past his 27th birthday, the fledgling Danish director had been brought to Britain to promote his first film, a low-budget crime drama called Pusher. &quot;It was a glorious moment,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The film had done more than I ever thought it could \u2013 it had left Copenhagen. For me that was like making Star Wars.&quot; Fifteen years on, he sits in another, larger Soho hotel \u2013 a sleek and genial figure whose last film, the neon-lit thriller Drive, carried him into Hollywood&apos;s upper levels. A London-set remake of his debut is about to be released, on which his credit is executive producer. He is here to reminisce. To walk between the two hotels would take minutes, yet the journey from one to the other has been outlandish \u2013 an odyssey through the film industries of Britain, the US and Scandinavia with a detour to India and a baroque cast of real-life characters. The new Pusher is, in fact, a second remake, joining a pair of sequels Refn made himself in what must surely be modern cinema&apos;s most unlikely franchise. The original plot was classically simple, a seven-day countdown as a Copenhagen heroin dealer tries to settle a debt to a louche but vicious Serbian gangster. Refn&apos;s gift for casting was clear \u2013 the burly Kim Bodnia gave anti-hero Frank a glowering magnetism, the much-admired Mads Mikkelsen took a first screen role as his sidekick. The result hummed with promise \u2013 the son of Danish film-makers who spent his youth in 80s New York, Refn instinctively fused the swagger of American crime movies with handheld European v\u00e9rit\u00e9. In Denmark, the film was a huge and unexpected hit. The rest of the world failed to notice. It took British distributor Metrodome to brave a first international release. In the last moments before Trainspotting became old news, company founder Rupert Preston cannily sold Refn as &quot;the Danish Danny Boyle&quot; and the film won an audience big enough to stir interest elsewhere. &quot;Britain is where it all started,&quot; Refn says. &quot;This place got me out of my cage.&quot; For its director, Pusher had served its purpose: he came to see the movie as a film student might regard their final coursework, with fond memories of a riotous shoot, a supporting cast of club kids and local heavies, and a snotty commitment to authenticity that meant &quot;all the cocaine on set being real&quot;. Assuming all that was now behind him, Refn got on with the rest of his career. Eventually, inevitably, he headed to the US. In 2003 came a wilfully opaque thriller called Fear X, starring John Turturro. It baffled almost all who saw it. All, essentially, was no one. Its director was left financially ruined. &quot;I was down and out,&quot; Refn says. &quot;I owed the bank a million dollars. I was depressed, humiliated, I had just had my first child. I felt like a rock&apos;n&apos;roll suicide.&quot; If the scale of his debt outdid Frank in Pusher, there was a mordant irony to the solution \u2013 the &quot;despicable sell-out&quot; of making not one but two belated sequels. He had few other offers. In Pusher II \u2013 Refn now calls it &quot;the girly Pusher&quot; \u2013 Mikkelsen&apos;s goonish sadsack attempted fatherhood. Pusher III focused on Milo, the ageing gangster again played by Zlatko Buric, a crazy-haired 6ft 5in Croatian steeped in avant-garde theatre who had stolen much of the first movie. Yet there would be a twist. Born as desperate cash-ins, the sequels won Refn new levels of critical acclaim. They also made just enough money to pay off the bank. An unhappy spell making Miss Marple TV movies still lay ahead. But old friendships endured. Preston had by now left Metrodome for Vertigo Films, a hard-nosed outfit whose movies were keenly attuned to the market. Having produced Refn&apos;s Pusher sequels, he now suggested a remake. Given the original&apos;s strong characters and ticking-clock conceit, he wasn&apos;t the first. A script appeared from an American producer. Fox discussed making a network TV show. Given the nature of Refn&apos;s career, it was therefore predictable that the first remake of Pusher would be developed in Leicester and shot in Hindi. A cheerful Anglo-Indian actor from the east Midlands, Assad Raja had nursed a passion for the film since 1997. Finally, after years telling friends he wanted to make a film &quot;a bit like Pusher&quot; to escape the weary chase for roles on The Bill, he approached Refn for the rights to direct a fully fledged remake \u2013 a showcase for his talents aimed at the Indian film business. Refn, says Raja, was &quot;amused&quot; by the thought of his debut going Bollywood. Casting himself in the lead and shooting in London, his production was almost as chaotic as the original: unable to find an Asian actor to play a henchman, Raja narrowly avoided having to &quot;brown up&quot; a white bodybuilder. In the end, his film came out in 2010 sharing the same scruffy, adrenal energy as its inspiration while adding a\u00a0sub-plot about the cricket world cup. India, to Raja&apos;s disappointment, was unmoved. At home, too, while the film found a fanbase on DVD, not everyone saw the commercial potential. In the meantime, Refn had agreed to Preston&apos;s idea of their own remake, set in London. It would be a mistake to see him as an innocent among moneymen. By his own account, his career began at 21, when his uncle \u2013 then owner of Denmark&apos;s biggest arthouse distributor \u2013 recruited him to scout for films at Cannes. &quot;That was my education,&quot; he says. &quot;I never approached film-making as an art. I saw it as what sells.&quot; For most of the remake&apos;s production, he was in Bangkok making his next film, cop thriller Only God Forgives. But his involvement went much further than the executive producer&apos;s typical role of turning up for the premiere. The choice of writer \u2013 former TV producer Matthew Read \u2013 was his. He and Preston together picked director Luis Prieto, a Spanish maker of Italian romantic comedies. The budget was set at $1m (\u00a3623,000) \u2013 a sum Preston says ensured fidelity to the tone of the original, but which must also have relaxed the accountants.     Kim Bodnia as Frank in Nicolas Winding Refn's original Pusher. Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive    Fighting jetlag in an east London bar, Prieto describes Refn&apos;s role in the new Pusher as &quot;like God \u2013 usually invisible, but always there&quot;. Casting decisions, he says, were collaborative \u2013 hiring ex-model Agyness Deyn as Frank&apos;s stripper girlfriend Flo was an idea put to him by the producers, but one he gladly accepted. Once he did, he insisted neither she nor co-star Richard Coyle should watch the original film, ensuring the only principal actor who had seen it had also starred in it \u2013 Buric, returning as Milo after coaxing from Refn. Prieto says he made his movie with two goals \u2013 to create something more stylised than the original and to foreground the character of Flo. On those terms, he succeeds. Deyn is a vivid presence, while $1m buys you a lot of slickness in 2012. And if the remake does sometimes make you pine for the Pusher you saw back in 1997, the truth \u2013 expressed politely but without apology by all concerned \u2013 is that it&apos;s not really for you: &quot;Luis&apos;s version is for a new audience,&quot; Preston says. &quot;So many people won&apos;t have seen the original. If you&apos;re 20 now, you were five when it came out.&quot; Similarly, if there were fears that setting Pusher in London might taint the film with geezerism, in fact the remake feels strikingly little like London. Shot in Stoke Newington, the standard-issue urban backdrops could often be anywhere. For Preston, hiring a director with no connection to the capital was deliberate \u2013 the result of a desire not to make &quot;one of those British crime movies we see too often&quot;. But in a global film market there may be other benefits \u2013 giving an international audience the hint of local flavour without enough of it to scare them off. This way, it seems, lies the future. Because rather than their remake ending the Pusher story, Refn and Preston see it as the start of a new chapter \u2013 or chapters. A working model is ready to go \u2013 Refn matching up a character, a city and a skeletal story, before the two men then find writers and directors to make the movie. So next will be a sequel to the remake \u2013 not, to be clear, a remake of the sequel \u2013 following Deyn as Flo to a new life in Las Vegas. Then it will once more be the turn of the tireless Buric, though Refn is unsure where to put him: &quot;Zlatko could go anywhere. Maybe Tokyo.&quot; Asked how many Pushers he might ultimately father, he pauses. &quot;At one point I wanted to do 10,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ll keep going until the ideas run out.&quot; He sips his cappuccino. &quot;So far they never have.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Indeed, this was less a book launch with wine-sipping literati than a raucous anti-Zuma rally attended by top dissidents Tokyo Sexwale, Mathews Phosa and rebels from the ANC youth league."], "tags": ["South Africa", "Jacob Zuma", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-12T07:37:25Z", "title": "South African deputy president's book launch turns into anti-Zuma rally", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/south-african-deputy-book-zuma", "article": "There are two gestures now essential to understanding South African politics. One is a rolling hand motion as practised by football fans when calling for a player to be substituted. The player they want yanked off is the president, Jacob Zuma. The other is the cupping of a hand at a downward angle to represent a shower head \u2013 a mocking reference to Zuma&apos;s six-year-old gaffe about showering after having sex with an HIV-positive woman, of which the cartoonist Zapiro constantly reminds him. Both these gestures were prominent, accompanied by much singing and stomping, at Thursday night&apos;s launch of the authorised biography of Kgalema Motlanthe, Zuma&apos;s deputy and his only credible challenger in an African National Congress (ANC) leadership contest in December. Indeed, this was less a book launch with wine-sipping literati than a raucous anti-Zuma rally attended by top dissidents Tokyo Sexwale, Mathews Phosa and rebels from the ANC youth league. In the absence of US-style presidential debates in South Africa (Zuma v Thabo Mbeki a few years ago would have been an amusing clash of styles), this was the closest thing the rank and file could get to a proper look at Motlanthe. For it could be argued that Motlanthe&apos;s principal strength in the presidential race is that he isn&apos;t Zuma. The 63-year-old is a private man and opaque politician; few voters would be able identify a clear Motlanthe agenda. He is the tabula rasa on to which the &quot;anyone but Zuma&quot; campaign can project their hopes and, perhaps, wishful thinking. The publication of his biography, therefore, risks letting in daylight upon magic. At the launch in the great hall at Johannesburg&apos;s Wits University, Ray Hartley, editor of the Sunday Times, said: &quot;I think this book does introduce South Africa to Kgalema Motlanthe for the first time. &quot;It does give us our first detailed picture of the deputy president. Those of us in the fourth estate have been scratching around to try to work out who is the man who was the third president of South Africa.&quot; Third president? Yes, Motlanthe was a kind of caretaker president for seven months after Mbeki was ousted and before Zuma won the 2009 general election. But president he was. The record will always show that he wore the crown and so does my memory. On my first day covering Africa for the Guardian, I attended a press conference with President Motlanthe specifically for foreign journalists (more than three years later, we are still waiting for Zuma to do the same). In fact, South African journalists mining advance copies of the biography are yet to come up with a blockbuster revelation. There have been tales about Motlanthe saving Zuma from expulsion from the party, Motlanthe disagreeing with the decision to expel the youth leader Julius Malema and Motlanthe expressing discontent over various government failings. But still little to fire up voters either way. &quot;The man is truly a biographer&apos;s delight,&quot; the author, the former trade unionist Ebrahim Harvey, told the audience on Thursday night, implying that Motlanthe will not be losing much sleep over its contents. Harvey said he had spent almost 200 hours with the politician over three years (adding that Mbeki only gave his biographer 45 hours). &quot;He decided to open up his mind both personally and politically in this biography,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a very courageous step.&quot; Motlanthe is a man with nothing to hide, he continued. Even when a newspaper falsely claimed that Motlanthe was having an affair with a 24-year-old, not once was he &quot;morose, dejected, looking troubled&quot;, but instead showed &quot;amazing fortitude&quot;. Harvey insisted that the timing of the book&apos;s publication, just two months before the leadership election in Mangaung, was pure coincidence. But then he took a swipe at the ANC over its response to the deadly unrest sweeping the country&apos;s mines. &quot;The ANC pretence that we don&apos;t have a social crisis in this country is quite ridiculous. In that respect the timing for me is much more important than Mangaung.&quot; Next up was the man himself \u2013 like Zuma, a former inmate on Robben Island. Motlanthe was, as ever, charming and cerebral but not exactly charismatic. &quot;I thought a political biography has got to be written by someone who is going to be critical and make an assessment of the work we do, the positions we adopt and so on,&quot; he said. &quot;I did not want a book that is only about positive issues.&quot; He then told a story about a trip to Italy where he was impressed by a new teaching method. &quot;Things are always changing,&quot; he observed innocently, prompting the biggest roar of the night from a crowd that could see only the subtext of leadership elections. Motlanthe paused. Against whoops and whistles, he continued: &quot;For me the irony is already lost because I&apos;m talking about \u2026 This is science. It&apos;s not about names of places. I can see that you are trapped within the geographic names of Mangaung (where the leadership election will take place). There are many other important things about Mangaung than just the ANC elective conference.&quot; He ended on a somewhat sombre note. &quot;I&apos;ve told my comrade Trevor [Manuel, the planning minister], in my will, I leave very clear instructions when I pass, my obituary or tombstone \u2013 if anybody believes I deserve a tombstone \u2013 should say: &apos;Others made suggestions and he implemented.&apos;&quot; Which, in the ranks of political epitaphs, is never going to challenge Abraham Lincoln or Winston Churchill. That apart, we still didn&apos;t learn much about the man who would be king (again). The wild cheers seemed to be driven more by out-with-the-old desperation than desire for the new. &quot;More bloody riddles from the masters of spin, smoke, mirrors and obfuscation,&quot; remarked one journalist on the way out. &quot;What does this guy really stand for except ABZ \u2013 anyone but Zuma?&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Speaking at the Institute of International Finance in Tokyo, Tucker said it was necessary to guarantee that taxpayers would escape paying again to bailout banks.", "Nobuyuki Hirano, president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said a taxpayer bailout should remain in the armoury of regulators."], "tags": ["Banking reform", "Banking", "Financial sector", "Business", "Bank of England", "Paul Tucker"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-12T10:17:02Z", "title": "Another bank bailout would spark 'uncontainable' backlash \u2013 Paul Tucker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/12/bank-bailout-uncontainable-backlash-paul-tucker", "article": "Bankers risk an &quot;uncontainable&quot; political backlash unless they agree to wide-ranging reforms to the financial sector, the favourite candidate to become the next Bank of England governor has said. Paul Tucker, currently its deputy governor, warned that without structural reforms that limit the cost of breaking up failing banks and prevent taxpayer bailouts, bankers would find themselves with few defences against an angry public. Tucker made his comments on Friday in response to demands from senior bankers at an international banking conference that regulators relax strict rules designed to prevent a repeat of the Lehman Brothers crash in 2008. A senior Japanese bank executive said taxpayers should remain on the hook for losses in the event of a crisis, while the one of the top brass at Deutsche bank argued that plans to ringfence the casino arms of major banks from their retail operations would make them less efficient and raise costs for customers. Speaking at the Institute of International Finance in Tokyo, Tucker said it was necessary to guarantee that taxpayers would escape paying again to bailout banks. &quot;The objective is to get to a point where public money is not used. If there was to be another financial crisis, once we have got through this one, and there was a need to bail out the banks, I think the backlash would be uncontainable,&quot; he said. Tucker was joined by Thomas Hoenig, a regulator on the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who said many major banks were too big to fail and needed to be broken up. The debate highlights the battle going on behind the scenes at meetings of regulators as they seek to agree rules for global bank regulation. The US has passed the Dodd-Frank Act, while the UK plans to bring in new laws based on a report by Sir John Vickers, who is also understood to have applied to succeed Sir Mervyn King as Bank of England governor. The EU is readying to push through new supervisory rules, though is only just considering a report that considers how to break up banks. Tucker said he believed it was possible for regulators to sit down with senior bankers and agree a method to re-finance them from private sources when they get into trouble, but they must accept public funds are off limits. Nobuyuki Hirano, president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said a taxpayer bailout should remain in the armoury of regulators. He said that without the possibility of taxpayer funds being used to re-finance banks, regulators were tying one arm behind their backs. Anshu Jain, co-chairman of Deutsche&apos;s management board, said attempts to ringfence the activities of banks would raise their costs and hit efficiency. Last night another frontrunner to become governor, Lord Turner, criticised the financial sector&apos;s conduct in the runup to the financial crisis in 2008. &quot;In retrospect, it was a fool&apos;s paradise \u2013 the band playing oblivious to the dangers ahead,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of apparently very clever people got it very wrong and the ordinary citizen suffered. We have to do better in future.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["What more do you want?\u2022 NEO Bankside, 50 Holland Street, London SE1, until 21 October William Klein and Daido MoriyamaGritty urban photography of New York and Tokyo.\u2022 Tate Modern, London SE1, until 20 January 2013 Masterpiece of the week     Photograph by kind permission of the trustees of the Wallace Collection    Jean-Honore Fragonard, The SwingThis tease of a painting defines an entire way of life \u2013 the exuberant and licentious culture of the French upper classes before the revolution."], "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Photography", "Frieze art fair 2012", "Frieze art fair", "William Klein", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-12T11:27:31Z", "title": "Frieze, funfair photography and Haiti's story \u2013 the week in art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/12/frieze-art-fair-haiti-week-art", "article": "Exhibition of the week: Kafou \u2013 Haiti, Art and Vodou The popular art of Haiti is rich and compelling.

Coming only days after the International Monetary Fund downgraded the growth forecasts for the majority of developed countries, including the UK, Osborne&apos;s view chimes with most policy-makers across the world. He said: &quot;There is less of an immediate sense of crisis at these meetings than there was at last year&apos;s annual meetings, but there is a greater concern about what lurks behind the next corner, a greater concern about the medium-term risks.&quot; The IMF has warned the US, Europe and Japan that a lack of action to refashion the financial system in the wake of the banking crisis has created problems for the future. In a report earlier this week it said the actions of the European Central Bank had lifted the immediate prospect of a eurozone country going bankrupt, but that risks remain next year unless there are moves to spur growth. Osborne said: &quot;You have the eurozone, the looming US fiscal cliff and an emerging market slowdown as triple threats to global recovery. &quot;What has been stressed at these meetings in Tokyo is the importance of delivery in all these areas: in the eurozone, delivering an effective implementation of what has been talked about; in the US, resolving the problem after the election of the fiscal cliff; and in emerging markets, continuing the structural reforms and openness that they require.&quot; Osborne is under pressure to relax Britain&apos;s austerity programme after more than two years of low or no growth. Economists expect to see the UK economy exit recession when GDP figures appear later this month, though the overall trend will remain flat. The IMF has given the UK the green light to delay some austerity measures in favour of a boost to investment and tax cuts. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the IMF&apos;s analysis that austerity measures could be more damaging for the economy than previously assumed gives Osborne the excuse he needs should he miss his deficit reduction targets later this month. &quot;This seems to give the go-ahead to the chancellor to defer some of his spending cuts until the economy is stronger,&quot; she said. The IMF calculated the impact of tax rises and spending cuts could lead to bigger reductions in GDP, effectively doing more harm than good to the economy and forcing the government to borrow more. Osborne is expected to miss his borrowing target for 2012-13 by as much as \u00a325bn after a fall in tax revenues and a rise in social security costs linked to high unemployment. He hinted in his speech to the Tory party conference earlier in the week that the global slowdown could encourage him to be more flexible in his approach. But at the IMF meeting he repeated his stance that countries needed to push ahead with spending cuts and structural reforms, saying: &quot;In general, western countries face a sink or swim question which the prime minister posed or, as he also put it, do or decline. &quot;In UK we are doing rather than declining. We are confronting our problems and the reforms that are required and tackling our debts.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Leading the current wave is Mamoru Hosoda, who follows up his Summer Wars with werewolf family saga Wolf Children, while Studio Ghibli&apos;s From Up On Poppy Hill remembers 1960s Tokyo."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-12T23:05:39Z", "title": "This week's new film events", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/13/this-weeks-new-film-events", "article": "Green Screen: Irish Film Distilled, Belfast     The Snapper.

Lord Turner, who heads the Financial Services Authority, said with hindsight the banks were left in a weak state despite the billions of pounds pumped into them by the government after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. With higher capital reserves, the banks would be in a position to maintain bigger buffers against the shocks from the UK&apos;s slide back into recession and the difficulties faced by countries in the eurozone, he argued. A bigger bailout would have taken the taxpayer&apos;s ownership of Royal Bank of Scotland to 100% and pushed up the current 43% shareholding in Lloyds Banking Group. It may also have resulted in Barclays, Santander and HSBC being forced to accept taxpayer funds. &quot;Looking back, and with the benefit of what we know now, I would have recommended UK banks have a higher level of capital and a boost to the counter-cyclical buffers they needed for the coming recession,&quot; he said. Speaking at a debate on the regulation of financial markets in Tokyo, Turner made it clear he believes the UK&apos;s major banks remain too weak to increase lending at a time when the economy remains fragile. &quot;The recovery from recession has been far slower than most commentators and all official forecasts anticipated in 2009. &quot;That reflects our failure to understand just how powerful are the deflationary effects created by deleveraging in the aftermath of financial crises. &quot;When credit booms turn to bust \u2013 as we know from Japan throughout the 1990s \u2013 private-sector deleveraging can have powerful deflationary effects, and conventional policy levers lose power,&quot; he said. Last week it emerged that the FSA loosened capital rules on British banks, freeing up funds for lending to businesses and households that would otherwise have been set aside for capital reserves. Without recourse to further taxpayer funds, banks must freeze lending unless they are given leeway to use their reserves by the regulator. It is understood that Sir Mervyn King, the central bank&apos;s governor, argued for a bigger bailout at the time of the Lehman&apos;s crash because he felt banks were under-capitalised. The Obama administration is credited with putting into operation the most comprehensive bank bailout and being rewarded with a rapid return to growth. The US has also avoided a second recession, unlike the UK and many other European countries. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were among many major banks forced to take government funds to reassure the markets, which they have all since paid back. Figures this week show the US housing market recovering and a strong jump in consumer confidence. Turner, who has applied to succeed King as governor, is garnering a reputation for saying the unsayable. Addressing an audience of financial services executives at the Bretton Woods conference in Tokyo, he said policymakers should be ready to design more innovative ways to kickstart the flatlining economy. Turner has supported the Bank of England&apos;s policy of quantitative easing, which has pumped \u00a3375bn into the economy but, like many senior officials, he is concerned that its effectiveness is waning."}, {"sentences": ["The economy isn&apos;t suffering from government borrowing but a severe lack of demand that only the government can fix.&quot; Osborne told reporters in Tokyo that the IMF does not allow for the boost provided to growth by the Bank of England&apos;s \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing."], "tags": ["Financial crisis", "George Osborne", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Christine Lagarde", "Economics", "Financial sector", "Financial policy committee", "Government borrowing", "Business", "UK news", "Austerity"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-13T20:08:31Z", "title": "George Osborne's austerity is costing UK an extra \u00a376bn, says IMF", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/13/imf-george-osborne-austerity-76bn", "article": "George Osborne&apos;s drastic deficit-cutting programme will have sucked \u00a376bn more out of the economy than he expected by 2015, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund of the price of austerity. Christine Lagarde, the IMF&apos;s managing director, last week caused consternation among governments that have embarked on controversial spending cuts by arguing that the impact on economic growth may be greater than previously thought. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility implicitly used a &quot;fiscal multiplier&quot; of 0.5 to estimate the impact of the coalition&apos;s tax rises and spending cuts on the economy. That meant each pound of cuts was expected to reduce economic output by 50p. However, after examining the records of many countries that have embraced austerity since the financial crisis, the IMF reckons the true multiplier is 0.9-1.7. Calculations made for the Observer by the TUC reveal that if the real multiplier is 1.3 \u2013 the middle of the IMF&apos;s range \u2013 the OBR has underestimated the impact of the cuts by a cumulative \u00a376bn, more than 8% of GDP, over five years. Instead of shaving less than 1% off economic growth during this financial year, austerity has depressed it by more than 2%, helping to explain why the economy has plunged into a double-dip recession. Labour seized on the IMF&apos;s intervention as a vindication of shadow chancellor Ed Balls&apos;s argument that the cuts programme is self-defeating. &quot;The IMF&apos;s analysis should be a wake-up call for David Cameron and George Osborne,&quot; said the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Rachel Reeves. &quot;It&apos;s time the prime minister and the chancellor listened to the evidence, accepted their plan isn&apos;t working and changed course.&quot; TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: &quot;The chancellor has repeatedly used the IMF as cover for his austerity strategy, despite warnings that deep spending cuts in the midst of a global turndown would make a bad situation worse. Now that the IMF has admitted spending cuts could hit the economy at least twice as hard as it previously thought, the government has all the evidence it needs to change course.&quot; Neal Lawson, director of left-wing pressure group Compass, said, &quot;the cuts were never going to work, but these calculations show the effect is bigger than anyone judged. The economy isn&apos;t suffering from government borrowing but a severe lack of demand that only the government can fix.&quot; Osborne told reporters in Tokyo that the IMF does not allow for the boost provided to growth by the Bank of England&apos;s \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. &quot;The point I would make about their study of the fiscal multipliers is that they explicitly say they were not taking into account offsetting monetary policy action. In the UK, I would argue we have a tough and credible fiscal policy to allow for loose and accommodative monetary policy and I think that is the right combination.&quot; But many economists believe the dent in growth caused by austerity policies may be larger than first thought, because the financial crisis has left banks starving firms and households of credit; and with many countries cutting back simultaneously, it is harder to fill the gap created by cuts with demand for exports. Former monetary policy committee member Danny Blanchflower said: &quot;In a way, the surprise is that it&apos;s taken everybody so long to work it out: Keynes knew it in the 1930s. This is the &apos;long, dragging conditions of semi-slump&apos;, and the multipliers are likely to be larger when you&apos;ve got banks that aren&apos;t lending and you&apos;re coming out of the longest recession in 100 years.&quot; Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said that the Treasury should have pumped even more into Britain&apos;s banks during the credit crisis to leave them in a stronger state. &quot;The recovery from recession has been far slower than most commentators and all official forecasts anticipated in 2009,&quot; he said. &quot;That reflects our failure to understand just how powerful are the deflationary effects created by deleveraging in the aftermath of financial crises.&quot; The OBR, set by Osborne to give an independent assessment of the economy, will publish a report on Tuesday explaining why it has consistently overestimated economic growth, and is expected to touch on the issue of whether the cuts are taking a greater-than-predicted toll. At its last forecast, in March, it predicted 0.8% growth this year; the IMF now expects the final figure to be -0.4%. \u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 14 October to add the word &quot;implicitly&quot; to clarify how the Office for Budget Responsibility used a &quot;fiscal multiplier&quot; to estimate the impact of the coalition&apos;s tax rises and spending cuts."}, {"sentences": ["But Christine Lagarde&apos;s intervention last week at the fund&apos;s annual meetings in Tokyo, where she warned the world&apos;s finance ministers against slashing public budgets too far, too fast, showed that in the topsy-turvy world of economics after the crunch, the most conservative institutions have sometimes been in the vanguard of the intellectual revolution."], "tags": ["Economics", "Global economy", "Christine Lagarde", "David Blanchflower", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-13T23:30:00Z", "title": "Despite the meltdown, economists  can't be prised from old thinking", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/14/nobel-prize-for-economics-models-forecasting", "article": "With its intimidating Washington headquarters and teams of crack young policy wonks jetting into troubled countries to read the riot act, the International Monetary Fund has a reputation as a bastion of economic orthodoxy. But Christine Lagarde&apos;s intervention last week at the fund&apos;s annual meetings in Tokyo, where she warned the world&apos;s finance ministers against slashing public budgets too far, too fast, showed that in the topsy-turvy world of economics after the crunch, the most conservative institutions have sometimes been in the vanguard of the intellectual revolution. In the midst of the deepest and longest-lasting economic malaise since the Great Depression, you might expect practitioners of economics to be wracked with self-doubt, academic departments from California to Cambridge sweeping away the old thinking that gave intellectual heft to the claims of City investment firms to be spreading risk and making the financial world a safer place. But as the Nobel committee prepares to announce this year&apos;s winner of the economic sciences laureate tomorrow, David Blanchflower, the US economist and former member of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee, says most people in the profession have sailed on unperturbed: &quot;Economics proceeds as if nothing has happened since 2008. Everybody&apos;s going on doing exactly the same things they always did, teaching the same classes.&quot; As for the forecasting record of many of the world&apos;s most eminent economic institutions, not least the Bank of England, he says, &quot;In many ways, we would have been better off to hire a monkey to throw darts at a dartboard.&quot; The Bank, as well as the independent office for budget responsibility established by George Osborne, and the vast majority of thinktanks and City forecasters, failed to anticipate the severity of the Great Recession, and the painstaking nature of the recovery. Yet many economists persist in clinging to their cherished mathematical constructions of the world, simply postponing the upturn each quarter when confronted with the reality that it has failed to materialise. And few have conceded that some of the fundamental tenets of their work \u2013 that individuals are perfectly rational, or markets always clear at the right price \u2013 need to be junked. There are islands of resistance. Two former winners of the economics Nobel, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, have used their prominence as public intellectuals over the past five years to issue repeated rebukes to policymakers for failing to grasp the scale of the crisis, and take sufficiently radical action to protect the economy from the worst ravages of the downturn. Maverick thinkers such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of Black Swan, whose latest book, Antifragile, on the fragility of systems, was cited by Sir Mervyn King in a speech last week, have sought to popularise the fact that model-based, mathematised economics is based on fundamental misunderstandings of the world. But Krugman and Stiglitz were already well-established as radicals, with strong sympathies for the Keynesian analysis that premature public spending cuts would inflict untold damage. The IMF&apos;s shift, from cheerleading for austerity to advocating a gentler approach, shows just how much old orthodoxies are crumbling in the face of the facts. Five years after the onset of the crisis, the eurozone is on the brink of collapse and the UK is mired in a double-dip recession, despite embracing drastic deficit cuts. Eric Beinhocker is the executive director of Oxford&apos;s Institute for New Economic Thinking, part of a transatlantic effort to rethink the basic tenets taught to students over recent decades. He says: &quot;The crisis has revealed enormous gaps in economists&apos; understanding of the linkages between the financial system and the broader economy. Before the crisis, few economists would have predicted that trouble in an obscure corner of the US mortgage market could cascade into a global calamity.&quot; He argues that there is lots of work going on to address these shortcomings, but &quot;some advocate tweaking existing models, while others feel a more radical rethink is needed&quot;. Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, falls into the latter camp. He&apos;s a fierce critic of the government&apos;s deficit-cutting strategy. But he says that in microeconomics \u2013 the bottom-up study of individual firms and markets \u2013 it would be wrong to throw the baby out with the bathwater. &quot;I don&apos;t think the crisis tells us much about the fundamental underpinnings of microeconomics,&quot; he says. However, he believes where economists failed was in assuming that finance worked just like any other market: &quot;When it came to financial companies, it turned out we needed to think about them completely differently. More markets are not necessarily better.&quot; He adds that one lesson economists may need to learn is to be more humble about the predictive power of their economic models, however neat and precise the mathematics that underlies them. Complex mathematical equations have replaced what Blanchflower calls &quot;the economics of walking about,&quot; as the foundation of the modern subject. Lord Skidelsky, economic historian and biographer of Keynes, agrees: &quot;It may be that there&apos;s no perfect model, and that the quest for one is an error. Maybe we need different models, different theories, for different situations, and that&apos;s the best we can do. Keynes said economics was a moral science, not a natural science \u2013 by which I mean that it has to take into account the variability of human situations.&quot; In other words, economics is not physics, because people are by their nature unpredictable. No one is going to discover an economic &quot;God particle&quot; that explains why someone decides to sell their house, hire an extra worker or buy a new car. &quot;There&apos;s no new paradigm; and perhaps the search for one is a bit misguided.&quot; As for tomorrow&apos;s Nobel prize, Skidelsky says it may tell us more about passing intellectual fads than fundamental truths about the economic world. &quot;My general feeling is that Nobel prizes in economics very closely follow current fashions in the discipline.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["All the chatter at the IMF&apos;s annual meeting in Tokyo last week was of this &quot;scientific&quot; study carried out by IMF economists on the effects of austerity."], "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Economics", "Banking", "European banks", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Euro", "Europe", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T13:52:15Z", "title": "Letting Greece off the hook is a moral issue for many Germans", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/14/debt-crisis-eu", "article": "When shopaholics find all their credit cards are maxed out and they&apos;ve lost their job they only have two options. They can stare into the middle distance while all their possessions are taken away one by one, or they can contact their creditors. It is always better to find a go-between such as Citizens Advice, which can arbitrate and will usually persuade angry lenders that a customer who loses their job cannot pay all the money back. The International Monetary Fund rejected the intermediary role in the aftermath of the financial crisis. When, in 2010, euroland&apos;s most indebted shopaholic, Greece, found itself without enough income to cover debt payments, the IMF sided with her creditors. It told Athens to repay the lot in a scheme arranged by Germany, France and the other northern European creditor countries that backed the deal. However, once the IMF joined as a creditor in this new repayment programme, it realised officials had made a serious miscalculation. Greece had no money to pay back its debts. The Washington-based super-bank arranged a 50% write-down and told Germany to live with losses. Greece struggled on. This week the IMF in effect admitted that the debt programme for Greece has failed again. Greece needs more time, it said, which is another way of saying there is no way it can repay its debts, which continue to climb. With pressure mounting on Greece day by day, the IMF produced a general rule that appeared from nowhere as a balm to a raging sore: it said spending cuts and tax rises, when implemented in a short space of time and under pressure from international money markets, can backfire spectacularly. All the chatter at the IMF&apos;s annual meeting in Tokyo last week was of this &quot;scientific&quot; study carried out by IMF economists on the effects of austerity. Germany was livid (and UK finance minister George Osborne was not best pleased either). Here was an examination that appeared to prove that British-style austerity, replicated across Europe at the behest of the Germans, was reducing GDP and making governments borrow more money, not less. Questions about the veracity of the report&apos;s findings occupied many debates. Nevertheless, the IMF stood by its theme that hastily implemented austerity hurts and switched back from its role as joint enforcer to sympathetic adviser. Sparking a furious row in Brussels, the IMF is understood to be insisting that Greece&apos;s eurozone creditors and the European Central Bank write off another \u20ac30bn (\u00a324bn) to close the latest funding gap in the Greek rescue plan. For many Germans, letting Greece off the hook is a moral issue. After years of self-imposed austerity, Europe&apos;s biggest exporter is upset that when others are asked to go through the same pain they opt out. For the average Christian Democratic Union supporting German, the shopaholic is to blame. But everyone who borrows money must find a willing lender. And that lender must consider a number of risks, including that the borrower will turn out to be incompetent with money, reckless or unfortunate. Mario Draghi, the boss of the European Central Bank, said at the conclusion of the IMF conference that creditors and borrowers must share the blame. (It is for comments like these that he is suspected by German rightwingers of being a closet socialist. Draghi and other pragmatic, practically minded European policymakers have pressed for a banking union and cross-border supervision to share the debts among member states. Yet it is a kind of subterfuge that allows banks to be given the money they need supposedly without the eurozone&apos;s richer citizens (the Germans, Dutch, Austrians and Finns) noticing. The reasoning is that banks remain the biggest problem for Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which are in deep trouble largely because of the colossal bank debts built up after the crash. A banking union will allow institutions to be refinanced from the centre without governments needing to put a hand in their pocket. A move like this sidesteps the moral argument over who deserves a bailout. Angela Merkel, who is nothing if not a practical politician, can see the numbers cannot add up on a Greek deal unless payments are delayed and for that reason she has fallen in behind Draghi, agreed the banking union and giving more time to Greece. Her visit to Athens last week was all about showing to the right wing of her party and the free market FDP, who are in her coalition and run the foreign ministry, that Greece will remain a euro member whatever the circumstances. Writing off more Greek debt is problematic after she, like most European policymakers, promised that the latest \u20ac130bn of loans was the last word. Hence the need to battle with the IMF. At the moment the banking union is her preferred vehicle. The question now is whether a banking union and more Greek debt forgiveness can haul the eurozone out of its hole and restore confidence and growth. According to Ollie Rehn, the commissioner in charge of economic affairs, it is the cornerstone of recovery. But this conjuring trick could create as many problems as it solves. In Britain, it must galvanise the eurosceptic voter, especially when the EU attempts to include the 10 non-members of the eurozone, including Britain, in the banking union. If Brussels finds a legal formula that allows Britain and Sweden to stay outside the banking union but inside the financial supervision structure, which is an EU construct, there will still be a fight over shifting funds from rich to poor under the guise of the new finance act. What will Ukip say? That the EU is seeking greater powers to steal the money of rich nations to deal with the feckless Spanish and Greeks. It&apos;s got to be a reasonably safe bet. Many other perfectly sane Europeans, with more muscle through their PR voting systems, will agree. There is the promise from Brussels of more powers for the EU parliament to counter this threat. Maybe. It is understandable that policymakers are fixed on solving economic problems, But if the cost is democracy, then it will be angry, unruly politics that unravels the deal."}, {"sentences": ["So with his mobile phone turned off flying back from the International Monetary Fund summit in Tokyo, I hope our chancellor has taken the time to reflect."], "tags": ["Economic policy", "George Osborne", "Public sector cuts", "Politics", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economics", "World news", "UK news", "Austerity"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T17:16:13Z", "title": "George Osborne is still in denial over his failing strategy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/14/george-osborne-denial-imf-downgrade", "article": "There&apos;s nothing like a long-haul flight to give you time to think. So with his mobile phone turned off flying back from the International Monetary Fund summit in Tokyo, I hope our chancellor has taken the time to reflect. Because this weekend&apos;s IMF gathering has marked a significant turning point in the debate about austerity in Britain and around the world \u2013 however much our chancellor tries to pretend otherwise. Over the past two years, George Osborne and David Cameron have increasingly seemed in deep denial, desperate to pretend things are going to plan when everyone else can see their strategy is badly off track. Now even the IMF has concluded that deep tax rises and spending cuts will have a much more negative impact on economies than it previously thought.Or, to use the economic jargon, that the &quot;fiscal multiplier&quot; has been much higher in the aftermath of the global crash. Of course, two years ago, the IMF was one of the strongest supporters of Osborne&apos;s plan A. But it has been inching towards a new view for many months. A year ago, when forecasting growth of 1.6% in the UK in 2012, it said that if things turned out worse the government should adopt a plan B of temporary tax cuts and extra infrastructure investment. Twelve months on, with its forecast down to minus 0.4%, Britain in a double-dip recession and borrowing on the rise to pay for the mounting costs of economic failure, there can be no question that action to kickstart the economy is urgently needed. Will Osborne listen? Sadly, politicians in denial usually claim that nothing has really changed. That&apos;s why the chancellor has spent the weekend insisting he is at one with the IMF on the need for a credible deficit reduction plan. The problem is there is nothing credible about a plan that leads to a double-dip recession and rising borrowing. The central political and economic debate remains not over whether to get the deficit down, but over the best way to do so. And with this new evidence from the IMF it is clearer than ever that action on growth and a steadier and more balanced deficit reduction plan would be more successful in getting borrowing down over the medium term and preventing long-term economic damage. In these circumstances, the reckless thing to do is simply to press on regardless. The sensible thing would be for the chancellor to accept the IMF&apos;s revised estimates and announce action to stimulate the economy now. That is why I proposed using the funds raised from the imminent auction of the 4G mobile phone spectrum to build 100,000 more affordable homes, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, alongside temporary tax cuts to kickstart growth. Of course, politicians in denial also pretend things are better than they seem. The government will doubtless take false comfort from next week&apos;s GDP figures. With billions of pounds of Olympics TV rights and 18 months of ticket sales all counted in this quarter, we should finally emerge from the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. But that one-off boost, no matter how big it is, should not breed complacency. Even if growth was 1% last quarter, as some are expecting, our economy will simply be the same size as a year ago. The major question is what level of growth can be generated in future quarters and, crucially, whether we can ever catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years. A further denial tactic is to try to change the subject. That is why ministers at the Conservative and Liberal Democrat conferences merely wanted to talk about further cuts to be made in 2015. But the only reason for that debate is that a failing plan and no growth means the government&apos;s promise to balance the books by the next election looks set to be broken, and by some margin. The longer this stagnation continues, the bigger the fiscal challenges we will face. So the most vital debate now is why the government&apos;s plan has not worked and what we need to do by 2015 to get our economy back on track. Tragically, I fear the Treasury will simply bat away the new estimates from the IMF, and Britain will be left with a chancellor in denial, trapped by a failing plan, and dragging the country down with him.

That can rarely have seemed more true than on Sunday when Andy Murray came within a whisker of winning the Shanghai Masters title for the third time only for Novak Djokovic to snatch it from his grasp. Five times he stood at match point against the man he defeated to win his first grand slam title at last month&apos;s US Open, and five times the Serb dashed his hopes with nerveless, courageous tennis. After three hours, 20 minutes of another scintillating contest, Murray was beaten 5-7, 7-6, 6-3. He looked livid. In the aftermath of his US Open victory, Murray had spoken about dealing with pressure and how he generally has no trouble finishing off matches. The irony was not lost on the Scot after he failed his task at 5-4 in the second set and after losing a tie-break of high quality and even higher drama, he was eventually worn down in the third set. &quot;I had been joking about when you talk so much about serving matches out, it&apos;s bound to happen at some stage [that you fail],&quot; Murray, the world No3, said. It was the second week in succession that he had lost from match point up \u2013 last week it was Milos Raonic in Tokyo who performed the great escape \u2013 but Djokovic hit four winners and on the fifth he forced a mistake from Murray. &quot;It&apos;s not like I threw the match away,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t make any real glaring errors or anything. When I had my chances, he just served very well and hit a couple of lines when he needed to.&quot; These two men do not deal in the mundane. Once Murray had immediately recovered an early break, they laid into each other, ripping returns and groundstrokes and turning each other&apos;s service games into a nightmare. The first set contained seven breaks but it was Murray who got the vital one for 6-5, prompting Djokovic to smash his racket in anger before the Scot served it out. Some of the shot-making was laughably good. As at the US Open, the two traded missiles from the baseline. As he had done against Roger Federer in the semi-finals, Murray&apos;s shots had that extra bite, with one forehand return clocked at an incredible 104mph. Murray broke for 4-3 in the second set with a brilliant passing shot and two games later he served for the match. It looked over when the Scot stood at 30-0 only for the match to turn on a moment of magic from the Serb. Chasing back a perfect lob from Murray, Djokovic chose to hit a between-the-legs shot \u2013 a &quot;tweener&quot; \u2013 which is usually the sign of desperation. It went in and after working his way into the rally, he hit a perfect drop shot to win the point. Djokovic responded with a raised fist and, revitalised, he broke back. Both men held to force a tiebreak and as in the first set of their US Open final, it was an epic. At 6-4, Murray looked home but for once the Scot dropped the ball short and was punished. Somehow, when his back is against the wall, Djokovic is able to produce his best, and four more times he saved match points with pure brilliance. Murray saved three set points himself but finally Djokovic clinched it 13-11 with a wrong-footing drive volley. This time Murray&apos;s racket took a beating and Djokovic looked the fresher. As the pain of being so close to victory spread to his body, the Scot tried to shorten the points but the Serb stayed strong and when Murray netted a forehand, he had the break for 4-3. Murray saved two match points with big serves but sent a backhand long to give Djokovic victory. The Serb is now almost certain to end the year ranked No1 and there is no denying that he will deserve it. Surely no one plays better when up against it and with so few ranking points to defend, he seems certain to overtake Federer. Murray must now decide whether it is wise to put himself through the rigours of scheduled events in Basle next week and then in Paris the following week before returning to London for the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. &quot;It was a disappointing one to lose,&quot; Murray said. &quot;[But] I&apos;ve lost tougher matches than that before in the biggest events. So I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll recover from it pretty well.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Discussions will be needed with the EU and, speaking to reporters in Tokyo at the IMF meeting, bank officials indicated they might argue to keep the branches."], "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Banking", "Business", "Banco Santander", "UK news", "Banks and building societies", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-15T08:07:36Z", "title": "RBS shares fall as Santander withdrawal hits branch valuation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/rbs-shares-fall-santander-branches", "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland shares slumped on Monday morning as analysts warned that the bailed out bank will have to accept a lower price for the 316 branches it had hoped to sell to Santander.

In a reversal of its insistence that nothing could have protected the plant against the earthquake and tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people on 11 March, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had known safety improvements were needed before the disaster, but had failed to implement them. &quot;When looking back on the accident, the problem was that preparations were not made in advance,&quot; Tepco&apos;s internal reform taskforce, led by the firm&apos;s president, Naomi Hirose, said in a statement on Monday. The company could have taken steps to prevent a catastrophic accident by adopting more extensive safety measures, the statement added. Tepco&apos;s about-turn came after an independent panel of experts challenged its claim that it could not have foreseen the up to 14m high waves that swept through the plant, knocking out its backup power supply and causing three of its six reactors to melt down. In a damning report released in July, a parliament-appointed panel criticised years of &quot;collusion&quot; between Tepco, industry regulators and politicians, and described the disaster as &quot;manmade&quot;. The crisis forced the evacuation of 150,000 residents, most of whom have yet to return home, and led Japan to announce it would end its reliance on nuclear energy, although it has since dropped its deadline to phase out atomic power by 2040. In a rare moment of introspection, an internal taskforce set up to reform the embattled utility said the firm feared that improvements in safety would highlight the risks to nuclear power plants and encourage the anti-nuclear lobby. &quot;There was a worry that if the company were to implement a severe-accident response plan, it would spur anxiety throughout the country and in the communities near where nuclear plants are sited, and lend momentum to the anti-nuclear movement,&quot; the report said. The firm conceded that some suggested safety improvements, such as using multiple power sources and cooling systems, would have required the plant&apos;s temporary closure and added to its costs. Acknowledging that previous safety measures were insufficient could have invited lawsuits, it added. The statement said the company should have adhered more closely to international safety standards for atomic facilities, and trained specialist staff in practical disaster response rather than relying on safety drills it dismissed as a &quot;formality&quot;. Tepco&apos;s admission that it was unprepared for the disaster came after the first meeting of an independent advisory committee set up to help the company reform its nuclear operations. &quot;It is very clear that mistakes were made,&quot; Dale Klein, the former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission and head of the reform committee, told reporters in Tokyo. &quot;It is very important for Tepco to recognise the need to reform, and the committee is very anxious to facilitate the reform necessary for Tepco to become a world-class company. &quot;The committee&apos;s goal is to ensure that Tepco develops practices and procedures so an accident like this will never happen again.&quot; Klein said individual workers at the plant would be expected to challenge the pervading culture of complacency over safety. &quot;The challenge that Tepco will have is establishing a culture so that every individual understands they are responsible for safety,&quot; he said. The report noted that Tepco had not made any safety improvements to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since 2002, and had dismissed the possibility of it being hit by a massive tsunami, even though it could not produce supporting data. It had, for example, insisted that Fukushima Daiichi&apos;s 5.7m seawall was high enough to withstand a tsunami generated by a large quake in the area, despite a warning in 2008 by its own engineers that much bigger waves were possible. Tepco repeated claims it had done everything possible to prevent a disaster as recently as July. Instead, it accused the prime minister at the time of the accident, Naoto Kan, of exacerbating the problem by interfering in the firm&apos;s response. Tepco has been forced to reform its management and operations after the government saved it from collapse in May, in effect nationalising it with a 1tn-yen bailout. Despite Japan&apos;s plan to phase out nuclear power, Tepco&apos;s 10-year business plan includes the need to restart idled reactors, beginning with those at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in northern Japan. But the company denied its admission of culpability and efforts at reform were intended to mollify the public ahead of a quick return to nuclear power generation. &quot;The reforms are intended to improve our safety culture, and we have no intention to link it to the possibility of resuming the [Kashiwazaki-Kariwa] plant,&quot; Takafumi Anegawa, a Tepco official, told the Associated Press. &quot;We don&apos;t have any preconditions for our reforms.&quot; The firm&apos;s efforts to restart other reactors received a boost from Barbara Judge, the former chair of the UK atomic energy authority, who said nuclear plants could operate safely \u2013 even in quake-prone countries such as Japan \u2013 provided the right safety measures were in place. &quot;It&apos;s a question of determination of the risks. It&apos;s a question of making sure that there is a plan for how to deal with the risks, or the problem, should they eventuate,&quot; Judge said."}, {"sentences": ["He had previously been based in Tokyo, where he was head of yen products, and Bloomberg reported he had allegedly instructed colleagues to lower Libor rates while in this position."], "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Libor", "Regulators", "Bob Diamond", "Financial Services Authority (FSA)", "Banking", "Business", "Financial sector", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-15T17:41:59Z", "title": "RBS suspends senior trader in Libor investigation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/rbs-suspends-trader-libor-investigation", "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended one of its most senior traders in London in the latest development in the Libor fixing scandal for which the bailed-out bank is bracing for a hefty fine. Jezri Mohideen was suspended last week, according to Bloomberg news agency, as head of rates trading for Europe and Asia Pacific. He had previously been based in Tokyo, where he was head of yen products, and Bloomberg reported he had allegedly instructed colleagues to lower Libor rates while in this position. RBS has fired four traders for attempting to manipulate Libor and other interest rates. They include Tan Chi Min, a senior trader in Singapore who is now suing the bank for wrongful dismissal. The case involving Tan has given rise to embarrassing allegations with the release of instant messages in which an RBS trader quips &quot;hahahah&quot; and describes Libor as a &quot;cartel&quot;. The bank would not comment on Mohideen, whose suspension comes as the bank awaits a fine from a number of regulatory bodies, including the Financial Services Authority, for its role in the Libor scandal, which has already led to the departure of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. RBS, 81% owned by the taxpayer, has also taken disciplinary action against a number of individuals involved in attempting to rig Libor while others have left of their own accord. A bank spokesman said: &quot;Our investigations into submissions, communications and procedures relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates are ongoing. RBS and its employees continue to cooperate fully with regulators&quot;. Bloomberg had spoken to Mohideen last month, when he told the news agency he had not pressurised colleagues into lowering the submissions to the Libor panel. The latest allegations in the Libor affair came as RBS shares fell 1% to 268p amid warnings from analysts that the bank would need to cut the price of the 316 branches it was going to sell to Santander for \u00a31.6bn. The sale, forced on RBS by Brussels as a result of the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, fell through on Friday after more than two years of negotiations and after \u00a34.5bn was pumped into Santander UK business by its Spanish parent. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: &quot;Assuming that an alternative sale is agreed, we now anticipate that RBS may ultimately settle for terms \u00a30.5bn to \u00a31.0bn worse than those agreed with Santander in August 2010.&quot; The bank said it will &quot;commence a new process of disposal&quot; and its chief executive, Stephen Hester, is understood to have received at least three phone calls from potentially interested parties over the weekend. Virgin Money, which took over Northern Rock at the start of the year, and venture capitalist JC Flowers are among those interested. But NBNK, the stock market-listed company created to bid for a bank, seems unlikely to enter the fray after its chief executive, Gary Hoffman, quit to join insurance company Hastings. Hoffman had joined NBNK from Northern Rock but failed to buy 632 branches being sold by Lloyds Banking Group. RBS is stressing that 98% of the work required to separate the branches has been done despite the delay to the sell-off, which must be completed in the next 15 months under the current timetable, which led to some speculation that the branches could be floated off. Analysts at Credit Suisse said that if RBS did not complete all the agreed divestment by the end of 2013, &quot;the UK government will appoint a trustee which will dispose of the businesses &apos;at no minimum price&apos;&quot;.

Click here to view trailer Discussing the Sundance sensation Beasts of the Southern Wild, the hottest thing to have come out of the bayou since Swamp Thing&apos;s own-brand Cajun sauce, the critic Tom Shone made an intriguing point recently. Writing for Intelligent Life, he called the film &quot;a howl-at-the-heavens ode to being child king, feet planted in the mud and mess of America, head filled with myth and magic&quot;. And he continued: &quot;Maybe that&apos;s the American genre now: magic realism. It used to be realism, at the movies as much as on the page, but the role of national chronicler has largely fallen to television these days.&quot; I&apos;ve already had a few thoughts myself in this column about the decline of American realism at the movies. But is Shone right? Could Southern Wild&apos;s thundering auroch hooves, the echoes of cataclysm in the mind of its six-year-old heroine, Hushpuppy, be beating a new path forward for US cinema towards magical realism? Shone has even been bold enough to coin a name \u2013 American exotic \u2013 to parcel up Southern Wild with Winter&apos;s Bone, and kindred films with a very topical interest in the country&apos;s hinterlands; &quot;a subtle but damning indictment, both of how broken-down America has gotten around its edges, but also of his just how foreign the country now seems, even to Americans,&quot; as he writes in another piece for Slate. That&apos;s not explicitly magical realism, though: the genre of fiction in which the fantastic shakes hands with the everyday. But setting Winter&apos;s Bone (which also has its roots in an older lineage of unruly backwoods forefathers such as Deliverance) aside, I think there have been signs in recent years that, surrounded by difficulties at home and abroad, America has turned from doing to thinking, and that its imagination is growing heavy to the point of overflowing; the emergence of a film like Southern Wild was only a matter of time. Generation X always had a fondness for surreal diversions and episodes of gentle, self-imposed exile from reality. And this spirit of pothead poesie \u2013 not too far from magical realism \u2013 has been breaking through with ever-greater frequency as Gen-Xers continue their directorial careers and get closer to the mainstream. To name a few examples: the quarry episode in Zach Braff&apos;s Garden State; the feeling in Monsters that the whole alien invasion was just a convenient backdrop of ephemeral wonder \u2013 like Lost in Translation&apos;s Tokyo \u2013 for its irritating lovers to conduct their Converse-sneakered romance; the quirky detours that are inevitably en route on any movie crush involving what has been christened the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Apr\u00e8s Zooey Deschanel, the deluge. The growth in the American imagination seems to be in inverse proportion to the country&apos;s inability to shape the world any longer, and fend off the overweening threats it&apos;s always been so good at conjuring up for itself. Keira Knightley and Steve Carell made it excruciatingly clear in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World that this ethic of flaky whimsy was now the only right-thinking way of dealing with apocalypse, and closer to mainstream thinking than ever. And what greater sign do you need that end times are nigh, and the natural order of things has been overturned, than the fact that Terrence Malick, whose voice-in-my-own-head narration and impressionistic style always situated him on the cusp of magical realism, has started pumping out almost a film a year? The patron saint of subjective experience has returned, and the imagination is ready to run riot. Beasts of the Southern Wild could be where these forces stampede into a full-blown magical realist movement: the film has had a lively critical whirling, and stands as good a chance of being an aesthetic game-changer as any. But there are no guarantees, either. Southern Wild can be read as some kind of response to a national mood of marginalisation and crisis \u2013 but if that&apos;s true it might equally result in an outbreak of films that refuse to let themselves be swept off towards unknown destinations, and instead try and shore up the fortifications of old, outdated tales: cue a multiplex full of Expendables clones. What&apos;s interesting about the possibility of magical realism flowering in North America is how much this species may differ from the original South American variety. South American magical realism also occupied the fringes, the marginal zones where the individual mind, not the consensus of the real, could rule. But in Latin American fiction, this often took place in a joyful, florid explosion of inner identity; from Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez to Like Water for Chocolate, indigenous fables and aromas burst through from a pre-colonial past through the hard paving of the Europeanised present. Beasts of the Southern Wild hollers exuberantly, but there&apos;s something frenzied about it as well. It&apos;s an intoxicated wake, as well as a celebration. American magical realism, if it comes to pass, could mean a retreat into the imagination, rather than a reunion with an inner self. America&apos;s golden-age protagonists \u2013 its chatty hacks, taciturn PIs and secretive dames, eyes always ahead \u2013 never had much time for the inner self. Hushpuppy, drunk on dreams of ancient creatures and impending floods as she searches for her lost mother, certainly has one, but it threatens to wash away the whole of reality in the film. Maybe the apocalypse is actually in Hushpuppy&apos;s head, the fever dreams of the dispossessed; maybe that&apos;s the real lesson magical realism has to offer America. The danger might have been building on the inside all along \u2013 Homeland&apos;s premise. But then that was always the risk for the nation that sold itself on a dream. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood is about how Bollywood markets itself abroad.

The suspects, named as Christopher Browning and Skyler Dozierwalker, both 23, were arrested after allegedly raping the woman as she walked home in the early hours of Tuesday. The alleged victim, who is in her 20s, later identified the sailors at an off-base housing complex, local media said. The two men, who are in Japanese police custody, had reportedly been drinking before the alleged incident. The case has come at a particularly sensitive time for relations between the US military and residents in Okinawa, which hosts more than half of the approximately 47,000 US military personnel in Japan. Lingering resentment at the large US military footprint on the island turned to anger recently following the controversial deployment earlier this month of 12 Osprey aircraft at Futenma, a marine corps base located in the middle of a densely populated city. &quot;This [the rape case] is the worst possible timing,&quot; Kyodo quoted an aide to the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, as saying, adding that Tokyo had lodged a strong protest with the US authorities. The US ambassador to Japan, John Roos, said in a statement: &quot;The United States government is extremely concerned by recent allegations of misconduct by two individual United States service members. &quot;We are committed to co-operating fully with the Japanese authorities in their investigation. These allegations, given their seriousness, will continue to command my full personal attention.&quot; A Pentagon spokesman said: &quot;The defence department takes all allegations involving misconduct by service members seriously wherever they may occur. &quot;The US navy in Japan is focused on co-operating and supporting the Okinawa police investigation.&quot; A spokesman for Okinawa prefecture said the alleged crime was &quot;unforgivable&quot; and had &quot;shocked all Okinawans&quot;. Recent protests against the US military have centred on the Osprey deployment. Residents claim accidents involving the MV-22 Osprey, including two last year, prove the aircraft is too dangerous to fly in built-up areas. The Japanese government, however, approved their deployment this summer after Washington attributed the accidents to pilot error rather than mechanical or design faults. The marines plan to deploy 24 Ospreys at Futenma by 2014. The Osprey&apos;s tilt-rotors enable it to take off and land like a helicopter and cruise like conventional aircraft. The US says the fleet at Futenma is needed to replace existing CH-46 transport helicopters and improve its ability to respond to security crises in the Asia-Pacific region amid growing concern over China&apos;s military buildup. Crimes by military personnel are a longstanding cause of tension in Okinawa, which hosts the majority of US bases in Japan. The 1995 abduction and rape of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen brought 85,000 people on to the streets in protest and forced Tokyo and Washington to discuss way to reduce the US military presence on the island. Those discussions led to an agreement to relocate the most contentious base, Futenma, but the move has been effectively ditched in the face of opposition from residents near the proposed new site along an unspoiled stretch of Okinawan coastline. In 2008, the then secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, was forced to apologise during an official visit to Tokyo following the arrest of a US marine for the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl in Okinawa. Opposition to US bases surged again in 2010 after the then prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, reneged on an election promise to move Futenma off the island altogether after failing to secure an alternative site. According to the public broadcaster NHK, seven US servicemen have been arrested on rape charges since Okinawa reverted to Japanese control 40 years ago."}, {"sentences": ["It is the absolute opposite of that.&quot; He added: &quot;If I dressed up as Godzilla, people would not accuse me of wanting to crush Tokyo myself.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857."], "tags": ["Daily Mirror", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Media", "Frankie Boyle", "Stage", "Media law", "Law", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Television", "Television industry", "Channel 4", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-17T13:56:27Z", "title": "Frankie Boyle denies peppering show with racist references", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/17/frankie-boyle-racist-references", "article": "Comedian Frankie Boyle has denied &quot;punctuating&quot; material with racist references or making &quot;gratuitous&quot; use of black people, in his libel trial at the high court.

Leaders from China, Japan and South Korea to Indonesia and the Philippines are desperate for the key eurozone countries to fashion a solution that makes life less traumatic and more conducive to trade. Asian nations have weathered the global economic crisis better than most, but concerns are growing that a prolonged European recession will start to take its toll, particularly if commodity prices continue to decline. Japan, which has embarked on a massive reconstruction effort after last year&apos;s tsunami, was expected to recover strongly, but European consumers have stopped spendingforcing down Tokyo&apos;s growth to 1.4% in the second quarter. China has also recorded a steep decline in demand for its goods, pushing down its usual double-digit growth rate to 7.8%. Of the two, Japan is more understanding towards Europe, although frustration is palpable when conversation with government officials turns to the question, &quot;what next for the eurozone?&quot;. One explanation for the diplomatic attitude could be found in Japan&apos;s application for a free trade deal with Europe. China has one and so does South Korea, but Japan has been slow off the mark. Criticism of European leaders could harm negotiations. Moreover, Japan is not well placed to lecture others about debt, with a debt-to-GDP ratio far worse than Greece, at about 200%. Chinese officials, on the other hand, have publicly raised concerns about the negative effects of the financial crisis in the west. Chief among Beijing&apos;s complaints is the west&apos;s reliance on cheap money printed by central banks. Chinese officials are also aghast at the perceived dithering by their European counterparts. &quot;The way the eurozone has handled the debt resolution issue has been more problematic,&quot; said Jin Liqun, chairman of the supervisory board at the China Investment Corporation. &quot;Too much time has been wasted on debates over the terms and conditions of piecemeal bailouts. Political leaders have been digging in on their own agendas, with their objectives pulling in different directions.&quot; He added: &quot;I&apos;m afraid to say that frailty, thy name is leadership&quot;. The European Central Bank has refused to follow the quantitative easing programmes of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, although it has supplied funds to local banks, which in turn have loaned the money to their governments. The expansion in the money supply has depressed the value of western currencies and raised the value of Asian currencies, China and Japan&apos;s among them, making their exports more expensive. Naohiro Yashiro, an economics professor at the International Christian University in Tokyo, says the Japanese and Chinese governments could easily support the eurozone by selling some of their loans to the US government and buying eurozone debt. &quot;Selling the dollar, and buying the Euro bond should be basically neutral to the exchange rate,&quot; he said. A switch from US Treasury bonds to bonds designed to support indebted countries would bring down borrowing costs and, arguably, give political leaders the confidence they need to reform the currency union and end the crisis. There would be the risk of leaving a safe haven (the US) for a risky project (propping up the euro) but it would be self-fulfilling such is the combined power of China and Japan. It would also prompt a surge in world trade, of which China and Japan would be the chief beneficiares. Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, supports plans to buy European bonds and effectively increase loans to the eurozone. Japan was one of the first to buy the rescue bonds launched by Brussels and the European Central Bank, although the $430m it committed is small compared to the size of the problem. But under the surface, Asia is focusing on the opportunities to be had \u2013 after hundreds of years of colonialism, buying Europe on the cheap is an opportunity not to be missed. The Chinese have busied themselves buying Greek, Italian and Portugese ports and utilities at knockdown prices.

A cross-party group of more than 60 politicians took part in an autumn festival at Yasukuni shrine on Thursday, following a similar visit on Wednesday by Shinzo Abe, the new leader of the Liberal Democratic party, who is widely tipped to become Japan&apos;s next prime minister. Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters in Beijing: &quot;Yasukuni shrine is a spiritual pillar used by Japanese militarism for its overseas aggression. It still enshrines class-A war criminals who owe victimised people heavy bloody debts. &quot;We urge the Japanese side to face squarely and reflect upon history and strictly abide by its solemn statements and pledges regarding historical issues, and face the international community in a responsible manner.&quot; The pilgrimages, made to coincide with the shrine&apos;s autumn festival, are expected to increase tensions between Japan and China, which are already embroiled in a dispute over territorial claims to the Senkakus, a group of islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu in China. The Yasukuni visit also drew an angry response from South Korea amid friction over ownership of the Takeshima \u2013 or Dokdo \u2013 islands, and renewed pressure on Japan to issue an official apology for its use of Korean women as sex slaves in frontline brothels during the war. Cho Tai-young, a South Korean foreign ministry spokesman, said the visit was &quot;an irresponsible act that ignores the sentiment of the peoples in neighbouring countries who suffered due to Japan&apos;s past imperialism&quot;, according to Kyodo News. &quot;The South Korean government calls on Japan&apos;s political leaders in a responsible position to look squarely at history with a humble attitude.&quot; Japan&apos;s chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, refused to condemn or support the lawmakers, who included the transport and postal reform ministers. &quot;A visit in a private capacity is a matter of the personal belief of individuals,&quot; Fujimura said. Yasukuni honours the 2.5 million Japanese to have died in wars since the second half of the 19th century. Among them are 14 class-A war criminals convicted by the Allies after the war, including Japan&apos;s wartime prime minister, Hideki Tojo, who was executed for war crimes in 1948. Many Koreans and Chinese view the shrine as a symbol of Japanese militarism, and visits by politicians as proof that Japan has yet to atone for its wartime conduct in parts of China and on the Korean peninsula. The group&apos;s leader, Makoto Koga, a former secretary general of the LDP, said the visits were being made in a private capacity and should not spark a diplomatic incident. &quot;Visiting Yasukuni shrine is an issue relating to the spirit of each lawmaker,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why neighbouring countries have such a hypersensitive reaction to it.&quot; Abe, who on Thursday repeated calls for the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to call a general election by the end of the year, said he had visited Yasukuni to &quot;pay my respects to the war dead who gave their lives for this country&quot;. But he declined to confirm if he would go to Yasukuni if he was elected prime minister: &quot;Given Japan&apos;s current relations with China as well as South Korea, I&apos;d better not say whether I would visit or not.&quot; A poll conducted by the Asahi Shimbun earlier this month found that 39% of voters would vote for Abe in an election, compared with 34% for Noda. Abe has recently expressed regret that he did not pay his respects at Yasukuni during his previous one-year term as prime minister from 2006, and has made several visits since.

Lingering resentment over atrocities committed during the second world war \u2013 and the perception that Japan has failed to show enough remorse for its actions \u2013 help explain the periodical outbreaks of anti-Japanese rage in the region, and the angry reactions to high-profile visits to Yasukuni, the controversial war shrine in Tokyo. &quot;Historical grievances in Korea do not depend on who is in charge in Japan,&quot; says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. &quot;They simmer on and on until every once in a while they boil over. Tokyo is living in a dream world if it believes that these matters are resolved and not worth addressing,&quot; he said. Earlier this week, South Korea repeated its demand that Japan acknowledge its use of former sex slaves and compensate them. &quot;Japan&apos;s legal responsibility has not been settled,&quot; the country&apos;s deputy chief envoy to the UN, Shin Dong-ik, told a UN committee. &quot;Those acts were a crime against humanity.&quot; Those grievances came to the fore again recently when South Korea&apos;s president, Lee Myung-bak, made a politically charged trip to Dokdo \u2013 a pair of remote, rocky islands also claimed by Japan, where they are known as Takeshima. The visit was not just intended to demonstrate his country&apos;s de facto control over the territory. Lee linked his visit to Tokyo&apos;s failure to apologise for the use of sex slaves, and challenged Japan&apos;s emperor, Akihito, to issue a mea culpa on the country&apos;s behalf. Japan retaliated last week by deciding not to renew a $57bn (\u00a335.5bn) currency swap with South Korea \u2013 a measure designed to protect both countries against financial crisis \u2013 although officials in Seoul and Tokyo said the decision was made on economic grounds and the territorial dispute was not a factor. Lee&apos;s remarks were in part a vote-winning exercise for his conservative Saenuri party before December&apos;s presidential election, but also proof that wartime history still weighs heavily on the South Korean national psyche \u2013 and finds voice in an enduring suspicion of Japan. There is disagreement on the exact number of women forced into prostitution by Japan. Campaigners believe between 50,000 and 200,000 women \u2013 mostly Koreans, but also Chinese, south-east Asians and a small number of Japanese and Europeans \u2013 were forced or tricked into working in military brothels between 1932 and 1945. Fearing ostracism in their own countries, most took their secret to the grave. But in 1991, Kim Hak-soon, a South Korean, became the first to testify about her wartime forced prostitution experiences in public. &quot;We must record these sins that were forced upon us,&quot; she said. Since then, more than 230 women have identified themselves as former sex slaves. Only about 60 are still alive. Eight, including Kang, live at the House of Sharing, a facility that opened in 1992 in the hills south of Seoul. The women, most of whom are in their 80s and 90s, say they have yet to receive an official apology or compensation from Japan over their treatment. The Japanese government initially denied the existence of &quot;comfort stations&quot;, as the brothels were known. But in 1993 Yohei Kono, the-then chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged and apologised for the first time for Japan&apos;s use of sex slaves during the second world war. Japan refused to directly compensate the women, saying all claims were settled by postwar peace treaties. In 1995 it set up the privately run Asian women&apos;s fund, which drew on donations, but many women rejected any redress unless it came directly from the Japanese state. The fund was disbanded in 2007. Kono&apos;s statement infuriated Japanese conservatives. They recently gained an ally in the country&apos;s supposedly progressive prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, who, despite conceding that individual testimony indicated the coercion of Asian women into sexual slavery, claimed no documentary evidence existed. His main opponent in the next general election, the Liberal Democratic party leader, Shinzo Abe, has even called for the Kono statement to be revised. The spread of frontline brothels followed the Japanese imperial army&apos;s sweep through large parts of China and south-east Asia. As colonial ruler of the Korean peninsula since 1910, Japan had easy access to local women, targeting poor, uneducated and single females aged between 13 and 19. On display in a museum near the women&apos;s residence are photographs, documents and exhibits that shed light on their wretched existence before they were abandoned by fleeing Japanese troops at the end of the war. Typically, they were forced to have sex with 10 to 30 men a day in dimly lit rooms furnished only with beds. Condoms were washed and re-used and offered little protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Medical examinations were infrequent, and many women became addicted to the mercury 606 used to treat syphilis. Forced abortions were commonplace. Surprisingly, the Japanese comprise about two-thirds of the estimated 15,000 people who visit the House of Sharing every year. In the past, the residents were happy to meet members of the public, but in recent weeks some have refused to talk to Japanese visitors. &quot;They wonder why Japanese visitors don&apos;t go home and tell everyone the truth about the comfort women,&quot; said a Japanese member of staff who did not wish to be named. After the war, Kang settled in north-west China where she married a local man and worked as a nurse. She did not return to South Korea until 2000, and these days speaks her native tongue with a heavy Chinese accent. She and other former comfort women have maintained pressure on Japan during weekly demonstrations outside its embassy in Seoul. Last December they conducted their 1,000th protest. The 85-year-old, who was given the Japanese name Tamako Okada while working in military brothels, said Japan&apos;s recent backpedalling would only prolong the agony of former sex slaves. &quot;To hear Japan&apos;s leaders accuse us of being liars makes me sad and angry,&quot; she said. &quot;I have nothing against ordinary Japanese people. This is their government&apos;s fault. The prime minister says there is no proof that we existed. But I am living proof.&quot; Japan&apos;s war apologies Earlier this month, a large billboard appeared in Times Square in New York. Beneath the question, &quot;Do you remember?&quot; is a black-and-white photograph from 1971 of the former German chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling before a monument to victims of the Warsaw Uprising. That simple gesture, the signs says, &quot;promoted reconciliation in Europe&quot;. It continues: &quot;In 2012, Korean women forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during WWII are still waiting for a heartfelt apology from Japan.&quot; Japan is often accused of never matching Germany&apos;s remorse for its wartime conduct. In fact, Japanese leaders, and its current emperor, have issued several apologies and expressed remorse. In addition to compensation agreed in postwar peace treaties, Japan points out that it has since extended generous aid and development packages to its former victims. On the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in 1995, the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, said: &quot;Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly those of Asia. &quot;In the hope that no such mistake will be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humanity, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.&quot; Two years earlier, Yohei Kono, then the chief cabinet secretary, acknowledged that the Japanese military had coerced Asian women into sexual slavery. The Kono statement, according to a recent editorial in the Korean press, deserves praise for &quot;extending its sincere apologies and remorse to all those who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women&quot;. But it is the nature, and perceived insincerity, of the apologies that continues to trouble China and South Korea. For the 60 or so surviving comfort women, previous expressions of remorse do not go far enough; instead, they are demanding an official apology and compensation directly from the Japanese government. In 2007, they won support from the US House of Representatives, which passed a resolution urging Japan to &quot;formally acknowledge, apologise, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner&quot; for the coercion of young women into sexual slavery. Demands for a formal apology and compensation will continue, at least as long as Japan, in Lee Myung-bak&apos;s words, refuses to summon the &quot;courage and wisdom to look squarely at history&quot;."}, {"sentences": ["Is Copenhagen the new Tokyo in the international league of absurdly high prices?"], "tags": ["Family finances", "Consumer affairs", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-19T08:00:00Z", "title": "Is this the world's most expensive cup of coffee?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/oct/19/worlds-most-expensive-cup-of-coffee", "article": "The Glyptotek in Copenhagen, a sort of mash-up of the British Museum and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, is\u00a0a very pleasant place to while away a rainy October afternoon, even after you&apos;ve swallowed the \u00a38.15 entry fee.

It looks like a ball of dark matter, an oily orb held in suspended animation, something mined from the depths of space awaiting testing. Suzuki presses a button and the orb begins to spin, emitting a crackly sequence of noises, as if the globe is channelling some garbled communication from a distant galaxy. This is The Sound of the Earth, a spherical vinyl record. It is played by a stylus that runs longitudinally down the side of the globe, tracking a continuous groove that spirals around the circumference from pole to pole. On its journey, as it scans across the continents subtly inscribed on the black surface, it plays a surreal mashup of field recordings taken by Suzuki on his travels, along with fragments of national anthems and folk music from around the world. &quot;I&apos;m always travelling,&quot; says Suzuki \u2013 just back from Sweden before jetting off to Belgium, followed by Oslo, Lausanne and Tokyo. &quot;I take a dictaphone wherever I go, and this project was a way of bringing all these sounds together.&quot;      He has been working on the idea for the last three years, developing software that allows him to map the sounds on to the 3D surface, and recently devised a spherical track cutting machine with the help of engineers in Tokyo.

Sound Chaser was a Scalextric track made from pieces of old vinyl, around which little stylus cars could run. His Finger Player allowed you to play records through a stylus strapped to your finger, letting users feel the sounds they were playing. Since graduating in 2008, he has gone on to build everything from animation machines to dancing robots, as well as a room-sized contraption that put together a cooked breakfast from scratch. &quot;Each project is trying to educate people about the way things work,&quot; says Suzuki, although it seems that performance outweighs pedagogy in much of his work. As part of his current residency at the Design Museum, he has been developing an electronics kit for children in the form of an interlocking puzzle that explains the principles behind circuit boards, as well as a radio whose electronics are based on the layout of the London tube map.

He was not the only one: most other teachers did too, as did more than 150 students and their parents. Most, to be honest, probably sat out of boredom. But some, including Kawaguchi, felt they couldn&apos;t ever stand for a song associated with Japan&apos;s military past. It was an innocuous event, but within two weeks the incident was reported in a rightwing newspaper and the school was bombarded with calls telling the teachers to &quot;go back to North Korea&quot;. Kawaguchi was given a written warning, and as a result was inadvertently pushed to the forefront of one of Japan&apos;s longest-running and most bizarre legal rows. Since 2003, more than 500 teachers have been disciplined for refusing to stand and sing Kimigayo \u2013 a solemn song about Japan&apos;s emperor, which calls for his reign to last &quot;8,000 generations \u2026 until the pebbles grow into boulders lush with moss&quot;. Standing for it at ceremonies is a requirement in both Tokyo and Osaka. Some teachers have just been given warnings; others effectively sacked. Appeals have reached the country&apos;s supreme court twice, but new cases keep coming. On Thursday morning Kawaguchi went to a high court in Osaka to try and get his warning overturned, saying the requirement restricts his freedom of thought. He lost. He&apos;ll now take his challenge to the supreme court. The issue may seem minor, but the fact that teachers are being asked to stand and sing an anthem at all is a worrying sign of Japan&apos;s continued conservatism and desire to please nationalists. There are few other developed countries that have regulations requiring people to stand and sing, and none others that actually enforce the requirement like Japan does. In Russia, some schools require daily singing from pupils, others don&apos;t. Even the US \u2013 that most patriotic of countries \u2013 does not discipline people failing to stand for the anthem. Its &quot;flag code&quot; says people &quot;should&quot; stand when the anthem&apos;s played, hand on heart, facing the flag. But you are free to not bother \u2013 unless of course you&apos;re running for office. It seems a somewhat basic requirement of any country that respects free speech to not force an anthem on someone; to realise these are historical songs that can either be taken by individuals as a vital source of inspiration or a joke. Should France force anyone from an immigrant background to sing the Marseillaise with its chorus calling on soldiers to water the fields with &quot;impure blood&quot;? Should the UK government be forcing schoolchildren to sing God Save the Queen? Unfortunately, it does not seem as though Japan is going to come to that realisation anytime soon. If anything, things are only going to get worse, and largely due to the rise of Osaka&apos;s mayor Toru Hashimoto. The young turk of Japanese politics, who leads the Japan Restoration Association party, is expected to win a large number of seats at this year&apos;s elections, and he&apos;s one of the strongest advocates of forcing people to stand and sing. Last autumn, he supported a bill introduced in Osaka that would allow schools to sack teachers if they refused to stand three times. He&apos;s even endorsed headmasters watching teachers&apos; lips to check if they&apos;re singing. Hashimoto&apos;s policies are ultimately aimed at restoring Japan to a world economic force. But culturally, how is stifling individualism and forcing people to sing a sad, one-minute-long tune going to achieve that? It&apos;s hardly the fresh break Japan needs. Hashimoto&apos;s office would not comment on Kawaguchi&apos;s case when contacted, but simply said the mayor endorses regulations &quot;designed to encourage respect for the traditions and culture of Japan&quot;. I thought a tradition of Japanese people was they were highly respectful of others&apos; views, but I guess I&apos;m wrong."}, {"sentences": ["Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images    Kamikochi national park, JapanThis park, more than 2,000m above sea level, is one of the most beguiling places in the Japanese Alps (north-west of Tokyo on Honshu island)."], "tags": ["Trees and forests", "Walking holidays", "Green travel", "Wildlife holidays", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-22T05:00:00Z", "title": "Forests and woodlands: readers' tips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/oct/22/forests-and-woodlands-readers-tips", "article": "Winning tip: Rothiemurchus, Cairngorms This beautiful area of the Caledonian Forest is managed by the family-owned Rothiemurchus estate and is a must for all lovers of the outdoors.

The deficit for the month was \u00a5558.6bn (\u00a34.5bn), the finance ministry said on Monday, higher than the forecasts of many analysts and bigger than a deficit of about \u00a32.3bn a year earlier. The deficit in August was \u00a36bn. Without a swift reversal in fortunes, Japan is likely to register its second annual trade deficit in more than 30 years, embarrassing its leaders and illustrating the difficulties for major exporting economies in a period of low global growth. Some analysts said the row with China was the most important factor holding back exports after a boycott of cars and other Japanese goods in the escalating battle over the Senkaku islands. Beijing is accused of stoking xenophobic protests over the islands, which it has claimed since the 1970s despite a settlement following the second world war that handed them to Japan. Protests in September across the communist-run country spilled over into violence against Japanese-owned factories and shops after Tokyo purchased the islands from a private owner. It is understood that Japanese companies have reacted to boycotts of their goods by cancelling plans for investments in factories and equipment in their Chinese subsidiaries. The stand-off between the world&apos;s second and third largest economies has the potential to hit international trade and slow the world economy further, unless China&apos;s new leaders, who are due to be unveiled next month, take steps to open diplomatic channels.

Central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, told a quarterly meeting of the bank&apos;s regional managers the economy was &quot;levelling off&quot;. However, the figures indicate the difficulties faced by major exporters after a &quot;lost&quot; two decades of low growth following the property bubble shock that wrecked Japan&apos;s banking system in the late 1980s. Shirakawa warned that the risk of shocks to the financial system from the debt crisis in Europe remained high and slowing global growth was hitting manufacturing and exports. Matthew Circosta, an economist with Moody&apos;s Analytics in Sydney, said with the risk of recession rising, the Bank of Japan needs to convince markets that it will do anything necessary to pull the economy out of its two-decade-old malaise. The central banks has refrained so far from copying the huge injections of funds undertaken by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to stimulate demand. Instead of sporadic monetary easing, &quot;they need to make it sustained and powerful&quot;, he said. &quot;They&apos;ve just got to be more aggressive than they are now.&quot; Many expect the central bank to opt for further easing soon, perhaps as early as the next board meeting on 30 October. September&apos;s exports totalled \u00a55.4 trillion. Imports rose 4% from a year earlier to \u00a55.9tn, inflated by additional imports of oil and other fuels for power generation as most nuclear reactors remain offline after last year&apos;s Fukushima nuclear disaster. So far, Japan&apos;s trade deficit for 2012, according to the ministry&apos;s provisional figures, is about \u00a54.73tn. The ministry figures show exports to all regions falling, apart from a meagre 0.4% year-on-year gain in shipments to North America. Exports to crisis-stricken Europe plummeted 26%. The dispute with China took a heavy toll, with exports to China sinking 14% from a year earlier to \u00a5953.4bn. Imports from China climbed 3.8% to \u00a51.28tn. Car exports fell 15% in September from the year before. The strong Japanese yen has hurt the country&apos;s export competitiveness, while demand has evaporated as growth slowed in most regions. Exports of consumer electronics, a mainstay, fell by double-digit figures from a year earlier. Resource-scarce Japan is almost entirely dependent on imported fuel, and it has long relied on robust exports of high-value consumer goods and industrial products, such as machine tools, to help counter the cost of importing its energy needs. With most of the country&apos;s nuclear plants shut down, manufacturers and utilities have increased their reliance on traditional energy sources, such as oil and gas, while stepping up conservation and investments in renewable energy. Boosted partly by higher prices, imports of fuels jumped 18% in September from a year earlier to \u00a52.15tn, accounting for more than a third of Japan&apos;s total imports."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo-based artist mus.hiba uses this program in a way few in Japan have - instead of using the digital singing as a diva stand-in, Yufu Sekka gets turned into an electronic ghost haunting the background of this gorgeous, heady production."], "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Indie", "Electronic music"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-22T14:17:26Z", "title": "October's best music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/oct/22/music-alliance-pact-october", "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an mp3, or grab a zip file of the whole 39-track compilation through Ge.tt here.  ARGENTINA: ZonaindieTrebian \u2013 ModernidadTrebian are a folk trio from Buenos Aires. Their songs are acoustic-driven with wood percussion and, above it all, the beautiful voice of lead singer Sof\u00eda Galarce. Modernidad is a preview from their upcoming second album, which will be released later this year.  AUSTRALIA: Who the Bloody Hell Are They?Mansion, Alaska \u2013 StepsIf a best-of compilation was made featuring the top American indie tunes of the last four years or so, this track would probably sum them all up. Mansion, Alaska may be channeling a sound similar to Local Natives, Grizzly Bear or even Volcano Choir&apos;s debut at times, but comparisons aside \u2013 what an impressive track from this young Melbourne band. Steps is seamless: beautiful harmonies, flowing piano arpeggios, sharp percussion and some dreamy guitar work gravitating around stratosphere level.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigB Fleischmann \u2013 I&apos;m Not Ready for the Grave YetWorking in a bookshop and on various musical projects as well as composing scores for TV series, electronica veteran Bernhard Fleischmann is a busy bee. On his new album I&apos;m Not Ready for the Grave Yet, he uses his own voice for the first time instead of inviting guest singers. Occasionally he also adds film snippets, such as in the album&apos;s title track.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoAbayomy Afrobeat Orquestra \u2013 Afrodis\u00edacoAfrobeat is the sound of the moment in Brazil. Bands such as Bixiga70 and Iconili are presenting the genre to a new generation and in Rio de Janeiro, the main representative of this trend is the Abayomy Afrobeat Orquestra. Afrodis\u00edaco is an example of the band&apos;s trippy music.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsThe Wilderness of Manitoba \u2013 White WoodsLike their namesake, the Wilderness of Manitoba is a Canadian national treasure, and one of our best-kept secrets. Their lush harmonies, delicate melodies and sparkling arrangements seem to always be attuned to their environment, creating music that sounds like it&apos;s sprung from fertile patches in the Canadian Shield, blooming against all odds. White Woods is taken from their new album, Island Of Echoes, which introduces electric guitars to give their music a whole new pulse and feel.  CHILE: Super 45Shog\u00fan \u2013 Unci\u00f3nextremaCristi\u00e1n Heyne, a producer whose output ranges from mainstream (Enrique Iglesias, La Ley) to indie (Javiera Mena, Gepe), has always kept his own musical project, Shog\u00fan, under a discrete, hermetic cover. With only a few limited-edition records and a handful of shows, he has attained a faithful cult following that has endured the last 15 years. His complete recordings were recently released via iTunes, giving a new life to his previously hard-to-find and unavailable works. Unci\u00f3nextrema is El Brujo&apos;s opening track.  CHINA: WooozyThe Gar \u2013 Love Will Lost Your LoveOne of China&apos;s most beloved cult indie bands, The Gar is without equal in both substance and acclaim. Wholly unconcerned with the trappings of stardom, they arrive, play their hearts out and exit stage left, blending seamlessly back into the crowds. On stage, however, the band transports audience members to a sonic wonderland coloured with soaring harmonies and unforgettable lyrics. The Gar just released their new EP, The City Of Burning Identities.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloOndatr\u00f3pica \u2013 3 Reyes De La TerapiaThis is what we call a supergroup. The union between Colombian musician Mario Galeano, from Frente Cumbiero, and English producer Will Holland, aka Quantic, resulted in Ondatr\u00f3pica \u2013 a musical research project through Colombian tropical sounds. Both Galeano and Quantic, scholars of Colombian and electronic rhythms, were given the task of recreating traditional sounds with vintage equipment and old recording techniques, but searching for its contemporaneity. Proof of this is 3 Reyes de la Terapia (&quot;3 Kings Of Therapy&quot;), featuring Juan Carlos Puello, which was made using a marimba, accordion and beatbox.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianKjartan Bue \u2013 Rosen And DannyHalf-Norwegian, half-Danish and raised in Denmark, Kjartan Bue debuts his five-track alt-country EP Man Riding Backwards on 15 November (I&apos;ve heard it and it&apos;s great). Here&apos;s Rosen And Danny as a MAP exclusive download, and do make sure you also check out the title track and closing ballad Old Woman here \u2013 the latter is also up for free download.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraEl Gran Poder De Diosa \u2013 Moriviv\u00edA Moriviv\u00ed is a minuscule tropical plant that has an unusual reaction when touched: it folds up and &quot;dies&quot; then &quot;comes back to life&quot; after several minutes. This song by reggae/Caribbean-influenced band El Gran Poder De Diosa reflects that internal debate between life and death, good and evil, through soothing tunes and clever wordplay.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaClo Sismico \u2013 Cassette PirataClo Sismico is a renowned musician, producer and MC. He is founder of two important bands in the local independent music scene, 38 Que No Juega (hip-hop) and Punto De Encaje (hardcore). This year Clo Sismico released his second album, Cassette Pirata, which blends rap, funk and Latin music with explosive, direct lyrics.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogNadine Shah \u2013 Aching BonesStraight out of Whitburn comes this singer and pianist-guitarist of Norwegian and Pakistani parentage who actually sounds more like the love child of Nick Cave and Polly Harvey. Shah&apos;s tales of lust and loss, revenge and regret are female takes on Trent Reznor&apos;s industrial blues, her voice redolent of the battle-worn Marianne Faithfull circa Broken English. The title track of her EP is vengefully dark business as usual for Shah as she roars over an insistent clang that provides the rhythm for the song. Her debut album Love Your Dumb and Mad, due early next year, should be a fiery, passionate hoot.  FINLAND: GluePaperfangs \u2013 EverydayPaperfangs is a dream-pop trio that draws inspiration from old movies, visual arts, geometric shapes, late-night biking trips, vintage girl groups, chamber pop and shoegaze, as well as the latest indie gems. A debut album will not be ready until next year, but in the meantime we can enjoy the band&apos;s take on one of the greatest melody makers ever as the trio covers Buddy Holly&apos;s Everyday.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredTotal Warr \u2013 xxx Hate xxxTotal Warr are not complete unknowns in the blogosphere, having been widely praised for their sweet electro-pop. Stereogum premiered xxx HATE xxx back in May and now that the Corbay EP is out, you don&apos;t have any more excuses not to listen to it.  GERMANY: BlogparteiVIMES \u2013 UpStairsIt&apos;s getting cold really fast these days so let&apos;s turn to some music which may give us comfort. Cologne newcomers VIMES is a duo with a penchant for vibrant electronic music. The voice of Azhar Syed gives the electronics of Julian Stetter a melancholic and yearning touch, thereby making VIMES recognisable. Live they are accompanied by VJ Till Beutling for a complete audiovisual experience. They are currently recording their debut album.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaCircassian \u2013 Eastern PatternsCircassian is a quartet formed in Athens in 2008. Their music demonstrates their traditions and habits, while their philosophy is based on bringing together experimental, neo-psychedelic patterns and forms of atonality along with ethnic melodies drawn from parts of Asia and Northern Africa. They create an eerie yet intimate atmosphere with a distinctive sound. Their second EP, Procrastinational, is available on Bandcamp.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnBorko \u2013 Born To Be FreeBorn To Be Free is Borko&apos;s first single from his long-awaited sophomore album, also named Born to Be Free, released in Iceland this month through Kimi Records and on 2 November through Sound of a Handshake for the rest of the world. Borko&apos;s first LP, Celebrating Life, was released to rave reviews.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarRock N Roll Mafia \u2013 Never Give UpIndonesia&apos;s finest electro band is back with their new album Prodigal, produced by Widi Puradiredja. Their sound is so fresh, optimistic and definitely danceable.  IRELAND: Nialler9Lar Kaye \u2013 EffectorWhile his main band Adebisi Shank are between things, guitarist Lar Kaye has been at his musical toy box and that bout of activity has resulted in a dizzying five-track solo EP. Effector is a hyperactive child of a song featuring pounding drum crashes, 8-bit melodies, cartoon samples, R&amp;B female vocals and spiralling guitar notes. The sound of one man having a lot of fun and dishing it out for free. Infectious.  ITALY: PolaroidMontgomery \u2013 RefrigeratorIt was very hard to choose just one song from the split EP by Montgomery and ED (available for free download on Bandcamp). Every track captures a perfect moment of acoustic pop, both light and moving, so my advice is to check out both acts. I picked Refrigerator by Montgomery because it&apos;s the best &quot;goodnight&quot; song I&apos;ve heard in a long time. Montgomery is a promising new group from Verona with members from the bands Canadians and Le Man Avec les Lunettes.  JAPAN: Make Believe Melodiesmus.hiba \u2013 Magical Fizzy DrinkMagical Fizzy Drink features vocals courtesy of Yufu Sekka. Thing is, Yufu Sekka is not a real person but rather a character tied to something called Vocaloid software, a singing synthesiser program. Tokyo-based artist mus.hiba uses this program in a way few in Japan have - instead of using the digital singing as a diva stand-in, Yufu Sekka gets turned into an electronic ghost haunting the background of this gorgeous, heady production.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaBrikkuni \u2013 Fil-Gallinar Tas-SultanTorn between their arty pretensions and a morbid fascination with kitsch, Brikkuni (&quot;scoundrels&quot;) try to have a stab at both. With Fil-Gallinar Tas-Sultan, the band leaves no stone unturned in its determined quest to marry reluctant bedfellows. The lyrics, sung in Maltese, recount a particularly tense day in a chicken coop owned by the titular Sultan. Riffs rise and ebb and rise again, leading to an an epic conclusion underscored by horns, strings and a pulsating bass line, all strung together by an insistent keyboard motif and \u2026 a purple chicken struggling to take flight. The song is taken from Brikkuni&apos;s sophomore album Trabokk.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaLos Macuanos \u2013 Sangre, Bandera, CruzLike a reveille amidst times of war against drug trafficking, Tijuana&apos;s Los Macuanos have released what may well be the curfew at the sunset of president Felipe Calder\u00f3n&apos;s administration, with his six years of futile strategies having left more than 70,000 human losses. Sangre, Bandera, Cruz (translated as &quot;Blood, Flag, Cross&quot;, written with witchcraft-associated symbols) is an ironic testimony that pictures the zeitgeist of Mexico during 2006-2012.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!WOLVON \u2013 UnicornyThis summer, Dutch bands WOLVON and Neon Rainbows set off on tour through the Balkans, playing in four countries of the former Yugoslavia. While battling the blistering heat, bored/corrupt border police, broken vehicles, stray dogs and their own preconceptions about south-eastern Europe, it was decided they&apos;d release a split 7&quot; to commemorate the experience. Unicorny is WOLVON&apos;s side of the record, launched during the independent culture festival Incubate last month. This noisy dream-pop trio has made a name for itself while touring the Dutch underground, thanks in part to their manic live antics. They&apos;re currently recording their debut full-length, which will be released through Subroutine Records in spring 2013.  PERU: SoTBPamela Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 Re-conozcoPamela Rodr\u00edguez is one of the best female voices in Peru, and recently received a Latin Grammy nomination for her third album Reconocer, which is both fresh and intense with a lot of pop inclination. The truth is that when her music starts to play, something magical happens in the ears of the listener. No matter what style she chooses, the true protagonist of her songs will always be her voice \u2013 sweet, free, sincere and perfect. Re-conozco is a beautiful and exciting piano song like few others.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogKAMP! \u2013 CairoIt&apos;s no exaggeration to say that KAMP! is the most popular band in Poland without an album to their name (although their debut record is due in November). Their elegant pop songs and fantastic live shows, including SXSW in Texas, have created a great buzz around this trio. Cairo was originally released as a single on Portuguese label Discotexas.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?The Weatherman \u2013 Proper GoodbyeAlexandre Monteiro (aka the Weatherman), after his presence on MAP in January 2009, is back with a new single which opens the way for his new album, Weatherman. A more intimate and autobiographical set of pure pop songs than his previous two albums, it&apos;s a sort of trip to outer space with plenty of time to think about life, where one can be viewed but can&apos;t view the observers.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieFantasmes \u2013 Redness MoonMario Negron and Dario Morales have been working together in psychedelic ensemble Fantasmes since 2007. For their third release, Redness Moon, Fantasmes required a space where they could compose, rehearse and record at their own pace, free from external pressures. And so a house in Santurce \u2013 San Juan&apos;s vibrant arts mecca \u2013 became Casa Fantasmes, where the duo worked tirelessly for months. The outstanding result of these sessions is their first release for New York indie label Last Bummer Records \u2013 a trippy, sci-fi, end-of-days dystopian video for first single Redness Moon was directed by Danilo Parra and is well worth your time.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseManfellow \u2013 WhyManfellow are an alternative rock band founded in Bucharest in 2011. They are known for their energetic and extravagant live performances and their fusion of many genres, including post-rock, progressive rock, alternative rock and electronic music. In December, they will represent Romania at The Global Battle Of Bands world final in London.  RUSSIA: Big EchoAnton Malinen \u2013 Rain SongAfter his successful debut Cape Of Good Hope, Anton Malinen from Saint Petersburg has released several songs through social networks. His impressive guitar and piano-based folk music continues to charm an online audience, but if Anton wants nothing more than some nice green tea for his songs, let it be the best supply for a few years at least!  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopKitty the Lion \u2013 Duck!There&apos;s cute and then there&apos;s Kitty the Lion cute, and the promo video for Duck! really does take this Glasgow band to unsurpassable levels of adorability. Frontwoman Anna Meldrum seems to have set herself a personal challenge of writing songs about subjects that are as mundane as possible, but first impressions can be deceiving. Closer inspection of her lyrics reveals exceptionally clever wordplay and crafty double-entendres. What isn&apos;t ambiguous is Kitty the Lion&apos;s pop heart, with a near-flawless grasp of melody flowing through their indie-folk veins.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up to \u2026Galactica \u2013 Saul&apos;s TighsIn a little-known recess in Singapore&apos;s music scene, there existed a group of science fiction aficionados with a common love for the space odyssey Battlestar Galactica. They went on to write some dreamily-inspired shoegaze with titles such as Saul&apos;s Tighs and Gaius Is Crying \u2026 Again, referencing series characters Colonel Saul Tigh and Dr Gaius Baltar. While the concept is an inside joke, the music is anything but. Their songcraft and taste in melodies evoke an immense sense of loss in the immeasurable vastness of space. It takes you back to the heyday of science fiction when the music was sprawling and searching, as opposed to present-day equivalents of over-budgeted pyrotechnics.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean Indie404 \u2013 WaterTwo-piece band 404 comes from the most interesting part of Korea&apos;s indie music scene. Not looking to put a label to their music, they say it&apos;s simply &quot;what a guitar/drum two-piece band would sound like in Korea in the year 2012&quot;. They recently released their first album, aptly titled 1, featuring their take on post-punk, modern rock, noise, folk-pop and a hint of blues in a surprisingly coherent mix. Water progresses playfully in a way that makes it impossible to sit entirely still while listening.  SPAIN: MusikornerWilhelm &amp; the Dancing Animals \u2013 ElephantWilhelm &amp; the Dancing Animals are from Pamplona, home town of a new wave of indie bands. Their sound can be described as folk with punk/rock influences and the animal kingdom is a feature that is often repeated in their work. They&apos;re certainly a band to follow, as we can tell from listening to their first album.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaThus:Owls \u2013 White NightThus:Owls is a Swedish/Canadian five-piece led by singer and composer Erika Angell. Together they craft carefully arranged, moving and melancholic pop with cinematic elements that&apos;s simply beautiful. Their widely and rightfully praised sophomore album Harbours is out now via Avalanche (North America) and Hoob Records (Sweden), and will be released in the rest of Europe next year on Kytopia.  SWITZERLAND: 78sMonotales \u2013 It&apos;s AlrightVelvet Underground, country, Americana, college-indie-rock, hair metal \u2026 you name it, Monotales have got it. They&apos;ve just released their sophomore album Hidden Thrills. Anything other than a lot of fun would have been a disappointment. And we looked anything other than disappointed after hearing it for the first time.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATSurrender! \u2013 ConflictedSurrender! is one of the newest emerging electronic music producers in the Turkish dance scene. Conflicted is one of his older tracks, but we are already excited about the upcoming album which will definitely be worth checking out.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouThe Cairo Gang \u2013 Everybody KnowsThe Cairo Gang make drifting seem like the only way to go about life. Their music hovers slightly above, moving at its own pace and coming down in a soft swoop at all the right moments. Hailing from Kentucky, the Cairo Gang bring warmth and introspection to the harshest country winters.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sSincr\u00f3nica \u2013 EsCupidoSincr\u00f3nica is a power trio formed in Caracas in 2001 when they participated in a college rock festival. Between 2002 and 2010 they recorded several EPs, before finally releasing their first album, Todo Lo Que No Sabes, in 2011. From this, we present the simple song EsCupido, which is also being included in the video game Rock Band."}, {"sentences": ["If I dressed up as Godzilla, people would not accuse me of wanting to crush Tokyo myself.&quot; David Sherborne, for Boyle, said it would be &quot;political correctness gone mad&quot; if the comedian was labelled as racist for using racial language in his jokes."], "tags": ["Frankie Boyle", "Media law", "Daily Mirror", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Stage", "Law", "UK news", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-22T15:15:00Z", "title": "Frankie Boyle wins more than \u00a350,000 libel damages from Daily Mirror", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/frankie-boyle-libel-damages-daily-mirror", "article": "The comedian Frankie Boyle has been awarded \u00a354,650 in damages after a high court jury found he had been libelled by the Daily Mirror. Boyle won \u00a350,400 after the jury&apos;s verdict on an article that described him as a &quot;racist comedian&quot;. Jurors awarded the comedian a further \u00a34,250 over the claim in the article that he was &quot;forced to quit&quot; the BBC2 show Mock the Week. The publisher of the Daily Mirror, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), must also pay an undisclosed amount of costs. During the five-day trial before Mr Justice Eady, jurors were shown a string of Boyle&apos;s jokes from Mock the Week and his Channel 4 show Tramadol Nights. The Scottish comedian told jurors he used racial language in jokes to ostracise other people&apos;s racist attitudes and make a point about society. Several witnesses, including Boyle&apos;s manager and the former production editor of Mock the Week, appeared as witnesses in the case in support of the comedian. The jury took just under three hours to find in Boyle&apos;s favour. Boyle said on Twitter: &quot;I&apos;m very happy with the jury&apos;s decision and their unanimous rejection of the Mirror&apos;s allegation that I am a racist. Racism is still a very serious problem in society which is why I&apos;ve made a point of always being anti-racist in my life and work and that&apos;s why I brought this action.&quot; Boyle spent hours in the witness box to explain the frequent use of racial references in his sketches. He denied accusations of using offensive words &quot;gratuitously&quot;, telling jurors at one point: &quot;There is no way they are an endorsement of racist terminology. It is the absolute opposite of that. If I dressed up as Godzilla, people would not accuse me of wanting to crush Tokyo myself.&quot; David Sherborne, for Boyle, said it would be &quot;political correctness gone mad&quot; if the comedian was labelled as racist for using racial language in his jokes. MGN argued the &quot;racist comedian&quot; description in its article, published on 19 July 2011, was either true or honest comment. A barrister representing MGN said if jurors thought that Boyle had been libelled they should show their &quot;contempt&quot; by awarding damages of 45p \u2013 the price of a copy of the Daily Mirror. Boyle said he would donate the damages money to charity. The trial was one of the only libel cases to be heard before a jury in the past decade.

Frankie Boyle&apos;s 2010 tour, quaintly titled I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face, was a sour triumph of vitriol over wit, complete with swipes at Susan Boyle and Heather Mills; on reviewing it for another paper, my main feeling was that it couldn&apos;t end soon enough. Yet I was firmly on Boyle&apos;s side when he announced that he was suing the Daily Mirror for describing him as &quot;racist&quot; and suggesting that he had been &quot;forced to quit&quot; the panel show Mock the Week. On Monday, Boyle won his case and \u00a354,650 damages for libel, and said he would donate the money to charity. At 3.22am he tweeted that it had been a &quot;hell of a day&quot; and posted a link to the Public Enemy song Fight the Power. Boyle&apos;s victory makes him seem like one of the good guys, a gallant fighter for justice \u2013 which must make a pleasant change. The 40-year-old Glaswegian&apos;s career has been punctuated by controversy. Over the years, Boyle has made a habit of sailing not just close to the wind, but directly into the eye of the hurricane. Think of a topic that stirs up the emotions, and more likely than not he has quipped where others fear to tread, creating cruel jokes, often about the vulnerable. He has come under fire for his gags about Jade Goody, Madeleine McCann, swimmer Rebecca Adlington and the Queen (he tells jokes about men, but it is noticeable how many of his high-profile targets have been female). He also got into hot water over joking about Katie Price&apos;s son Harvey, who has multiple disabilities. What&apos;s interesting is that, despite various media furores, he has frequently escaped the heaviest of punishments. When there were complaints after he made a joke on Mock the Week about Her Majesty being so old that &quot;her pussy is haunted&quot;, the BBC Trust called the joke &quot;sexist and ageist&quot;, but they cleared him of any misconduct, saying this &quot;would not have gone beyond audience expectations for the programme&quot;. Ofcom did uphold complaints about his joke about Harvey on Tramadol Nights, but this didn&apos;t stop Channel 4 from this year giving him another vehicle, The Boyle Variety Performance. Though, following some of his tasteless tweets during the Paralympics, Channel 4 insiders said Boyle was unlikely to feature on the channel again. You could charge Boyle with all sorts of -isms, but as Mirror Group Newspapers found to their cost, racism isn&apos;t one. There is a difference between Boyle using the word &quot;nigger&quot; when making a joke about the Ministry of Defence (in full, the joke ran: &quot;The Ministry of Defence? At least in the old days we were honest, it was the Ministry of War. &apos;Hello, Ministry of War, department of nigger bombing, how can I help?&apos;&quot;), and Bernard Manning&apos;s insulting &quot;Paki&quot; routines from the 1970s: Boyle is making a satirical point about British foreign policy, while Manning&apos;s routines were reductive, unreconstructed and \u2013 despite Manning pointing to black members of his audience \u2013 based on prejudice. As Boyle argued in court, it&apos;s all about context: &quot;If I dressed up as Godzilla, people would not accuse me of wanting to crush Tokyo myself.&quot; On stage and elsewhere, he presents himself as a particular character \u2013 not literally in the style of Al Murray&apos;s bibulous, bigoted Pub Landlord, but a persona nonetheless. It is certainly a consistent one, whether live, on Twitter or on screen. Unlike another foul-mouthed motormouth, Jerry Sadowitz, Boyle does not have a sideline as a children&apos;s entertainer. Or, if he does, he keeps very quiet about it. Off duty, now teetotal after his drinking years, he seems to be a happy family man, living with his partner and their two children. That seems to work commercially. His live DVDs and books are bestsellers and he has a regular column in the Mirror&apos;s rival the Sun. He is currently on a UK tour. As far as I&apos;m aware, his agent has not given out review tickets for his last few tours \u2013 no need for the publicity, it seems \u2013 and with his profile raised by this victory, I can&apos;t see any reason why his commercial popularity would change. Boyle might not sell many tickets to racists \u2013 not that we are suggesting he ever did, m&apos;lud \u2013 but there are plenty of fans who will be queuing up to enjoy his bleak banter. I just feel it&apos;s a shame that he continues to mine this seam: it&apos;s a waste of an undisputed verbal and comic talent.

Ishihara, an unabashed nationalist, sparked a diplomatic crisis with China in April when he announced plans to buy the Senkaku islands \u2013 which are claimed by both countries \u2013 and bring them under the control of the Tokyo metropolitan government. The move forced Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to offer a rival bid to buy the islands from their private Japanese owners and prevent them from falling into Ishihara&apos;s hands. Ishihara had hinted that he would develop the Senkakus, a move certain to infuriate China, which refers to them as the Diaoyu. In an apparent attempt to placate Beijing, Noda has said he will not build on the territory. Ishihara said at a packed news conference on Thursday that he would resign as governor immediately and aimed to fix Japan&apos;s political and economic problems. &quot;I&apos;m returning to national politics by forming a new party with like-minded colleagues,&quot; he said. &quot;I will try to do nationally everything I have been striving to do for Tokyo.&quot; The new party&apos;s name has yet to be announced. Ishihara, 80, who entered parliament with the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) in 1968, compared the country&apos;s bureaucrats to the shogunate regimes of feudal Japan. &quot;We must fix the inflexible rule of the central government bureaucrats,&quot; he said. It is not clear how much influence Ishihara&apos;s new party will have on national politics. His rightwing populism has won over Tokyo residents, securing him four straight terms as governor over the past 13 years, but other voters are wary of his provocative nature. Opinion polls suggest the main opposition LDP could win the most seats in the lower house under its new leader, Shinzo Abe, but may have to look to smaller parties to form a coalition government. The governing Democratic party of Japan is expected to be punished over Noda&apos;s handling of the economy and tax increases due to be phased in over the next three years. Ishihara has not ruled out joining forces with another new party formed by the rightwing mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto. &quot;There is momentum in Osaka, too, and I want to join hands [with Hashimoto&apos;s party],&quot; Ishihara said. The Asahi Shimbun quoted a senior member of the minor Sunrise party of Japan as saying the group&apos;s five MPs would join Ishihara. Ishihara is unrivaled in his ability to antagonise Japan&apos;s neighbours. He has described the Japanese army&apos;s slaughter of as many as 300,000 civilians in Nanjing in 1937 as a fabrication, and called on Japan to develop a nuclear deterrent against China and North Korea. Last year he drew widespread criticism after describing the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, in which almost 20,000 people died, as divine punishment for the &quot;egotism&quot; of the Japanese people. During his term as governor, he has made derogatory remarks about women and foreigners, and insulted Francophones by dismissing French as a &quot;failed international language&quot;. In 2010 he suggested gay people were &quot;deficient&quot;, after watching same-sex couples take part in a parade in San Francisco. Yet in Tokyo at least, he has remained remarkably popular. He downed a glass of the capital&apos;s drinking water in public at the height of the Fukushima nuclear crisis to reassure residents about its safety, and has won plaudits from environmentalists for restricting diesel emissions. He outlined his nationalist agenda in his 1989 book, The Japan that Can Say No, written with Sony&apos;s co-founder Akio Morita, which urged the country to end its dependence on the US for its security. A prizewinning novelist at 23, Ishihara wrote the screenplay for I Go to Die For You, a 2007 film that glorifies kamikaze pilots who flew on suicide missions towards the end of the second world war. Like many Japanese conservatives, Ishihara wants to abandon the country&apos;s postwar constitution, which forbids the use of force as a means of settling disputes, and build a stronger, more active military. &quot;There are several major contradictions that we hope the state itself will solve,&quot; he said on Thursday. &quot;The biggest is the Japanese constitution, which was imposed by the [US] occupying army, and is rendered in ugly Japanese.&quot; Japan does not have to hold a general election until next August, but Noda is under pressure to go to the polls early, having promised opposition parties he would do so in return for their support for a rise in the consumption tax. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012.

The Nuremberg option wasn't apple pie either | Michael White", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/oct/26/nazi-shooting-nuremberg-international-justice", "article": "Anyone tempted to get indignant on learning for the first time today that Winston Churchill proposed shooting leading Nazis in 1945 rather than putting them on trial should first ponder the fact that how the allies eventually treated their defeated enemies at Nuremberg was widely criticised at the time as victors&apos; justice, a lynching party even. Courts can always be pretty rough places, that&apos;s still obvious in 2012. As Ian Cobain reports, the war-time prime minister had long thought that Hitler and his henchfolk should be bumped off if caught alive, the law being squared if necessary by an act of attainder passed in parliament. Stalin and Roosevelt thought trials would be better \u2013 FDR because that&apos;s what US public opinion would want, Stalin because he had extensive experience of the value of show trials for propaganda purposes. What the newly released papers don&apos;t appear to confirm is that at their Tehran conference in 1943 \u2013 Iran was a divided Soviet-UK zone of influence \u2013 Stalin had proposed shooting 50,000 to 100,000 German officers, the sort of thing he&apos;d done to the Poles in the Katyn Forest in 1940. FDR joked that perhaps 49,000 would do, but Churchill, a former fighting soldier himself, recoiled in horror that soldiers would be shot for doing their duty by their country \u2013 he&apos;d rather be &quot;taken out into the courtyard and shot&quot; himself. Later in the war FDR&apos;s heart hardened when, at Yalta, he saw for himself what German occupation had done. In the event, 23 top Nazis were initially tried in 1945-46 \u2013 including G\u00f6ring, whose suicide pill cheated the hangman \u2013 and sentenced, 12 to death, seven to prison and three acquitted. Martin Bormann was absent, never caught despite repeated claims by the London tabloids. Two hundred or so lesser officials and soldiers were tried later at Nuremberg, 2,000 in normal courts. The basics are all here. Similar trials were held in Tokyo. It all fitted the public&apos;s angry, understandable desire for retribution against those who had launched a war that caused so much death and destruction, far more savage than had been realised until the post-war debris was assessed. Nuremberg became the precedent for all sorts of international jurisdiction, up to and including the international criminal court (ICC), most of it welcome, little of it free of controversy. But right from the start there was always unease. Harlan Fiske Stone, a member of the US supreme court, said Robert Jackson, the chief US prosecutor, was away &quot;conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg&quot;. Not that Stone minded what was done to the Nazis, he just didn&apos;t want justice to be tainted by it in fraudulent trials. Why? Because all sorts of indefensible things had to be conceded. Some of the charges were retrospective; others should have been levied against the Soviets who had taken part in the invasion and partition of Poland \u2013 the cause of the war in 1939 \u2013 and done dreadful things both at home and abroad. It presented false testimony to cover up complicity. Normally inadmissible evidence was admitted, no appeals were allowed. And plenty more. So perhaps Churchill&apos;s plan for summary executions had the merit of lacking hypocrisy, unacceptable though it was in the new world of international war emerging from the ruins of 1945. But international tribunals of one kind or another remain open to the charges of partiality, of victors&apos; justice. Serbian defendants at The Hague routinely complain about it; critics of Tony Blair and George Bush, who led the 2003 invasion of Iraq, say they should be in the dock there, too. The charge of &quot;substituting power for principle&quot; \u2013 made about Nuremberg in 1945 \u2013 lingers on. Imperfect justice is better than anarchy or the assertion that might is right, the prevailing principle for most of humanity during most of recorded history. But it&apos;s always messy. If you missed Conrad Black&apos;s interview with Newsnight&apos;s Jeremy Paxman this week you will enjoy it. In a series of interviews on his return to Britain, the jailed Daily Telegraph tycoon is spectacularly self-deluding as well as abusive. Paxo can \u2013 and does \u2013 defend himself with ease, against a more appropriate target for his disdain than young female Treasury ministers. Yet Black&apos;s attack on the US justice system (a &quot;fraudulent, fascistic conveyor belt of a corrupt system&quot;) and its propensity to lock people up \u2013 it has 5% of the world&apos;s population but 20% of its prisoners \u2013 is not something merely to be shrugged off. News that Christopher Tappin, the British businessman accused of breaking the arms embargo to Iran, is close to doing a plea-bargaining deal with prosecutors in Houston, Texas (he was extradited), which may save him years in a brutish prison. Is that justice? I don&apos;t know, but one of the NatWest Three \u2013 convicted in similar circumstances in the US \u2013 is quoted as saying that a US prosecutor can become &quot;judge, jury and executioner&quot; by threatening a suspect with heinous charges but settling for a quick and cheap compromise. As Black points out to Paxo, US conviction rates are very high. Closer to home I wasn&apos;t wildly enthusiastic at the prosecution of PC Alex MacFarlane for what is called a racially aggravated public order offence \u2013 you can read the case here \u2013 on the basis of what I have read in the Guardian. As I often remind readers, you have to have been in court to understand exactly what happened, but two juries failed to agree and the authorities have now given up. Some people will think the failure to convict an outrage, others will be outraged that the case was ever brought. Meanwhile I&apos;d love to know why the Belgian authorities imposed a news blackout on the shooting of British oil executive, Nicholas Moxford, outside a Brussels restaurant on 14 October \u2013 almost two weeks ago. A shooting in a street is a secret? Well, well. But justice is funny stuff.

Germany could only manage 20th place and France secured a lowly berth at number 34 out of 183 countries ranked this week. There is a reasonable expectation that western countries will appear in the top 50 of a list that values a country that can offer speedy property registration and access to electricity. The rankings also reward countries that can boast a legal system which enforces contracts fairly and protects creditors when a company goes bust. Putting in place these basic building blocks should be meat and drink to developed nations, though persuading the local electricity supplier to plug new customers into the grid often seems difficult in all parts of the world. Yet there are many countries in or near the top 50 of the World Bank&apos;s rankings that have proved hugely controversial. Georgia, the former Soviet satellite state, has jumped into 9th place from 112th in 2005 after a decade-long struggle with corruption that the World Bank and anti-corruption agency Transparency International claim is succeeding, but which many experts say still leaves many corrupt practices in place. More broadly, critics argue the World Bank rankings promote a neo-liberal agenda of privatisations, welfare cuts, limited employment rights and low wages to please and entice foreign multinationals. The anti-poverty charity Care International says incomes and living standards remain low across most of the south Caucasus despite consistently high GDP growth. In a recent report on Georgia and Armenia, which has climbed the rankings above France to the number 32 spot, the charity said poverty is &quot;pervasive&quot;. Peter Bakvis of the International Trade Union Confederation, says Georgia was rewarded for embarking on &quot;massive deregulation and the elimination of worker health and safety rules&quot;. Georgia&apos;s GDP grew by 7.1% last year and is projected to grow by 4.5% this year, yet the official unemployment rate remains at 15%. Likewise Kazakhstan, which ranks at 49, has 47% of its population subsisting on low incomes according to a United Nations report and is high on most experts&apos; list of corrupt countries. African trade unions make the same complaint. Some have seen their countries grow by 5% or more each year for a decade and leap up the Doing Business rankings while millions of their citizens suffer extreme poverty and workers cannot find a job that pays a decent wage. At a debate organised by the Bretton Woods project and supported by aid charity Cafod during the World Bank&apos;s annual meeting in Tokyo earlier this month, Augusto L\u00f3pez-Claros, director of global indicators and analysis at the Washington-based agency, was clear his mission is to fight poverty. He maintained that the business rankings showed which nations were stable economies and the ones tht provide a sound platform for wealth creation. Geoffrey Chongo of the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection in Zambia is a long term critic of the rankings. He says most people in Zambia, which is one of the world&apos;s largest copper producers, have remained in poverty despite soaring national income growth and annual rises up the rankings. He argues the central African nation has proved unwilling or unable to generate taxes from mining companies, leaving ministers no option but to tax workers more heavily. Starved of domestic capital, the government was forced recently to borrow $750m (\u00a3465m) from the international markets in the form of a bond to generate much needed funds for investment. L\u00f3pez-Claros argued issuing a bond was a great achievement and revealed a high level of confidence in Zambia. But Chongo said Zambia&apos;s attraction was the 16% effective tax rate on corporations, while workers paid 25% on their incomes. Zambia earned a paltry $50m from mining royalty revenues in 2009 despite the industry generating \u00a35bn in sales. Corporation tax from other areas and PAYE brought the total to $500m, according to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. But at 10%, the tax rate was considered a failure by all but the Banda government, which scrapped a windfall tax that had previously gone some way to making up the tax gap. Similarly, Zambia was ranked 8th in the &quot;getting access to credit indicator&quot; in 2011, &quot;yet small businesses still cite access to credit as their biggest challenge with more than 90% of SMEs saying they lack access to credit with interest rates above 25%,&quot; says Chongo. He believes the Zambian government has been obsessed with getting a top 50 ranking and was prepared to starve SME development in favour of multinationals to get it. He can expect more of the same after a 10 place drop in the 2013 list to 94th as other nations worked harder to meet the criteria. Bin Han, one of China&apos;s senior representatives at the World Bank, says the rankings are fundamentally flawed. &quot;The Chinese conclusion is straightforward: the report has used a wrong methodology, failed to reflect facts in individual countries, and misled readers. The questionable quality of the report has ruined the Bank&apos;s reputation,&quot; he said at the debate. The new boss at the World Bank, Jim Yong\u00a0Kim, has pledged to review the rankings. Maybe he needs to scrap them in favour of individual country reports.

The revelations have prompted anger among survivors, who say reconstruction is taking too long. More than 18 months after the disaster, about 325,000 people forced to flee the tsunami and radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are still living in temporary accommodation and have no idea when, or if, they will be able to return to their home towns. A breakdown of expenditure for the 2011 portion of the disaster budget found a large amount had gone to projects that have little or no relationship to the reconstruction efforts in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, where almost 20,000 people died on 11 March last year. They included 500m yen for road construction in Okinawa, more than 1,000 miles to the south; 330m yen to repair a sports stadium in Tokyo; 10.7bn yen for a nuclear power research organisation; and subsidies for a contact lens factory. Another 30m yen went to the justice ministry to buy equipment for prisons, while 2.3bn yen was given to the fisheries agency to protect Japan&apos;s whaling fleet from harassment by the marine conservation group, Sea Shepherd. Other expenditure included renovations of government offices in Tokyo, training for aircraft and fighter pilots, research and production of rare-earth minerals, and semiconductor research.

Local media reported that money used to improve disaster readiness in areas untouched by the tsunami could be trimmed next year, but there is no sign yet that the government will rein in other dubious expenditures. Noda acknowledged, however, that the revelations had angered the public, saying he would &quot;wring out&quot; spending on unrelated projects. Reconstruction spending included in the budgets for 2011 and next year was supposed to help people affected by the nuclear crisis, rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the tsunami and create employment.

Harumafuji, one of two reigning yokozuna \u2013 or grand champions \u2013 said he understood why the sport was failing to create interest among young Japanese. &quot;Sumo is a strict sport,&quot; he said, weeks after becoming the first wrestler to be promoted to sumo&apos;s highest rank for five years. &quot;I understand that there are people who feel like they needn&apos;t go through the pain [of life as a wrestler] in an age when convenience is everything,&quot; he told Kyodo news agency. &quot;But that&apos;s why success feels so good after you have made such an effort and experienced such great hardship.&quot; The regimented life of a trainee sumo wrestler involves sleeping in dormitories, rising at dawn and carrying out chores in between gruelling exercises. The decline in interest in a sumo career among teenage boys comes as the sport struggles to improve its image after a series of scandals. Last year, sumo was rocked by allegations of bout fixing, described by the chairman of the JSA as the darkest chapter in the sport&apos;s 1,500-year history. In 2010, more than two-dozen wrestlers were found to have gambled illegally on baseball, golf, cards and mahjong, sometimes with the help of middlemen with links to organised crime. The same year, the then grand champion, Asashoryu, took early retirement after allegedly assaulting a man outside a Tokyo nightclub. Two years earlier, three Russian wrestlers were banned for life after testing positive for marijuana. But perhaps the most damaging incident occurred in 2007, when a 17-year-old recruit died following an assault by three senior wrestlers on the orders of their stable master. Sumo authorities insist they have clamped down on hazing and bullying, and have tried to make the sport more appealing by, for example, relaxing physical requirements for new recruits. But the measures appear to have done little to boost interest among teenagers, who are eligible to join a stable once they have completed junior high school. Traditionalists also bemoan the absence of a homegrown yokozuna to inspire his compatriots to take up the sport. Harumafuji, and fellow reigning grand champion Hakuho, were both born in Mongolia, as was Asashoryu. The last Japanese-born yokozuna, Takanohana, retired in 2003. But Doreen Simmons, a sumo writer and commentator who has followed the sport for 40 years, said talk of a crisis was premature. &quot;I don&apos;t think there is anything fundamentally wrong with sumo and I&apos;m not particularly worried about its future,&quot; she said. &quot;The authorities have cracked down on the worst cases of bullying. You have to remember that this is a contact sport and you must be able to take pain and then find something special inside you to succeed.&quot; Instead, Simmons blamed attitudes among the young in Japan for the decline in interest. &quot;A sumo wrestler once told me Japanese kids were too soft,&quot; she said. &quot;They also have other options, whereas their counterparts from Mongolia or the former Soviet Union have a hunger to succeed. And sumo is a very tough life. Only the very highest-ranking wrestlers make good money, and even they don&apos;t earn much compared with professional baseball players.&quot; The recruitment period before the final tournament of the year traditionally attracts very few recruits, while the March tournament, held at the end of the academic year, usually draws the most. This spring, however, only 34 boys applied \u2013 the lowest number since 1973."}, {"sentences": ["Angus Hindley, who has died suddenly, aged 47, on a flight from London to Tokyo, was a highly respected and well-liked Middle East business journalist."], "tags": ["Magazines", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-01T15:39:29Z", "title": "Angus Hindley obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/01/angus-hindley-obituary", "article": "Angus Hindley, who has died suddenly, aged 47, on a flight from London to Tokyo, was a highly respected and well-liked Middle East business journalist.

These days the Japanese electronics brand is etched on my microwave oven. They both cost around \u00a370. There was probably a fat profit margin selling stereos in 1978 when they cost more than half the average weekly wage, and not much of a margin on a generic microwave in 2012. No wonder Sharp warned on Thursday that it will lose $5.6bn (\u00a33.4bn) this year. Ratings agency Fitch went so far as to say it might not be able to survive on its own, but which of its rivals would want to buy it? Ranking the losses of Japan&apos;s electronics conglomerates is a popular game. Panasonic&apos;s cumulative loss over five years is nearly $25bn. Sony managed to register a small profit this week, but only after it sold a chemicals business. Last year the maker of PlayStation and around 16m TV sets a year lost $5.7bn. Its TV assembly lines have lost money for eight years. These firms need to rescue themselves before they can step in to save Sharp. And they have much to do. They are all sprawling businesses that have lost too much of their technological edge and mass appeal as companies such as Apple and Samsung muscle in at the top end and China&apos;s cheap-as-chips manufacturers steal the mass market business. All three firms have lost billions investing in solar panel making factories - a once lucrative market stolen by copycat Chinese, German and US manufacturers able to use the high yen to undercut Japanese rivals. A sudden downturn in sales to China following the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute between Beijing and Tokyo has made matters worse. The problem for Japan is that these businesses are not only major employers and exporters, they are also demanding huge amounts of debt funding to keep themselves afloat, adding to the already massive debts built up by the government over the last 20 years. It is only as long as employers and the government can fund themselves with bigger and bigger loans that the Japanese economy can stay afloat. At the moment debt is cheap. Japan is a safe haven. And it will stay that way all the while turmoil exists in euroland and Washington procrastinates over planned tax rises and spending cuts due in January that could plunge the US into recession. Most MPs in Japan&apos;s parliament deny there is a problem while debt costs remain low. &quot;Keep borrowing until something turns up,&quot; seems to be the answer. But that something needs to be more than a 4D flatscreen TV, however all-embracing and clear the picture turns out to be. The world was willing to pay a premium for hi-tech Japanese goods once, but not any longer. For instance, it is probably true that Japanese solar panels last longer than cheaper Chinese versions, but they cost three times the price. Maybe with installation costs taken into account, they are worth buying, but most consumers have shorter horizons. A massive spending spree by the Tokyo administration on solar in the last year is the only thing keeping these domestic businesses afloat. And that is at the expense of more government debt because the Japanese simply don&apos;t pay enough tax to fund the public schemes that benefit business. As with so many mature capitalist states, with wealthy corporations and citizens resistant to paying standard rates of tax, borrowing is the easiest and cheapest option. Like an addict, Japan&apos;s parliament knows the only way to keep the majority happy is to keep mainlining cheap loans, without which there would be an almighty shakeout, and Sharp, Sony and Panasonic would stop being employment agencies. The unemployment rate would certainly rise from being the lowest in the G7 at 4.4% to nearer the 9% average. A run on the yen is not imminent, say most analysts, but realistically it could happen any time."}, {"sentences": ["Last week, I don&apos;t think I was focused as hard as I needed to be [when losing to the Pole from nowhere, Jerzy Janowicz].&quot; However, coming on the back of comments he made on the Asian swing of the Tour to the effect that he regards himself as an uncompromising front-runner, losing to Milos Raonic in Tokyo, Djokovic in Shanghai then Janowicz with victory all but in his pocket each time is at least cause for minor concern, despite his otherwise excellent form."], "tags": ["Andy Murray", "ATP World Tour Finals", "Roger Federer", "Novak Djokovic", "Tennis", "Sport", "Tomas Berdych"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-03T19:58:16Z", "title": "Andy Murray meets Tomas Berdych in his opening match of Tour Finals", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/03/andy-murray-tomas-berdych-atp-london", "article": "For Andy Murray, this is a homecoming dripping in goodwill but, down river from the Tower of London, the Scot will not need reminding that a coronation by the Thames can some times be a tricky affair. The freshly minted US Open champion arrives in London via Paris, where he was put out of his stride when losing for the third time in a row after holding match point (eight in all), a statistic he was at pains to put in context on Saturday ahead of his opening match on Monday against Tomas Berdych at the start of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. The world No6 has inconvenienced him before but he was no match for his inventiveness in an absurdly wind-blown semi-final at Flushing Meadows, a memory that pleases Murray. Yet it was always asking a lot for him to carry the zest and sharpness of a major (where Novak Djokovic fell before him in the final), into the concluding stages of the Tour when he had already qualified for this tournament. &quot;I am aware how hard it is to finish matches off,&quot; Murray said of his recent blips. &quot;Some times it is going to go very well, some times it is not. Last week, I don&apos;t think I was focused as hard as I needed to be [when losing to the Pole from nowhere, Jerzy Janowicz].&quot; However, coming on the back of comments he made on the Asian swing of the Tour to the effect that he regards himself as an uncompromising front-runner, losing to Milos Raonic in Tokyo, Djokovic in Shanghai then Janowicz with victory all but in his pocket each time is at least cause for minor concern, despite his otherwise excellent form. Had he not closed out that dramatic New York final against Djokovic to break the most onerous hoodoo in British sport, Murray would be in a considerably more difficult place coming into the final tournament of the year, at least in the perceptions of an unforgiving media. But he trusted his talent and his legs to secure his greatest win and is determined to rediscover some of that energy before his Christmas break. Once this tournament is done, he will collapse in a dignified heap at the feet of the nearest back specialist to fix a chronic complaint that has some of its origins in the injury that forced his withdrawal from this tournament a year ago. With Ivan Lendl back at his side at the end of a long, physically draining and garlanded season, focus ought to be the least of the Scot&apos;s worries. It was not so much that Murray did not see the little-known but not so little Janowicz coming at Bercy (at 6ft 8in, the Pole is hard to miss); he has, after all, suffered against other lesser lights in a past thought to be well behind him. Yet modern tennis is such an intense undertaking, grief can arrive in seconds. From a distance, it seemed he was not alone among the game&apos;s leading players in blinking at the wrong time in Paris. So Murray might just feel more comfortable with his peers on home soil, especially given his conqueror&apos;s subsequent giant-killing of Janko Tipsarevic, followed by a less surprising win over the unseeded Gilles Simon on Saturday, to reach the final of the BNP Paribas Masters against David Ferrer. Janowicz broke into the top 30 from 69 in the world with that two-set win over the Frenchman and becomes the first qualifier to reach an ATP 1000 final in seven years. Unlike the world No100, Lukas Rosol, who shocked the ailing Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon with a one-off performance, Janowicz, at 21, seems to have substance to his game. In that context, Murray&apos;s loss to him in three sets can be viewed as a hiccup rather than a full-blown embarrassment. After the rising of the sans-culottes in Paris, he is, after all, sharing space in a tumbril filled with the bodies of the chastened elite, among them Berdych, eliminated by Simon, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Tipsarevic, who also lost to Janowicz. Add to that the wounded Roger Federer, absent in Paris but probably still fuming after losing to Djokovic in Basel the week before. Federer surrendered his world No1 ranking to the Serb in that match and cannot get it back until next year, a fierce blow to the Wimbledon champion&apos;s self-esteem after a fulfilling 2012. There is a lot of wounded pride on both sides of the draw, some of it self-inflicted, much of it down to the physical demands of 11 tough months of tennis, and just a little because a couple of upstarts at the penultimate tournament decided not to roll over in the presence of greatness. In the other match on Monday, Djokovic plays Tsonga in the evening. The draw pitched Murray into the A Group alongside Djokovic, Berdych and Tsonga (seeded 7). On the other side are Federer, the defending champion, fourth seed David Ferrer, Ddel Potro (6) and Tipsarevic (8). It matters little. Getting through the round-robin is tough, although there are judgments to be made. As Murray pointed out, Federer is supreme indoors on a hard court and Del Potro is taking a shine to the surface too, preferring Europe inside in the early winter to the clay of south America. (He is worth a bet here.) It was pointed out, redundantly, to Murray that a British player has never won this tournament.

Instead, the Spaniard wisely chose to sit out the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, the end-of-season gathering of the game&apos;s best eight players, to give his 26-year-old bones the longest rest they have had from the game since his suspect ankles first sent distress signals to the rest of his legs in 2005. So much has happened in that time. Nadal established himself as the greatest clay-courter of them all and engaged in a personal duel with Roger Federer that enthralled the public and froze out their rivals from all but a handful of the biggest prizes. They might resume proceedings at the Australian Open in January, but, for the first time, there are genuine doubts about their hegemony, voiced most recently by Boris Becker. Forecasting a power shift in tennis is a fraught exercise, confounded by the flickering genius of Nadal and Federer, but the signs are building at the end of the most unpredictable year in the men&apos;s game since 2003 that Becker might have got it right: the new heavyweights are Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic. That is not to disregard the man with 17 grand slam titles, of course, and Federer&apos;s enduring thirst for glory will be manifest again when he begins the defence of his title in Greenwich this week. Indeed, when one writer suggested last week that the 31-year-old darling of the tennis fancy might be showing evidence of slippage after losing to Juan-Martin Del Potro in Basel two weeks ago, he was buried in opprobrium from incensed bloggers and tweeters. When seven of the eight players were introduced to diners at a charity dinner at the High Court in London on Saturday night, it was clear Federer will never lack for admirers. Murray and Djokovic \u2013 two of four different slam winners this year, alongside their more decorated peers \u2013 are understandably cautious about subscribing to the revolution. When Murray \u2013 who conquered Djokovic so memorably in New York for his breakthrough slam \u2013 was asked if this sharing of the spoils, as well as the recent upsets of the game&apos;s elite in Tokyo, Shanghai, Basel and Paris, provided convincing evidence of sustainable change, he demurred, although he clearly relishes his jousts with Djokovic. &quot;Nearly all the matches I have played with him this year have been incredibly close,&quot; he said. &quot;The two matches at Dubai and Miami were not that close but all of the other ones could have gone either way, including the one at the Olympics. There were a lot of long games and, in the second set especially, he had chances. &quot;The US Open, the Australian Open, they were so close. I would not say either one of us has especially had the upper hand this year. They have been incredibly physical matches, very, very tough. I hope it is the same again this week.&quot; So, is this the new era of tennis? &quot;It might be a bit too soon to say that. I think the rankings would suggest that it has not changed too much. Over the past few years, a lot of players have been at the top of their games ... obviously, [David] Ferrer, [Tomas] Berdych, [Janko] Tipsarevic. All of the guys that have been coming through in the last couple of years have been of a similar style of play. They have been huge guys, with big games, big serves, who have caused numerous upsets but have maybe lacked a bit of consistency to make that final breakthrough to the top eight. &quot;To me, [Federer losing to Del Potro in Basel] is not a major surprise. When it happens in the slams, when that starts happening more regularly in the slams, that is when you would see that guys are making a big breakthrough.&quot; Murray has had challenges of his own to deal with, not the least of them giving up eight match points in three recent defeats. &quot;I know that stuff can happen to anyone. I was incredibly focused in Shanghai [against Djokovic] and just did not manage to get it. I think I had one on my serve. &quot;Against [Milos] Raonic in Tokyo, against one of the biggest servers in the game, that was also on his serve. The one that is disappointing for me is last week [losing to the Polish qualifier Jerzy Janowicz in Paris], because I just rushed and wasn&apos;t thinking really. I thought the match was won. I don&apos;t think I will take anything granted here, that&apos;s for sure.&quot; Between January, 2002, and September, 2003, tennis had eight different grand slam title winners, a period commonly characterised as &quot;The Window&quot;.

But Nicholas Levene&apos;s story was ended at Southwark crown court when he was sentenced to 13 years in jail on Mondayfor swindling investors out of more than \u00a332m. The 48-year-old former stockbroker, who once checked himself into London&apos;s Priory clinic for his gambling addiction, orchestrated a lucrative Ponzi scheme to live a life of luxury, raking in hundreds of millions of pounds between 2005 and 2009, the court was told. Among his victims were Richard Caring, the restaurant tycoon who owns The Ivy and Le Caprice in London&apos;s West End; Sir Brian Souter and his sister Ann Gloag, the founders of the Stagecoach bus and rail group; Russell Bartlett, director of the R3 Investment Group and ex-owner of Hull City FC; and Ray O&apos;Rourke, founder of construction firm Laing O&apos;Rourke. Sentencing Levene, who pleaded guilty in September to 12 charges of fraud between 2005 and 2009, Judge Martin Beddoe said: &quot;It was a fraud from the outset, where countless lies were told. It was rank dishonesty. There were separate acts of individual moments of betrayal.&quot; Levene \u2013 known as &quot;Beano&quot; because of his love of the comic book \u2013 once had an estimated wealth of \u00a315m to \u00a320m and was a former vice-chairman of Leyton Orient Football Club. Barry Hearn, the club&apos;s chairman, once described him as a &quot;nice family man [with] three lovely kids&quot;. But Levene was also a compulsive gambler who loved a spread bet before his empire collapsed in bankruptcy. Levene told investors he had bought shares on their behalf but instead spent the money on buying property in the UK and Israel, expensive guns, flash cars, private schools for his children and flying friends to parties in St Tropez. He once spent nearly \u00a3600,000 on a family celebration and his parties attracted luminaries such as Simon Cowell and Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon who owns Topshop. Once one of the best-connected figures in the City, Levene also counted Jeremy Isaacs, Lehman Brothers&apos; former London boss, as his friend. To keep up the illusion Levene provided investors with false &quot;profits&quot;, conning them into believing he was a successful trader. The profits were in fact funds from new investors \u2013 a classic Ponzi scheme, such as the one run by the American fraudster Bernard Madoff, where money is taken from one client to give to another. The son of an electrician, Levene quit school at 15 without qualifications and joined the London Stock Exchange as a trader in the runup to the big bang deregulation of the City in 1984. He described himself as having 25 years&apos; experience in the equity and derivative markets, having worked at the stockbroker Phillips &amp; Drew, the moneybroker Tullett &amp; Tokyo and Trio Equity Derivatives, where he was managing director. He also worked as an executive director at the hedge fund Integrated Asset Mangement. His sales pitch was that he could get access to share offerings in companies that were unattainable for ordinary investors. Between 1 January 2005 and 31 October 2009 he pocketed more than \u00a3250m from investors, according to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The fraud came to an end in 2009 when several investors sued him in the civil courts to recover their money. Gloag and Souter, for example, handed Levene \u00a35m each to invest in fundraisings by the mining firm Xstrata and HSBC bank. When they made \u00a33.8m each they instructed him to sell, but said they never received the capital back or the profit they were due. Their litigation marked the beginning of the end for Levene. The Essex businessmen Victor Lupson and John Bennett made a claim for \u00a338m. Levene was also chased by spread betting firms. Levene also admitted one charge of false accounting and one of obtaining a money transfer by deception. He was declared bankrupt in the high court on 7 October 2009 and the SFO started a criminal investigation the same month. The SFO said he used the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. More than \u00a318m was spent on property, luxury holidays and other lifestyle expenses. Jonathan Midgley, lawyer for the SFO, said: &quot;This was a complex and extensive fraud where Nicholas Levene used investors&apos; monies to finance a lavish personal lifestyle.&quot; Confiscation proceedings have been fixed for 25 March at Southwark crown court. Separately, a Deloitte partner, Louise Brittain, who was appointed trustee in Levene&apos;s bankruptcy in 2009, has still not finished collecting all his assets. She said they could be worth tens or hundreds of millions of pounds. His villa in Israel and chauffeur-driven Bentley have already been sold and the bulk of the remaining assets are property and bank accounts, both in the UK and abroad. It is one of the toughest sentences ever issued for financial fraud.

The Jeffrey Archeresque premise \u2013 two boys born on the same day, with a maternity ward baby swap leading to a Jew and a gentile being raised as twins in a Jewish family while the Nazi party (which Elton repeatedly explains to us is a Very Bad Thing) is coming into being \u2013 is certainly readable, and the setting fascinating. But oh, this book is exasperating. Elton traces the boys growing up in 1920s Berlin. We know it&apos;s 1920s Berlin because somebody says &quot;This man lives in the hottest craziest city in Europe! Every studio&apos;s got some wild genius in it breaking all the rules of form!&quot; &quot;But don&apos;t you know TB is up 300% on prewar levels!&quot; says someone else. Every single time you get drawn into the flow of the narrative, you are pulled up abruptly by a horrible clunk of finger-wagging exposition. Characters (who are either saints or brutes) say things such as: &quot;Only the Jews could produce an Einstein&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t you know any thick Jews?&quot;, and off they go again, like the sixth-form common room. And has Elton done his research? Oh yes, he really has. Trust me on this. &quot;We hoped she might swim for the Berlin Olympics, in 1936. Or Tokyo, in 1940.&quot; It is particularly annoying because the sincerity of what Elton is trying to achieve here is so apparent. There is none of the slightly doubtful utilisation of the Holocaust that I found in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, as if it existed solely to make the reader upset and disgusted by any means necessary. And Elton&apos;s prose is pacy; he can undeniably turn pages. But every time he starts to let his characters live and breathe on paper, he interrupts his own narrative with &quot;but the Nazis have stolen our youth!&quot; or &quot;I don&apos;t think this will end well!&quot; He even has a group of 15-year-olds, in 1935 Berlin, discussing seriously how they really mustn&apos;t be naughty to the Arabs when they get to Palestine. Characters cannot be people and mouthpieces at the same time; they simply fall apart, as does your patience with the narrator. But even cardboard cutouts are not immune to the horrors of those grisly days, and the most irritated reader will find it hard not to want to know the outcome. In fact, as a popular history \u2013 the closing of the grand department store feels freshly culled from the newsreels \u2013 in which Elton could have given his own voice room to comment, this might have been rather excellent. And it is readable as an Archeresque yarn, each boy born to destiny etc etc, with the requisite number of twists and turns. Whenever the sole three-dimensional character, Dagmar, takes the stage, the story threatens to come alive with a whoosh. But in the end the author is, I think, simply too kind, too respectful; he cannot quite bring himself to send real people into agony (the touching afterword traces the parallels within his own family history, which made me think more and more that this would have made a fascinating memoir). And so he makes do with setting the ultimate evil against heroic sacrificers; fearless fighters; beautiful, living saints. This is a shame for both the book and its readers: he should have had more confidence in us. \u2022 Jenny Colgan&apos;s Christmas at the Cupcake Caf\u00e9 is published by Sphere."}, {"sentences": ["It hit around $1,729 an ounce this morning, its strongest performance since October 23 Yuichi Ikemizu, branch manager for Standard Bank in Tokyo, said Obama&apos;s victory likely means more quantitative easing."], "tags": ["Polymetal", "Mining", "Business", "Gold", "Commodities", "Barack Obama", "Quantitative easing"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-07T12:34:06Z", "title": "Scuba divers find Polymetal's gold ore", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/nov/07/scuba-divers-find-polymetals-gold-ore", "article": "The top riser in the FTSE 100 at the moment is Polymetal International, the precious metals group that is headquartered in St Petersburg and whose shares have gained almost 3% to \u00a311.44.

(Warning: Some of the events below might be slightly more of the &quot;actually happened&quot; variety than others.) 13 January The New York Yankees trade catcher Jesus Montero to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Michael Pineda, despite Mariners officials high-fiving each other after the Yankees sign off on the &quot;no backsies&quot; stipulation before checking Pineda&apos;s medical report. 17 January After President Barack Obama hosts the world-champion St Louis Cardinals at the White House, pollster Nate Silver notes a 4.7% drop in presidential approval ratings among Chicago Cubs fans. 23 February National League MVP Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers successfully appeals his 50-game suspension for testing positive for a banned substance, after proving that his urine was improperly handled in the process. Sadly, serious discussion about whether or not Braun&apos;s urine was kept in a delivery person&apos;s fridge proves to be one of the least inane baseball-related sports-radio topics of the year. 28 March  The MLB regular season begins in the Tokyo Dome as the Seattle Mariners face off against the Oakland Athletics, several days before the MLB regular season begins for everybody else. The other MLB teams also tell the Mariners and A&apos;s that there&apos;s a pool on the roof of the Dome and that the word &quot;gullible&quot; is not in the dictionary. 30 March The Colorado Rockies&apos; Jamie Moyer becomes the subject of the oldest &quot;player X is so old that&quot; joke to appear on an Opening Day roster, beating out a record formerly held by Julio Franco. 4 April Actual Opening Day. The A&apos;s and Mariners slowly realize that they were just totally punk&apos;d. 10 April The Miami Marlins suspend Ozzie Guillen for saying that he admires Fidel Castro. In response to his suspension, Guillen tries to say &quot;this is the worst thing to happen since the capitalist swine installed Batista&quot; \u2013 but no one English-speaking or Spanish-speaking can decipher the Ozzie-ese he uses on his Twitter account. 20 April      Boston Red Sox's Cody Ross reacts after striking out in the ninth inning during an American League MLB baseball game against the New York Yankees at Fenway Park on 20 April.

This will, seriously, be the highlight of the season for Boston fans. 21 April  Chicago White Sox pitcher Philip Humber pitches the first perfect game in two years, over the Seattle Mariners. &quot;When&apos;s the next time we&apos;ll see another one of those?&quot; pitching-enthused baseball fans ask themselves. 21 April The Yankees rally from a nine-run deficit to defeat the Red Sox 15-9. Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine says his club has now hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;. This begins a long fruitful history of Bobby Valentine being entirely wrong about basically everything. 3 May New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera is out for the season after he tears his ACL while shagging balls in the outfield before a game. The news devastates Yankees fans, emotional after losing their Hall of Fame closer to a career-threatening injury, as well as non-Yankees fans, upset with themselves at the fact that they&apos;re feeling sorry for a Yankees player. 8 May  Josh Hamilton goes 5-for-5 with four home runs in a 10-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles. &quot;I feel like I&apos;ll never go on a slump again,&quot; Hamilton says after the game, before walking underneath a ladder and pausing to let a black cat cross his path before breaking several mirrors in the clubhouse. 1 June  The New York Mets record the first no-hitter in team history as Johann Santana beats the St Louis Cardinals 8-0. To celebrate, the Mets open up the Fifth and Sixth Seals. 8 June  Six Seattle Mariners combine to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers. &quot;OK,&quot; baseball fans say. &quot;This no-hitter stuff is cool and all, but this is starting to become routine.&quot; 13 June Matt Cain pitches the 22nd perfect game in Major League history as the San Francisco Giants beat the Houston Astros 10-0. &quot;Wait, seriously?&quot; baseball fans ask, incredulously. Meanwhile, the New York Mets&apos; knuckleballer RA Dickey throws a one-hitter in a 9-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. &quot;He allowed a hit?&quot; spoiled baseball fans snark. &quot;Then what&apos;s the big deal?&quot; 18 June Dickey throws his second straight one-hitter, this time in a 5-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Dickey publicly apologizes for disgracing his team for allowing a hit in two starts in a row. Baseball fans, spoiled by the number of no-hitters this season, bitterly reject the apology. 10 July The National League defeats the American League 8-0 in the 83rd All-Star Game, at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City. Matt Cain of the Giants gets the win for the National League, which guarantees home-field advantage for the National League team throughout the World Series, while his teammate Melky Cabrera receives the game&apos;s MVP honors for hitting a two-run home run.

This seems sort of a missed opportunity.&quot; 23 July The New York Yankees call up Ichiro Suzuki from their AAA farm team, the Seattle Mariners.

Free-agent-to-be Josh Hamilton is booed by the hometown crowd for his poor performance. &quot;This is terrible,&quot; Hamilton says after the game. &quot;I can only hope that Alex Rodriguez chokes in the playoffs to take the attention off of me, but what are the odds of that happening?&quot; 11 October After falling 2-0 in the NLDS, the San Francisco Giants rally to win their next three games against the Cincinnati Reds and win the series 3-2. &quot;We can&apos;t keep winning series like this,&quot; Giants manager Bruce Bochy says before adding a &quot;wait unless....&quot; and flashing a mercurial smile. 11 October The Detroit Tigers defeat the Oakland Athletics and win the ALDS 3-2, leaving Oakland GM Brad Pitt looking for answers in the offseason. 12 October      St Louis Cardinals players celebrate after defeating the Washington Nationals in Game 5 of their MLB NLDS baseball series in Washington.

To celebrate, the Yankees decide to take the next series off. 18 October The Detroit Tigers sweep Alex Rodriguez, and to a much lesser extent, the New York Yankees in four games in the ALCS. &quot;We could have done that&quot;, says every Orioles fan in the world, at once and practically at unison. 22 October The San Francisco Giants come back from 3-1 down in the NLCS to defeat the St Louis Cardinals. The Giants have home-field advantage over the Tigers due to the National League&apos;s win in the All-Star Game, thanks to their own Matt Cain and Melky Cabrera and Detroit&apos;s Justin Verlander. &quot;This is what we were trying to tell you&quot;, say annoyed time-traveling sportswriters, adding: &quot;Can we go back in time and kill Hitler now?&quot; 23 October The Miami Marlins dismiss Ozzie Guillen, who tries to write &quot;the Luria regime will die at the hands of its exploited proletariat&quot; on his Twitter account.

Afterwards, San Francisco holds a large colorful parade in front of a lot of giddy, intoxicated residents. &quot;Oh we planned to do this today anyway,&quot; town officials say. &quot;But now that you mention it we should also do something special to celebrate the Giants victory,&quot; town officials add. 29 October In-denial MLB fans sit in front of their televisions and wait for Game 5 of the World Series, as friends and family worry about whether or not to tell them that there is no more baseball for the rest of the year."}, {"sentences": ["He became national cycling coach at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games \u2013 where he inspired another great British track cyclist, the four-times world pursuit champion Hugh Porter \u2013 and later president of the British Cycling Federation and the Solihull Cycling Club, although his influence crossed club boundaries."], "tags": ["Olympic Games 1948", "UK news", "London", "Cycling", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-08T15:44:17Z", "title": "Tommy Godwin obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/08/tommy-godwin", "article": "The cyclist Tommy Godwin, who has died aged 91, was a double bronze medallist at the 1948 London Olympic Games and an ambassador for the event when it returned to the city this year. At the &quot;austerity&quot; Games three years after the end of the second world war, athletes were billeted with families or in barracks, and other nations donated food for the 4,000 competitors. The British cycling quartet had to make do in their preparation as well, dogged by disputes, walk-outs, late substitutions and poor qualifying performances at the Herne Hill velodrome in south London. Godwin was selected to ride the 1,000m time trial at two days&apos; notice, without having ridden one in training. &quot;It was a bad night,&quot; he recalled, &quot;pitch black.&quot; Having won his medal, he was back at work at the cycle manufacturers BSA the following Monday. He recalled: &quot;Somebody there said, &apos;Oh you won a medal,&apos; and I said yes. He said, &apos;Well, the job we&apos;re doing today is so and so.&apos; That was it.&quot; It was, as he underlined, a very different existence to that of today&apos;s lottery-funded full-time athletes. Godwin was born in Connecticut to parents who had migrated from the Midlands, and was approached by the Americans to ride for them in 1948, although he turned down the offer. His family had returned to the Midlands in 1932 when the Great Depression struck. Godwin&apos;s interest in cycling was sparked by the Dutchman Arie van Vliet&apos;s performance in the 1936 Games. He began racing shortly before the war, winning a Midlands Olympic trial event, but it was a string of track victories in 1944 and 1945 that led to his selection for the 1948 Games, confirmed only a week before his first event, the 4,000m team pursuit, where he raced with Dave Ricketts, Alan Geldard and Wilf Waters. &quot;We were strictly amateurs, racing for watches and clocks, furniture, canteens of cutlery. We were not allowed to take money as prizes,&quot; Godwin told Cycling Weekly earlier this year. After his racing days were over, Godwin remained heavily involved with the sport. He became national cycling coach at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games \u2013 where he inspired another great British track cyclist, the four-times world pursuit champion Hugh Porter \u2013 and later president of the British Cycling Federation and the Solihull Cycling Club, although his influence crossed club boundaries. He opened a cycle shop in King&apos;s Heath, Birmingham, and founded the Birmingham Road Cycling Club. Among his proteges was the British Olympic cyclist Mick Bennett, who worked at his shop building wheels, to whom he lent a bike and his crash hat from the 1948 Games, and who was coached by Godwin, emulating his mentor&apos;s brace of bronze medals in 1972 and 1976. More recently, Godwin helped to launch the Herne Hill Velodrome Trust, the campaign group launched when the track came under threat of closure in 2010, and he was present when the resurfaced circuit was reopened this year with its future secure under a fresh long-term lease. After being selected as an Olympic torchbearer for his home town of Solihull, Godwin attended this year&apos;s Olympic opening ceremony in London and made a point of being present at the velodrome in the Olympic Park in August to watch Britain&apos;s cyclists continue his medal-winning legacy. He will also be remembered by West Midlands cyclists for his appearances at more low-key events, such as local track leagues and road races, where his modesty, ready smile and wealth of anecdotes made a huge impression. His wife, Eileen, predeceased him. He is survived by a daughter, Kay. \u2022 Tommy Godwin, cyclist, born 5 November 1920; died 3 November 2012"}, {"sentences": ["There&apos;s also the whole British thing, so they love the whole heritage thing.&quot; At the opposite end of the industry is Jaggy Nettle, based at Lauder in the Scottish Borders, whose products, featuring hi-top sneakers in Harris tweed, are stocked in expensive boutiques on 22nd Street in New York, in Tokyo and in Italy, alongside Prada and Louis Vuitton."], "tags": ["Fashion", "Fashion industry", "Manufacturing sector", "Retail industry", "Business", "Scotland", "UK news", "Life and style", "Heritage", "Culture", "Topshop"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-09T16:45:33Z", "title": "Harris tweed returns to global boutiques after islands' renaissance", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/nov/09/harris-tweed-industry-scotland-renaissance", "article": "For many, Harris tweed may conjure images of itchy jackets worn by your grandad, fictional sleuths such as Miss Marple, or the local vicar. But no longer. The hand-woven fabric is now enjoying a giddying surge in popularity; it is hip, desirable and back on the high street. The traditional Hebridean cloth is now featured in the central men&apos;s ranges of Top Man and preppy American retailers like J Crew, and can be found covering headphones, holdalls, North Face jackets, and Dr Martens and Converse boots. Championed by Doctor Who star Matt Smith and the rapper Tinie Tempah, the tweed is being used on hand-stitched &quot;hi-top&quot; trainers and handbags produced by cottage businesses in Scottish market towns, but sold in Italian and Japanese luxury boutiques alongside Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs. This year, production is expected to exceed a million metres \u2013 the biggest production run for 15 years \u2013 every centimetre hand-woven at homes in Scotland&apos;s Western Isles. The surge in production is evidence of a remarkable resurrection. Five years ago, the future of Harris tweed was bleak after decades of under-investment and poor sales. Production was half of this year&apos;s rate, at around 500,000 metres, and many feared the industry was in terminal decline. The number of weavers \u2013 all self-employed, some crofters working part-time on their looms in sheds beside their homes as they juggled seasonal weaving with running smallholdings and other part-time jobs \u2013 had fallen below 100. Having learned their craft from parents or relatives, the remaining weavers were ageing. Few teenagers wanted to enter the industry. But now, after a five-year initiative partly headed by a former Labour energy minister, Brian Wilson, Harris tweed is enjoying a renaissance few had predicted. There are now more than a thousand designs, from those blending in the traditional dull duns, purples and ochres of the Scottish Highlands, to brash patterns with bright reds, pinks and yellows. &quot;Probably the big success has been to transform the image of Harris tweed into a young fabric, a stylish fabric for a new generation,&quot; said Wilson, who founded the radical West Highland Free Press newspaper in Skye in 1972. &quot;Our client list now has just about every serious designer; every fashionable designer is now working with Harris tweed.&quot; Five years ago, Wilson and a small group of co-investors reopened a mothballed mill in the village of Shawbost on the west coast of Lewis. A Yorkshire textiles magnate, Brian Haggas, had bought what was then the island&apos;s largest tweed maker in Stornoway in 2006, in what was billed as a last-ditch rescue for Harris tweed. Controversially, Haggas had decided to cut tweed production to just four designs, purely to make a set number of tweed jackets. The Haggas takeover was &quot;a blessing in disguise, albeit heavy disguise,&quot; said Wilson. It made people focus on saving the industry. The newly formed Harris Tweed Hebrides company, based at Shawbost, began targeting fashion shows, trade fairs and retailers. Wilson said the primary focus was to market Harris tweed&apos;s history and its reputation for quality, particularly in its traditional market in the United States. Harris tweed is one of the world&apos;s oldest protected trademarks. Its distinctive &quot;orb&quot; label, guaranteeing its origin in the Western Isles and hand-woven production technique, was first licensed by act of parliament in 1910.Over the last five years, 40 new weavers have joined the industry, some returning to a craft previously practised by their parents. Some were spurred on by Donald John MacKay, given an MBE in this year&apos;s New Year&apos;s honours list after landing a remarkable contract to supply the sport shoes manufacturer Nike with 10,000 metres of tweed for their Terminator basketball range seven years ago, a period when the industry was in crisis. The tweed industry \u2013 weaving, finishing and design \u2013 is now the Western Isles&apos; largest private sector employer. With 140 weavers now working full-time on producing tweed, it generates about \u00a310m a year for the local economy, which has one of the lowest rates of wealth-creation in the UK. The Shawbost mill now accounts for 90% of Harris tweed production. &quot;It was a very definite objective to take it into places where it used to be known and had kind of lost its way. That means mainly the US, because that used to be the main market,&quot; Wilson said. He realised the company&apos;s promotional campaigning had succeeded not when a major fashion designer began buying Shawbost tweed but when the British high street retailer Top Man did so last year. Top Man is again using tweed for its tailored jackets, blazers and waistcoats, and a rucksack and men&apos;s shoulder bag. Gordon Richardson, Top Man&apos;s creative director, said there was a strong interest among young men in &quot;noble&quot; fabrics like Harris tweed: fabrics with a history and tradition. &quot;There&apos;s this whole mood for all things heritage,&quot; Richardson said. &quot;So one of our ranges is using something that has a history and has a past, and has a resonance with something which has existed before, rather than something purely futuristic. There&apos;s also the whole British thing, so they love the whole heritage thing.&quot; At the opposite end of the industry is Jaggy Nettle, based at Lauder in the Scottish Borders, whose products, featuring hi-top sneakers in Harris tweed, are stocked in expensive boutiques on 22nd Street in New York, in Tokyo and in Italy, alongside Prada and Louis Vuitton. Started 18 months ago by Jason Lee, a painter, and his partner Emily Quinn, a textiles expert, as an &quot;anti-fashion&quot; clothes design firm, their tweed product range, made by craftspeople in Fife, has expanded. Last week, Lee took possession of newly made tweed Chelsea boots and trainers. He chose Harris tweed, he said, because their clothes are not designed for one season or one trend, but to last. &quot;I bought a Harris tweed coat from a charity shop in Hawick made in Galashiels. I have had that coat for eight years, and I&apos;ve never had to wash it. That&apos;s my real aspiration for a fabric: its lack of wear and tear, the way it repels water and dirt.&quot; Now, said Wilson, tweed-weaving is again central to island life for the Western Isles. Weavers are spread across the islands, boosting the local economy. &quot;The objective was to create a new generation interested in it: the great thing is you&apos;re selling something which is truly genuine,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;It&apos;s not like spinning a story around something which doesn&apos;t exist.

Federer, who played magnificently on Sunday night after a slow start, won 7-6, 6-2 to rapturous applause and reaches for his seventh title in the Barclays ATP World Tour finals on Monday night against Novak Djokovic, the Serb having earlier accounted for Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in three absorbing sets. For all that the notion of Swiss neutrality is an historical clich\u00e9 \u2013 and those waving the Red Cross flag were proud and entitled to cheer for their representative \u2013 the noise throughout most of the packed arena seemed inordinately in favour of the world No2 against Murray for the hour and a half it lasted. Indeed, from this perch it would not be unreasonable to put it at 60-40. Two incidents stood out. After breaking Federer in the first game of the match Murray dropped serve to allow him back into the contest and, when deep in a fightback at 5-4, was heckled in mid-serve. He double-faulted but held and said later it did not affect the result, although it did prompt a plea from the umpire for silence. Then, towards the end of an enthralling tie-break, trailing 4-6, Murray changed rackets and a tiny section of the ground whistled and booed, an unedifying spectacle. At other moments minor errors were cheered, his better efforts sometimes only politely received. It was not the sort of homecoming an Olympic gold medallist and US Open champion might have expected in front of what was a largely British audience. While the Scot might have thought he could count on at least something like a fair shake against the most popular player of modern times, he declined to complain about any perceived slight. &quot;Almost all the times when you play Roger anywhere in the world he gets great support,&quot; he said. &quot;He deserves that because of everything that&apos;s he&apos;s achieved.&quot; He was similarly philosophical about the result, as well as the slight tailing off in his remarkable season. &quot;I don&apos;t think the results have been that bad,&quot; he said, of tight defeats in Tokyo, Shanghai and Paris, &quot;or that I played poorly or not responded well to winning the US Open. I would have liked to have finished with a win, obviously. But it&apos;s been the best year of my career by a mile. So it would be silly to look back on that negatively, because I&apos;ve achieved things I&apos;ve never achieved before.&quot; All that said, Federer played on a different level towards the end of the first set and most of the second. Once the rhythm of his tennis grew, he was pretty much irresistible and Murray&apos;s tennis did not survive a brutal examination in a clinical finish. The beast in Djokovic, meanwhile, has been stirred. Even as he was handing out chocolates to journalists after qualifying, one guessed the charity would end right there. The Christmas gift to his regular inquisitors was a nice gesture by a most interesting man but there will be no sentiment in the final. The Serb arrived in London from Paris understandably preoccupied by worries about his father&apos;s health but encouraging news on that front looks to have cleared his mind and he was back to near his ruthless best on Sunday afternoon, content, relaxed and dangerous. The reinstated world No1 will be tougher to beat on Monday night than he might have been a week ago. This was tennis which touched the heights, two uncompromising ball strikers leaving nothing but sweat on the court, stretching muscle and mind to the limit in a tense three-setter that lasted two hours and 11 minutes. Djokovic won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 pulling away. However, the Argentinian looked dominant in the first set and stayed on level terms until early in the second when, after a period of sloppy tennis, Djokovic came to life. The ball left his racket with more certainty, the near-misses of the first spell now clipped lines down the channels and deep, as the rush of a champion&apos;s desire coursed through him. &quot;I had a little, let&apos;s say, crisis from four-all in the first set to two-all in the second,&quot; he said, &quot;where I didn&apos;t feel so good on the court, struggling to find my momentum and my rhythm. Also, when mentally you&apos;re not confident and you&apos;re not in control of the match, your energy level drops. So I tried to be positive and push myself to fight for every point. I always believe I can come back.&quot; It should be some final."}, {"sentences": ["In Lost in Translation, Bill Murray plays the part of a fading actor who suddenly confronts his acute loneliness and alienation in a Tokyo hotel."], "tags": ["Ian Thorpe", "Swimming", "Sport", "Depression", "Mental health", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-12T15:38:12Z", "title": "Ian Thorpe: 'I was surrounded by people but had this intense loneliness'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/12/ian-thorpe-swimming-depression", "article": "Ian Thorpe began his long and lonely return to the pool a year ago this month. He understands the solitary nature of elite sport better than most professional athletes, and describes its impact with layered elegance, but even Thorpe was jolted by the isolation he felt as he prepared to swim competitively again in Singapore last November. After four years in retirement, his five Olympic gold medals and famous old Thorpedo racing persona meant nothing as he climbed on the blocks. &quot;I&apos;ve never felt more alone than in that moment,&quot; Thorpe says simply. &quot;The water is normally my space \u2013 because I get quite territorial. But I realised that, despite all my training, I was about to put myself back out there as a competitor. I was surrounded by people but I still had this intense loneliness. Sport can sometimes isolate you and I&apos;ve come to realise through all the travelling and all the hotel rooms that there is this recurring Lost In Translation moment.&quot; It&apos;s typical of Thorpe, and an example of why he is so interesting to interview, that he should refer to Sofia Coppola&apos;s film amid his explanation of a difficult sporting comeback. In Lost in Translation, Bill Murray plays the part of a fading actor who suddenly confronts his acute loneliness and alienation in a Tokyo hotel. Thorpe, however, has ended up in far darker and more frightening places. The 30-year-old&apos;s attempt to swim for Australia at this summer&apos;s London Olympics ended in disappointment. Yet set against his depression, which he has revealed for the first time in his stark but powerful new book, Thorpe&apos;s return assumes fresh meaning. &quot;In terms of making the Olympics it was a complete failure,&quot; Thorpe concedes, as he reflects on his non-selection, &quot;but I&apos;ve rediscovered what I loved about my sport when I walked away from it, loathing it. I find such beauty in the repetition of training \u2013 in its rhythms and rituals. I had lost that. But, even if I prefer training to racing, part of me wants performance. It&apos;s less about winning than turning in a performance that matches my preparation.&quot; Such purity ensured that Thorpe resumed training as soon as his stint as a BBC commentator at London 2012 ended in August. He plans to swim at next year&apos;s world championships in Barcelona and at Glasgow&apos;s 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 while possibly continuing two years beyond that at one last Olympic Games in Rio. Following the return of a former great sportsman is always poignant but, with Thorpe, there is a sense that swimming also provides a refuge from depression. &quot;There are some mornings when, if I didn&apos;t have the routine of training, I would struggle to get out of bed. But, when you get to training, all of a sudden things seem a little better. Of course racing can bring about increased pressure. But when I&apos;m racing I usually manage my depression and anxiety really well. The pulse of anxiety is appropriate then. It&apos;s just more troubling on ordinary days.&quot; Thorpe thinks carefully before he answers most questions. And his pause is especially considered when asked to describe his worst days of depression. He eventually offers a telling account which uncovers the extent to which depression can be physically, as well as well as psychologically, debilitating. &quot;It&apos;s like a weight is pressing down on you. There are days when you just can&apos;t get out of bed. You cannot face the world. You tell yourself simple things like: &apos;Just get to the kitchen and get a glass of water.&apos; But not being able to do something so basic is frightening. &quot;There were lots of times where I just could not bear to leave the house. You actually scour the cupboards for food. You become quite resourceful with what&apos;s left. And if there&apos;s nothing in the cupboards you just don&apos;t eat. Sometimes this feeling lasts just days. Other times it can be weeks. But you learn to identify the triggers. You can start to minimise the length of your depression. &quot;I realise now when I start to withdraw from doing things with my friends that I need to force myself. My doctors say [Thorpe emits a dry laugh]: &apos;Fake it till you make it.&apos; So even if I don&apos;t feel like going out with my friends I know I need to. It&apos;s tough but, once you&apos;ve forced yourself, it doesn&apos;t seem so bad and you can minimise the low.&quot; Courage is needed to address such problems and Thorpe, who is an intensely private man, makes it seem as if &quot;the cancer of attention&quot; had contributed to his depression. So how was he finally able to voice a secret he had harboured so long? &quot;It helped knowing doctors don&apos;t talk. It&apos;s also realising you need help. I still don&apos;t understand it entirely but being able to share it has helped because part of being depressed is being completely irrational. It&apos;s important to apply some rational thought. &quot;I think depression is genetic and I probably would&apos;ve dealt with it whether I was famous or not. But people sometimes don&apos;t think you have a right to feel like this because you&apos;ve been famous or successful. It just doesn&apos;t work like that. You can be a really great athlete and have all the attributes of mental toughness but, in real life, it doesn&apos;t work. I was really tough when I raced but I couldn&apos;t hold the rest of my life together.&quot; Thorpe had been a world champion at 15, and won three gold medals at his home Olympics in Sydney in 2000. Yet a year later, and only 19, his illness had become so &quot;crushing&quot; Thorpe needed clandestine psychiatric help. He still could not bring himself to tell his friends or family and the unbearable weight continued to bear down on him. He finally contemplated suicide. &quot;It made me understand I needed to see someone more frequently and to get medication that worked. I feel I&apos;m on to the other side of it now. I&apos;ve got a handle on it but I would never say I&apos;m in control of it because I know how quickly it can change. But I&apos;m in a place where, for the first time, I&apos;m comfortable talking about depression.&quot; Does Thorpe believe that discussing his illness will diminish its hold on him? &quot;I&apos;m not sure. I assume it&apos;s better I&apos;m not bottling it up. But it also means I&apos;ve exposed myself.&quot; It&apos;s hard to shake the assumption that Thorpe&apos;s demons have been deepened by media hounding and speculation about his sexuality. In one telling anecdote he writes of how the mother of Grant Hackett, another famous Australian swimmer, spoke of her sadness when she saw how he walked with his head lowered in public. Thorpe, in contrast, felt a burst of empathy with Hackett. &quot;You feel you have to hide yourself,&quot; Thorpe says. &quot;I don&apos;t want people to feel sorry for me but that&apos;s what fame is. Sometimes it&apos;s incredibly difficult to deal with and sometimes it&apos;s great. It&apos;s just not simple.&quot; Thorpe was friends with Heath Ledger, the gifted Australian actor, and his partner, the actress Michelle Williams. A few years after his success in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger died after an accidental overdose. Just like Thorpe, he had struggled with depression and an intrusive Australian media. &quot;We had some interesting discussions around fame,&quot; Thorpe says. &quot;What fame is and how we felt about it. But the last time I saw Heath we spoke of the summer we&apos;d all just had as &apos;the happy summer&apos;. It seemed as if everything was great for all of us. But things changed very quickly for him.&quot; Was Ledger aware of the pressure Thorpe also faced? &quot;Of course,&quot; Thorpe chides gently. &quot;He liked sport and he was from Australia, so come on!&quot; Innuendos about Thorpe&apos;s sexuality began when he was a boy \u2013 and he remembers first being asked if he was gay in an interview when he was only 15. Thorpe insists in his book that, &quot;for the record, I am not gay and all my sexual experiences have been straight&quot;. He argues that his interests in fashion and art and &quot;beautiful things&quot; have led to mistaken assumptions about him. His sexuality really doesn&apos;t matter but he then makes a sad aside: &quot;The truth is I&apos;ve spent most of my adult life trying to avoid relationships \u2026 if people get too close to me I often end up pushing them away.&quot; But Thorpe provides a cautionary suggestion which can be applied to his private life. &quot;The world is a lovely shade of grey and there needs to be more balance in the way lives are described. I know people need certain results to stay in their job so things get exaggerated in the media. It often seems as if there is not much else besides success and misery. I think what happens is that people in my position don&apos;t give out all the information because there is not enough trust. They don&apos;t want it to be sensationalised. &quot;I look at athletes and I see what they have to offer but they never reveal it in public. I see textbook media answers where I am just frightened by how boring it is. But they&apos;re scared to show themselves. We need to get back some trust between the media and athletes.&quot; Australia&apos;s media can be hysterical in its treatment of sporting failure. Thorpe raises an eyebrow when I read to him some reports from the London Olympics which described James Magnussen&apos;s silver in the 100m freestyle as &quot;the biggest Australian flop since Crocodile Dundee 3&quot; and the failure of him and his team-mates to win a medal in the relay as &quot;the biggest defeat since Gallipoli&quot;. Thorpe shrugs: &quot;We should not be talking about sport in this way. But he had talked his prospects up a lot and when you do that you have to deliver. If he had won we would&apos;ve accepted that this is the way he talks \u2013 like an American track-and-field sprinter. But because he didn&apos;t swim very well he invited that upon himself. Of course it&apos;s still exaggerated because we&apos;re talking about sport and not war.&quot; Thorpe is different to most sportsmen and yet, for all his refined interests and sometimes fragile personality, he retains a hard competitive edge. &quot;A driven part of me loves elite performance and I may be able to capture that again. I want to swim as well as I used to and if I do that it would mean winning medals again. If I get to a point in training where I don&apos;t think that&apos;s achievable I&apos;ll have to rethink everything. In 2016, at the Rio Olympics, I&apos;ll be 33. It&apos;s completely feasible I could swim there. But I&apos;m taking it step by step. We have trials for the 2013 world championships in April. That&apos;s my next big goal. &quot;Before the London trials I did times in training I&apos;d never done but I need consistency. So that&apos;s why big blocks of training are important. I just want to get back in the pool and train hard and that eagerness makes me realise how much I want it. It&apos;s helping me as a person and who knows where I&apos;ll end up as a swimmer. I&apos;m excited to find out \u2013 and that&apos;s not something I could have said a few years ago.&quot; Ian Thorpe&apos;s autobiography, This Is Me (Simon &amp; Schuster), is available from the Guardian Bookshop, priced at \u00a316 (RRP \u00a320)."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;There&apos;s a real failure of leadership,&quot; Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo, told Associated Press.", "That could open the door to a coalition involving smaller parties on the right led by the former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, and the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto."], "tags": ["Japan", "Yoshihiko Noda", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-14T14:24:33Z", "title": "Japan set for December elections", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/14/japan-elections-noda-parliament", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda is poised to call a general election for next month, in a move that could see his party thrown out of office just three years after it was elected by a landslide. Noda, who is expected to dissolve the lower house of parliament by the end of the week, agreed to an early election in return for opposition support for electoral reform and an urgent budget-financing bill. After months of speculation, he is also making good on a promise to go to the polls early in exchange for opposition support this summer for a rise in the sales tax. In a heated exchange on Wednesday, Noda told Shinzo Abe, leader of the main opposition Liberal Democratic party (LDP), he would call an election for 16 December. In return, the LDP would have to vote for plans to shrink the number of seats in the lower house and address the disparity in the weight of rural and urban votes. &quot;We have to achieve that as soon as possible,&quot; Noda said. &quot;We must make a decision and set a deadline. Let&apos;s do it.&quot; In reply, Abe said: &quot;Is that a promise? You&apos;re sure, right? Absolutely sure?&quot; adding, &quot;We&apos;ll let the people decide which of us is more qualified to lead the country out of deflation and get the economy back on track.&quot; Noda&apos;s Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) has a comfortable majority in the lower house but depends on other parties to push legislation through the upper house. That arrangement has resulted in political deadlock, just as Japan&apos;s economy risks slipping back into recession and while the country attempts to repair relations with China in its dispute over the Senkaku islands . Speculation over the election date has swirled around since the summer, adding to a lengthy period of political instability in which six prime ministers have been installed since Junichiro Koizumi&apos;s resignation in September 2006. Noda, who became leader last September, is the third DPJ prime minister since 2009. &quot;There&apos;s a real failure of leadership,&quot; Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo, told Associated Press. &quot;That&apos;s in part because Japan&apos;s expectations for leadership are unrealistic. But also because the quality of leadership in Japan is really low.&quot; Noda&apos;s decision was greeted with dismay by many DPJ lawmakers who had urged him to wait until the party&apos;s fortunes had improved. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun released this week showed support for the Noda cabinet at just 18%; Abe, meanwhile, is the most popular choice as leader. Abe has said he would take a tougher stance against China over territorial disputes, and suggested he would revise a 1995 statement issued by the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, apologising for Japan&apos;s wartime conduct. He also wants to revise the constitution to give Japan&apos;s military a bigger role. But Abe and his party&apos;s traditional ally, New Komeito, could fall short of an overall majority. That could open the door to a coalition involving smaller parties on the right led by the former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, and the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto. Ishihara, who launched the party of the Sun on Tuesday, has been discussing a possible election alliance with Hashimoto&apos;s Japan Restoration party. &quot;The most prevalent view among the public is that this country will sink if things remain as they are,&quot; Ishihara told reporters."}, {"sentences": ["New Tokyo trio For Tracy Hyde are similarly enchanted, but unlike a lot of their peers they incorporate more experimental touches into their music."], "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Indie"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-15T09:00:00Z", "title": "November's best music from across the MAP", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/nov/15/music-alliance-pact-november", "article": "Right click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the full 40-track compilation through Ge.tt here.  ARGENTINA: ZonaindiePl\u00e1stico - CinicosFor the 50th edition of MAP we have chosen a brand new band from a western suburb of Buenos Aires. Pl\u00e1stico&apos;s sound is a mixture of trip-rock with some electronic and acoustic elements that caught the attention of famous producer Raphael Gordon (The Strokes). Together they recorded a couple of tracks. One is Subir Al Tren, which was used on their first video. The other is Cinicos, previously unreleased, which is a great preview of their upcoming debut album.  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Courtney Barnett - History EraserIt&apos;s hard to pin down what exactly defines that distinct &apos;Australian&apos; sound. For all the ringing guitar riffs and choruses sung in unison etched into our collective memory, there&apos;s something about Australian music that still flails an antipodean flag. We isolate ourselves on the coast; we recycle stories about strangers, lovers and backyard melancholia; we make poetry championing the suburbs. Melbourne singer Courtney Barnett is certainly at home on her track History Eraser. A colloquial ode to The Triffids, ticket inspectors and nights with good company, this track is a perfect summary of the earnest freewheelin&apos; and rambling wit that makes music from this end of the world just so great.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigMauracher - Outer Space DancerOuter Space Dancer is the first single from the new, fourth Mauracher album Super Seven, out now on Fabrique Records. For this album, Tyrolean electronic musician Hubert Mauracher has teamed up with singer Sonia Sawoff (of Sawoff Shotgun). Together, they create synth-filled dream-pop with ethereal lyrics such as, &quot;When I close my eyes, I stop thinking&quot;.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoSexy Fi - Pequeno Dicion\u00e1rio Das RuasFrom our capital Bras\u00edlia comes Sexy Fi, a band that knows how to make a good first impression. Their debut album was produced by John McEntire (Tortoise) and received great reviews in Brazilian alternative blogs. Pequeno Dicion\u00e1rio Das Ruas is the song that opens the album and sees them experiment with indie-rock, resulting in a tropical, alternative sound.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsSome Minor Noise - Tape ExperimentsToronto duo Some Minor Noise&apos;s Tape Experiment gets its name from the fact that every sound used, except the kick, snare and vocal, was recorded through a 13-year-old cassette deck, an Optimus CTR-117 (Google it), to a very worn cassette tape that&apos;s at least 10 years old. The end result has a richness and humanity that&apos;s very often missing from electro-pop, and a perfect example of Some Minor Noise&apos;s refreshing take on a familiar genre.  CHILE: Super 45Nader Cabezas - Doble En El EspejoSynthesizer layers, guitars with heavy feedback and a lo-fi sound are the attributes of duo Nader Cabezas. On their new album, El Hijo Del Mounstruo, released through LeRockPsicophonique, their music goes deeper into this direction, resulting in dense and obscure rock but without losing focus on what matters - the songs. Doble En El Espejo is taken from this album.  CHINA: WooozyChui Wan - BerberChui Wan is a four-piece experimental psychedelic rock band from Beijing. Their lush arrangements of guitar, keyboard, viola, other assorted instruments and random sound samples often eschew reliable melodies and vocal harmonies in favor of occasional passages of minimal drone or maximal sonic layerings. They will have their debut release tour with Brooklyn-based band Psychic Ills in China this month.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloAlfonso Espriella - Cielo AdentroAlfonso Espriella is a tireless and dedicated musician who has been making alternative rock for more than 10 years. Joel Hamilton produced his most recent EP, Anima, from which Cielo Adentro (&quot;Heaven Inside&quot;) is taken. It evokes marked influences of acts such as Caifanes from Mexico or Robi Draco Rosa from Puerto Rico, with deep lyrics and an emotive sound.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianThe Savage Rose - Soldier On The RunOn Love And Freedom, The Savage Rose&apos;s 21st album since their eponymous debut in 1968, the legendary rock outfit stage love and politics on an amazing backdrop of hauntingly soulful rock - just as they did when they were a young band - taken to magical heights by frontwoman Annisette&apos;s breathtaking vocal and a performance I could never do justice to in words. Because it&apos;s anniversary time on MAP, here&apos;s a mindbogglingly exclusive download of Soldier On The Run.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraJanio Lora - Mi Nueva EdadFor this MAP special edition, singer-songwriter and dreamer Janio Lora has recorded a new demo. Produced by Argentinian composer Pablo Dacal, Mi Nueva Edad blends elegant tango melodies with poignant lyrics as a preview of what to expect from Janio&apos;s upcoming album.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaDa Pawn - Casi SiempreA band&apos;s music lasts over time when its songs become part of a generation&apos;s culture. Da Pawn, one of the revelations of this year, reworks a popular single by the important electronic indie-pop band Can Can into a beautiful folk-rock song. This track is taken from the free download album Malas Influencias (Remixes y Reversiones), which celebrates the 10th anniversary of Can Can.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogDan Croll - From Nowhere (Ben Gomori&apos;s Staring You In The Eye Remix)Dan Croll is a Liverpool Institute For Performing Arts graduate who doesn&apos;t like The Beatles, a folkie who&apos;s gone electronic, and a bespectacled boffin who is no softie - in fact, he could have played rugby for England until an accident waylaid his plans. Instead he&apos;s the new golden boy of indie Afro-tinged synth&apos;n&apos;b. From Nowhere is his debut single, a catchy slice of electro-pop with a breezy vocal about losing control and a hook designed to lodge in your skull.  FINLAND: GlueStatues Made Of Matchsticks - If I Didn&apos;t Comb My HairFolk trio Statues Made Of Matchsticks joins the 50th MAP post celebration with an exclusive song recorded at their rehearsal room this month. If I Didn&apos;t Comb My Hair features the band&apos;s signature laid-back acoustic sounds and a sweet pop melody to create a perfect sunset-on-front-porch kind of song.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredColours In The Street - Paper ChildColours In The Street&apos;s members are still in high school but have acquired a big following with only two years behind them thanks to delightful pop songs with strong English influences and a very thorough sense of composition. Having won several contests with only the few songs from their first EP, Euphory, they decided to push further and have been recording a second EP, Paper Child, due out on December 15, from which this song is taken. Watch them playing an acoustic set in a bathroom here.  GERMANY: ColtranTouchy Mob - Seven Hills (Afternoon Touchymap version)I&apos;m very proud to present an exclusive recording by my favourite German artist Ludwig Plath aka Touchy Mob, who was first featured on MAP in February 2011. He has reworked his song Seven Hills with guitar, bass and rattle - resulting in something he calls &apos;fuzzybuzzy&apos;. I love his velvet voice and how his attention to detail and songwriting skills make my hair stand on end.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaLe Page - IleanaLe Page is a secret worth knowing about. They are clearly ready to step out from the shadows and play timeless music intended for dreamers and romantics. Their new digital single feels like the product of careful, thoughtful growth, bringing in new influences while maintaining the group&apos;s core sound. It makes an indelible mark. Shimmering, beguiling and evocative, Ileana is a song that boldly merges the subtle and the overt. It will haunt you for many days to come.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnBiggi Hilmars - War HeroWar Hero is the second single from Biggi&apos;s upcoming solo album All We Can Be. It is a rearrangement of Ponds, one of Biggi&apos;s most sought-after compositions, which has been featured on numerous films, TV series and commercials around the globe. Biggi wrote the lyrics and dedicated the song to his sister Agusta, who had been fighting cancer for years. She is the War Hero.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarHarlan Boer - Kiri KananHarlan Boer is a humble singer who writes simple yet sophisticated lyrics and infuses them in melodic, acoustic arrangements. Kiri Kanan is a glorious indie-pop tune.  IRELAND: Nialler9Owensie - Distance Of Her LoveDistance Of Her Love is possibly the first song that could be called an Irish bossa nova tune, but that description doesn&apos;t tell the whole story. Lilting bright guitar with a Brazilian slant and Michael Owens&apos; threadbare falsetto lead the way on a song about a mother&apos;s faraway son, while the mournful brass underscores the lyrical sentiment. It&apos;s taken from Owensie&apos;s confident second album Citizens.  ITALY: PolaroidCrimea X - EssentialCrimea X is the project of Jukka Reverberi, from cult indie band Giardini Di Mir\u00f2, and DJ Rocca (Maffia Soundsystem). They play cosmic disco with krautrock and Marxist influences. If space stations have radios, they&apos;ll definitely be playing some Crimea X on repeat. In February 2013, Crimea X will release their second album, Another, produced by Bj\u00f8rn Torske (Smalltown Supersound), and Essential is a MAP exclusive preview.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesFor Tracy Hyde - Shady Lane SherbertOver the past year, Japan has been experiencing a boom in indie-pop music, with artists from every corner of the country embracing twee sounds. New Tokyo trio For Tracy Hyde are similarly enchanted, but unlike a lot of their peers they incorporate more experimental touches into their music. Shady Lane Sherbert brings in a sprinkling of chillwave, but does so in a way that keeps the song bouncy.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaBeangrowers - RancheroFor more than a decade, Beangrowers have been Malta&apos;s indie ambassadors, having released albums and played tours on both sides of the Atlantic. The female-fronted trio can always be counted on to deliver quirky, off-the-wall but nonetheless catchy numbers. With all three members living in different countries for the past couple of years, the good news is that they have now regrouped and a new EP is in the works.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaNi\u00f1ovan - Peque\u00f1o FolkApparently the beautiful Baja California landscapes are inspiring enough to write and record simple, innocent folk songs. At least that&apos;s what we imagine while listening to Ni\u00f1ovan, a boy/girl duo from the coastal city of Ensenada. Karina Ni\u00f1o and Efra\u00edn de la Rocha released their first album, Peque\u00f1o Folk, this year and won a place in this month&apos;s MAP through an open announcement we recently made at Panam\u00e9rika. Their song Peque\u00f1o Folk (translated as &quot;Little Folk&quot;) puts the emphasis on the infantile aura of this project, projected even in their own name (&quot;ni\u00f1o&quot; means &quot;child&quot; in Spanish), and perfectly sums up their ideas and imagination.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Vox Von Braun - Dig A HoleVox Von Braun are the undisputed chroniclers of the seedier aspects of Dutch provincial life. Habitual stoners, gonzo wannabes and possibly the laziest and unluckiest of outfits, you&apos;re more likely to see them mooching about all-night bars in Groningen than performing anywhere near you. But there&apos;s strength in adversity: this most charming of bands harness their kitchen sink romance to one of the most beautiful, crystalline walls of sound you&apos;ll encounter. And for such a horizontal bunch they have influential fans: the new LP was mixed by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and recorded in Brighton by Matt Thwaites from The Electric Soft Parade. MAP exclusive track Dig A Hole features Brenda of bozo poets Spilt Milk, with their second LP, Rich &amp; On Wheels, out in December.  PERU: SoTBFrancois Peglau - Life Is IndefinableThis month the Music Alliance Pact turns 50 and, to celebrate, we bring you an unreleased song recorded by Francois Peglau especially for the landmark. Life Is Indefinable is dedicated to his newborn son and has a beautiful acoustic warmth and much tenderness. The London-based Peruvian is working on his second album. You can watch the video for his latest single Everybody Loves Me, filmed in New York, here.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogPlug&amp;Play - Cities I&apos;ll Never Go ToPlug&amp;Play is changing. Having been on the Polish alternative scene for about six years, they&apos;re moving from post-punk/dance-punk origins to more sophisticated song structures, a good example of which is Cities I&apos;ll Never Go To. The lyrics of this track are a metaphorical journey through different cities all over the world. Since we&apos;re on MAP check if your hometown is one of them.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Balla - A Casa (Wall Of Sound Mix)For this very special 50th post/month, multi-instrumentalist and producer Armando Teixeira, one of the most talented Portuguese composers, offers MAP and its followers an exclusive new mix for A Casa, one of his tracks from Balla&apos;s new album, Can\u00e7\u00f5es. The original version as well as the full album are available for free from his website.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieLos Ni\u00f1os Estelares - Satya Yuga Est\u00e1 Por Comenzar (Sesi\u00f3n Archipi\u00e9lago)Clearly the product of an internet age, Los Ni\u00f1os Estelares unleashed their brand of heartfelt and biting satire on an unsuspecting Puerto Rican populace four years ago via YouTube. Half a million views later, the duo is back with Satya Yuga Est\u00e1 Por Comenzar, a direct sequel to their most popular song. Fernando Castro-\u00c1lvarez barely catches his breath as he lays out the path to righteousness through internal struggle, while Dar\u00edo Consta\u00edn keeps things simple on the guitar, allowing the lyrics to take center stage. This special live take, a preview of the band&apos;s upcoming fourth album, was recorded for Puerto Rico Indie&apos;s Archipi\u00e9lago video series and is available exclusively for download here.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseWe Singing Colors - Cantec De SearaAs a special gift for the MAP anniversary, our friends from We Singing Colors have prepared a simple but intense song in their familiar acoustic/electronic style. Their intimate set-up combines vocals, guitar, handmade instruments and beautiful lyrics in Romanian.  RUSSIA: Big EchoDZA - I Love UAfter the successful launch of his Surrender EP, DZA drops a new tune, I Love U, on his SoundCloud. The famous Russian beatmaker twists the classic chiptune-style sound into the house playground. Big up, Sasha!  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopRoddy Hart &amp; The Lonesome Fire - QueenstownWhen I launched the Music Alliance Pact with a dozen blogs in October 2008, I never imagined it would be going as strong as it is today, with 40 countries around the world now part of the project. For this, the 50th consecutive month of MAP, I&apos;m returning to where it all started with my first ever Scottish pick, Roddy Hart, albeit in his full-band guise. The Glaswegian has vacated the singer-songwriter path and is aiming for a Springsteen meets The National vibe with Roddy Hart &amp; The Lonesome Fire&apos;s self-titled album, due out in spring 2013 and produced by Danton Supple (Coldplay). From it, savour the compelling Queenstown, a MAP exclusive download.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Gema - BeforeGema&apos;s debut EP Before is a sprawling canvas of sounds, textures, layers, beats and samples that come together to form a cohesive theme of soulful disturbia. I&apos;m somewhat afraid of what I might find inside Gema&apos;s head. Every sound seems to have a sort of nascent meaning, which is scary because such premeditated behaviour has no place in the hands of a musician capable of carving another world straight into your skull. He&apos;s one of the newest additions to the Syndicate stable, and we hope the marriage of the two will equal three.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Diamond Thug - Lipstick StainsA smattering of synths, piercing vocals and some cutting lyrics turn Diamond Thug&apos;s Lipstick Stains into instantly addictive listening. The trio is made up of Danilo, Dylan and Chantel, and while the project is in its infancy, given the quality of work they are producing they&apos;ll soon be making waves.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieHugh Keice - We Are Islands (acoustic)Originally from Seoul, London-based singer-songwriter Hugh Keice counts both John Mayer and Jamiroquai as influences, owning to a sound that ranges from acoustic pop to neo soul. His third EP, Slow Tree, is scheduled for release in January. He has recorded an acoustic version of his new song, We Are Islands, exclusively for MAP.  SPAIN: MusikornerCeremoney - Morning BodyWe are always pleased to hear new tracks we can dance to, and that&apos;s exactly what Ceremoney has delivered with Morning Body. They describe their sound as post-tropipunk, probably influenced by the crossbreeding of Hispanic and British cultures you find in the Balearic Islands, where they&apos;re from. They craft post-punk with tropical, danceable roots, which is fresh to listen to and perfect to move your body to.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaLast Lynx - Killing SwitchLast Lynx is a Stockholm-based band inspired by the organic 60s, howling wolves and modern electro-pop. When those worlds collide and become one, magic happens. The young quartet mixes slick guitar grooves with well thought-out electronic elements and wonderful vocals, with amazing and highly addictive results. Killing Switch is the first single off their as-yet-untitled sophomore EP, due out in early 2013 via SoFo Records.  SWITZERLAND: 78sThe Monofones - Drop DeadThe Monofones hail from Berne and play straight-edge garage rock right in your face and heart. They&apos;ve just released their third album Super Hits. For the 50th edition of the Music Alliance Pact they have made an exclusive recording of Drop Dead, which is straightforward, raw and dirty.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATSeni G\u00f6rmem \u0130mkans\u0131z - Tar\u00e7\u0131n GezegeniKad\u0131k\u00f6y, on the Asian side of Istanbul, always boasts Turkey&apos;s most interesting new acts. The two young women who make up Seni G\u00f6rmem \u0130mkans\u0131z are BFFs who down doubles of rak\u0131, our national drink, on stage. It actually fits when you consider their band name means &quot;impossible to see you&quot;, a line from an unnecessarily depressing Arabesque song from the 80s that goes instinctively well with rak\u0131. In Tar\u00e7\u0131n Gezegeni, synths and drums take us back to that decade, with the sultanic melody of a toy melodica creating a weirdly elegant and hard-drinking piece of work.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouThe Pass - Real SummerFor MAP&apos;s 50th month of posting, electro-rock outfit The Pass have allowed us to post a web exclusive track off their new album Melt. Real Summer is a tornado of sound that builds and builds with each note. Have your ears perked from the three-minute mark to close - it&apos;s one of the best stretches of music this year.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sAudrey Holder - Cuando No S\u00e9 De TiAudrey Holder is a young woman from Caracas whose melodious voice is part of the Cantor\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Antonio Anzo\u00e1tegui, one of Venezuela&apos;s leading choirs.

The visually striking submission will replace the current, ageing structure, built in 1958 and which served as the main venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics. The 54-year old stadium, designed by Mitsuo Katayama and described by the jury chair Tadao Ando as &quot;announcing the birth of a modern Japanese architecture&quot;, will make way for a new venue which Ando said would see a modern Japan &quot;reborn&quot;. The stadium is scheduled for completion in 2018, and will play host to the 2019 Rugby World Cup, as well as forming the centrepiece of the 2020 Summer Olympics should Tokyo&apos;s bid prove successful. The choice of Hadid may prove to be a controversial one, however, as the single major sports venue her firm have produced was subject to significant budget overruns. The Aquatics Centre was anticipated to cost \u00a372m, but the final figure spiralled to \u00a3270m, a figure which may have been even higher had earlier designs for the venue&apos;s temporary &quot;wings&quot; been followed. With Japan&apos;s self-taught, Pritzker-laureate Ando overseeing a jury containing such architecture heavyweights as Lords Foster and Rogers, the former Japan Football Association President Junji Ogura and Ichiro Kono, who led the unsuccessful 2016 Tokyo Olympic bid, the contest required a number of specific criteria to be met, notably the use of adjustable seating and a retractable roof, while establishing a dialogue with its physical surroundings, particularly the Meiji Shrine. Despite Japan&apos;s staggering national debt, the stadium is set to become the world&apos;s most expensive venue at current exchange rates. Assuming a construction budget of 130bn yen ($1.62bn/\u00a31.02bn) is fully utilised, it will surpass the $1.6bn paid for the New Meadowlands Stadium, home of both the New York Giants and New York Jets. Moreover, it will not become the home of any of Japan&apos;s major professional sports teams, instead playing host only to a potential future Fifa World Cup, IAAF World Championships and concerts by performers of sufficient standing to fill what will become an 80,000 capacity arena. The question as to whether a return on investment is a viable prospect when the lifespan of modern venues is 40 years or less remains open, although it should be assumed that it will succeed the Saitama Stadium 2002 as the home of Japan&apos;s national football team as the latter continues to be devilled by problems with public transport. The competition, in which submissions were invited from firms which had both experience in the design of a minimum 15,000 capacity stadium and had won one of five major architecture awards, carried a prize of 20m yen ($249,532/\u00a3157,431), although the prestige associated with being chosen for such a landmark project may outweigh any immediate financial benefits. The 48 entries were eventually whittled down to a shortlist of 11, including bids from the sport specialist Populous, designers of Wembley Stadium, Arsenal&apos;s Emirates Stadium and the London 2012 Olympic Stadium; Australia&apos;s Cox Architecture, a major player in the design of Sydney&apos;s Olympics venues, and Japan&apos;s 2010 Pritzker Prize winners SANAA, one of the two favourites for the competition according to Kenplatz, a Japanese engineering and architecture publication."}, {"sentences": ["Abe could be forced to court smaller rightwing parties to prop up his government, leaving open the possibility that Shintaro Ishihara, the former governor of Tokyo who launched the party of the Sun this week, could return to national office.", "The two met in Tokyo on Friday in an attempt to iron out differences over tax rises and nuclear power, and could reach agreement to merge their parties over the weekend, according to Kyodo."], "tags": ["Yoshihiko Noda", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T11:00:59Z", "title": "Japanese PM calls December election", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/japanese-pm-december-election", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has called an early general election for next month, despite polls indicating he will lose. The election on 16 December could damage global confidence in Japan&apos;s attempts to steer its economy away from its fourth recession since 2000, and further damage ties to China over competing claims to a group of islands in the East China Sea. Polls show that the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) leader, Shinzo Abe, a hawkish conservative who has promised to take a tougher stance towards China, is tipped to win. Noda, who took office in August 2011 after Naoto Kan resigned, defied fellow Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) members who had urged him to delay calling the election until the party&apos;s poll ratings improved. He had promised to dissolve the lower house of parliament after securing opposition support for key bills on electoral reform and budget finance. The DPJ controls the lower house but depends on other parties to get legislation through the upper house. Speculation about the election date began in August when Noda promised the LDP he would go to the polls &quot;soon&quot; after it supported his plans to raise the sales tax. At least nine of the DPJ&apos;s 244 MPs in the 480-seat lower house are reportedly planning to defect in anticipation of a heavy defeat, effectively depriving the party of its majority. But it is not clear whether the LDP, which governed Japan almost without interruption for more than 50 years until 2009, will win enough seats to form a government with its traditional ally, New Komeito. Abe could be forced to court smaller rightwing parties to prop up his government, leaving open the possibility that Shintaro Ishihara, the former governor of Tokyo who launched the party of the Sun this week, could return to national office. Ishihara is attempting to create a &quot;third force&quot; in Japanese politics with the populist mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, leader of the newly formed Japan Restoration party. The two met in Tokyo on Friday in an attempt to iron out differences over tax rises and nuclear power, and could reach agreement to merge their parties over the weekend, according to Kyodo. Abe, who this week called on the Bank of Japan to print &quot;unlimited yen&quot; and take interest rates to below zero to boost the economy, described the election as a historic battle. &quot;We must achieve victory,&quot; he told party officials. &quot;That is our mission, and it&apos;s with that in mind that I will fight this historic battle. The LDP and the public have been waiting three years for this day to arrive.&quot; If he wins, Abe, who served as prime minister for a year from 2006, will come under pressure from inside his party to reverse Japan&apos;s recent decision to abandon nuclear power by around 2040."}, {"sentences": ["When it opened on a quiet street in the Takaido neighbourhood of Tokyo in June last year, 47 Dining&apos;s prospects were decidedly gloomy.", "As soon as he knew his parents had been found safe after being swept along by the tsunami in their car, his thoughts returned to his business, which began in 2009 with a van selling Fukushima produce around Tokyo.", "Kenji Suzuki of 47 Dining in Tokyo with Fukushima branded sake.", "Photograph: Robert Gilhooly for the Guardian    Anonymous callers told Suzuki he was bringing that contamination to Tokyo, while posters on online forums accused him of poisoning his customers.", "&quot;People watched the news and decided it was not worth the risk, even though we have never served anything that hasn&apos;t been tested and cleared as safe,&quot; said Suzuki, who moved to Tokyo 10 years ago.", "Octopus and whelks were declared safe this summer and, after trial sales at supermarkets in Fukushima, are once again on sale at Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji market."], "tags": ["Japan", "Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "World news", "Environment", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Restaurants", "Travel", "Food", "Food and drink", "Food safety", "Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Asia"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T14:55:21Z", "title": "Fukushima's food champion fends off taint of nuclear disaster", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/fukushima-food-nuclear-disaster", "article": "The laughter coming from diners in a corner of Kenji Suzuki&apos;s restaurant is flowing as effortlessly as the beer. The chatter cuts through the steam drifting from a nabe, or hotpot, in the centre of the table. There is talk of work, and praise for the chicken, vegetables and tofu being transferred to bowls from the bubbling stock. Their exuberance is unusual, not just because the working week is only a day old, but because every dish is made with produce many Japanese have spent the past 20 months doing everything possible to avoid. In an age when serious diners insist on knowing the provenance of their food, the example set by Suzuki&apos;s restaurant is hard to beat. About 80% of his menu \u2013 from perilla-infused pork to daikon pickles and sake \u2013 is from Fukushima. When it opened on a quiet street in the Takaido neighbourhood of Tokyo in June last year, 47 Dining&apos;s prospects were decidedly gloomy. Suzuki&apos;s business plan defied logic: to offer dishes made with ingredients sourced mainly from his hometown of Iwaki, just over 20 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, then still in a perilous state after three of its reactors suffered meltdowns in the 11 March triple disaster. &quot;We were supposed to open in April that year, but then the tsunami and nuclear accident changed everything,&quot; Suzuki, 30, said as he prepared for a busy evening. As soon as he knew his parents had been found safe after being swept along by the tsunami in their car, his thoughts returned to his business, which began in 2009 with a van selling Fukushima produce around Tokyo. &quot;The day after the disaster, I thought this place was never going to open,&quot; he said. &quot;In the weeks after, nothing from Fukushima was going on the market and all our restaurant promotion events were cancelled. &quot;But then I saw how the tsunami had ruined ports, destroyed seafood and agricultural produce, and I thought &apos;what can I do to help?&apos;&quot; What had started as a straightforward business venture became a mission to help the fishermen and farmers of Fukushima prefecture. &quot;The biggest problem was the nuclear accident,&quot; Suzuki said. &quot;Most people seemed to think that everything from Fukushima had been irradiated.&quot; His plans were not helped when, a month after the restaurant opened, tests found that beef cattle from Fukushima containing abnormally high levels of caesium had been processed and eaten. Confidence in Fukushima produce was shaken again last November, when rice samples from some parts of the prefecture were found to contain caesium levels exceeding government limits. Fukushima, once a byword for some of Japan&apos;s finest beef, fruit and seafood, had become indelibly associated with nuclear contamination.     Kenji Suzuki of 47 Dining in Tokyo with Fukushima branded sake. Photograph: Robert Gilhooly for the Guardian    Anonymous callers told Suzuki he was bringing that contamination to Tokyo, while posters on online forums accused him of poisoning his customers. Within weeks of the restaurant opening, bookings had plummeted as nervous diners stayed away. &quot;People watched the news and decided it was not worth the risk, even though we have never served anything that hasn&apos;t been tested and cleared as safe,&quot; said Suzuki, who moved to Tokyo 10 years ago. The restaurant buys produce only from markets where the produce has passed stringent government regulations on radioactive isotopes. At 47 Dining, the chicken, pork, beef and horse meat is all from Fukushima, as is the rice and most of the vegetables. Lining the counter are bottles of sake made from rice from around the prefecture. One glaring exception is the seafood. Octopus and whelks were declared safe this summer and, after trial sales at supermarkets in Fukushima, are once again on sale at Tokyo&apos;s Tsukiji market. But fishermen are still banned from operating in large areas of the Pacific off the Fukushima coast, and last month, a study in the journal Science found that radiation levels remained elevated in waters near Fukushima Daiichi, warning that large and bottom-feeding fish could be inedible for a decade. For now, Suzuki buys fish from Miyagi and Iwate prefectures \u2013 where most of the 19,000 people killed by the tsunami had lived \u2013 and from Hokkaido in the far north. Seafood aside, radiation levels in other produce have fallen. Of 105,000 or so food items from the disaster area checked between April and September this year, about 1,360 \u2013 half of them from Fukushima \u2013 exceeded the caesium limit, according to the health ministry. They included mushrooms, wild game and other produce sourced from forests, rivers and lakes, where radiation tends to be higher, and are all subject to bans. Armed with those reassurances, public concern over the safety of Fukushima produce slowly diminished, and people started coming to Suzuki&apos;s restaurant in droves. &quot;I eat here regularly because the food is fantastic,&quot; said diner Mika Matsumoto. &quot;I&apos;m not worried about radiation because we know that everything has been tested, and tested again. The farmers and fishermen who lost their businesses are doing their best to get back on their feet. If we are helping them by coming here, then that&apos;s a plus.&quot; But Suzuki, who recently helped launch a scheme to use restaurants to rejuvenate the economy in Iwaki \u2013 home to about 20,000 people evacuated from the nuclear exclusion zone \u2013 concedes it will be some time before Fukushima shakes off its association with tainted food. &quot;I&apos;m sure some people will never eat Fukushima produce,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time there are plenty of others who already are. But people eat here not because of where our dishes come from \u2013 they come because they know they&apos;re going to get great food.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Hara hopes people will upload images of the structures they build and customise from these blueprints \u2013 pictures will then be used in a final exhibition of the project at Tokyo&apos;s Toto Gallery in October 2013."], "tags": ["Dogs", "Art and design", "Architecture", "Animals", "Pets", "Life and style", "Interiors"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T15:35:32Z", "title": "Furniture for dogs: join the kennel club", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/16/furniture-for-dogs-kennel-club", "article": "The dog house has traditionally been a bad place to be, but if Kenya Hara has his way, that&apos;s set to change. Hara is a designer, curator and creative director of Muji and his latest project aims to bring a better quality of life to the canine world. His new company \u2013 Architecture for Dogs \u2013 provides architectural blueprints for products, each designed with a specific breed in mind, but suitable for all four-legged friends. Soon they&apos;ll be available on a dedicated website, free to download for any pet owner who wants to improve Rover&apos;s lifestyle. &quot;Dogs are basically forced to live in a human-scaled environment,&quot; says Hara. &quot;This may be out of our control, but I\u00a0 believe it&apos;s beneficial for humans to be cognisant of that reality.&quot; Hara asked 12 of his design and architecture chums to consider this problem and create structures that would make man think about his best friend a little more carefully. The results range from the aesthetically pleasing to the absurd. Elien Deceunick and Mick van Gemert of Dutch architectural practice MVRDV created a Beagle house on runners. The aptly named Atelier Bow-Wow made a\u00a0chair that lets a Dachshund sit at eye-level with his owner. New-York based practice Reiser + Umemoto contributed what looks like a spacesuit for Laika. The futuristic dog coat was made to cover up an employee&apos;s hairless Chihuahua that ran around the office \u2013 partly because not everyone found the animal attractive, partly because research showed that Chihuahuas love being in small, enclosed spaces. Hara says he chose dogs as the starting point for his project because they&apos;re a &quot;universally understood concept&quot;. He says his pace of life doesn&apos;t allow him to have a dog now, but he had one as a child. &quot;I had a Spitz. I had to walk him every day. It was a chore. I definitely felt like I lived with that dog.&quot; The project will be launched at Design Miami in December, but the instructions to create your own version of these products are already available to download. Hara hopes people will upload images of the structures they build and customise from these blueprints \u2013 pictures will then be used in a final exhibition of the project at Tokyo&apos;s Toto Gallery in October 2013. &quot;I wondered what happened at the intersection of dog lovers and architecture enthusiasts and I wanted to test that on the internet, so I thought of free downloads,&quot; he explains. &quot;People throughout the world can get excited about the idea of dogs together.&quot; These whimsical designs may not be for every pet owner. They may not be for every dog. But Hara readily admits that himself. He sees them as &quot;an unsolicited gift to dogs. Like all presents, this can render a dog bewildered, surprised, and maybe even happy.&quot; For more information, go to architecturefordogs.com"}, {"sentences": ["When the bill arrives, I start to wonder if maybe it isn't ludicrous enough: maybe they should be adding value, like they do in Tokyo, with monkey waiters or ninja attacks."], "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-16T22:59:10Z", "title": "Restaurant: Sushi des Artistes, London SW3", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/16/sushi-des-artistes-restaurant-review", "article": "The tides of restaurant trends move in pre-ordained patterns, dictated by the gravitational pull of&nbsp;the&nbsp;major metropolises. So Manchester and Glasgow copy London, which apes&nbsp;New York, which in turn cannibalises its own past, rose-tinting and sanitising and twirling its moustaches. \nUnlike in the theatre, you open in London, then move to the provinces. The rare occasions when things happen the other way round are generally met with sniffiness: a Manchester outfit recently landed in London's Piccadilly has drafted in Aldo Zilli to help its marketing push, deaf to the hoots of derision from the capital's restaurant-goers. \nWhat I've never encountered before is a Marbella restaurant deciding to branch out to London. And not a Spanish one, either, but a \"creative Japanese restaurant\" with \"unique chefs\" offering \"A TOUCH OF ROMANCE\" (their caps). What's that word again? Oh yes: hubris. \nSushi des Artistes is heroically ugly: dark and moody but sheeny-shiny, red-and-black stripes everywhere, huge TV screen belting out Yo-Yo Ma or the Bee Gees, light fittings either bowler hats or the kind of coloured chandelier usually found in teenage girls' bedrooms. It's the absolute antithesis of the calm, serene Japanese restaurant model, like eating inside a migraine. \nAnd who wrote the vast menu? A Chuckle Brother? Sashimi assemblies are called things like \"Salmon and Garfunkel\" and \"Love for sale\"; appetisers \"A kiss with edamame\" or \"Love me tender\". If&nbsp;an item can feature truffle, wagyu or foie gras, it will. Prices cause me to lose all feeling in my fingertips. \nThe food is equally absurd. There are big flabby prawns wrapped in a mummy's shroud of impenetrable noodles doused in sweetish goo. A polished tile balances a red wineglass draped with slices of yellowtail, all foofed with strawberries, slivers of lemon, barrels of cucumber, microherbs and lashings of flavourless white truffle. If Pee-wee Herman went into catering, he might come up with something like this. \nButterfish (Server: \"Have you had butterfish before? We fly it in from Japan.

Psy, the Korean rapper whose viral video sensation (the YouTube view count stands at 738 million and rising) spawned myriad copycat videos by everyone from the US navy to pupils at Eton, became the first Korean artist to gain household-name status outside K-pop&apos;s main hunting ground of Asia. It now seems certain that he has blazed a trail. Girls&apos; Generation , a nine-member Korean girl group who had racked up millions of sales throughout east Asia long before Psy made &quot;air&quot; horseriding socially acceptable, are poised to release their first album recorded entirely in English. Tentatively due for release next year by Lady Gaga&apos;s label, Interscope, the album will mark the group&apos;s first serious effort to court English-speaking music fans. The women, all aged between 21 and 23, are the obvious choice to take up Psy&apos;s mantle in the UK, where artists who sell millions of albums in Korea and Japan are known only to a small number of K-pop devotees. Since their debut in 2007 with Into The New World, the highly polished band with a penchant for unfeasibly tailored hotpants, have been at the apex of Hallyu, the wave of Korean pop culture that has cracked even the famously tricky Japanese market, the second-biggest in the world after the US. &quot;It doesn&apos;t surprise me at all that Girls&apos; Generation are doing this,&quot; said Steve McClure, the Tokyo-based executive editor of McClure&apos;s Asia Music News. &quot;The South Korean market is limited, so winning over new fans overseas has always been part of the K-pop strategy. The fact that they are riding on the coat tails of Psy is just pure luck \u2013 it has just made it easier than it might have been without him.&quot; The group&apos;s biggest overseas success to date has come in Japan \u2013 which is responsible for about 80% of K-pop&apos;s total revenues \u2013 where they immediately stood out among their saccharine counterparts from the world of J-pop. After a string of hits and awards spawned by their breakthrough 2009 hit, few K-pop watchers expected to wait long before Girls&apos; Generation turned their attention to the English-language market. They have overcome the language barrier with ease. Two of their five studio albums were released in Japanese, three of the singers were born and raised in the US and all are comfortable speaking English, which made for a comfortable appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman earlier this year. In the five years since they made their debut, Girls&apos; Generation have racked up sales of well over 30m in digital singles and 4.4m albums, assisted by clever promoters and a Korean management agency, SM Entertainment, that has been nurturing their talents, and their unimpeachable image, for more than a decade. The group&apos;s 2011 single The Boys was released in English as well as in Korean and Japanese. That year the band earned more than $88m for SM Entertainment, and they are expected to earn double that this year. &quot;GG&apos;s songs are infectious pop,&quot; said Robert Poole, chief executive of SomethingDrastic, a Tokyo-based Asian music promoter. &quot;It&apos;s hard not to like Gee, and as soon as I heard Mr. Taxi, I thought they had to make an English version.&quot; Industry experts say the group&apos;s brand of electropop and brilliantly produced videos will ease them into unfamiliar markets outside Asia. &quot;Girls&apos; Generation totally fit the bill,&quot; said Mio Scobie, overseas editor of Us Weekly magazine. &quot;They produce feelgood beats, instantly memorable choruses and, as I&apos;m sure people have already noticed, they&apos;re stunning. &quot;British listeners are used to genres being full of variety, so in terms of people getting disappointed that other K-pop acts aren&apos;t like Psy, I doubt that&apos;ll be the case,&quot; said Scobie, adding that Psy had been &quot;brilliant marketing&quot; for the K-pop genre. &quot;The album will be a hit regardless of how many new listeners jump on board. Girls&apos; Generation fans are fiercely loyal and will be ready to buy and download in their droves.&quot; The band&apos;s carefully manufactured image is evident everywhere from their myriad product endorsements to support for causes ranging from Unicef&apos;s work with children in Africa to aid for the victims of last year&apos;s tsunami in Japan. They reportedly live together, sleeping two to a room apart from Tiffany , who has a room to herself. It should surprise no one who has seen them perform that they receive more requests than any other K-pop artist to perform for the South Korean military. If Psy pushed open the door to an unsuspecting international fan base, Girls&apos; Generation could be the second stage in K-Pop&apos;s assault on Britain, McClure says. Fellow girl group 2NE1 and boy band Super Junior are rumoured to be preparing material for release in the UK, while Psy has promised to record an English-language follow-up to Gangnam Style. &quot;Psy is by definition a one-off and I&apos;d be surprised if he had another international hit,&quot; said McClure. &quot;But bands like Girls&apos; Generation have more staying power. The question is: will K-pop become a permanent fixture? I don&apos;t know, but I have a feeling that Girls&apos; Generation will stick round for a while.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Amour will, I believe, take its place alongside the greatest films about the confrontation of ageing and death, among them Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story, Kurosawa&apos;s Living, Bergman&apos;s Wild Strawberries, Rosi&apos;s Three Brothers and, dare I say it, Don Siegel&apos;s The Shootist."], "tags": ["Amour", "Michael Haneke", "Isabelle Huppert", "Drama", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-18T00:06:00Z", "title": "Amour \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/18/amour-michael-haneke-review", "article": "&quot;In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes,&quot; said Benjamin Franklin. The latter part of this assertion, however, is currently being challenged by some famous companies such as Google, Amazon and Starbucks and a good many familiar TV faces, while the unavoidability of death is a matter frequently evaded by euphemism and clouded by sentimentality. Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke has often been open to the charge of obscurity, ambivalence and obliquity, but no one has ever accused him of suggesting that life is other than a vale of tears best endured by honesty, love, unremitting work and a frank recognition of its essentially tragic nature. These qualities are to the forefront in his bracing new film, Amour, in which a middle-class French couple in their 80s, Georges and Anne Laurent, both music teachers, live out the final months of a long marriage. They&apos;re played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, two great actors with whom many of us have grown up and grown old over more than half a century that has seen Riva appear in Alain Resnais&apos;s first film, Hiroshima mon amour, and Trintignant star in Truffaut&apos;s final picture, Vivement dimanche!. Amour will, I believe, take its place alongside the greatest films about the confrontation of ageing and death, among them Ozu&apos;s Tokyo Story, Kurosawa&apos;s Living, Bergman&apos;s Wild Strawberries, Rosi&apos;s Three Brothers and, dare I say it, Don Siegel&apos;s The Shootist. It&apos;s worthy of being discussed in the same breath as the novels and plays of Samuel Beckett, of which Christopher Ricks wrote in his bitingly perceptive Beckett&apos;s Dying Words: &quot;We know about our wish to go on being, we human beings, our wish not to die. Samuel Beckett, who rigged nothing, fashioned for himself and for us a voice, Malone&apos;s, at once wistful and wiry: &apos;Yes, there is no good pretending, it is hard to leave everything.&apos; These are the accents of a consciousness, imagining and imagined, which braves the immortal commonplace of mortality.&quot; Amour begins with a pre-credit sequence that deliberately removes one of the film&apos;s two elements of dramatic suspense. The police break into a handsome Parisian apartment to discover, neatly laid out on the bed, the corpse of an elderly woman, her head ceremoniously surrounded by flowers. The intruders wear masks to protect themselves from some form of contamination. The word &quot;Amour&quot; then fills the screen and there is an extended flashback to the preceding months, beginning with the carefully dressed Georges and Anne sitting in the fourth row of the stalls at a piano recital. We hear the beginning of the first work but only see the audience: this is the only scene outside the couple&apos;s flat in the whole film.            They return home to find there has been a break-in, a threat that troubles and puzzles them, but which they take lightly and immediately have the door repaired. But someone has intruded upon their lives, something cold and unseen like death. From then on, there is an inexorable, exponential, existential development in the well-ordered lives of this loving couple. As they sit in their dressing gowns at breakfast, Anne gives Georges his boiled egg then suddenly freezes. She recovers, remembering nothing, and Georges thinks she&apos;s been joking. In fact, she&apos;s had some sort of stroke that turns out to have paralysed her right side and she is soon being cared for in a wheelchair and provided with an invalid&apos;s bed. But she can still talk, read, respond. Their only child, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), also a musician, lives abroad with a small son and a philandering English husband. She makes a fleeting visit, but her advice is shaped by her own needs and she&apos;s steadily excluded from the new life being constructed in the apartment. A former pupil of Anne&apos;s (pianist Alexandre Tharaud) drops in and plays a piece he first worked on with her at the age of 12 on the now disused grand piano. Steadily, Anne&apos;s condition deteriorates. Her coherent voice disintegrates, her focusing goes, carers are called in, one of whom has a vicious exchange with Georges. Devastatingly, Anne ages before our eyes, hallucinating, wishing to die. In a terrible moment of anger, Georges strikes her when she persistently refuses to eat, threatening the one thing they have cherished, felt being undermined, most feared losing \u2013 their dignity. Along the way, there are comic moments. Georges reports on a friend&apos;s funeral he&apos;s attended where one of the musical pieces played was the Beatles&apos; Yesterday. (Inevitably we think of the grotesque funeral at the centre of Patrice Ch\u00e9reau&apos;s 1998 movie Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train, where the deceased was Jean-Louis Trintignant himself, and the music included Mahler, Aznavour, Bj\u00f6rk and the Doors.) When Eva proposes visiting with her husband, Anne rejects the offer, commenting: &quot;His British sense of humour is acceptable in small doses.&quot; And there are felicitous moments: Georges imagining Anne well again and playing the piano and Anne suddenly asking for the family photo album, flicking through it and sadly remarking: &quot;C&apos;est beau \u2013 la vie.&quot; There is also a remarkable scene in which a pigeon flies into the hallway and Georges pursues it as if it represents some kind of liberated spirit. The film unfolds with a seemingly effortless grace, the apartment, like the sepulchral interiors in a painting by Danish artist Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, becoming a metaphor for the labyrinths of a mind. And the two central performances, rich in subtle gestures and expressive detail, are beyond reproach. As the film ends, its title will prompt many British viewers to think of those weathered medieval figures in Philip Larkin&apos;s &quot;An Arundel Tomb&quot; (&quot;Time has transfigured them into untruth&quot;), and of the poem&apos;s final line: &quot;What will survive of us is love.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["His photographs may baffle some as much as they enthral, but they make sense as a dark extended coda to Klein&apos;s more energetic vision.&quot; Sean O&apos;Hagan, the Observer     Tokyo, 1961, by William Klein    &quot;While Klein sought the clamorous beauty of the untamed city, Moriyama&apos;s photographs are an investigation into the very heart of the medium of photography itself, a strenuous refusal of objectivity and of the camera&apos;s promise to deliver honesty and truth.&quot; Charlotte Simmonds, New Statesman &quot;After the formal rigour and all-embracing humanity of Klein&apos;s work, Moriyama&apos;s nihilistic expressionism is not so much disturbing as numbingly repetitive.&quot; Richard Dorment, Daily Telegraph &quot;Ultimately, this exhibition is an opportunity to witness how pioneering both were in breaking from the confines of the photograph to create a visual language where perception can roam freely, in turn, producing images that seem to spring from the dark recesses of our imaginations and fantasies.&quot; Rachel Ridge, 1000 words photography magazine The verdict This exhibition assembles over 300 works by Klein and Moriyama and includes films, installations, contact sheets and vintage prints."], "tags": ["Photography", "Exhibitions", "William Klein", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-19T11:37:06Z", "title": "Klein and Moriyama at London's Tate Modern \u2013 reviews roundup", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography-blog/2012/nov/19/klein-moriyama-london-tate-modern-reviews-roundup", "article": "The critics&apos; view &quot;The exhibition demonstrates the visual affinity between their urgent, blurred and grainy style of photography and also their shared desire to convey street life and political protest, from anti-war demonstrations and gay pride marches to the effects of globalisation and urban\u00a0deprivation.&quot; Tate Modern &quot;Half of everything I have done is chance.&quot; William Klein &quot;I think that the most important thing that photography can do is to relate both the photographer and the viewer&apos;s memories.&quot; Daido Moriyama &quot;Like the late Garry Winogrand, Moriyama often seems to be intent on photographing everything, however mundane or throwaway.

Provoke 2, 1969, by Daido Moriyama. Courtesy of Daido Moriyama Photo Foundation    Many of Klein&apos;s wide-angle photographs capture people in parades and protest rallies. Captivated by people&apos;s faces, the photographer would join the marches and shoot his subjects close up from inside the crowd. The results are raw expressions of movement and vitality, in which grain and motion-blur feature heavily. Both Klein and Moriyama explore urban streets in black-and-white, experimenting with the medium and pushing it to its figurative limits. However when Moriyama explores the darker side of the city, his vision is more sombre and intense, lacking the immediacy and energy of Klein&apos;s work. Taken together, you can clearly see the influence of the elder Klein on Moriyama. However, Moriyama pursued his own radical approach to photography, exemplified here by the abstract work from his book Farewell Photography.

Inconveniences like jobs and loved ones (I&apos;m joking), combined with the sheer wealth of new releases splurged across multiple platforms on an almost daily basis, ensure we can only ever skim the surface of what&apos;s available. Offbeat gems and modern cult classics are likely to be missed in the process.  So as we draw closer to the end of 2012, Simon Parkin and I have selected 20 titles you may have missed, but which you should definitely seek out. They range from eccentric Japanese brawlers to modest indie releases, and they&apos;re all interesting and surprising in some way. And fortunately for you, many will now be available very cheaply: just right if money is getting tight as we approach the festive season (or if you&apos;re looking for affordable treats to bulk out that Christmas list).  Anyway, here are Simon&apos;s 10 suggestions, mine will follow tomorrow. Enjoy! LittleBigPlanet Vita (PS Vita)            Dismissed by some as a stripped down cover version of the PS3 originals, LittleBigPlanet Vita is in many ways the most delightful entry in the series. A conglomerate of new developers patch fresh, brazen ideas onto Media Molecule&apos;s original template, building worlds around the Vita&apos;s eccentricities, dizzying the mind with their creativity and inventiveness. A labyrinthine editor allows wunderkind designers to showboat their skills while everybody else can enjoy the downloaded fruits of these prodigies&apos; labours once the main &apos;boxed&apos; levels have been exhausted. Papo &amp; Yo (PSN/ PS3)            A mournful, affecting game that matches its roughness of execution with a roughness of theme \u2013 that of a young boy&apos;s struggle to live with and understand his father&apos;s substance addiction. Papo &amp; Yo juxtaposes the warm surroundings of a high-contrast, sunbaked Brazilian favela with a relentless melancholy, expertly conjuring the sense of confusion and loss experienced by any child living with an abusive parent. It strays far from gaming&apos;s usual go-to subject matter and, by illuminating a truly dark side of humanity \u2013 rather than the comic book approximation it usually invokes \u2013 it quietly broadens the medium&apos;s boundaries of conversation. Dyad (PSN/ PS3)            Barrel down Dyad&apos;s endless, esoteric tunnels and you&apos;ll catch glimpses of gaming&apos;s greats in its smeary, streaking colours. Tempest, WipeOut, Rez, Frequency all leave their mark on Shawn McGrath&apos;s stylish, cryptic indie racer, but Dyad stands alone thanks to its abstention from guns. Rather, your task is to haul yourself forward by tugging on light points, rotating the tunnel itself to line up anchors and zip forward as you attempt to race up the leaderboards. An unforgiving game but one that has the capacity to engender the flow state like few others released in 2012. GunLord (Neo-Geo/ Dreamcast)            An anachronism built upon an anachronism, GunLord is a 2D side-scrolling shooting game in the style of early 1990s classic Turrican released by an independent German developer for Sega&apos;s long defunct Dreamcast console and SNK&apos;s even longer-defunct Neo-Geo. Eschewing the indie trend of subverting 2D games of our youth, GunLord&apos;s straight-faced design and unironic proto-aesthetic is anything but amateurish, instead appearing as a forgotten classic, one whose success is far from dependent on nostalgia alone. Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise (Nintendo Wii)            Not the weary Nintendo Wii swansong you might be expecting this close to its followup&apos;s launch, Rhythm Paradise is instead an exuberant musical microgame collection from the architect of the WarioWare genre, Yoshio Sakamoto. Its parade of diverse musical stages have a wild-eyed sort of flippancy: thwacking a shuttlecock between biplane-flying dogs, screwing the heads on love bots in a rhythmical factory, jumping over the swinging arm of a metronome. Beneath the whimsy, however, exists a game of exacting tempo. The eccentric ideas delight, but it&apos;s the taut rhythm game foundation that challenges and beguiles as you seek to master this subversive yet revitalising take on a genre now fallen from fashion. Final Fantasy: Theatryhthm (Nintendo 3DS)            Winner of the award for the year&apos;s most awkward naming contraction, Final Fantasy: Theatrythm (that&apos;s theatre and rhythm mixing together. Sort of like oil and water) is a warm celebration of the music made popular by Square-Enix&apos;s long-running fantasy series. Taps of the stylus direct the microchip orchestra, as your party of four warriors (assembled from the series&apos; best-known characters) do battle with monsters on screen, their victories or defeats driven by your rhythmic ability. A staggering number of musical pieces are included on the cartridge, celebrating the outstanding work of long-standing composer Nobuo Uematsu. Dragon&apos;s Dogma (PS3/ Xbox 360)            It&apos;s been a bountiful 18 months for European fantasy in culture, from the sharp popularity of HBO&apos;s Game of Thrones series and the forthcoming Hobbit movie to the more game-specific success of Skyrim and Dark Souls. As such, Dragon&apos;s Dogma with its hills, castles, lore and tics of terminology drawn from a range of contemporary Western fantasy had the appearance of a me-too development, hitching its rickety wagon to ye olde trend. But in play, Capcom&apos;s curio effortlessly establishes its own identity, with a slew of fascinating multiplayer ideas and a single-player quest that heaves and rolls with as much drama as its rugged landscape. Tokyo Jungle (PSN)            Video games are often accused of a disproportionate focus on base themes \u2013 the guns, the power fantasies, the relentless quest for domination - but Tokyo Jungle&apos;s focus on primal, animal fighting and sex turns this sticking point into a selling point. In this post-apocalyptic world, humankind has been wiped out and animals of all stripes are left to roam Japan&apos;s capital, establishing a new order in the quest for survival. You assume the role of one such creature, anything from a Pomeranian to a deer, scavenging for ability-enhancing clothes, preying upon the weak and securing your lineage by attracting a mate. The purity of focus is nothing short of refreshing. Gasketball (iOS)            Mikengreg&apos;s follow-up to Solipskier, one of the strongest games for Apple&apos;s platform, takes the knockabout excitement of backyard basketball and combines it with robots and puzzles. It&apos;s all about scoring hoops, naturally enough, but your route to dunk is hampered by a 2D gauntlet of flippers, switches, lasers, saw-blades and portals. The inviting, sugary art style makes the sting of failure somehow more palatable, while a slew of multiplayer modes offer genuine long-term competition. Tiny and Big: Grandpa&apos;s Leftovers (PC)            Few game designers, having fastidiously arranged their game&apos;s levels and puzzles, go on to press the power to pull it all down into the player&apos;s hands. In allowing you to slice the tops off mountains with a laser, to pull rocks apart with a grappling hook and to fire props off into space with a rocket, Tiny and Big is a game of unusual freedom. It plays it so loose and easy with tools, in fact, that it&apos;s entirely possible to snooker yourself by destroying the set, forcing a shame-faced (yet irreverently proud) restart. It&apos;s a short game that burns brightly, infusing its key verbs of push, pull and slice with cause/effect meaning as you play as Tiny, a bookish scientist in search of his inheritance \u2013 a pair of soiled underpants."}, {"sentences": ["Beijing is also enmeshed in a tense dispute with Tokyo over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which sparked mass demonstrations in China earlier this year."], "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "World news", "Barack Obama", "Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "China", "US foreign policy", "South China Sea"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T11:42:27Z", "title": "Obama urges Asian leaders to step back from territorial disputes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/20/obama-asian-leaders-tensions", "article": "Barack Obama urged Asian leaders to turn down the temperature on simmering maritime disputes as he wrapped up his tour of the region on Tuesday. Tensions over the South China Sea and a separate dispute in the East China Sea overshadowed economic and trade issues at the East Asia Summit in Cambodia. The meeting brought together the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) with the other significant powers in the region, including the US and China, Australia, India and Russia. It was the final leg of the US president&apos;s trip, which has also taken him to Thailand and Burma, where he met veteran democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi as well as President Thein Sein. The long-running row over the South China Sea, which involves China, Taiwan and four Asean members, has become increasingly fraught in the last few years. China claims almost all the sea but other countries say they own parts of it. The waters are rich in energy resources and fisheries and an estimated $5tn (\u00a33tn) of cargo \u2013 half the world&apos;s shipping by weight \u2013 passes through them each year. &quot;President Obama&apos;s message is there needs to be a reduction of the tensions,&quot; the US deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told reporters in Phnom Penh. &quot;The US believes that any solution has to be consistent with international law, has to preserve the free flow of commerce that is important not just to the countries in this region but to the world. &quot;The US is not a claimant in the South China Sea, but we have significant interest there given its role in the global economy.&quot; Vietnam and the Philippines have sought to deal with the dispute in international forums. But China says only bilateral negotiations are acceptable and has urged Washington not to internationalise the issue. State media commentaries this summer bluntly ordered Washington to &quot;shut up&quot; on the issue. The row is coloured by China&apos;s growing strength and Washington&apos;s foreign policy focus on Asia, which has raised Chinese concerns that the US is seeking to contain it. Cambodia, China&apos;s key ally in the bloc, announced on Sunday that Asean members had agreed to discuss the dispute only in talks with China and not multilateral contexts. But Benigno Aquino, president of the Philippines, publicly rebuked his host by announcing his country had not agreed to such a stance. Asean has requested that China start formal talks on a code of conduct to avoid tensions sparking outright clashes. Washington has been pressing for the early development of such a document. Most analysts see little hope of resolving the complex dispute at present and argue the most important step is to prevent further escalation. Shi Yinhong, an expert on international relations at Renmin University in China, said it was not realistic to expect a code of conduct to be agreed swiftly, but that it was important to reach general agreement on one. He said China was concerned about maintaining good relations with Asean and that the bloc should look carefully at Beijing&apos;s stance on the wider issue, noting: &quot;China&apos;s position is that for the territorial dispute they will only accept negotiations between individual countries. For maritime rights I think it is much more flexible.&quot; Asean is trying to evolve into a more powerful regional grouping to help foster development. But the South China Sea row has threatened to undermine those ambitions. In July, a meeting of Asean foreign ministers failed to agree on a communiqu\u00e9 for the first time in the bloc&apos;s history due to disagreements over the issue. Beijing is also enmeshed in a tense dispute with Tokyo over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which sparked mass demonstrations in China earlier this year. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told Obama in a meeting on the sidelines of the summit: &quot;With the increasing severity of the security environment in East Asia, the importance of the Japan-US alliance is increasing.&quot; Earlier, the US president told outgoing Chinese premier Wen Jiabao that the world&apos;s two largest economies needed to work together to &quot;establish clear rules of the road&quot; for trade and investment. The meeting, held before the summit began, was his first with a Chinese leader since his re-election and follows a campaign in which both he and his Republican rival Mitt Romney criticised China for unfair trade practices."}, {"sentences": ["Although he has now directed three feature films, he spends most of his time on the road between Tokyo and his native Yamanashi prefecture."], "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T16:57:36Z", "title": "Saudade \u2013 by Katsuya Tomita", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/20/saudade-katsuya-tomita-profile", "article": "Uncertainty is not good for a film&apos;s career, and there are plenty of unknowns surrounding Saudade (a particularly Portuguese form of longing). Directed by Katsuya Tomita, whose day job is driving trucks, it has recently released in France, where no one has ever heard of his two previous efforts. Saudade focuses on the problems of identity and social discontent of several groups of rootless youths. Its characters are unpredictable, alternately languid and enraged, erratic and evasive. The oppressive atmosphere is equally difficult to grasp. The setting in Kofu, population 200,000, the capital of Japan&apos;s Yamanashi prefecture, lacks distinctive features, apart perhaps from its vineyards. On the other hand there are very good reasons to see this uncompromising chronicle of social decay, largely at odds with current Japanese cinema. The way Tomita ties together his fragmented tale is highly original. He gives us the impression he is not paying any particular attention to what he is filming, just picking up the beat of the street and observing his characters with long fixed-frame shots. You may at first be fooled into thinking this is just a trivial, slightly incongruous account of a clash between the construction industry and several hip-hop groups. But gradually something more subtle unfolds. Times are hard in the building industry and a bunch of youths are hankering after a better life. Seiji, initiated by his mate Hosaka to the charms of Thai &quot;hostesses&quot;, becomes a regular in the bars where these migrant workers ply their trade. Predictably Seiji abandons his girlfriend, a beautician, and falls in love with a hostess. A third man, encountered on a building site, sometimes joins this group. He makes the connection to the hip-hop scene, where things are grim too. Takeru belongs to a hip-hop collective, Army Village, its opposition to the local council tainted by rampant nationalism. That sentiment drives them to defy the members of another group, who belong to Kofu&apos;s substantial Brazilian community. Large numbers of people who left Japan several generations ago to settle in Brazil came back in the 1990s to earn a better living until the crisis caught up with Japan and they were relegated to the status of an unwanted sub-class. What ties all this together in the film is the impossibility of integrating the various immigrant groups in a national community founded on exclusion. To make matters worse, the degraded state of society, where money rules, leaves no option for its poorest members, denied any form of solidarity, but to fight it out with one another. Saudade is well worth seeing just for this harsh conclusion, reminiscent of the Japanese new wave, but what makes it even more special is the extreme gentleness with which Tomita highlights the cruelty of social interaction and the urban poetry he deploys to depict the cosmopolitan beauty of these contemporary outcasts. His is a very melancholic take on globalisation. Katsuya Tomita: an unusual route into movie making It is easy enough to picture the slim, youthful-looking Katsuya Tomita as a film director. Seeing him as a truck driver, his bread-and-butter activity, is more difficult. Although he has now directed three feature films, he spends most of his time on the road between Tokyo and his native Yamanashi prefecture. It took two and a half years to make Saudade. &quot;We worked at weekends and during the [week-long] summer and winter holidays,&quot; he says. Much as Seiji and Hosaka in the film, the actors who portray them work on building sites in Kofu. Tomita says the region has been hard hit by the economic downturn. &quot;For the past 20 years people have been subjected to austerity measures, but commercial films don&apos;t deal with such topics.&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t know how to enter the film industry, but I knew that the constraints of commercial cinema would prevent me from making the films I want,&quot; Tomita adds. For over 10 years he has been producing, directing and distributing guerrilla films with friends at the Kuzoku collective. Saudade is the biggest project so far. The aim was to describe the Kofu hip-hop scene and the increasingly difficult predicament of working people. &quot;But I added about 40 sequences while we were shooting,&quot; he explains. At the outset he had barely noticed that his birthplace was also home to a large Brazilian community, itself drawn from early 20th-century Japanese migrants to Brazil. Many of them are not really Brazilian and certainly not accepted as Japanese \u2013 some do not even speak the language. The length of the film (almost three hours) reflects this addition. This is the first Kozuku-produced film to reach a wider audience, both in Japan and at international festivals. Tomita now wants to make a film on Thai sex workers, but if the project works out, shooting in Bangkok will force him to leave his truck in the garage, for a while.

So it was only a matter of time before this cutting-edge technology found its calling in the novelty goods industry \u2013 and where else, other than that global hub of teenage trendsetting, Tokyo&apos;s Harajuku. Omote3D is taking the photo booth into the next dimension by offering customers the chance to be full-body scanned and given a plastic figurine of themselves. Always wanted a miniature you, but couldn&apos;t be bothered with the hassle of parenthood? Well look no further, because now you can have a pocket-size mini-me \u2013 starting at \u00a3160 for a 10cm version, rising to \u00a3320 for the 20cm model. Taking the form of a temporary pop-up shop at the Eye of Gyre exhibition space, the project is the brainchild of branding agency Party, which was inspired by the Japanese custom of shichi-go-san, a festival that celebrates children coming of age. &quot;The photo studio is a very special place for Japanese families to shape their memories,&quot; says Party creative director Naoki Ito. &quot;Our idea is to attempt to capture you and your family&apos;s portraits in 3D.&quot; The process involves a 15-minute scan with a handheld scanner, during which the subject must stay completely still, in the manner of early portrait photography \u2013 no doubt resulting in similarly rigid poses and fixed stares. The scanner cannot yet detect fluffy fabrics, small detailed patterns or shiny materials, nor can it read small accessories such as earrings, glasses or bags. So that pretty much rules out most PVC- and fur-clad Harajuku regulars. But Tokyo is not the only city getting stuck into the print-yourself craze. This week, the MakerBot store opened in New York, offering you the chance to print your own head for the bargain price of $25. More pixelated than Omote3D&apos;s offerings, the heads are constructed from monochrome plastic filament in a choice of lurid colours.     Mug's game \u2026 MakerBot plastic heads come in three sizes    &quot;Ever since we started, people kept saying that this is science fiction \u2013 it&apos;s not real. So we had to make a MakerBot store,&quot; says Bre Pettis, MakerBot CEO. &quot;This is beyond digital photography \u2013 it is the future \u2013 and to be able to create a 3D image of yourself is just amazing.&quot; The manufacturer also sells the $2,200 MakerBot Replicator 2, so you can print off as many of your own heads as you like, in the comfort of your own home. So where will this scan-and-print trend go next? If the mugshot is to be replaced by the mug-model, one blogger wonders if police departments will one day keep busts of offenders, or casting directors will have drawers full of little actors&apos; heads. Or if, like many Harajuku trends, it will all stay in the realms of novelty action figures and dangly things to hang off your mobile phone."}, {"sentences": ["With two lost decades under its belt, Tokyo is considered the capital of stasis, a place where nothing grows."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Bonds", "Quantitative easing", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-23T19:42:12Z", "title": "Is Japan really on the brink of a sudden downward spiral?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/nov/23/japan-downward-spiral", "article": "First Britain was compared to Greece \u2013 sunk by debt.

Hardly a week goes by without someone arguing that Japan&apos;s lack of growth, its ageing population, massive debts or its strong currency spell the end of a renaissance that propelled the country into the first rank during the 1970s. To many people the situation remains benign. If you are happy with your domestic situation, job and income, an economy that is going nowhere does little to provoke the forces of change. So far outside investors have adopted a similar view. However, not everyone is content. The traditional prop for a government that repeatedly spends more than it generates in taxes, is the Japanese saver. They put their money aside to lend to their own government. Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are famously 95% owned by Japanese investors (who believe misguidedly that it is better to get a return on loans to the government than pay tax, which has no return). Japan&apos;s savers have been ageing for some time. Every year there are fewer people putting money aside. In recent times the banks have made up the difference, but this has only made the situation worse as they tie themselves to the fortunes of the government in an ever-closer union. Polls this week showed the refusal to pay enough tax persists and voters are turning to opposition leader Shinzo Abe&apos;s plans to unleash unlimited amounts of free cash to push inflation up to 3% and interest rates below 0%. This free cash is printed by the central bank and will flood the Japanese financial markets in the hope that some people will spend it. It is a scheme that has worked in the US, but in Japan is more likely to mimic the Bank of England&apos;s quantitative easing programme, which has flopped as a spur to growth. In the UK, the people who benefit - those who discover their debt payments are cheaper - tend to hoard the savings while those without debts find their income cut as savings interest declines. All the new money gets swallowed by the banks, which are grateful because they are also suffering terribly, and recycled back to the government. Japanese banks are by some measures in better shape than their UK counterparts, but the rest of the economy is looking decidedly shaky. Exports fell in October by 6.5% on the previous year (imports dropped by 1.6%). Exports to the EU are down 20%, while exports to China have slumped by 11.6%, in part due to tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Sony, Panasonic, Sharp are on the slide along with much of the tech sector. Worse, domestic consumption dropped 0.5% and capital expenditure fell 3.2%, both registering the second-largest falls since the height of the 2008-09 recession. Graham Turner at GFC Economics says Japan stands on the brink of an almost complete reversal in fortunes. After years of rising spending and debt, supported by domestic and foreign lenders, the government could find itself spiralling downwards. He says: &quot;The determination of the government to beat deflation via a loose fiscal policy could be the tipping factor, which drives the current account deeper into deficit. In this respect, Japan may begin to mirror the peripherals of the eurozone, prior to the euro crisis, where a loose fiscal policy goes hand in hand with poor external fundamentals.&quot; The poor external fundamentals he refers to are the lack of demand for Japanese goods and the increasing unease of foreign lenders at Japan&apos;s plight. Already the interest rate the government pays on its debt has risen. It doesn&apos;t need to go up by much to add billions of pounds to the bill. George Osborne is also looking at rising debts and zero growth. He is relying on the Bank of England to create growth with money created in the bowels of Threadneedle Street. We didn&apos;t want to follow Greece, and we don&apos;t want to be the next Japan.

It&apos;s a long way from a private jet,&quot; Michael Woodford shouts out as he charges across five lanes of traffic and into the underground at Euston Square. In a previous life as the boss of one of Japan&apos;s biggest companies, Woodford was used to being served champagne at 33,000ft as a stewardess put slippers on his feet. But that was a very different life again from the one Woodford was born into, in a &quot;sink estate in Liverpool&quot;. As well as having a difficult upbringing in a &quot;shoebox&quot;-sized home, Woodford was bullied for being both Jewish and Chinese \u2013 he is neither, but he went to the King David Jewish school and has a slightly oriental appearance from Tamil ancestry. &quot;To get home you had to walk past the two big rough comprehensives, and they&apos;d see my school blazer and yellow and black tie and they&apos;d say, &apos;Are you a yid, lad?&apos; &quot;I would say, &apos;No, I&apos;m a gentile,&apos; but they couldn&apos;t understand that, which would always irritate them and I&apos;d get pushed around. Another day I&apos;d come back and they&apos;d say, &apos;Are you a chink, lad?&apos;. I&apos;d say, &apos;No I&apos;m English,&apos; and they&apos;d say, &apos;Ah, two number 16s.&apos; They thought they were hilarious.&quot; Despite the bullying, Woodford, 52, is still in touch with many friends from his formative years in Liverpool and Southend. But he says you will never catch him boasting about the private jet that would whisk him from the modest Southend home he has lived in for 30 years to Paris for the overnight first-class flight to Tokyo, or his \u00a32.75m to \u00a33m a year salary. &quot;My friends aren&apos;t businessmen, they&apos;re artists and teachers, that sort of thing,&quot; he says. &quot;If I went on about things like that, they would think I was a tosser.&quot; While he always tried to stay grounded as he climbed the corporate ladder at Olympus over three decades, it&apos;s tough, he says, to break ties with the luxury lifestyle. &quot;I don&apos;t like travelling economy on long-haul flights. All that pampering over the years has obviously got to me \u2013 so it&apos;s always business class,&quot; he says as he relaxes into the leather seats of the first-class carriage from Paddington to Oxford for the latest in a series of public speaking engagements. Woodford joined Olympus&apos;s British subsidiary Keymed as a salesman in 1980 and rose to become managing director of the division before he was 30, then went on to become head of Olympus in Europe before being called to the top job in Japan. &quot;But, you know, I don&apos;t live on a yacht or do silly things.&quot; It&apos;s not as if he can&apos;t afford to be a little silly. Earlier this year he collected a \u00a310m settlement over his dismissal for blowing the whistle on a \u00a31bn fraud scandal at the endoscope and digital camera company. &quot;It must make you feel sick, interviewing people earning all this money,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m quite leftwing, you know. I could be a communist, if that worked any better than capitalism.&quot; Some of his beliefs would go down well with Marx and Lenin. His kids won&apos;t be getting any of the \u00a310m. &quot;If I&apos;m struck down now, they won&apos;t get a penny,&quot; he says. &quot;Rather than being posh little rich kids, they&apos;re going to go out there and earn it on their own.&quot; Edward, 19, and Isabel, 17, were sent to state grammar schools until he left for Tokyo, when Isabel was sent to a private boarding school \u2013 &quot;she would have had to be sedated and handcuffed to go [to Tokyo]&quot; \u2013 where, Woodford says, she&apos;s educating her classmates. &quot;Isabel told me the other day that some of her friends at school were saying taxation is wrong \u2013 not the level of taxation [but the fact that it exists]. She told them that that&apos;s what pays for the hospitals and the schools for other kids who can&apos;t afford to go to nice little rich schools.&quot; His money will go to charity, predominantly those campaigning for human rights, such as Clive Stafford-Smith&apos;s Reprieve, and road safety foundations. Noting the irony that he had just run across one of London&apos;s busiest junctions, he says, &quot;But we looked both ways, right? And we were late. Being late in Japan is just about the rudest thing you can do. The contents of a meeting [in Japan] don&apos;t matter as long as you arrive on time.&quot; Woodford says Japan&apos;s obsession with politeness and social niceties is partly to blame for the country&apos;s fall from the top of the global power tree and the fraud that almost destroyed the 93-year-old Japanese electronics company. &quot;There is a disaster in Japan because of these social characteristics \u2013 the deference, not being able to question people in authority,&quot; he says. It was this attitude, he continues, that almost allowed Olympus&apos;s previous bosses to cover up more than \u00a31bn of fraud. He first got wind of the claims just weeks after taking over as chief executive \u2013 the first foreigner, or gaijin, to run the company, and only the fourth at any major Japanese company \u2013 when a friend emailed him a translation of &quot;amazingly detailed&quot; claims published in Facta, a local magazine with a campaigning remit similar to Private Eye. &quot;When I got to the office I expected everyone to be talking about it. But no one mentioned it.&quot; By lunchtime he summoned two of his most trusted colleagues and ask them if they had read it. They had, but said that Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, Olympus&apos;s previous CEO and then chairman, had &quot;told them not to tell me&quot;. Eventually Woodford demanded a meeting with Kikukawa and Hisashi Mori, then deputy president and &quot;Kikukawa&apos;s permanent sidekick&quot;. The table for the lunchtime meeting was set out with the &quot;most wonderful selection of sushi, but in front of my place was a tuna sandwich&quot;, Woodford, a committed sushi fan, told students at Sa\u00efd business school in Oxford later that evening. &quot;It wasn&apos;t just any tuna sandwich \u2013 it was a tuna sandwich that would have made British Rail in 1981 proud. It was that manky. The tuna sandwich was to tell me my place in life. &quot;That&apos;s when it really blew up, and the shit hit the fan,&quot; he said, before pausing hand over mouth in mock horror that he might have committed another terrible faux pas on top of arriving half an hour late for his own talk. &quot;Can you say that at Oxford?&quot; Although Woodford tried to embarrass Mori into talking to him by following him into the urinals and shouting at him eyeball to eyeball, Mori and Kikukawa refused to explain why Olympus had spent almost \u00a31bn buying three &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; companies and paid $687m for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) advice on the deal. &quot;It was the largest payment ever made for M&amp;A advice in the history of capitalism by a factor of three,&quot; Woodford says. Forensic accountants traced the money to London, from where it &quot;went to the Cayman Islands and disappeared&quot;. When the next edition of Facta was published, it claimed the fraud was linked to &quot;antisocial forces&quot; \u2013 code for the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. &quot;I was scared. Even telling you now I can feel myself shaking and feel my hands going cold, soon my feet will go cold too,&quot; he says. &quot;I started to think what was going to happen to me. My fate could have been, &apos;Michael has been under a lot of stress, he&apos;s been drinking and taking sleeping pills. He jumped off the top of a building.&apos; That&apos;s what happens in Japan.&quot; At home, his wife, Nuncy, (&quot;she&apos;s Spanish, Latin-tempered and very bossy&quot;) was having constant nightmares. And it was about to get worse. Woodford called a meeting of the whole Olympus board to discuss the crisis, but Kikukawa had changed the agenda. &quot;This meeting is to vote on the dismissal of Michael Woodford as CEO,&quot; Woodford heard via simultaneous translation in his headset. &quot;As he said the O, all the directors put their arms up. They couldn&apos;t have put them up higher.&quot; The next word was from Kikukawa. &quot;&apos;Mr Woodford cannot speak on this matter because he has a conflict of interest.&apos; It was an eight-minute corporate execution.&quot; He was forced to give up his apartment and take the bus to the airport, but Woodford wouldn&apos;t acquiesce to Mori&apos;s demands to hand over his iPhone. &quot;I got in his face. &apos;Are you going to take it off me? My wife will be phoning, she&apos;ll be worried,&apos;&quot; he says. &quot;Mr Mori didn&apos;t know I&apos;d grown up in Liverpool.&quot; Within hours he had given all the details to the press and the police. Kikukawa and Mori eventually resigned, but even then the rest of the board and institutional shareholders failed to support his bid to be reinstated as CEO. &quot;It is like a John Grisham novel.

Meal for two, including wine and service: \u00a350 Greed does a terrible marketing job on itself. It&apos;s all &quot;I want&quot; and &quot;gimme&quot; and &quot;hurry up&quot;. Greed and delayed gratification are, like energy companies and a fair deal or Nadine Dorries and common sense, deemed to be mutually exclusive. No truly greedy person could ever have the self-control, the simple moral rectitude necessary for holding back. To be fair, if I were to argue too strenuously against this the rhetoric would fall into the column marked &quot;protesting too much&quot;. I am not a big fan of later. I do not regard patience as a virtue but a vice. If a thing&apos;s worth doing it&apos;s worth doing now. But greed, like a mid-career Madonna, presents itself in myriad ways. One of the best lurks on the stove in any proper kitchen. It is stock. A\u00a0properly made stock is never quick or easy, whatever the crappy cookbooks with those words in the title tell you. It takes time and effort and patience and an instinct to parsimony. For a great stock is also the product of things lazy people would throw away. It is the final resting place for the cow&apos;s moo, the chicken&apos;s cluck, the pig&apos;s oink. It is the last hurrah for a life reared solely to be eaten. It deserves to be good. The stock at Tonkotsu is very good. It is a deep, rich, intensely life-affirming thing (albeit not for the pigs that must die in its making). The word means &quot;pork bone&quot; which describes the ingredients, along with piggy collagen and fat, simmered long and slow in water. Think 18 hours. The result is a cloudy liquor with a milky texture which would set into jelly if it dropped very far below room temperature. It may well be the best hangover cure known to humankind; a soothing balm which makes the lips sticky and reaches deep unto the very deepest part of even the most godless chap&apos;s soul. At Tonkotsu, a tight, dark corridor of a Soho ramen joint where you hunker down, elbows on the table, to keep the world at bay, this stock is the star. The restaurant, in the Japanese tradition, does a small number of things very well indeed. Two of us managed to eat the vast majority of the menu. There were crunchy, garlicky pieces of cucumber to pick at while we waited for our ramen to be prepared. There were crisp-bottomed prawn and pork gyoza (dumplings) to be dredged through a sprightly dipping sauce and though not the very best in town, they avoided the usual crime of stodginess. At a time when everybody seems to be pimping Southern fried chicken, their karaage was a master-class, the soft flesh surrounded by layer after layer of golden undulating crunch. To smear over this was their own chilli oil, an unctuous condiment full of sweet, soft-roasted garlic, dark toasted chilli notes and sesame seeds, and just the right amount of fire. It demanded to be spooned direct from pot to mouth. It&apos;s now available to buy in jars to take home, so the challenge is to find things it doesn&apos;t improve. Bacon? Check. Cheese? Check. Apple pie? Hell, why not? And then the deep, luscious Tonkotsu ramen arrived filled with silky noodles, slices of soft pork belly, half a\u00a0seasoned soft-boiled egg and with a\u00a0slick of black garlic oil across the top. It\u00a0is what greed is for. It is\u00a0a\u00a0bowl full of maternal instincts. It\u00a0is the way to make a bad day good. This is what delayed gratification is for. The Tokyo spicy ramen, with its soy-sauce based pork and chicken stock, filled with pulled chilli pork, is a\u00a0little more of a freshener; a wake up rather than a soothe down. Compared to some of the places I\u00a0have reviewed recently, Tonkotsu is cheap. That said there will be some who will balk at the \u00a311 charged for the ramen. That much? For a bowl of ramen? Well, yes, that much. And I would probably agree. It is rather expensive, but at least you know your \u00a311 will buy you something very good indeed. Incidentally, tonkotsu is clearly the hip thing right now. The Japan Centre on Lower Regent Street is about to open a restaurant entirely dedicated to it, with prices for its ramen ranging from \u00a38 to \u00a310.40. Reports please.

There will be no change to the Treasury and Bank of England&apos;s obsession with inflation targeting and &quot;price stability&quot;. Above all, he confirmed that there will be no reining-in of the banks; that banks will not be re-structured \u2013 to separate the retail and investment arms, and ensure that banks are no longer too big to fail. He confirmed this by appointing an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, Mark Carney, as governor of the Bank of England. The FT was right when in January this year it described Carney as [FT paywall]&quot;the leading example of a new breed of ambitious, internationally focused central bankers who view regulatory and monetary policy issues through a more market-based lens&quot;. He favours an &quot;open and resilient financial system&quot; \u2013 code for giving the banks free rein in global capital markets. And like many of his peers he believes that the key to recovery lies in all western economies &quot;capitalising on the immense opportunity that emerging markets in general and China in particular represent&quot;. Like others, he prefers exports over the expansion and strengthening of domestic markets. So be very afraid. Business-as-usual will prevail. And nothing will be done to constrain the City, and therefore to prevent the next collapse of the financial system. Carney is a central banker steeped in the culture and practices of Goldman Sachs&apos;s investment banking arm. Before becoming Canada&apos;s central bank governor, he spent 13 years with Goldman Sachs in its London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto offices. He held a range of senior positions. The most significant was as managing director of investment banking. In a speech made recently Carney made the right noises. He complained of &quot;a system that privatises gains and socialises losses&quot; and endorsed the approach that sets capital and leverage ratios for banks. He&apos;s even commended the Occupy movement for being &quot;constructive&quot;. But there is nothing in his speeches that indicates that he will help give Britain&apos;s real economy the protection it needs from its over-mighty \u2013 and still very dangerous \u2013 banking sector. Nothing, in other words, that indicates the real economy \u2013 the productive sector \u2013 will be given priority over the City&apos;s preference for reckless global speculation. Instead like many others who adopt a &quot;market-based&quot; approach to regulation, Carney prefers to tinker \u2013 retrospectively \u2013 with the capital ratios of banks. This is because he and many others in central bank circles know that most of the Britain&apos;s banks are very highly leveraged. That without the support of the Bank of England&apos;s quantitative easing programme, and its very low lending rates \u2013 all effectively backed by British taxpayers \u2013 Britain&apos;s banks would effectively be insolvent. And so Carney will continue with quantitative easing \u2013 which has provided British banks with the liquidity needed to indulge in speculative activity both at home and abroad, speculative activity that bears a scary resemblance to that undertaken before the crisis. He is unlikely to pressure his friends in the City&apos;s commercial banks to lend at low sustainable rates to Britain&apos;s productive sector. He is therefore most unlikely to reverse the most bizarre and historically unprecedented aspect of today&apos;s British banking system: the fact that those of us in the real economy are lending to banks. Their original mission \u2013 of lending into the real economy \u2013 has been turned on its head. Today Britain&apos;s banks are recipients of loans (deposits) from those active in the real economy \u2013 and subsidies from taxpayers. None of this is likely to change."}, {"sentences": ["They speculate that his 13 years at Goldman Sachs, which took him to London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, inspired his smart dress sense and air of authority."], "tags": ["Mark Carney", "Bank of England", "Business", "UK news", "Canada", "Americas", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-26T19:45:59Z", "title": "Profile: Mark Carney, the former banker with a quiet authority", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/26/mark-carney-profile-bank-of-england-governor", "article": "Likened in his native Canada to a character from hit TV show Mad Men, Mark Carney is certainly clipped and groomed like a 1950s Hollywood star. Sporty \u2013 he was a netminder for Harvard&apos;s ice hockey team \u2013 and dapper, he could be Tony Curtis, though with a little more menace behind the wide smile. As far as central bankers go, the 47\u2011year\u2011old more than stands out from the generally more rotund suits that populate the conference circuit. Critics say he wears his Oxford doctorate on his sleeve and is less than self-effacing. They speculate that his 13 years at Goldman Sachs, which took him to London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, inspired his smart dress sense and air of authority. Yet he is not brash, preferring to make few public comments and he rarely agrees to interviews. When he did talk about the speculation linking him to the Bank of England job, he consistently ruled himself out. If he does break cover it is to make considered comments that fail to register on the media Richter scale. Goldman Sachs has a way of giving its senior executives this quiet authority. But he made the headlines in the financial press last year when he came under attack from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon during a meeting of then G20 Financial Stability Board, set up to tame the banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It was the kind of moment that endeared him to the Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King, who is understood to have championed Carney&apos;s candidacy, and in turn chancellor George Osborne, who controversially rejected a clutch of home-grown talent to favour the Canadian. Dimon attacked Carney in a closed session for backing Basel III \u2013 the third global regulatory effort in around two decades \u2013 which demands that the world&apos;s largest banks carry extra reserves to prevent governments needing to bail them out again. The attack was leaked and Carney&apos;s credentials as defender of sound money was sealed. He could have further clashes inside Threadneedle Street, though. At a conference to discuss financial regulation, he received a forceful broadside from Andy Haldane, the Bank&apos;s executive director of financial stability. Haldane accused Carney and others of adopting highly complex rules to keep bankers in check when they ought to simplify banking. But Carney is concerned to balance the needs of banks and the economy with a sophisticated mix of rules. He told Euromoney magazine last month: &quot;The interests of the private financial community should be absolutely aligned with those of the regulatory community to grow the real economy in a sustainable way. And the more enlightened members of the financial community have that perspective.&quot; Carney spent his first six years in Canada&apos;s Northwest Territories before moving with his parents, a university professor and a school teacher, and two brothers to Edmonton. In high school, he began his ice hockey career which culminated in winning the US national championship at Harvard, where he gained his first degree in economics. He then went to Oxford, where he got his master&apos;s. Goldman Sachs followed. While in London he met his British-born wife, Diana, an economist specialising in developing-world issues and a star player on the Oxford field hockey team. He went back to Oxford to complete his PhD and then rejoined the firm before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a senior position in Canada&apos;s national finance department that included being the country&apos;s G7 deputy."}, {"sentences": ["At the World Bank IMF annual meeting in Tokyo this month, Jim Yong Kim promised to bring in an era of reformsaying: &quot;While I&apos;m excited by how much the bank has changed around openness and results and accountability, I believe the bank can go further.&quot; One step in this direction would be for the bank to address racial inequalities in its staffing at the senior level and to become open and accountable about its progress towards this end.", "Kim told the global community this month in Tokyo that he wants to &quot;bend the arc of history&quot;."], "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Transforming institutions", "Professional development", "Global development", "Race and inequality", "World Bank", "World news", "Business", "Race issues"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-27T13:10:00Z", "title": "World Bank reforms must embrace racial equality and accountability | Chris Simms", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/poverty-matters/2012/nov/27/world-bank-reforms-equality-accountability", "article": "At the World Bank IMF annual meeting in Tokyo this month, Jim Yong Kim promised to bring in an era of reformsaying: &quot;While I&apos;m excited by how much the bank has changed around openness and results and accountability, I believe the bank can go further.&quot; One step in this direction would be for the bank to address racial inequalities in its staffing at the senior level and to become open and accountable about its progress towards this end. At issue is the conspicuous under-representation of African-Americans at senior levels of the bank. In 1978 William Raspberry reported in the Washington Post that there were only three black Americans, out of 619 Americans working at the World Bank. Thirty years later (in a report titled &quot;Racial discrimination at the World Bank: a review of the treatment of black employees in recruitment, retention and justice decisions&quot; (pdf)) the Washington-based Government Accountability Project (Gap) reported that of more than 1,000 American World Bank staff of professional grade, four were African-Americans. The many studies the bank has undertaken over the years have generally acknowledged that race-based discrimination &quot;is evidenced in management&apos;s hiring and promotion decisions, attitudes and behaviours&quot; and that a culture of bias, stereotyping of in-groups and out-groups exist within the work environment. In response, the bank took several positive steps including launching a racial equality programme in 1998, the office of diversity programmes in 2001, the diversity and inclusion leadership awards in 2003, and in 2009, a code of conduct (pdf) that addressed diversity, inclusion and discrimination. Yet to most observers, these anti-discrimination policies have been largely cosmetic. Racial discrimination persists and even the bank&apos;s own diversity newsletter reports that &quot;despite considerable talk about the diversity and inclusion agenda \u2013 and new policies designed to advance it \u2013 the impression lingers among many World Bank Group staff that culture change lags far behind&quot;. A fundamental first step towards redressing discrimination, according to the bank&apos;s team for racial equality (TRE), is to develop &quot;accurate and complete databases&quot; and use them &quot;as indispensable management tools for monitoring the status and progress of black staff&quot;. This is consistent with Kim&apos;s call for openness and accountability. Yet the bank categorically refuses to track the number of African-American employees and, instead, collects information on national diversity based on passports \u2013 an exercise that it recognises is inadequate and misleading (pdf). From the point of view of bank employees with a discrimination complaint, the situation is substantially worsened because they do not have recourse to national laws and must rely on the World Bank administrative tribunal (Wat); the tribunal almost never finds for the complainant. According to the Gap (pdf), review of the records since 1996 shows that Wat found no instances of discrimination in any of the cases that came before it. A recent article in Forbes Magazine said the bank &quot;is so obsessed with reputational risk that it reflexively covers up anything that could appear negative, rather than address it&quot;. This is an extraordinary conclusion to reach yet, for an institution that claims that &quot;diversity and inclusion are at the heart of how we define organisational and professional excellence&quot;, (pdf) then fails to provide an effective internal grievance system for those harmed suggests an organisation more concerned about reputation than it is about justice. The bank is vulnerable to still more far-reaching critiques. Chronic inequalities may draw attention to past failures to deal with development challenges such as Africa&apos;s HIV/Aids crisis, malaria and tuberculosis in the 1990s where severe under-representation of Africans on its board of governors and in regional offices, and the general lack of an African voice, show that inequalities affect output and outcomes. The bank, as the lead donor in SSA&apos;s health sector in the 1990s, allocated $552m to HIV (1986-96): $160m went to Brazil, a middle-income country with an HIV prevalence rate of less than 1%, while $274m was received by Africa. In any organisation, raced-based discrimination will inevitably have a detrimental effect on its legitimacy, credibility, effectiveness and staff morale. Kim told the global community this month in Tokyo that he wants to &quot;bend the arc of history&quot;. Dealing with its long-standing inequalities in Washington DC and its own institutional weaknesses is a good place to start.

The Red and White Song Battle, one of the most keenly anticipated TV programmes of the year, will instead feature an all-Japanese lineup that includes the popular girl group AKB48, their sister act SKE48, and the veteran crooners Smap. But there was no room among the 50 acts announced this week for the K-pop sensation Girls&apos; Generation, who have sold millions of albums in Japan and won praise for their support for the 11 March tsunami victims. The nine-member group, who will reportedly release their first album recorded entirely in English next year, made their debut in last year&apos;s contest, joining fellow Korean artists Kara and Tohoshinki. NHK, which has broadcast the show for more than 60 years, said politics was not behind the decision to drop Korean performers. &quot;It has nothing to do with the souring of relations between Japan and Korea,&quot; the show&apos;s manager, Taro Furutani, told reporters. &quot;Korean singers were dropped after reviewing how popular they were over 2012, and after looking at support for them among Japanese fans.&quot; An NHK statement was more ambiguous, saying Korean acts had not been chosen &quot;considering public opinion and their activities this year&quot;. Longstanding tensions over rival claims to a pair of islands, known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea, were reignited in August when Lee Myung-bak became the first sitting president to visit the territory. Amid furious protests from Japan, the dispute began to seep into the country&apos;s cultural ties. A Japanese foreign ministry official said the popular actor Song Il Gook would no longer be welcome in Japan after he took part in a swimming relay between the Korean mainland and Dokdo, while nationalists held small demonstrations in Shin-Okubo, a Tokyo neighbourhood at the centre of the Korean pop culture boom in Japan. Members of Girls&apos; Generation drew criticism in Japan for having previously voiced support for Seoul&apos;s claims over the islands. Despite signs that K-pop&apos;s popularity has waned this year, the group&apos;s current single, Flower Power, was No 4 on Oricon&apos;s daily chart on Monday, according to McClureMusic.com. The snub could be bad news for Korean management agencies with groups such as Girls&apos; Generation on their books: they have built their financial success largely on the back of sales in Japan, whose music market is 15 times bigger than South Korea&apos;s. Several Korean acts have made the NHK lineup in recent years, and the show has traditionally featured other Asian singers and a handful from the US, including Paul Simon in 1990. The contest, which is essential viewing for millions of families on 31 December, runs for more than four hours and ends minutes before Japan rings in the New Year."}, {"sentences": ["Now marvellous musical-skating spray-&apos;em-up Jet Set Radio has appeared on iOS and Android, as you zoom around Tokyo leaving graffiti in your wake."], "tags": ["Games", "Apps", "iPhone", "iPad", "Android", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Mobile phones", "Mobile", "Technology", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-29T13:09:00Z", "title": "20 Best iPhone, iPad and Android games this week", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/nov/29/best-mobile-games-jet-set-radio", "article": "Welcome to our weekly roundup of the best new games for smartphones and tablets, from console classics and casual multiplayer games through to driving, zombies and, er, zombie bowling. As ever, all these games were released in the last seven days. Prices are included, but bear in mind where a game is marked as Free, it&apos;s highly likely to be using in-app purchases. Actually, a lot of the paid games are also using IAP nowadays too. One note: no Windows Phone games. I may be missing something, but usually there&apos;s at least one new Xbox-integrating Windows Phone game a week, but one&apos;s been elusive this week. Hopefully that&apos;ll change next week though. On with this week&apos;s selection: Jet Set Radio (\u00a32.99) Oh, I miss the Dreamcast \u2013\u00a0a console ahead of its time with its online features, and with some cracking games that deserved a wider audience than they got. Something that&apos;s been rectified since the Dreamcast&apos;s demise with ports to various platforms. Now marvellous musical-skating spray-&apos;em-up Jet Set Radio has appeared on iOS and Android, as you zoom around Tokyo leaving graffiti in your wake. The link above is for Android but here&apos;s the iOS version. Android / iPhone / iPad Chaos Rings Omega (\u00a38.99) Or Chaos Rings \u03a9 if you want the official title on the Google Play store. This is from Square Enix, a conversion of its iOS roleplaying game, where you&apos;re taking part in a &quot;fight to the death&quot; tournament, battling a succession of fantasy foes. The \u00a38.99 price is certainly bold for Android, although in the week since the game&apos;s release, it&apos;s yet to pass 500 sales.Android BattleFriends at Sea (Free) Moving on from more-hardcore games, how about someone giving Battleships the &apos;With Friends&apos; multiplayer treatment? No, not Zynga: developer Tequila Mobile is the company responsible here, with asynchronous watery ship-battles against Facebook friends, complete with neat graphics and the ability to play across different devices.Android / iPhone / Android Arcane Legends (Free) This online co-operative RPG (&quot;with pets&quot;) has been very popular on Android, with more than 1m downloads and over 20k five-star ratings. Now it&apos;s available on iOS too. It sees you taking control of a hero, teaming up with other players and battling a succession of foes, while unlocking new skills and finding animals to help out. There&apos;s a solo mode too, if you&apos;re feeling unsocial.iPhone / iPad Hamilton&apos;s Adventure THD (\u00a32.59) Fatshark&apos;s new game is a port of an existing PC/console title, where you explore 22 levels of puzzle-action challenges with adventurer Hamilton and his pet bird Sasha. The idea being that you use both characters to work your way through the traps and enemies. It works on Tegra 3-powered devices only for now, and has an additional Expansion version with more chapters.Android Contract Killer Zombies 2 (Free) Glu&apos;s freemium Contract Killer games have been very popular, so why not add zombies into the mix? That&apos;s the pitch here: you control a heroine called Evelyn who&apos;s trying to solve an undead outbreak while clearing out &quot;the Savehaven Research Center&quot;. Any resemblance to the Resident Evil games is... Well, it&apos;s presumably entirely intentional.iPhone / iPad Hyperwave (\u00a30.69) Released for iOS a few weeks ago, sci-fi shooter Hyperwave is now also on Android devices, aiming to blend the old (Space Invaders) with the new (Geometry Wars, Super Crossfire) in its genre. That means waves of enemies to shoot, power-ups to collect, and LOTS of neon.Android Word Derby (\u00a30.69) A number of developers are currently trying to push the word-game genre forward on mobile devices, with the success of Letterpress proving that innovation can be rewarded in downloads. Word Derby is a new release from Chillingo that takes a quirky approach: virtual horse races powered by making words to score points. Up to four players can compete in each match.iPhone / iPad Zen Shapes: The Way of the Brush (\u00a30.69) For word games, also read puzzle games, with the app stores still a fertile spawning ground for new spins on matching and sorting games. Zen Shapes takes calligraphy as its inspiration, as you take virtual scraps of paper and turn them into shapes against the clock. It&apos;s one of the most moreish games this week.iPhone / iPad Chop Chop Ninja World (Free) With more than 7m downloads so far, Gamerizon&apos;s Chop Chop games have quite a fanbase. Now the company is bumping up its ambitions with an &quot;epic social platformer&quot; where you play a ninja kicking (and chopping) his way across a series of levels, while connecting with friends who are building their own kingdoms.iPhone / iPad The Bowling Dead (Free) Yup: zombie bowling. Or, to give you the pitch: &quot;In a world overrun by an undead horde, one man stands in the way of complete annihilation of the human race. One man... and his balls.&quot; It sounds ridiculous, but might just work as you bowl your way through more than 40 levels unlocking new balls as you go.iPhone / iPad Vectrex (Free) This one&apos;s getting gamers of a certain age hot under the collar: an iOS port of the Vectrex games console from the early 1980s, including games like Blitz, Scramble and Pole Position, with more to come via in-app purchase. The app is designed to resemble the original console, and it also plays nice with the retro iCade accessory.iPhone / iPad Fashion Inc. by Stardoll (Free) Almost the polar opposite in likely-demographic terms from Vectrex, Fashion Inc. is a game offshoot from virtual world Stardoll, where you have to run your own fashion house, designing, making and selling posh clobber, with a connection back to the main Stardoll world to collect exclusive items.iPhone / iPad Flashout 3D (\u00a31.49) This game&apos;s influences are fairly clear: futuristic flying vehicles with wings whizzing round twisty tracks to an electronica soundtrack, anyone? That&apos;d be Wipeout. Expect eye-blasting visuals, lots of weapons and upgrades, and the obligatory pulse-racing music.iPhone / iPad Wombi Detective (\u00a31.49) Something for the youngest iOS users here: a game from Swedish developer Wombi Apps with a suitably hard-boiled detective trying to solve a robbery by interrogating witnesses and hunting for clues. Atmospheric film noir-esque music accompanies the action, which is tuned for children as young as four to have fun with.iPhone / iPad Crazy Fairies Beta (Free) As the title implies, this is a chance to get in early on an interesting new game, but there may be some rough edges. It&apos;s the work of Spicy Horse, the new venture from developer veteran American McGee, taking the form of a &quot;multiplayer turn-based artillery game&quot; (think Worms) with a fairytale setting. It looks imaginative and intriguing in equal measures.Android Dropple. (Free) Developer Foundation Mobile won plaudits for its Lumi game on iOS, but now it&apos;s returned with an accessible action game that sees you tilting your device to navigate through more than 170 levels, avoiding traps and collecting golden droplets to boost your score. It has the makings of a word-of-mouth hit.iPhone / iPad Mission: An Investigatore Steffani Mystery (\u00a35.99) Immersive mystery game or marketing campaign for a music album? Both, actually. This is the work of Somethin&apos; Else, which made innovative audio games Papa Sangre and The Nightjar. This project is for Universal Music though, showing off songs from the latest album by classical artist Cecilia Bartoli. Those tracks provide the background, but the game sees you solving a novella-length mystery as a 17th-century diplomat.iPad Sailboat Championship (\u00a31.59) Yes, a niche, but a very good-looking one, and with Team GB being not-half-bad at sailing, there may well be a decent audience out there for this sailboat racing game, which has been out on iOS for a little while now too. It sees you racing against a host of other boats, trying not to get distracted by the spangly water effects.Android Governor of Poker 2 (\u00a32.49) Poker games are pretty popular on iOS, and this sequel looks like it has plenty of character to build on the 3m downloads of its predecessor. The twist here is that there&apos;s a story wrapped around the poker matches, as you try to &quot;take over Texas&quot; with your winnings, travelling from city to city. No online multiplayer element, but there is Game Center integration to compare your achievements against friends.iPhone / iPad That&apos;s our selection, but what have you been playing on your smartphone or tablet?

Permeating the whole of Threadneedle Street&apos;s latest update on the state of the financial sector is the conviction that, as with Japan in the 1990s, the sickness of the banking sector could throttle the life out of the economy. With Britain already half way through its own lost decade, the Bank&apos;s financial policy committee believes immediate action is needed that will force lenders to improve their financial resilience. If the warning sounds far-fetched, then compare and contrast. Britain had a long period of growth that ended with a massive property bubble. So did Japan. The UK banks lent far too much than was wise in the 2000s to property companies against too little capital. In doing so they followed a trail blazed by Japanese banks two decades earlier. When Britain&apos;s party finally ended, the result was an economic wasteland of over-indebted consumers and over-leveraged banks. In a repeat of Japan&apos;s experience, the credit taps were turned off and growth shuddered to a halt. Japan ended up with a zombie economy in which zombie banks were lending to zombie companies. Firms that would in normal circumstances have gone bust were kept on life support by lenders who themselves were kept in the realm of the living dead courtesy of easy credit and softly-softly financial regulation from Tokyo. Worryingly, the UK is showing signs of heading in the same direction. One in 12 companies are able to repay only the interest on their debts and between 5% and 8% of mortgage payers are able to stay in their homes only because lenders are going easy on them. The Bank is particularly concerned about the commercial property sector, which accounts for half of all commercial loans. One third of commercial real estate loans by value are subject to some sort of forbearance, and losses could be higher than lenders are estimating. To make matters worse, the Bank thinks accounting rules are allowing lenders to systematically underestimate risks when assessing loans, and that they will eventually face a much higher bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance than they have so far admitted. The Bank was coy yesterday on putting a figure on the total capital shortfall faced by the big UK banks, but on some estimates it could be close to \u00a360bn. Threadneedle Street wants banks to raise more capital without choking off lending to the economy, something which is easier said than done. The state has a big stake in two of the biggest UK banks \u2013 RBS and Lloyds banking group \u2013 and George Osborne has made it clear that he is not going to ask the taxpayer to stump up more capital. With investor confidence in banks at a low ebb, drumming up enthusiasm for rights&apos; issues could be tough. King says there are other ways round the problem, such as banks selling off non-core parts of their business or by raising money through contingent capital \u2013 debt instruments that can be converted into equity in periods of stress. Bank shares rose slightly yesterday because there had been concern that King would specify what individual banks would have to do and by when. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that the issue of bank capital has been kicked into the long grass. The FPC is deadly serious about this because until the banks are sorted out the economy will remain in limbo. Raising interest rates will mean that the policy of &quot;extend and pretend&quot; towards non-performing loans will have to end. Banks will have to be robust enough to cope and at the moment they are not. So, the Bank means it all right. The real question is why it has taken it so long to get tough."}, {"sentences": ["There are already well established specialist universities of the arts in other countries and often with fewer than 4,000 students such as Tokyo University of the Arts or ZHdk in Zurich."], "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "Policy", "Reforms", "Management and administration", "Widening participation", "Student experience", "Admissions", "Higher education", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2012-11-29T17:57:05Z", "title": "University shakeup will help society and sector 'value our creative thinkers'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/nov/29/university-college-title-reforms-arts", "article": "It is billed as the biggest creation of universities since 1992. This week universities and science minister David Willetts made the announcement that 10 higher education colleges have met the criteria to be awarded university title and he has recommended them to be put forward to Privy Council for formal approval. Norwich University College of the Arts (NUCA) is one of these. The announcement is very significant for specialist institutions like ours. It removes the anomaly that granted a university title on the basis of size not quality, seeing those with fewer than 4,000 students granted the &apos;University College&apos; designation. On our campus there is a great deal of excitement among our 2,000 strong community and it is important news for Norwich, a creative city that will soon boast two universities. But will something that could be perceived as essentially a rebranding exercise change anything? Why is it so important to us that the Privy Council accepts our application to be Norwich University of the Arts? We are a selective institution and this year, against the sector trend, recruited to the maximum number of students permitted. As a specialist arts institution, former NUCA tutors include fine artists such as Lucian Freud and Ana Maria Pacheco. Last year alone our graduates between them received one Oscar nomination, two BAFTAs and two D&amp;AD Yellow Pencils. The Harry Potter film set, Rastamouse and Bob the Builder were all created or animated by our graduates. Some of our design students have gone on to lead successful agencies; others work in creative roles in organisations such as the Sunday Times, Tate and Sony. So, what began as the Norwich School of Design has been contributing to creativity and innovation in the UK for almost 170 years and we achieve all this every day without being recognised as a university. The same is true of the other specialist institutions on the list \u2013 each one at the heart of their cities and our wider economy. However, in an increasingly marketised environment for higher education, universities need absolute clarity and distinctiveness in their offer. There are already well established specialist universities of the arts in other countries and often with fewer than 4,000 students such as Tokyo University of the Arts or ZHdk in Zurich. Other world renowned universities are either specialist or relatively small. The term &apos;university college&apos; is specific to the UK and the confusion it causes to students and parents both here and in the wider world has been very apparent. It&apos;s not clear to anyone why the university title was based on scale. The clarity on title is also very much welcomed by current students and graduates who deserve recognition for their hard work and commitment to the creativity, innovation and academic rigour that makes the UK a world leader in advertising, culture, publishing, film, digital games and fashion. During these times of economic challenge we need to value our creative thinkers more than ever and this ruling helps us do just that.

Matt Smooth, curator of street art exhibition #ScratchEXPO17, hosts this evening of films, talks, Q&amp;A and live graffiti demonstration with artists Remi Rough and Kid Acne.  Remi Rough has been breaking boundaries with the aid of a spray can and a paintbrush for over 26 years. His art moved from the south London streets to the galleries with his debut show in 1989 and has since gone on to exhibit internationally throughout London, Paris, Tokyo, LA, Miami, Hong Kong and beyond. Transcending the traditional and somewhat idealised vision of a graffiti writer, his work has pushed the boundaries as he continues to embrace this constantly evolving art form. His work has also appeared in the publications Graffiti World, Abstract Graffiti and Untitled III and was featured in the award winning film &apos;Ghost Village Project&apos;. Remi was invited to speak at the sell-out Tate Modern &apos;Street Art Exhibition&apos; in 2008 and published his first book &apos;Lost Colours and Alibis&apos; in 2009. Tutor profiles Kid Acne is an artist, illustrator and hip-hop musician. He was born in Lilongwe, Malawi in 1978 and currently lives and works in Sheffield. He spent his formative years painting graffiti, creating fanzines and making limited run records on his own Invisible Spies imprint. Nowadays, his artwork can been seen throughout the world - both inside and outside of galleries. His signature style has adorned products for leading brands such as Prada, Kenzo, Elle, Kid Robot, Brompton and Warp Records, while the man himself continues to paint epic slogans in sub-zero temperatures. And he still has acne. Matt Smooth founded Scratch with production partner Rob Mac in 1996 - Scratch started back in Kings Cross as a hip hop inspired live production company encompassing the global dynamics of b-boy culture. Scratch has travelled through London, Edinburgh, Gothenburg, US, Australia, India &amp; beyond. Scratch made it&apos;s name in fusing events that highlighted art in equal headline to music - featuring often first time UK shows for international artists alongside emerging British talent.

Jumbo, one imagines, was not a nice clown. A picture of a burlesque pin-up girl beckoning from inside a cocktail glass attempts to lighten the tone, but even she looks worried, possibly drowning in champagne rather than waving. Inside, Jumbo&apos;s has all the features of a classic dive bar. The drinks are stiff and cheap. Regulars hunch in dark corners while hipsters from all over the city jostle among the historic ephemera \u2013 grinning clown dolls and photographs of scantily clad women. Legend has it David Lynch wrote the screenplay for Blue Velvet in the back corner booth, which gives a good sense of the sleazy, cinematic ambience. Be warned, though: it&apos;s odder than your average dive. Courtney Love used to dance here, and a similar style of rock chick still swings under a mirrored ceiling at the right of the bar. The girls choose their songs from a jukebox and many of them make their own costumes. It&apos;s dirty, kitschy and fun. In the afternoons, LA industry types pore over their film scripts next to alcoholics who look like they&apos;ve been at the same table since Jumbo&apos;s opened in 1970.

Appearance? Of course. No one wants a boozer that looks like it&apos;s been assembled from an alcoholic Ikea catalogue. Atmosphere? Obviously. Beer? Goes without saying. The Albion ticks all those boxes and a few others. It sits within the town&apos;s 13th-century walls, just off Conwy&apos;s refreshingly chain-free high street. Its art deco interior is less a dusted-down museum piece, more a well-appointed time capsule. The modern world \u2013 rolling sports coverage, happy hours, fruit machines juke box \u2013 never got a look in. After Punch Taverns deemed the pub a dead loss and jettisoned it in 2010, a businessman took the site on and offered it to Llandudno brewery Great Orme. Feeling too small to take it on alone, it proposed bringing in three other brewers \u2013 Conwy Brewery, Bragdy Nant in Llanrwst, and Purple Moose from Porthmadog. Each brewery gets to use the pub as a showcase space. It&apos;s this welcome shot of community spirit(s) that elevates the place to the exceptional. \u2022 Upper Gate Street, conwybrewery.co.uk And three more ...\u2022 The Front in Falmouth (Custom House Quay) looks as if it has been tunnelled from beneath the quay buildings.

Photograph: Alamy    Bar La Opera, Mexico CityTequila&apos;s reputation as a shot is busted. The stuff we used to throw down with salt and lemon is the equivalent of bad navy rum against smoky blue agaves and French-oak reposados of today. And as long as we&apos;re busting stereotypes, Mexico City is the place to catch up on tequila, and bust a few more \u2013 because forget sombreros, apart from As well as Aztecs and Spaniards the country was also taken by Napoleon III of France \u2013 it once even had an Austro-Hungarian emperor complete with palace. All this left marks between the pyramids and churches \u2013 and one great mark they left is Bar La Opera, a Parisian-style cantina in the old heart of the city. Originally opened as a patisserie by two French sisters in the 19th century, La Opera has hosted the cast of Mexican history on its way to becoming a bar; there&apos;s still a bullet fired by Pancho Villa lodged in the baroque gold-leaf ceiling. You can sit under it and drink. The style is down to a 19th-century president who believed in aristocracy and wanted to remodel the city on Paris; he was Porfirio Diaz, and this was his pet haunt. La Opera isn&apos;t specifically a tequila bar \u2013 just the grand duke of bars in the capital of tequila. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz and virtually every president of Mexico have helped, and still help, to burnish the wood around the bar, a one-off objet fetched from New Orleans way back when. But this isn&apos;t a museum showpiece, an old boys&apos; club, a place to be seen, or a tourist trap: it&apos;s the real thing, a working cantina with good ice, with career waiters quietly bustling, with proud Mexican food, and with doors that swing open on to one of the capital&apos;s oldest and most significant avenues; one that Spanish, French, and a variety of Mexican troops have marched up and down on their way to capture this home of gods. Plenty of them stopped here; and we can stop here. Like all great cantinas it&apos;s a place to feel your heart, gain inspiration, and speak the truth. Of a night you might hear salsas and cumbias clunking out of the club over the street. Tap your feet, order the chipotle snails, and get a start on the tequila. Just remember you&apos;re already more than 2,200m up.

Photograph: Alamy    Augustiner Keller, MunichThe Augustiner, which dates from 1812, has survived several wars and a fire to retain its position at the centre of Munich&apos;s social life: it has a cosy dark wood interior of the most relaxed and atmospheric sort, and headstrong, no-nonsense \u2013 but friendly \u2013 staff. Among its most popular beers are: Augustiner Helles, a lager beer; Edelstoff (&quot;noble stuff&quot;), slighter, sweeter more bubbly; Dunkles, a dark malt beer; and Pils. As befits a traditional bier keller, it serves the sort of hearty fare that M\u00fcncheners have been feasting on for centuries, including cheese platters, roasted pork belly, liver sausage, gherkins and pretzels. Portions are generous and prices very reasonable. In 1842, according to city records, the tavern on this site was described as &quot;one of the finest in Munich, despite the fact that it is located directly opposite the Munich execution site&quot;.\u2022 Arnulfstrasse 52, augustinerkeller.de And three more ...\u2022 Pinkus in Munster (Kreuzstrasse 4-10) is the only survivor of 150 city breweries, run by the fifth and sixth generations of the original family.

Kate Connolly Warsaw vodka bars Przekaski ZakaskiA decade ago, tourists coming to Warsaw were surprised to find very little vodka being consumed. But like in Britain, the Polish national drink is beer: Poles are more likely to choose a cold, golden Tyskie, Okocim, Zywiec, Lech or Kr\u00f3lewskie beer than a spirit. But a new trend has taken Polish drinking habits by storm. The vodka-and-snack bar began as a tongue-in-cheek throwback to communism. The pioneer was Przekaski Zakaski, a stand-up place opposite the glamorous Hotel Bristol on Warsaw&apos;s poshest street. It serves vodka shots at four zlotys (about 80p) a throw, and portions of sausage, herring or pat\u00e9 for little more. Rumour has it the first bar staff were out-of-work actors, carefully rehearsed to deliver convincing Iron Curtain service.

Japanese media said several vehicles were ablaze after a 100 metre long section of the Sasago tunnel&apos;s ceiling caved in shortly after 8am. Firefighters discovered the bodies inside a white van after battling through thick smoke. The number of bodies inside the car is unknown; local media were reporting that as many as seven people were missing. The rescue operation was temporarily halted in the afternoon amid fears of another collapse. Police said they did not know what had caused the section of the 2.5 mile tunnel to cave in. The tunnel is located along a busy section of the Chuo expressway about 50 miles west of Tokyo. Dozens of motorists, including two women who received minor injuries in the accident, left their cars and walked out of the tunnel to safety. &quot;When I was driving in the tunnel, concrete pieces fell down suddenly from the ceiling,&quot; one man told public broadcaster NHK. &quot;I saw a crushed car catching fire.

Goto, who emerged safely, said he had seen thick smoke billowing from one end of the tunnel. &quot;I managed to drive through the tunnel but vehicles nearby appeared to have been trapped,&quot; local media quoted him as saying. &quot;Black smoke was coming and there seemed to be a fire inside the tunnel.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Both John Terry and Frank Lampard will be on that flight to Tokyo with the pair due to play some part in training on Monday as they step up their recoveries from knee and calf injuries respectively."], "tags": ["Chelsea", "Avram Grant", "Football", "Rafael Ben\u00edtez", "Roman Abramovich"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-02T23:40:00Z", "title": "Avram Grant could be offered consultative role with Chelsea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/02/chelsea-avram-grant-rafael-benitez", "article": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez believes he retains the support of the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, despite seeing his team endure a third winless match under his interim management at West Ham on Saturday, though the oligarch could yet offer Avram Grant a consultative role back at the club if results continue to deteriorate. The loss at Upton Park extended Chelsea&apos;s run without a win in the Premier League to seven matches, their worst sequence since 1995, with Abramovich understood to have been infuriated by his players&apos; second-half capitulation. There are concerns that Ben\u00edtez, who remains the subject of intense hostility from the club&apos;s fans given his long-standing ties with Liverpool, has been unable to spark an immediate upturn in the side&apos;s form with Chelsea now 10 points behind Manchester United in the title race. While there is no great desire to instigate further upheaval within the coaching set-up following the abrupt dismissal of Roberto Di Matteo less than a fortnight ago, Chelsea will consider more changes to their staff if results do not improve swiftly. To that end the possible reappointment of Grant \u2013 who had briefly been considered as an alternative to Ben\u00edtez when the board deemed Di Matteo&apos;s time to be up \u2013 in an advisory role to assist the Spaniard has been discussed by the hierarchy. The Israeli&apos;s return to the club would represent further antagonising an increasingly disillusioned fanbase, though that he is under consideration reflects the chaos currently gripping the European champions. Grant, a personal friend of Abramovich and previously the club&apos;s director of football, had controversially replaced Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as manager in the autumn of 2007 and went on to steer the team to the League Cup and, most notably, Champions League finals only to lose them both. His contract was terminated in the wake of the European Cup defeat by Manchester United in Moscow on penalties, with Grant later claiming he had turned down the chance to revert to his former position as director of football. The 57-year-old has remained on good terms with Abramovich since and spent time in charge at Portsmouth, West Ham and Partizan Belgrade, but is currently available and in London having delayed a trip back to his home in Tel Aviv. While Grant has not been contacted formally over any potential involvement at Chelsea, it is understood he would be willing to take up an advisory role if the club came calling, though the specifics of any such position are as yet unclear. Ben\u00edtez brought in Xavi Valero, Paco de Miguel and Bolo Zenden on his appointment 11 days ago on a seven-month contract, though Zenden, nominally his No2, is still to secure all his Uefa coaching badges and cannot enter the technical area during games.

Ben\u00edtez has confirmed there were angry words exchanged by staff and players in the dressing room after the frustrating 3-1 reverse at Upton Park but reaffirmed his belief that he can arrest the side&apos;s slump in form. Indeed, having spoken face to face with Abramovich after his first two games in charge, against Manchester City and Fulham, and again at the club&apos;s Cobham training base last week, as well as attending a board meeting last Thursday, he is confident he still benefits from the owner&apos;s immediate support. Ben\u00edtez will hope to register a first win against Nordsjaelland in Chelsea&apos;s final Champions League group game on Wednesday, though even victory over the Danes may not be enough to force passage into the knock-out phase. Should Juventus avoid defeat against Shakhtar Donetsk, then Chelsea will be consigned to the Europa League, a reality they would still be digesting as they depart for the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan immediately after Saturday&apos;s trip to Sunderland.

The victims include three men and two women, all in their 20s, who were travelling in the same vehicle, Japanese media said. A woman who had been travelling with the group when the accident occurred managed to escape and was being treated for minor injuries. Police said the bodies of a man and two women had been found in a second vehicle, while the ninth victim was confirmed as Tatsuya Nakagawa, a 50-year-old lorry driver who had called his company asking for help after the tunnel&apos;s ceiling collapsed. Reports said as many as 150 concrete slabs, each weighing 1.2 tonnes, had crashed to the ground along a 110-metre-long stretch of the Tokyo-bound lane inside the tunnel, which connects Tokyo with central Japan. Firefighters discovered five bodies inside a white van after battling through thick smoke on Sunday afternoon. The rescue operation was halted temporarily amid fears of another collapse. Police said they did not know what had caused the section of the 2.5-mile tunnel, located along a busy stretch of the Chuo expressway about 50 miles west of Tokyo, to cave in. Motorway officials believe that one of the metal rods used to secure the concrete panels to the tunnel&apos;s inner walls may have become loose, triggering a chain reaction that rained concrete onto the vehicles below. Another theory is that the structure may have been weakened by a 4.9 earthquake that shook the Tokyo area on 24 November, or by a landslide inside the mountain through which the tunnel passes. The motorway&apos;s operator said a routine safety check conducted as recently as October had not revealed any structural faults. Closed circuit TV footage showed rescue workers attempting to remove large chunks of concrete in a frantic effort to reach vehicles trapped beneath. More than a dozen fire engines were lined up outside both entrances to the tunnel, while fleets of ambulances waited to treat the injured. People who were able to drive or walk out of the tunnel said panicked motorists had started driving the wrong way down the motorway after the collapse began; others said they heard people trapped beneath the concrete calling out for help. &quot;While I was driving through the tunnel, concrete pieces suddenly started falling from the ceiling,&quot; one man told public broadcaster NHK. &quot;I saw a crushed car catch fire. I was scared, so I left my car and walked for about an hour to get out of the tunnel.&quot; Earlier, firefighters had struggled to reach the scene of the accident \u2013 about a mile inside the tunnel \u2013 because falling concrete had ignited petrol leaking from trapped cars, sparking a blaze that sent thick black smoke billowing from the tunnel entrance. Another survivor told TV Asahi he had witnessed the cave-in before calling police, who told him to flee. &quot;A few seconds later and my car would have been right in the middle of it,&quot; he said. Yoshio Goto, an NHK reporter who was driving through the tunnel when the roof began to cave in, said he had put his foot on the accelerator as soon as he felt pieces of concrete falling on to the roof of his car. &quot;I was a bit too late and pieces of the roof fell on my car,&quot; Goto said. &quot;I kept pressing the pedal and managed to get out. Then, when I looked around, I saw that half of the top of my car had been crushed.&quot; It is not clear if emergency workers expect to find more bodies beneath the rubble. Officials had initially said seven people were feared missing inside the tunnel, which opened to traffic in 1977. The accident, on one of Japan&apos;s busiest motorways, will inevitably raise questions about the safety of the country&apos;s large network of tunnels \u2013 motorists&apos; quickest route through its mountainous topography. Sunday&apos;s accident was the worst of its kind since 1996, when a tunnel in northern Japan collapsed and falling rocks crushed cars and a bus, killing 20 people."}, {"sentences": ["Tokyo&apos;s fish market to close     Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images    Tsukiji fish market, the must-see slice of Tokyo life that tourists flock to before dawn, is set to close in late 2014."], "tags": ["Travel", "Tokyo holidays", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-03T06:00:00Z", "title": "Travel news roundup: snow watch, your drunken tales and what's new?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/dec/03/travel-holiday-news-tokyo-fish-market", "article": "Escapism Anyone wanting to travel Gangnam style can now book direct flights to Seoul, capital of South Korea, with British Airways, which launch on Saturday 1 December.

Tokyo&apos;s fish market to close     Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images    Tsukiji fish market, the must-see slice of Tokyo life that tourists flock to before dawn, is set to close in late 2014. The world&apos;s largest seafood market will move to the neighbouring district of Toyosu and is set to become 40% larger. The increasingly decrepit state of Tsukiji and its position on prime Ginza real estate made the decision inevitable. I visited Tsukiji a few days ago and was glad I had the chance. After queuing at 4.45am for entry to the wholesale tuna auctions, we were herded by security guards through the frenetic inner market. We dodged porters and forklifts, heading for a makeshift viewing area of pallets in the middle of the auction, where we were captivated by the rows of huge tuna, all auctioned within seconds. The market imposes strict regulations on visiting: visitors are limited to 120 a day and have an allotted time period. Once ours was up we wandered the market&apos;s fringes in search of breakfast in old-school sushi bars that serve the freshest sushi in the city, and probably the world. The new Toyosu market, 2.3km to the south, will be more modern and tourist-friendly, with observation decks, shops and restaurants, and cooking demonstrations. But it is unlikely to have the same feel. Charm and authenticity will be lost to the bulldozers and visitors are likely to be more removed from the auction floor. This will be practical for day-to-day business, but the sense of theatre will probably be diminished, so go now before it disappears. Osaka&apos;s central fish market is a good alternative if you don&apos;t make it to Tsukiji.

The incident sent hundreds of tonnes of concrete crashing on to passing cars and raised concerns about the country&apos;s ageing infrastructure. Central Japan Expressway, known as Nexco Central, was being investigated on suspicion of professional negligence after it emerged the firm had conducted only basic safety checks, and had not carried out major repairs to the ceiling of the tunnel since it opened 35 years ago. Company officials say the accident could have been caused by ageing bolts used to secure the concrete panels, which aid ventilation, to the tunnel&apos;s inner walls. There is also speculation that the bolts had been loosened by earthquakes. The firm said no structural faults had been found when the tunnel underwent rudimentary checks during a routine inspection in September. &quot;They are searching our offices,&quot; said Osamu Funahashi, a spokesman for the government-owned firm. &quot;We are giving them our full co-operation.&quot; Raids were also carried out at several other locations connected with the company. Television footage showed about a dozen uniformed police entering Nexco Central&apos;s headquarters in Nagoya, central Japan, early on Tuesday. Japanese media reported heavy traffic on alternative routes in the area, saying that the motorway&apos;s closure had begun to affect the flow of goods between Tokyo and the west of the country. Police have so far confirmed nine deaths from the accident, which occurred on Sunday morning after suspended concrete slabs worked loose from the tunnel walls and crashed on to three vehicles travelling below. At least one of the vehicles caught fire, creating thick black smoke that billowed from both ends of the tunnel. About 270 concrete panels, each weighing up to 1.5 tonnes, fell during the accident inside the Sasago tunnel, which links Tokyo with central and western Japan. Huge pieces of concrete were scattered along a 130-metre stretch of the 4.7km (2.9-mile) tunnel.           The road remained closed while emergency workers resumed their search for victims, while officials said the affected stretch of motorway was unlikely to fully reopen this year. The long operation ahead to remove the concrete debris from the road and make the tunnel safe again was expected to cause widespread disruption, particularly as millions of people head to their hometowns ahead of the new year. The tunnel is located along the Chuo expressway, a major artery used by about 47,000 vehicles a day. Rescue workers said they had not ruled out the possibility of finding more bodies, but they did not believe anyone else was still in the tunnel. Recovery work was halted overnight while emergency reinforcements were carried out to prevent further collapses. The victims included three men and two women, all in their 20s, who were travelling in the same van when it was crushed by falling debris before catching fire. It took three hours to extinguish the blaze. The only victim named so far is Tatsuya Nakagawa, a 50-year-old lorry driver who had called a colleague shortly after the accident to ask for help. Some of the other victims were so badly burned it could take days to identify them. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, offered his condolences to the victims&apos; families. &quot;I offer my sincere prayers to those who lost their lives or were injured in this accident,&quot; he said. &quot;I have ordered the transport ministry to do everything possible to help the injured and to quickly establish the cause of the accident so that something like this never happens again.&quot; The tragedy is expected to lend greater urgency to the debate over public spending on Japan&apos;s infrastructure, much of which was built in the 1960s and 70s, as the country prepares for a general election on 16 December. The accident, which occurred about 50 miles west of the Japanese capital, has raised questions over the safety of tunnels of a similar age and design. The transport ministry ordered immediate inspections of 49 other motorway and road tunnels, part of a nationwide network of more than 1,500 tunnels that offer motorists an easy route through Japan&apos;s mountainous terrain. About a quarter of the tunnels were built more than 30 years ago, the ministry said. Sunday&apos;s accident was the worst of its kind since 1996, when a rock slide caused by the collapse of a tunnel in northern Japan engulfed cars and a bus, killing 20 people."}, {"sentences": ["He went on to become the Tokyo correspondent for the Financial Times, where he covered the 1990s economic crash, and then became the paper&apos;s Washington bureau chief and chief US commentator."], "tags": ["Wall Street Journal", "Newspapers & magazines", "US press and publishing", "Newspapers", "Media", "Dow Jones", "Stock markets", "Business", "Rupert Murdoch", "News Corporation", "Media business", "US news", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-04T08:44:42Z", "title": "Gerard Baker named as editor in chief at Dow Jones and WSJ", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/04/gerard-baker-dow-jones-wsj", "article": "Gerard Baker, the British-born and BBC-trained journalist, has been confirmed as the new editor in chief at Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal.

He was criticised as a &quot;neo-conservative&quot; who is &quot;pro-business&quot; and &quot;anti-Obama&quot; by the New York Times upon his arrival at WSJ following Murdoch&apos;s acquisition of Dow Jones in 2007. But he has said in the past that the opportunity he had with the title was &quot;to play it straight&quot; and give people the truth when all around others were taking either liberal or rightwing positions. After graduating from Oxford University where he read philosophy, politics and economics, his first job was as an economist but he quickly discovered it was not the career for him. &quot;Basically I was no good at it, I was temperamentally unsuited,&quot; he told Peter Robinson in a lengthy interview about the future of journalism in 2011 with the Hoover Institution in the US. He revealed he had started his career as an admirer of the left and the idealism of communism but when he took a trip to the Soviet Union in the 1980s he had a &quot;Damascene&quot; conversion. &quot;I was completely horrified,&quot; he said of the despair and poverty. He worked at the Bank of England and Lloyds Bank as an economic analyst, moving into journalism in 1986 with a job at the BBC where he remained for seven years. He went on to become the Tokyo correspondent for the Financial Times, where he covered the 1990s economic crash, and then became the paper&apos;s Washington bureau chief and chief US commentator. In 2004, Thomson hired him to become the US editor of the Times and then to be his No 2 at the WSJ. A father of five girls, he says he is &quot;between two minds&quot; as to whether he would recommend his daughters go into journalism. Baker says much of the media is in the &quot;subsidariat&quot; \u2013 a term applied to loss-making enterprises and the BBC, which is funded via a licence fee \u2013 and journalists, like their employers will continue to struggle to make money. But, he told Robinson, &quot;the calling of journalism is magnificent&quot;. He also told Robinson that profits &quot;are a better guarantee of independence&quot; than subsidies, echoing the views of James Murdoch in his MacTaggart speech at the Edinburgh TV Festival three years ago. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

It&apos;s probably the only time &quot;glocalisation&quot; will ever get namechecked in a feature-film script. But the ploy of tailoring global business to individual countries could be picking up speed in the cinema industry, according to a recent Hollywood Reporter article on a new wave of remakes: rather than cutting a one-size-fits-all global hit from foreign material, Hollywood producers are increasingly seeing steady revenue from licensing foreign reworkings of US films, like last year&apos;s Chinese version of Mel Gibson vehicle What Women Want. Those are individual cases, though. There are signs that the glocally-minded film producer can think bigger, namely Paramount&apos;s recent announcement that it&apos;ll be releasing a Latino-targeted instalment of its Paranormal Activity franchise. Interesting move: why not spice up the flatpack suburban occultism with some heady Catholic themes, especially if there&apos;s a target audience out there? There&apos;s already been a Japan-produced PA offshoot, and with that grainy night-vision bedcam keeping the branding consistent, and Paranormal 2 and 3&apos;s writer there to oversee things \u2013 under the provisional title The Oxnard Tapes (so Latino-sounding!) \u2013 as director, this could be the first glocalised film franchise. Like most new ideas, glocalisation isn&apos;t really new. The Japanese apparently invented the concept in the late 1980s, calling it dochakuka, and using it to drive the spread of J-pop across different Asian territories. And it&apos;s a pretty familiar philosophy in television franchising, with gameshows (The Weakest Link; Who Want to be a Millionaire?), talent shows (Pop Idol), and comedies (The Office; Shameless) all budding off new, culturally-pruned varieties across the world. But it&apos;s never evolved very far in the cinema. I suppose you could see remakes (or indeed any form of translation or dubbing) as the bluntest form of local customisation. Having showcase sequences, like M:I4&apos;s Burj Khalifa&apos;s jolly in Dubai, or the now-obligatory Chinese blockbuster interlude, or packing a whole franchise instalment off on holiday (Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) are alternative ways of adding a bit of glocal spice. But I can&apos;t think of a fully fragmented franchise that has worked to strengthen the overall brand, along TV lines; when film franchises do splinter more comprehensively, the separate versions, usually made by different production teams, have effectively been in competition with each other, like the Japanese/Korean/American Ringus in the 00s. Horror seems to be the genre in which film glocalisation seems nearest to fruition, perhaps because it&apos;s so often low-budget, intimate and character-driven; very different to the blockbuster-spectacle idiom geared to steamroller unilaterally across the globe, and closest to the TV model that adapts most easily to local demands. The Grudge franchise tried to deftly dovetail its American remakes into the Japanese originals, by having Sarah Michelle Gellar&apos;s careworker visit the Far East in the first film. The fact that director Takashi Shimizu took charge of its English-language incarnation \u2013 unusually for a Japanese director \u2013 helped maintain these links across the franchise. And Paranormal Activity looks like it&apos;s attempting the same feat of cultural transplantation (though the Latino outing won&apos;t be in Spanish). There&apos;s no reason why glocalisation has to mean homogenisation by the back door: switching proceedings to a new environment should enhance the premise \u2013 or at least entertain \u2013 as with the American version of The Office. Starting with a universal idea, like having a titan of cringe for a boss, can help bring out the local particulars in even sharper definition. If the new reverse-direction remakes are a new phase of glocalisation, then franchising could be where things get truly creative. I like the idea of, say, regional episodes to introduce a round-the-world cast of martial-arts heroes, who might then assemble, Avengers-style, for an Enter the Dragon-esque blockbuster tournament. Or Clint Eastwood&apos;s Flags of Our Fathers strategy, exploring the same set of events from opposing perspectives, could be put to radical use. Global film franchises have descended from above, and let rip with the shock and awe, for too long; it&apos;s time they put down deeper roots. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will look at Abu Dhabi&apos;s first horror movie.

But if you want to stay at the maximum level for a while, you have to be competitive. That is the difficult thing, to manage the hunger of the players and the hunger of the staff. It&apos;s part of our job to push them and try and keep the competition. The only thing we can try and do is win our game. I&apos;m still confident Shakhtar can beat Juventus.

The interim first-team manager has yet to win after three matches, and continues to be deprived of his captain and deputy, John Terry and Frank Lampard, due to injury. The experienced pair&apos;s significance to the team has not escaped the stand-in, for all that Lampard will leave the club next summer under freedom of contract. Asked if the current Chelsea \u2013 who completed the signing of the Brazilian full-back Wallace from Fluminense on Tuesday, although he won&apos;t join the club until next summer \u2013 lacked strength of character, Ben\u00edtez said: &quot;Not really, but the problem we have is that some of the key players who have that character are still missing. They are injured. So the younger players who come in are having to adapt and learn about the Premier League without them. The character is there, but it&apos;s not on the pitch because they&apos;re injured. We have good, young players out there but having Lampard and Terry with them would help. You need that character to be competitive.&quot; Lampard did play a part in training at Cobham but, while he continues to make progress with his calf injury, he will not be considered for selection against the Danes. Terry (knee) and Daniel Sturridge (hamstring) will be assessed by Ben\u00edtez and his medical staff on Thursday and only then will a decision be taken as to whether the centre-half accompanies the squad to Japan on Saturday, immediately after the Premier League game against Sunderland, for the Fifa Club World Cup.

So anyway, Cayucas is the vehicle for nostalgic slacker Zach Yudin, although it turns out he doesn&apos;t really spend all day in bed dreaming of summers gone: he&apos;s an avid bird-watcher who majored at college in both music theory/production and Japanese and spent a year after university living and teaching in Tokyo. It was only when he came back to California that he decided to live the musician&apos;s life and refine his ideas for Cayucas. He went into the studio with producer/multi-instrumentalist Richard Swift, who most famously worked with the Shins, and emerged with a series of catchy tunes that evoke memories of an era that artists, musical or otherwise, have been idealising and immortalising for 40 years now, ever since American Graffiti. Yudin&apos;s stock-in-trade is innocence with a twist \u2013 there is language used here that would never have made it to radio in 1962. Still, that&apos;s where his heart lies. The first single, Cayucos, is accompanied by a video with a predictably Instagrammatic glaze and makes us wonder whether chillwave hipsters do surfing music better than the Beach Boys themselves \u2013 we actually hated Surfin&apos; Safari and the rest of those early ones, loving the Beach Boys only when Brian Wilson embraced the harmonically complex and revealed himself as a tortured solipsist. We like Yudin&apos;s version of events, maybe because we can tell he&apos;s a loner himself, even if the music sounds like it&apos;s been performed by a band, albeit one rendered sluggish by reefer. \u00a0\u00a0The buzz: &quot;If you&apos;re hitting up the beach anytime soon, Cayucos is a must have on your playlist.&quot; The truth: It may be winter outside but not where these purveyors of endless summer-pop live. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most likely to: Catch a wave. \u00a0 \u00a0 Least likely to: Catch a cold. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What to buy: The single Cayucos is out now on Secretly Canadian.

In Japan, it made Momofuku Ando, inventor of the instant ramen, his fortune. Raw fish is all very well for a special occasion, but as Michael Booth notes in his culinary travelogue, Sushi and Beyond: &quot;When they want a umami hit, crave carbohydrates and porky protein, when they want warming and filling, and to lose themselves in slurping contemplation of a bottomless bowl of sustenance, it is to ramen that the Japanese turn.&quot; This simple noodle soup is nothing short of a national obsession, and it has Britain in its sights. The chain Yo! Sushi has just launched a new ramen menu, and, while establishments such as Wagamama, Glasgow and Cardiff&apos;s Ichiban restaurants and Birmingham&apos;s Woktastic have been offering bowls of ramen-style noodle soups for years, finally, the proper stuff has arrived. In London, the first specialist ramen bars of the kind found on every Japanese street corner have arrived, so expect to see them hitting cities across the country. So far is ramen from the delicate stereotypes of Japanese cuisine that when Ross Shonhan opened Bone Daddies in Soho earlier this month, the Zuma and Nobu veteran had a whole new set of skills to master, starting with the slowly simmered broths and springy noodles that form the backbone of any good ramen. Happily, he had put in the research: &quot;I&apos;d been studying, reading and exploring the world of ramen for four or five years, staying up &apos;til all hours of the night.&quot; Fortunately, unlike classical Japanese cooking, ramen encourages experimentation: Shonhan describes its masters as the punks of the Japanese culinary scene: &quot;There&apos;s no great tradition of a particular type of ramen. Everyone&apos;s got an opinion.&quot; This is because ramen, for all its ubiquity, is relatively new to the Japanese diet. Introduced by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th century, it came into its own when Japan was dependent on US flour imports after the war. With no indigenous tradition of breadmaking, the noodles all but rescued a starving population, which showed its appreciation by elevating ramen to cult status, with its own museums, magazines and manga. Shonhan likens the dish to a drug: &quot;I\u00a0couldn&apos;t find ramen that made me happy in this city.&quot; Londoners are now spoilt for choice: four restaurants have opened there in six months. Some, like the Japan Centre&apos;s Shoryu Ramen, concentrate on one style \u2013 almost every Japanese city has its speciality \u2013 but Shonhan isn&apos;t much interested in authenticity: &quot;I&apos;m not trying to represent Tokyo, I&apos;m just trying to create a delicious bowl of noodles.&quot; To this end, he is keen to experiment with his ramen. &quot;Right now it&apos;s noodles, broth, vegetables, meat, egg \u2013 if you just think of pork and eggs for example, think how many different manipulations and applications of those there are, whether it&apos;s smoking the eggs, smoked bacon, smoked ham hocks.&quot; A Japanese restaurant run by an Australian serving egg and bacon ramen?

The answer, given that world rankings this month may be vastly different come September 2015, was that maximum time is needed for planning the event: it will, for example, take four months to decide who plays where and then comes the inspection of hotels, training facilities, travel organisation for teams and supporters. The draw could probably have been held this time next year with the minimum of disruption. That has nothing to do, of course, with the fact that none of the home unions is embarking on a major tour of the south next summer, although they are all acting as hosts next November. The Lions are in Australia and, as far as the rankings are concerned, the home unions will have a potential advantage next year of not playing southern hemisphere teams away, not that home proved much of an asset this year. The draw itself was notable for the contribution of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who judging by what he said has never made an effort to clamber aboard England&apos;s chariot. His speech had been agreed in advance with the International Rugby Board but the written version bore little relation to what he actually said, leaving the organisers with a rising sense of panic. Faces were turning the colour of Will Greenwood&apos;s garish tie when Johnson started talking about rearranged noses and faces. Was he going to declare his belief that Andrew Hore was innocent? There was relief when he kept his offering to a few minutes. The next time the draw is made Japan will be the hosts. Will they automatically qualify if they are outside the top 12 of the rankings come 2016? It will not be quite the same at the ceremony if Tokyo&apos;s version of Boris is left to chunter on about Asia 1 and Asia 2&apos;s prospective pool partners. The current Japan coach, Eddie Jones, was at the Tate Modern and is preparing for his third World Cup having been in charge of the finalists Australia in 2003 and a consultant to the 2007 winners, South Africa. Getting the Cherry Blossoms to the 2015 final would make it some hat-trick. &quot;Japan have not won a World Cup game for 20 years and our performances against the top countries have not been good,&quot; said Jones. &quot;We are trying to play differently, relying on fewer foreigners and forging a Japanese style of play. The former France hooker Marc dal Maso has been working on our scrum and offered the opinion that the Japanese are too nice on the field. It is something we are working on. &quot;I will stand down after the 2015 World Cup, even though the next tournament is being held in Japan. I know my limit: international rugby works in four-year cycles now, unless you are an All Blacks coach. My challenge is to make the team respected by the time I leave and to help produce two or three coaches who will take the squad forward. We have three players who will be involved in the Super 15 next year and that is important for us.&quot; A popular subject of the draw was England&apos;s victory over New Zealand some 48 hours before, not just the result but the ebullient manner of the home side&apos;s performance. When he was in charge of Australia, Jones enjoyed verbal sparring with his then counterpart, Clive Woodward, but there was only one grenade for the 2015 hosts. &quot;England went into the game against New Zealand with no fear: no one expected them to win and I know it sounds funny, but you can go out then and play rugby,&quot; he said. &quot;They were also good tactically and the big test is how they deal with the expectation that will now be on them. Will they have the courage to play the same way? The only coach who has been able to get that out of them is Woodward and, since he went, it has been a case of peaks and troughs. Stuart Lancaster&apos;s job now is to make sure England continue to play without fear. The question going forward is over their mental ability.&quot; Jones&apos;s caveat was over Manu Tuilagi, the scorer of one of England&apos;s three tries and creator of the other two. &quot;He is a very good player and I think he is an out-and-out 12: when you look at the pace and power England have out wide and Ben Foden to return at full-back, all they need is a 13 similar to Conrad Smith. If I had been his coach, I would have kicked Tuilagi&apos;s backside afterwards for the way he walked in his try against the All Blacks. You do not do that sort of thing.&quot; The All Blacks will not forget. Twickenham played host to a game even more remarkable than last Saturday&apos;s in 1999 when France met New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final. Les Bleus were trailing 24-10 and their cause looked hopeless when, out of nowhere, they produced some remarkable rugby, scoring three tries in quick succession and winning 43-31. It was England, though, who were to become the dominant force in Europe and then the world. &quot;A number of sides are building,&quot; said Jones. &quot;South Africa have gone from a forward pack with 400+ caps to 150, England the same. France and Wales have young players coming through. The race to 2015 is about who becomes the most stable. &quot;We did not see a shift in power last month. South Africa did not play particularly well but they won their three Tests. They had a number of injuries and they did enough in each game, if no more. I think they are the most pragmatic side in the world: they do what they have to do to win. Australia had good results in England, Italy and Wales after losing to France and they have some really good young players coming through. They have a really attacking back line when everyone is fit, but it is a question of finding balance. There have been concerns expressed about the future of Australian rugby, but because of the sporting environment in the country there will always be a good Wallabies team.&quot; Robbie Deans was at the World Cup draw and the Australia coach was asked whether he would still be in charge in 2015: his contracts ends after the Lions series next summer and he has come under increasing pressure in the media. &quot;I know how he feels,&quot; said Jones. &quot;It will be a great series against the Lions and I think it will be as close as it was in 2001 when the Lions were the best team in the first two hours of the Tests and the Wallabies were in charge in the final two hours. It came down to a final lineout and could do so again.&quot; SOBER RETURN OF HEINEKEN CUP The decision of the English and Welsh rugby unions to play a fourth international in their autumn series and devalue their regional/club games meant that the World Cup draw has overshadowed the return of the Heineken Cup. In one sense, it means longer relief from the politicking about the future of the tournament that will return this month, especially when the opposing factions start talking about television deals and legality. If England&apos;s World Cup group overshadowed the one that included France, Ireland and Italy, the back-to-back Heineken weekends will give a taste of what is to come with the champions, Leinster, meeting the team they defeated in last season&apos;s semi-final, Clermont Auvergne. Leinster started slowly in October, fortunate to defeat Exeter at home and functional in Llanelli against the Scarlets, but Clermont have not been as dominant at home, despite continuing their long unbeaten record in front of their own supporters. Their last three home matches in the Top 14 have seen the visitors depart with a bonus point and, in the cases of Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Toulon, a belief that they were short-changed. The victory over Toulon marked 50 unbeaten Top 14 matches at Stade Marcel-Michelin. Leinster are unbeaten at home this season. Ulster go to Northampton on Friday night having won 12 out of 12 this season. Four of their last five matches in the RaboDirect Pro 12 have been away, and they left it late during the international window before beating Zebre and Treviso. An issue for the English clubs and the Welsh regions is that their players only returned to duty this week after five weeks away with their national squads. A problem with Tests arranged outside the official international window is that club tournaments do not take account of them, not that the two unions involved will be bothered as they count their profits. \u2022 This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby.

You can watch a live video feed from the conference here. The conference publication includes a wealth of detailed graphics covering topics including transport, energy consumption, pollution and urban planning, as well as a visualisation-rich case study on London. Below is a selection of the maps and charts on show, along with a summary of some of the most interesting patterns that emerge: Proximity to public transport     Proximity to rapid transit stations in selected cities, broken down by residential and commercial property. Click for larger image    Hong Kong&apos;s residents are the best-connected, with over 40% living within a 500m radius of a rapid transit station. The city also scores highest for commuting, with over half its places of work less than half a kilometre from a station. Stockholm scores second highest in both categories, while New York and London are third for residents and commuters respectively. Los Angeles scores lowest for each category, with less than 5% of its residents living within 500m of a station. How people travel     Methods of transport in selected cities. London has the highest proportion of trips made by car. Click for larger image    Of the six cities shown, London has the highest proportion of trips made by car, at 39.8%. Public transport accounts for 34% of journeys, while walking (23.7%), cycling (2%) and motorcycle trips (0.8%) make up the remainder. New York scores highest for public transport, with almost three in every five commuter trips made by taxi, bus, rail or metro. Hong Kong fares best for walking, with 44.7% of journeys made on foot. Copenhagen leads the way for cycling, with one in five trips powered by pedals. How cities change     Changes in measures including population, emissions and transport, shown for selected major cities across different continents and states of economic development. Click for larger image    Portland&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita have halved since 1993.Copenhagen&apos;s energy consumption per capita has fallen by around 20% since 1993, with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita dropping at a slightly faster rate. Singapore&apos;s population has risen steadily, and TransMilenio, its public transport system, has seen passenger numbers double since its 2001 launch. Despite its growing population, traffic incident fatalities have more than halved since the late 1990s. Cycling in Hong Kong has been booming in the last 20 years, and is one of the factors that have contributed to its falling CO2 emissions per capita.     Changes in measures including population, emissions and transport, shown for selected major cities across different continents and states of economic development. Click for larger image    Around the year 2000 London&apos;s technology sector really took off, and employment in the digital economy has increased by almost 50% since 1997. Taking inner East London as a standalone region, high tech employment has nearly doubled in 15 years. Mumbai&apos;s rapid population growth is symptomatic of nationwide trends, and has come at an environmental cost, with CO2 emissions per capita for India as a whole increasing at a faster rate than the port city&apos;s population. Peak electricity demand in Mumbai has also rocketed upwards, increasing by over 75% in ten years. Berlin&apos;s population has remained relatively constant since 1993, but a decreasing reliance on non-renewable energy across Germany as a whole has improved its environmental credentials. The capital&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita have dropped by over 30% in 18 years. Vehicle ownership in Sao Paulo is booming, but traffic speeds during evening rush hour have fallen since 1993, suggesting its road network is struggling to cope with congestion. Unpacking London: energy &amp; pollution     Data on energy and pollution in London, mapped and analysed over time. Click for larger image    Three quarters of London&apos;s energy consumption is fueled directly by oil and gas, with the vast majority of the remainder generated by fossil-fuel-powered electricity. Just 2.1% comes either direct from waste and renewables or from renewably-generated electricity. London&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita are higher than the world average, but lower than those of comparable developed cities New York and Portland, as well as Singapore. Landfill is gradually being phased out as a method of solid waste management, but still accounted for roughly one third of the total in 2011/12. Incineration and recycling/composting also make up around a third each. London&apos;s air contains more than 2.5 times as much NO2 than the EU standard - still slightly less than Paris - but is well below the EU&apos;s recommended ceiling for particulate matter. PM10 counts in Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam are all higher than that of London. NO2 levels closely follow London&apos;s road network, with Heathrow Airport and the M4 standing out as particularly high. Unpacking London: transport, tech and planning     Data on transport, planning and the digital economy in London, mapped and analysed over time. Click for larger image    Since 1993 car travel has decreased faster in London than across the UK as a whole, and average annual distance traveled per person in 2011 was roughly half of that for the country overall. Bus, tube and overground travel continues to grow, with distance traveled on public transport approaching the same level as car miles. Cycling has taken off in London, with the number of cyclists in the capital trebling since 1985, and overtaking that of both New York and Stockholm. Berlin remains ahead of London on this nominal measure, and at 13% has one of the highest proportions of cycle trips a share of all journeys. London&apos;s office space is well served by public transport links: almost 1m cubic metres was built between 2004 and 2011 within 500m of a station, with no new office construction more than 2km from a public transport hub. The City of London has seen more new office space than any other part of the capital, while the bulk of retail and leisure floorspace has gone to the Olympic Park and surrounding area. Shoreditch has the highest density of IT jobs in the city, followed by Holborn and parts of the City of London. Despite its strong performance in the digital economy, London has slower broadband speeds (both download and upload) than European neighbours including Berlin, Paris and Copenhagen, as well as Tokyo and Seoul, whose speeds are several times faster.

The commission&apos;s independent chairman, Christopher Quinlan QC, stressed it and the FA accepted that &quot;at the time he threatened the referee, the player genuinely believed that the referee had racially abused him&quot; and, had that not been the case, &quot;the suspension would have been significantly longer&quot;. The FA investigated the allegations and found there was no case for Clattenburg to answer. Mikel will also to miss the game at Leeds and the a Premier League game match against Aston Villa.

US investment bank Citigroup has confirmed that traders in its London office made two of a series of six gas deals that prompted inquiries by the Financial Services Authority and the energy watchdog, Ofgem. The sales were made around the &quot;window&quot; in which so-called price reporting agencies set the benchmark price for gas. In both deals, late in the afternoon of 28 September, Citigroup sold gas at 58.00p per therm \u2013 substantially below the price of other deals earlier in the day and later. Earlier this month, Seth Freedman, an employee of price-setting firm ICIS Heren, went public in the Guardian with concerns about what he feared were widespread attempts to manipulate the wholesale gas market. He said his suspicions were aroused by the series of mysteriously underpriced deals on 28 September, a key day in the gas calender. After Freedman raised the alarm, ICIS Heren expressed concern that the 58p trades could indicate market manipulation and reported it to Ofgem last month. It has since emerged that another price reporting agency, Platts, which takes the temperature of the market at around the same time of day, decided that a more appropriate price for gas was 59.10p and declared that in its daily roundup. A third agency, Argus, said it also set a higher benchmark figure for the day, concluding that the series of 58p trades was &quot;unrepresentative of prices at the close&quot;. The involvement of a bank in unusual gas trades will raise concerns about speculation in non-financial markets but may be a relief to Britain&apos;s beleaguered energy firms, who have all denied involvement in attempts to manipulate gas prices. The identity of the companies that sold the four other consignments of gas at 58p on 28 September are unknown. FSA attention is likely to be centred on who first posted at this rate. It is understood that Citigroup was not responsible for the first deal. The US-based bank, whose global head of commodity trading is based in London, said it was not trading on its own behalf. &quot;Citi&apos;s activity in the natural gas market on 28 September was related to client activity, and all Citi trades were completed at levels consistent with the context of the market at the time they were executed,&quot; a bank spokesman said. &quot;Citi provides a variety of services to assist corporate clients in managing future cash flows. As a function of providing these services, Citi participates in a number of commodity markets, including the market for natural gas,&quot; he added. There is no suggestion at this stage that Citigroup has acted illegally or improperly, but the fact that it, along with many other top names, has been linked with the Libor interbank lending rate will increase concerns. Last December, Japan&apos;s Financial Services Agency found that two ex-Citi employees in Tokyo had tried to pressure colleagues and employees at other banks involved in the rate-setting process for the Japanese equivalent of Libor, the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate. The bank wrote off $50m associated with this activity, which came to light after a Citi trader in London reported it. Barclays, another bank at the centre of the Libor scandal, is trying to fight off a $480m fine from a US regulator for allegedly trying to manipulate the Californian electricity market. In a Commons debate last month after the market-rigging allegations first surfaced, Labour MP Frank Dobson said the involvement of hedge funds and banks in the gas market had turned it into &quot;nothing more than a speculative racket.&quot; The major energy suppliers have all issued statements that their traders operate under strict guidelines and would not be involved in market manipulation. But an industry source whose employer is active in these markets, who demanded anonymity, revealed that one of the six lots of gas sold for 58p on 28 September 28 was bought by Russian energy giant Gazprom. A spokesman for Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading in London said it did not engage in &quot;malpractice&quot; in wholesale gas markets. &quot;We have robust governance and compliance policies and procedures in place, which are reviewed regularly. Our trading desk acts in line with such policies and follows the relevant and applicable market rules wherever we trade.&quot; The state-owned Moscow group is known to have its own concerns about the way an increasing number of long-term gas contracts have had their prices tied to short-term &quot;spot&quot; or &quot;hub&quot; prices as drawn up by the price reporting agencies. Sergeyi Komlev, head of contract structuring and price formation at Gazprom, told the Interfax news agency in February: &quot;Hub prices can easily be manipulated. Relatively small additional values of gas dumped on the market could bring day-ahead prices down. The losses from dumping by a cartel of buyers will be compensated next day with a profit, when a lower day-ahead price from a previous day devalues the entire supply portfolio, which is unacceptable for gas supplier.&quot; The price reporting agencies have also recently been under fire over the different methodologies they use. Concern about the way the over-the-counter (OTC) gas trading is reported has been raised by the discrepancy between the way the PRAs reported the 28 September closing price. Platts said it was 59.10p, while Argus said it was 58.50p and ICIS Heren said 58.25p. Following the Guardian&apos;s original revelations about the ICIS approach to Ofgem, Argus released the following statement justifying its price of 58.50p for 28 September: &quot;On the day in question, Argus excluded the allegedly manipulative trades as unrepresentative of prices at the close. Argus price reporters collate a broad range of evidence in order to exercise informed editorial judgment, rather than relying mechanistically on transaction data \u2013 which in this case were the vehicle of the alleged attempt at manipulation.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s just about setting here in Tokyo, which gives me the flimsiest of segues to ask you for a quick mention please of the fact that both the male and female Japanese national cricket teams are standing on chilly street corners looking for sponsors right now.", "&quot;In response to Mark&apos;s email (115th over), I am also following the OBO as the sun sets in Tokyo."], "tags": ["England in India 2012-13", "India cricket team", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-07T10:36:00Z", "title": "India v England \u2013 live! | Rob Smyth and Andy Bull", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/07/india-england-live-cricket-obo", "article": " Preamble The problem with achievement is that it leaves you with nothing to achieve. Since the turn of the century England have won their first series in Pakistan for 39 years, their first Test in Sri Lanka for 19 years (and their first series ever), their first series in the West Indies for 36 years, their first in South Africa for 40 years, their first Ashes series anywhere for 18 years, and they have become No1 in the world for the first time since the inception of the ICC Test Rankings, Only one significant goal remains: to win a Test series in Zimbabwe for the first time, but as that&apos;s not possible in the current climate, we must distract ourselves with their attempt to win a Test series in India for the first time since 1985. For the first time, perhaps, we can consider that a legitimate possibility. Alastair Cook? Kinell. His immense 136 not out is the main reason that England will resume on 216 for one, just 100 behind India. For reasons we&apos;re too tired/can&apos;t be bothered to go into at 3am, it&apos;s arguably not quite as good a position as it looks \u2013 the OBO&apos;s inherent Englishness compels us to accentuate the negative \u2013 but it&apos;s still, in any money, a decent position. And for the first time since the 1980s, England are probably favourites to win a series in India. There has been a bit of talk that India are rubbish. Nah, sorry, I&apos;m not having that. This is a relatively weak India side, but nobody else bar South Africa is capable of winning a four-Test series here. This could and would (not should, certainly not with eight days of the series to go) be a monstrous victory for England.  74th over: England 217-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 136, Trott 21) R Ashwin opens the bowling to Trott, with a slip, short leg and daft mid on. A leg bye takes England&apos;s deficit into two figures. The pitch looks terrible, really cracked, but its glare is worse than its bite at the moment.  75th over: England 218-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 136, Trott 22) Zaheer Khan starts at the other end, around the wicket to Trott. India will feel that, if they get one early, they could easily bowl England out for around 400, which would bring them back into the game. Trott works a single to leg. &quot;The reality is, after two good days, we need to spend most, if not all, of today consolidating and building up a big lead,&quot; says Iain Sedgley. &quot;If we lose a couple of wickets in the first session and the ball moves around, well \u2026.. you know the story, it could be a bit difficult. But, anyway, thanks for putting it all in context \u2013 who cares about India, while Zimbabwe has still to be conquered!&quot;  76th over: England 219-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 136, Trott 23) Ashwin gets one to turn sharply and hit Trott on the pad. He was outside the line but that was a nice piece of bowling. &quot;As a traditional bar-humbugger, I&apos;m more than a little fed up of the current festive celebrations already, so I&apos;d like to suggest that the cricketing brethren change their practices and begin to celebrate Cookmas,&quot; says Joe Kenrick. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t have to change the date as it&apos;s his birthday, and I&apos;m sure that Alastair will have achieved much more by the time he is 33, judging by the rate he is going. We can&apos;t be certain of his legacy in 2,000 years&apos; time, but I&apos;d like to think far less wars would have been started on behalf of him and his dad for one thing. Do any of the other OBO followers have any ideas and/or reservations on this theme?&quot;  77th over: England 219-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 136, Trott 23) Zaheer is switching around and over the wicket, as he has throughout the innings. It&apos;s been a quiet start to the day, with Trott dominating strike. Cook hasn&apos;t added to his overnight score, although he&apos;s only faced five balls in four overs.  78th over: England 219-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 136, Trott 23) Ashwin has a big appeal for LBW turned down when Cook misses a sweep. He was outside the line, though not by that much. A maiden. England have scored three runs in five overs this morning. The plan will be for these two to grind India down so that the more attacking players can take advantage later in the day.  79th over: England 221-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 137, Trott 23) Ojha on for Zaheer. Cook gets his first run of the morning. That&apos;s all your getting for now as I&apos;m having a sneezing fit.  80th over: England 221-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 137, Trott 23) &quot;Here&apos;s an early morning quandary,&quot; begins Sam Tarr. &quot;Perhaps pre-empting a pertinent question, but who are the next greats of the game? Ponting has retired, Tendulkar&apos;s surely imminent retirement will see the last of that terrific set of Indian batsmen, Kallis can&apos;t have that long to go, and Jayawardene and Sangakkara won&apos;t hold Sri Lanka&apos;s batting together forever. Chanderpaul must also be fed up of bailing the Windies out every Test match. We&apos;re talking batsmen here (although maybe the bowling department across the globe is the biggest concern), those who will score in excess of 10,000 runs at Test level, and I can see Cook, for sure, and who else? I doubt Pietersen has longevity \u2013 something will distract him \u2013 and so that leaves Michael Clarke, Graeme Smith (who I rate as a big awkward sod who scores big awkward sodding runs), Hashim Amla, AB De Villiers (ultra-talented and surely the next Saffers skipper, but who knows how that will affect him, especially with the keeping issue).....and? No-one from NZ or Pakistan, India&apos;s talent is raw, England are a little transitional right now, Australia&apos;s top three or four look vulnerable ... thoughts?&quot; Kohli and probably Pujara will make 10,000 Test runs. Warner could. Chandimal looks good, although 10,000 might be pushing it. Umar Akmal has the talent to make 10,000 Test runs, if not perhaps the temperament. Anyone else? My brain isn&apos;t really functioning at the moment.  81st over: England 221-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 137, Trott 23) The new ball is due, but MS Dhoni carries on with Ojha. A maiden to Trott, so that&apos;s five runs in eight overs now. Trott has 23 from 96 balls.  &quot;Regarding Joe Kenrick&apos;s email (76th over) about Cook&apos;s birthday being on Christmas day, does anyone else find it a little odd that Cook came in to the side to replace Banger, who&apos;s also a Christmas Day baby?&quot; says Jos Roberts. &quot;Oris that just me being still up at quarter to 4 waiting for a call from work... I wonder how many other batsmen have shared their birthday with the man they&apos;ve replaced.&quot; Simon Jones was born on Christmas Day as well.  82nd over: England 226-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 138, Trott 27) Trott fetches Ashwin from outside off stump, sweeping him for a couple, and then shovles two more over his shoulder. There&apos;s a bit more turn this morning, certainly for Ashwin, which will please England. If they get a lead of 150 they will have a fantastic chance of victory.  83rd over: England 227-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 139, Trott 27) &quot;Cook n Trott... in India... first innings... building up to a lead...&quot; says Adam Hirst. &quot;No rush \u2013 today could be a day for the purists. It will still have to go some to match this little beaut though. Three solid hours of Boycs and Tavs batting together in India. It doesn&apos;t get any better than that for the cricket purist, the ultimate Test. No wonder TV didn&apos;t cover those overseas overnight series back in the Golden Days. Would anyone have stayed up through the night for that?&quot; That&apos;s actually not bad from Tavare: 149 from 303 balls, 18 fours. Fire up the DeLorean.  84th over: England 233-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 144, Trott 28) Cook gets the first boundary of the day with a delightful inside-out drive through extra cover off Ashwin. The next ball is a peach that dips onto middle stump before turning past the edge.  85th over: England 235-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 144, Trott 30) Trott drives Ojha pleasantly for a couple. Runs are coming a little more freely now.  86th over: England 238-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 145, Trott 32) This isn&apos;t, as you may have discerned, the most spine-tingling passage of play, but England will not care about that. Cook and Trott are playing it just about right, wearing down the bowlers so that Pietersen, Bell and the rest can punish them later in the day. &quot;Botham clearly got bored of watching them from the hutch for a day and a half for 350,&quot; says Adam Hirst. &quot;Strike rate a little incongruous there.&quot;  87th over: England 239-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 146, Trott 32) &quot;Morning Rob!&quot; says Matthew in Maryland. &quot;Yesterday&apos;s warm glow of my girl asking about the cricket has been replaced by the cold reality of her going to bed early (and the pup padding along with her) and me working out just how late I can reasonably stay up and still be functional for a 7:30 meeting in the morning.&quot; Go to bed, I suspect you won&apos;t miss much in the next couple of hours.  88th over: England 246-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 147, Trott 38) Grass is growing, paint is drying, and Jonathan Trott is batting. Actually, that&apos;s not fair; he&apos;s doing an extremely good job in the context of the match. And he has also just scored first boundary of the day, a classy extra-cover drive off Ashwin. England trail by 70. Cook and Trott have been excellent this morning; they haven&apos;t given India a sniff.  89th over: England 250-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 151, Trott 38) Now India do take the new ball. Zaheer is a touch too straight to Cook, who works him through midwicket for four more to bring up his 150. Another day, another daddy. Gordon Gekko would love Alastair Cook. What a player! &quot;10,000 runs?&quot; says Gary Naylor &quot;Darren Bravo, Angelo Matthews, Shalib al Hasan, maybe.&quot; Who are the next great bowlers? Finn, Cummins  90th over: England 255-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 151, Trott 42) Ishant Sharma&apos;s first ball lifts sharply and almost hits Trott in the armpit as he shoulders arms. Later in the over Trott reaches forward to time a nice square drive for four, the third boundary in as many overs. Then a delivery from Sharma, wide of off stump, keeps very low. That uneven bounce will interest Steven Finn in particular later in the match. Having survived the first hour without losing any wickets, England are in a ridiculously good position. &quot;Rob, morning from Australia,&quot; says Richard Clayton. &quot;I work in an office of one Pom (me) and several Indians. At the start of the second Test we took our usual positions of long suffering and knowingly superior, respectively. We are now at condescendingly smug and contrite. I prefer this.&quot;  91st over: England 266-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 151, Trott 53) A risible misfield from Sehwag at midwicket gives Trott a couple of runs off Zaheer, and then he flicks consecutive boundaries \u2013 one to midwicket, one to fine leg \u2013 to move to a solid and much needed half-century from 131 balls. England have scored 20 from three overs with the second new ball. &quot;A slow start is a good thing,&quot; says Duncan Smith. &quot;It&apos;s the start of a new day, and Cook may have a lot of runs on the board but it is a totally new innings, changed pitch and conditions. Boycott would approve of proper innings building.&quot;  92nd over: England 267-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 151, Trott 54) Sharma gets some nasty bounce to rap Cook on the glove, and then the next ball stays down. These are all good signs for England. &quot;Cook, it seems, is a very selfish man, a very selfish captain and I think the rest of the team must dislike him a lot,&quot; says John Allen. &quot;At least when Strauss was in charge they knew that the next morning after a century they&apos;d all get a crack at batting, too.&quot;  93rd over: England 267-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 152, Trott 55) Imagine how proud Graham Gooch must be, watching his man score big hundred after big hundred. It&apos;s like having a second career. Cook must be a coach&apos;s dream.  94th over: England 273-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 156, Trott 54) Ishant Sharma has dropped Cook! This was one of the easiest return catches imaginable. The ball stopped on the pitch and hit high on the bat before looping gently back towards Sharma, who had enough time to slowly run his fingers through his luxuriant mane and still take the catch. He reached to his right, got both hands to the ball, and dropped it. That is a shocker. That&apos;s the second time Cook has been dropped; Pujara at first slip put him down on 17.  &quot;Whilst whiling the morning away on a small boat winding through a Vietnamese floating market I was trying to figure out if there had been a better opening batsman and bowler combination for England than Cook and great Jimmy (good no longer enough),&quot; says Mark Lewis. &quot;Gooch &amp; Botham maybe? A strong start with bat and ball defines an innings and the current pair are best I&apos;ve watched! also it&apos;s starting to get a little too hot here now. Ah well time for a Mekong cruise!&quot; Gooch&apos;s best years came after Beefy peak with the ball. Boycott and Botham? Hutton and Trueman certainly. Hobbs and Larwood. Sutcliffe and Larwood.  95th over: England 274-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 156, Trott 56) &quot;The only consolation to this comprehensive hammering,&quot; says Shankar Mony, &quot;is the knowledge that the typical English fan ties himself up in knots worrying about the worst so he won&apos;t enjoy this position of dominance.&quot; On the contrary, this is the scene in the Guardian office right now.  96th over: England 278-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 156, Trott 60) Trott drives Sharma easily through the covers for four more. He scored 32 off his first 118 balls and has added 28 from 32 since. &quot;I&apos;m up for Cookmas \u2013 even if it entails pilgrimaging to Gloucester to commemorate his birth,&quot; says Jennifer Roesler. &quot;We&apos;ve got the Shepherds covered but who would be our three Wise Men?&quot;  97th over: England 279-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 157, Trott 60) I wonder if Alastair Cook has ever, at any stage in his life, been bored of batting. Almost certainly not. A wide delivery from Zaheer is drilled to the cover sweeper for a single.  98th over: England 282-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 159, Trott 61) England are in no hurry. They would surely like to bat on for at least another day in an attempt to achieve full mental and physical disintegration. Mind you, India don&apos;t look far from that at the moment. Their body language is pretty poor. &quot;We had the pleasure of meeting the England team last week at a dinner hosted by the British Deputy High Commission here in Mumbai,&quot; says Mark Hannant. &quot;My wife, Munni, asked Cook if, after the first Test, he&apos;d been given a bit of a talking to. &quot;As I&apos;m the captain it was down to me to do the talking!&quot; was his reply. Boris Johnson was also in town. In his breakfast speech the following day he noted the correlation between his arrival in India and the upturn in England&apos;s fortunes.&quot; I know Cook has scored 514 runs at an average of 171.33, but it&apos;ll be a scandal if Boris doesn&apos;t get Man of the Series, whatever the result.  99th over: England 285-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 160, Trott 62) Cook is beaten by a beautiful flighted delivery from Ashwin that turns past his defensive push. He has a tentative shout for LBW later in the over; Trott was well outside the line. &quot;Opening batsman/bowler combo,&quot; says Paul Ewart. &quot;I give you this. Mark Lathwell &amp; Martin McCague or Mark Ilott. Anyone think they can better that?&quot;  100th over: England 287-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 161, Trott 63) Ojha comes on for Ishant Sharma. A lot goes on but nothing happens. &quot;At work in Sydney following online,&quot; says Kate Matterson. &quot;No wise men in Australian team. Absolutely no mention of the Eng v India Test or Cook&apos;s achievement in the Sydney Morning Herald today. I think they are shaking in their shoes and recalling the Gabba in 2010! Bring on the Ashes...&quot;  101st over: England 287-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 161, Trott 63) Ashwin has an appeal for a bat-pad catch against Trott turned down by Rod Tucker. It missed the bat by a fair way. He&apos;s getting some pretty sharp turn now, and Trott has to endure a difficult over. He attempts to sweep the fifth ball and very nearly drags it back onto the leg stump. He hit it onto the glove and then back onto the boot; had it not hit the heel of the boot it would have hit the stumps. An excellent over from Ashwin, probably the best of the morning.  102nd over: England 287-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 161, Trott 63) More sharp turn, this time for Ojha, with Trott beaten by a fine delivery. Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar may well be licking their lips right now. &quot;Wise men,&quot; says Andrew Jolly. &quot;Graham Gooch is obviously one.&quot;  103rd over: England 291-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 163, Trott 65) This is a hairy little spell for England on the stroke of lunch. Cook is beaten, trying to cut a quicker ball from Ashwin. He is a little becalmed, with just 27 runs in the session &quot;This pair are so good at wearing down an attack in such a way as to leave them demoralised for the rest of the series,&quot; says Tom Goodfellow. &quot;They did it on Australia a couple of years back, and look to be doing it again. Triffic.&quot;  104th over: England 292-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 164, Trott 65) One more over before lunch.  105th over: England 296-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 167, Trott 66) That&apos;s the end of a brilliant morning for England. I suppose you could argue they were ever so slightly on the slow side, with 80 runs coming from 32 overs, but by not losing a wicket they have almost certainly put India out of the game. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  LUNCH  106th over: England 297-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 167, Trott 67) Pragyan Ojha (27-5-74-1) will start after lunch. Trott pushes a single to leg to move to 67. He and Cook are having a race to their respective milestones. Well, a meander. In other news, this is a great link from Andrew Jolly \u2013 the most runs by Test openers since January 1 2010. &quot;Okay Cook has nine more innings than Sehwag,&quot; says Andrew, &quot;but look at the balls faced!&quot; That is astonishing. Cook has faced 6987 balls \u2013\u00a0almost twice the next man on the list, Graeme Smith with 3713.  107th over: England 298-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 167, Trott 68) It&apos;ll be R Ashwin from the High Court End. He bowled nicely before lunch, beating the bat on a number of occasions. A quiet first over brings just a single to Trott. &quot;Cook,&quot; says Matt Farrell. &quot;Could he do it on a wet Tuesday night in Stoke?&quot;  108th over: England 298-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 167, Trott 68) Ojha spits a beauty past Trott&apos;s forward defensive. That ragged a long way and missed the edge by a distance. &quot;Are you as worried as me about India batting forever (four sessions) and saving this?&quot; says Andrew Hurley. &quot;Is there enough in the pitch for England to feel confident? And you can&apos;t help feeling you wouldn&apos;t mind swapping Trott for Pietersen in not too long to move things along just a bit quicker...&quot; I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m worried, although it is keeping me awake at night. We don&apos;t know what the pitch will do on the last two days but the signs are decent, with uneven bounce and sharp (if sporadic) turn today. An England win is surely the likeliest result. I do agree that they need to get a jump on sooner rather than later, though.  109th over: England 304-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 172, Trott 69) This pitch is doing a fair bit now. Consecutive big-spinning deliveries from Ashwin bring false strokes from Cook, the first an edged drive wide of slip for four and the second a play and miss.  110th over: England 304-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 172, Trott 69) &quot;How long before someone starts talking about the declaration...&quot; says Patrick Murphy. &quot;England need to treat this as a three-innings game or treat this first innings as their second and forget about batting a second time. Bat long \u2013 until tea tomorrow if possible and leave India four sessions to hang in there against Monty and Swann. Takes India&apos;s winning the toss out the equation. In short, forget about declaring at all and just bat and bat.&quot; There could well be a collapse at some stage, so the declaration might not come into it. But if it does I&apos;d imagine it&apos;ll be somewhere between lunch and tea tomorrow. There&apos;s certainly a good case for batting on and on. Full mental and physical disintegration. It worked in Australia in 2010-11 and this match has, thus far, followed that pattern.  111th over: England 310-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 173, Trott 74) Trott edges Ashwin for four with the help of this extremely fast outfield. &quot;I fear Trott&apos;s selfishness will end up costing England a lot of time,&quot; says Andrew Hurley. &quot;He needs to up his scoring rate, as England don&apos;t need a century from him but quicker runs. Trott really makes you value Matt Prior and his attitude.&quot; Sometimes the box seat can get a bit too comfortable I suppose, as we saw famously at Johannesburg in 1995.  112th over: England 313-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 173, Trott 77) Trott laps Ojha for two more. We&apos;ve just seen a close-up of the pitch again. It looks hideous. As Bumble says on Sky, this has surely got to turn big before the end of the match.  113th over: England 319-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 173, Trott 83) Trott reverse sweeps Ashwin for four. That&apos;s the first real sign that England want to kick on, and those runs also take them into the lead.  114th over: England 320-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 174, Trott 83) Another misfield, the 47th of the innings, gives Cook a run. This time it was Kohli. Ojha has a big if slightly desperate LBW appeal against Trott later in the over. It didn&apos;t straighten enough and Kumar Dharmasena, who has had a good game, says not out. &quot;I&apos;m writing in from a part of the world where people care little for what&apos;s happening in the cricket, yet Manchester United fans are in abundance,&quot; says Andy Dodd. &quot;The Naga hills (in India) are a wonderful place from where to follow the OBO. Beautiful sunshine, a cool breeze and green mountains rolling into the distance. They seem to go on forever \u2013 the perfect natural metaphor for Cook&apos;s batting surely.&quot;  115th over: England 329-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 183, Trott 83) I was just about to type &apos;Cook has got a bit stuck&apos; when he swaggered jauntily down the track to Ashwin and lifted him elegantly down the ground for six, a repeat of the eye-opening shot he played yesterday. That&apos;s just lovely batting. &quot;Is the sun even up there in London yet?&quot; asks Mark Hiratsuka. I don&apos;t think so, although it&apos;s hard to tell from the bunker. &quot;It&apos;s just about setting here in Tokyo, which gives me the flimsiest of segues to ask you for a quick mention please of the fact that both the male and female Japanese national cricket teams are standing on chilly street corners looking for sponsors right now. Never easy at this time of year, eh? The men need sponsorship for a very ambitious tour of the UK next summer, while the women are after a main sponsor. If you&apos;re curious, the Japanese gals won a bronze medal at the 2010 Asian Games and are up against mighty Ireland and the Test-playing nations in T20 in 2013. The Japan cricket head is the wonderful Mr Miyaji and he&apos;s on n-miyaji@cricket.or.jp. You&apos;re too kind. Domo arigato.&quot; That sounds like a great subject for the Spin as well; I shall mention it to Bull when he wakes me up in an hour or so.  116th over: England 331-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 185, Trott 83) Cook, sent back by Trott, gets home comfortably, although he might have been out with a direct hit from midwicket.  117th over: England 333-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 186, Trott 84) &quot;In honour of the greatest living Englishman,&quot; begins Simon McMahon.   &quot;There was a fine batsman named CookBatting records were all that he tookA sublime cover driveMakes us glad we&apos;re aliveAnd what&apos;s more he can pull, cut and hook!&quot;   118th over: England 334-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 187, Trott 84) If Cook does get to 200, he will become only the fourth Englishman to make three double hundreds or more in Tests. The others are Wally Hammond, Len Hutton and Kevin Pietersen.  119th over: England 338-1 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 188, Trott 87) Trott top-edges a sweep off Ashwin which loops safely to fine leg for a couple. The lead is 23.  WICKET! England 338-2 (Trott c Dhoni b Ojha 87) I&apos;m not sure which team will be happer with this wicket. Trott has gone, 13 short of his hundred, but the manner of his dismissal will please England. It was a peach from Ojha that turned sharply to take the edge, and Dhoni took an extremely good catch.  120th over: England 339-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 188, Pietersen 1) Morning Kevin!  121st over: England 339-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 188, Pietersen 1) With KP at the crease, MS Dhoni gives the ball to Yuvraj Singh. He almost strikes first ball, with Pietersen inside-edging a grubber not far from off stump. There&apos;s another inside edge later in the over, this time onto the pads. Pietersen looks like he&apos;s struggling to resist the urge to dump Yuvraj out of the ground. Here&apos;s Richard Robins. &quot;Back to my question of yesterday (which was rather rudely cut) so you could print only the best bits. (Obviously all relative.)Are you a &apos;proper&apos; cricket fan if you watched more cricket on the OBO than live/TV?&quot; Did you email yesterday? I must be misplacing more marbles, I don&apos;t remember that at all. Anyway, good question. I have no idea what the answer is though. Hope this helps!  122nd over: England 339-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 188, Pietersen 1) &quot;11pm in Seattle,&quot; says Seamus Devlin, of whom I am already insanely jealous. Seattle! &quot;I have one more Stella in me, so prediction please Rob for where we&apos;ll be at the close today. It&apos;ll help me sleep if I know.&quot; They will be 447 for seven. Night!  123rd over: England 343-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 188, Pietersen 5) Yuvraj continues after the drinks break. Pietersen defends carefully, almost patronisingly, and then savages a wide half-volley for four. &quot;Having woken up at various points in the dead of night and checked the OBO, the accumulation of Chef has become this wondrous, inexorable delight,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;I can scarcely believe this man actually has a central nervous system, so calm is he. But with KP at the other end things should warm up. You feel he&apos;ll either get 124 or 5 here.&quot;  124th over: England 348-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 189, Pietersen 5) An excellent quicker delivery from Ojha beats Pietersen, the leg stump and finally Dhoni on its way for four byes. &quot;Afternoon Rob,&quot; says Andy Welch. &quot;In response to Mark&apos;s email (115th over), I am also following the OBO as the sun sets in Tokyo. I remember being dropped in the slips by Mr Naoki Miyaji back in 2009 in the semi finals of the Japan Cup, a tournament our pub team went on to win that year. For an astonishingly average cricketer, it&apos;s nice to have the comeback, &apos;And how many national titles have you won?&apos;.&quot;  125th over: England 353-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 190, Pietersen 9) Yuvraj is throwing pies. A loopy full toss is waved past mid on for four by Pietersen. England lead by 37.  126th over: England 357-2 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Cook 190, Pietersen 9) A filthy delivery from Ojha to Cook races down the leg side for four more byes. Can anyone score some Pro Plus? &quot;The national TV news here in Australia has just shown some highlights and referred to him as &apos;Captain Cook&apos;,&quot; says Jennifer Roesler. &quot;No doubt the Aussie media will be awash with such references when he voyages Down Under with his fleet next year. Oh very dear.&quot;  WICKET! England 359-3 (Cook run out 190) Alastair Cook has been run out in bizarre circumstances. He can&apos;t believe what he&apos;s done. He&apos;s leaning on his bat handle, head down almost in shame. Pietersen flicked Zaheer to Kohli at square leg, who threw down the stumps at the non-striker&apos;s end. Cook, who had backed up and was about to ground his bat, lifted it instinctively as he tried to avoid the Kohli throw \u2013 but he wasn&apos;t in his ground at the time. Had he been home and then left his ground as he avoided the throw, he would have been not out because he was taking evasive action. Kumar Dharmasena and Rod Tucker had a chat, checked with the third umpire and gave Cook out. It&apos;s a strange end to a monumental innings, and you suspect Cook will be disgusted with himself for such an unusual lapse in concentration. He really shouldn&apos;t be. You&apos;re allowed to lose concentration after facing 1160 balls in the series.  127th over: England 359-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 11, Bell 0) What an odd dismissal. Can anyone remember an equivalent? I can&apos;t recall one, and I&apos;m special.  128th over: England 361-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 12, Bell 1) If Cook had not moved, that throw would have almost certainly hit his bat or body. He flinched to avoid the ball, the sort of thing that only happens when you are completely shattered mentally.  129th over: England 361-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 12, Bell 1) Bell, Bairstow and now Cook. What is it with England, India and weird dismissals.  130th over: England 361-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 12, Bell 1) A maiden from Ojha to Bell. &quot;The question Richard Robins put in the 121st over clearly begs my follow-up question: are you a &apos;proper&apos; cricket fan if you learnt the laws of cricket (or at least to understand the game) by reading the OBO (and going to Wikipedia for explanations of terms) and only later actually saw the game played,&quot; says Sara Torvalds. &quot; After I fell in love with cricket \u2013 which was when I understood the concept of the declaration \u2013 I got an &apos;English Summer of Cricket&apos; DVD off Amazon... But I&apos;ve been to a Test match at Lord&apos;s since (I saw KP&apos;s double hundred against India, incidentally), if that is improves my odds of being a proper fan...&quot; Did you meet &apos;The&apos; Gary Naylor when you were over here?  131st over: England 366-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 16, Bell 1) Ishant Sharma has come on to replace Zaheer Khan. One more wicket would give India the merest sniff, because England have a longer tail than usual. These two are comfortable at the moment, however, and Pietersen flicks Sharma crisply through midwicket for four. That Cook run out might just be the weirdest since the Dean Jones incident in 1991. &quot;If any of your readers fancies a game of indoor cricket near Canary Wharf next Tuesday, or wants to try out for Seveno \u2013 the Wimbledon / Morden based cricket team I play for \u2013 next season, could they get in touch on seveno.availability@gmail.com,&quot; says James Walsh. &quot;We&apos;re not very good, but we&apos;re enthusiastic.&quot; True, but then so is a dog that regularly deposits fibre on the lounge rug.  132nd over: England 367-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 16, Bell 2)  133rd over: England 369-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 17, Bell 3) Sharma beats Bell, who nods respectfully. Both sides seem to be playing for tea. Astonishingly, that was Cook&apos;s first run-out in first-class cricket. &quot;In response to Cook&apos;s dismissal,&quot; begins Sam Abrahams, &quot;I think it&apos;s fair to say I speak for all of M\u00e9xico when I say, what a bummer.&quot; Mark it one nine zero, Dude.  134th over: England 376-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 24, Bell 3) Effortless brilliance from Pietersen, who charges Ojha and lifts him for a perfectly straight six.  135th over: England 381-3 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Pietersen 29, Bell 3) Pietersen sweeps the new bowler Ashwin flat and hard for four. That&apos;s tea. Another good session for England, despite the peculiar run-out of Alastair Cook for 190. Andy Bull&apos;s here now; see you at tomorrow.  TEA  Morning everyone. I&apos;ve a feeling I&apos;ve arrived just in time. This final session looks like it might be an entertaining way to start the day. Pietersen has made 29 from 58, and a couple of the shots he played at the end of that last session - one sweep in particular, whipping the ball away from outside off and whistling it away through leg - suggested that the man is in the mood to take names and collect dues. I&apos;m looking forward to this.  While you&apos;re waiting, here&apos;s a fiendish little quiz for you to have a got at. You have to name as many of the 174 men who scored Test centuries in the 2000s as you can in 20 minutes. Scott Oliver, the man who sent me the link, says he scored 115, which, I have to admit, is just a few more than I managed. I haven&apos;t heard what Smyth&apos;s score was yet, but I&apos;d be disappointed if it was anything below 171.  Rob put this email from Mark Hiratsuka up earlier, but it is worth repeating: &quot;Both the male and female Japanese national cricket teams are standing on chilly street corners looking for sponsors right now. Never easy at this time of year, eh? The men need sponsorship for a very ambitious tour of the UK next summer, while the women are after a main sponsor. If you&apos;re curious, the Japanese gals won a bronze medal at the 2010 Asian Games and are up against mighty Ireland and the Test-playing nations in T20 in 2013. The Japan cricket head is the wonderful Mr Miyaji and he&apos;s on n-miyaji@cricket.or.jp.&quot;  136th over: England 393-3 (Pietersen 41 Bell 3) Glory be. Sit back and buckle in folks. Ojha starts after Tea, and Pietersen, well, Pietersen cuts the first ball for four past point, drives the second for four through cover, and thumps the third for four through long-off. He blocks the fourth and fifth, and survives an LBW appeal from the sixth. The ball hit him outside the line. One quick gripe I need to get off my chest - it irks me that Ian Bell shouldn&apos;t have walked straight back into this team, regardless of how many runs he makes in this innings. Bairstow should have held on to it till the end of the series at least. Anyway.   WICKET! Bell 5 c Dhoni b Sharma (England 395-4) Ahem. I&apos;m saying nothing. Bell becomes the first English batsman to fail in this match so far. He&apos;s been caught behind off the inside edge, after throwing a loose drive at an innocuous delivery that was passing well wide of his stumps. Really, it&apos;s bizarre that Bell was picked for this match after everything he has been through in the last fortnight - the man has had to fly to England and back for goodness&apos; sake. Samit Patel is the new batsman, and Ishant makes him sway out of the way of his first ball, a bouncer.  138th over: England 403-4 (Pietersen 44 Patel 4) Bell&apos;s average is 27 in 13 Tests so far this year, with a top score of 76 against the West Indies. back in the middle, Patel has scored his first runs with a lovely shot, a sweetly-struck cut that races away past point for four runs.  139th over: England 403-4 (Pietersen 44 Patel 4) I&apos;m not going to make a habit of this, but i feel I do have to say that there&apos;s a rather fascinating T20 match going on in Australia right now, where the Melbourne Stars - featuring Shane Warne - are playing the Melbourne Renegades - featuring Muttiah Muralitharan. Right now Luke Wright - yes, that one - is 41 not out off 32 balls. Warne, by the way, is claiming to have invented a new delivery which he has called the &quot;disco ball&quot;. I think his tongue is in his cheek. Or it would be, but I&apos;m not sure his skin stretches that far anymore because of all the  plastic surgery  moisturiser he has been using. &quot;Have you seen the flashing stumps being used in the Big Bash?&quot; asks Alistair Stewart. &quot;The future of cricket is here!&quot; I haven&apos;t, no, but they sound horrendous. I believe Fox are planning to use a helmet cam during their coverage of the tournament too.  140th over: England 411-4 (Pietersen 45 Patel 10) Ashwin is on now, replacing Ojha. What a shot that is from Patel! If you&apos;d been squinting you might have thought it was Pietersen. I mean, you&apos;d have to be really squinting very hard indeed, given that he&apos;s about a foot shorter, twice as wide around the middle, and his skin is a different colour, but still, you get my gist. Samit stepped down the pitch and lofted the ball from middle stump away over mid-wicket for four, stylishly flicking his back foot up as he did so. &quot;With regard to Bell walking straight back into the side,&quot; writes Phil Withall, &quot;I wonder about the wisdom of it. His poor show in the first test, followed by his return to England for the birth of his child, with all that is involved with the experience and then the return. Not ideal preparation for a test return. He should have been released from the tour (dare I say left at home altogether) and Bairstow allowed to play the entire series. Foolish decision making.&quot; Second!  141st over: England 415-4 (Pietersen 49 Patel 11) A preposterous drive from Pietersen, who crouches down low and swings his bat down from way up above his head through the line of the ball. &quot;I quite take your point about Bell not walking back in,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst, &quot;but there is a wider point to consider too. As Compton has shown in this match, dynasties matter in English cricket, and that means that current players have to reproduce. If paternity meant losing their place, possibly forever, then our current players might not make that commitment to the future of English cricket, and in twenty years or so we&apos;d all be in trouble. If they know they can procreate and still keep their place (see Jimmy and the Ashes in Australia for example) then we are all better off in the long run. It&apos;s all about perspective and the long view. Admittedly an awful lot of perspective and a very long view, but still...&quot;  142nd over: England 415-4 (Pietersen 49 Patel 11) A maiden over, this one. &quot;I know this is very immature,&quot; writes Alex Netherton, &quot;but when you say helmet cam...&quot; Yes?  143rd over: England 416-4 (Pietersen 50 Patel 11) That&apos;s fifty for Pietersen, raised with a single to fine leg off Zaheer, who has come back into the attack. Brilliantly, the camera has just picked out Ian Botham&apos;s daughter in the crowd, and he had no idea she was there. &quot;Oh!&quot; he says, rather nonplussed, &quot;I thought she was in Colombo!&quot; The flashing stumps being used in the Big Bash are, I&apos;m told, called &quot;Zings&quot; and light up whenever the bails are knocked off. They will, Cricket Australia say, &quot;add another level of excitement for fans watching on television and at the ground&quot;. Oh mercy.  144th over: England 416-4 (Pietersen 50 Patel 11) &quot;The problem with Bairstow keeping his place is that it&apos;s possible Bell wouldn&apos;t have gone home if he&apos;d known that,&quot; says Nath Jones. &quot;Do we really want to discourage players from attending the birth of their children? If we&apos;re going to drop Bell, let&apos;s do it on form, not because he&apos;s done the right thing and taken some paternity leave.&quot; I&apos;ve no problem with him going home, I&apos;ve a problem with him coming back again.  WICKET! Pietersen 54 lbw b Ashwin (England 420-4) Pietersen plays a sweep, and misses a sweep. Up goes the umpire&apos;s finger. That&apos;s a shame, for fans and neutrals alike. Matt Prior is the new man in, with England leading by 104.  145th over: England 423-5 (Patel 13, Prior 1) Zaheer fires in a bouncer, and Patel pops up on his toes and pats it down to fine leg. I&apos;m not sure why so many people seem to have decided that he&apos;s not fit to be a Test batsman, he has a lovely touch. Something seems to have riled Zaheer, because he fizzes another bouncer down at Prior, and then spits out a few choice observations in his follow through. &quot;A good point about procreation and cricketing dynasties from Robin,&quot; writes Michael Keane. &quot;Perhaps the ICC should put a breeding window in the future tours schedule. And a birthing one 9 months later.&quot;  146th over: England 428-5 (Patel 16, Prior 2) A cheeky sweep from Prior, swatting the ball away behind square leg. Patel plays a similar shot to the next ball, and top-edges the ball over Dhoni&apos;s head. Sehwag, fielding at slip, trundles after it with all the urgency of a sloth on mogadon. &quot;Are we really discussing whether England cricketers can Have It All?&quot; asks Richard Marsden. &quot;Today&apos;s OBO, brought to you in conjunction with Loose Women.&quot; Up next: Rob Smyth asks &quot;Is the pressure of meeting other people&apos;s expectations when it comes to Christmas Dinner, really worth the effort?&quot;  147th over: England 433-5 (Patel 21, Prior 2) Actually I see that last week Loose Women asked their viewers &quot;Is there such thing as the joy of boredom? What do you think?&quot; Seven hours watching Cook and Compton bat together will soon answer that. Maybe there&apos;s more of a crossover with the OBO than I imagined. &quot;You have a problem with Bell coming back,&quot; thunders Gavin Wilson. &quot;Which means you want him to be punished for taking paternity leave, which obviously would discourage people doing it in future.&quot; No. These are the problems I have with Ian Bell: 1) his shot in the first innings in the first Test was the single most irresponsible piece of play by a senior batsman I can recall seeing in recent years 2) he is averaging 27 this year 3) why did he come out for the first Test when, as he has said himself, his mind wasn&apos;t on the job? 4) why has he taken up his place in the side again, when his preparation for this Test has involved flying back-and-forth around the world? If you&apos;re going to taker paternity leave, do it properly and sit out the tour. 5) OK, I admit, I just don&apos;t like the man very much.  148th over: England 442-5 (Patel 23, Prior 9) Prior carves three past point, and then, put back on strike by a single, clatters four through mid-wicket. Meanwhile Gustavo Pinto writes to say &quot;We Offer High Quality Ecuadorian Banana&quot;. Mr Pinto thoughtfully includes the following specifications: &quot;Type: Cavendish Banana. Class: Class A Premium. Average lenght: Min 8&quot; - Max 11&quot;. Calibration: Min 39 mm - Max 47 mm. Net Weight: 19 Kg. Fingers per cluster: Min 4 - Max 8.&quot; Thank you Mr Pinto. It&apos;s tempting, I have to say, but generally I prefer my bananas to have a calibration of more like 44mm to 51mm.  149th over: England 445-5 (Patel 25, Prior 10) England&apos;s lead is now 128. Those of you who thought I was sounding Victorian in my attitudes about Ian Bell will enjoy this missive from Anthony Doyle: &quot;I&apos;m not being funny, but as an International cricketer, you know every year you are likely to be abroad November-January minimum. It&apos;s not very hard to do a bit of family planning and plan for baby to arrive during the 9 months you&apos;re most likely to be in England. Bell&apos;s fault, shouldn&apos;t have played first test, shouldn&apos;t have played this test, in short, should have had to miss the tour.&quot;  150th over: England 449-5 (Patel 33, Prior 10)Ojha is back into the attack, replacing Ashwin. Patel tucks into him with real relish, whipping four one side of the wicket, and then thumping four more to the other.  WICKET! Patel 33 c Sehwag b Ojha (England 453-6) One shot too many from Samit, who cuts at an ugly short, wide, delivery from Ojha and slices the ball up off the top-edge. Sehwag stretches up an arm, and deflects the ball higher up into the air, pirouettes on the spot, then catches the rebound as it falls to earth.  151st over: England 464-6 (Prior 16, Swann 0) England&apos;s new No8, Graeme Swann, walks to the wicket. With a tail like this, England will take every run they can get from here on in, so they&apos;re happy to be gifted four byes by Dhoni, who makes a weak effort to gather the first ball of Sharma&apos;s over. And at the other end of the over, Prior swats a pull away for four more. Whatashot. &quot;Those zings in the Big Bash (143rd over) sound frankly a bit meh,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;If they&apos;re going to do it, couldn&apos;t they go the whole hog and attach little rockets - or at least large springs - to the bottom of the stumps so that when the bails come off the stumps blast up into the sky? Now that would be dramatic, especially if they then explode like fireworks. Though I suppose there is the danger of a fast bowler knocking the stumps over so that they then blast off in a perpendicular direction endangering the entire slip cordon, but hey, you want excitement, right?&quot;  152nd over: England 468-6 (Prior 16, Swann 4) I hope Swann doesn&apos;t try to bat properly now he has been bumped up the order. He blocks three balls from Ojha, then lustily slaps four past point. &quot;That Ecuadorian banana sounds like the ultimate mystery delivery to me,&quot; says Richard Woods. :Maybe a left armer&apos;s doosra?&quot;  153rd over: England 474-6 (Prior 21, Swann 5) A reverse-sweep from Prior, for four. &quot;Re: Anthony Doyle&apos;s views on Ian Bell&apos;s paternity leave,&quot; writes Robert Darby, &quot;What he appears to be saying is that with regards to Bell&apos;s family planning he should have played and missed until the time came to select the right stroke. Given Bell&apos;s form this year that is easier said than done.&quot;  154th over: England 478-6 (Prior 21, Swann 9) Swann wallops four down the ground, then essays a series of assiduous blocks. They way he&apos;s playing, it&apos;s a little like watching a man sneak a sweet from the jar when he thinks no one is looking.  155th over: England 483-6 (Prior 25, Swann 9) There&apos;s aplenty of spin out there now for Ashwin, though it doesn&apos;t stop Prior sweeping him for four. Hallelujah - and email that isn&apos;t about Ian Bell. &quot;At the risk of putting the mockers on him, Matt Prior really is special isn&apos;t he?&quot; It&apos;s not the most original observation, Martin Whitaker, but it is true. &quot;He&apos;s now within a gnat&apos;s whisker of having the highest batting average for an English wicketkeeper - currently the pre-war Les Ames - and his glovework is pretty much irreproachable too. Almost makes one forget how it was a position of constant debate for about 20 years.&quot;  156th over: England 484-6 (Prior 26, Swann 10) Just two singles from this over.  157th over: England 488-6 (Prior 27, Swann 13) Here&apos;s Eva Broer: &quot;Little thought on the joy of boredom; I am currently sitting in a rather large meeting room, all alone, waiting for members of a research degrees sub-committee to rock up. The meeting was supposed to start at 10:00, but as the Chair is currently stuck on a train outside of Croydon, it has been postponed till he gets here. I am in the room to inform the members who didn&apos;t get the email of this joyous fact. Though the delay is annoying and I am bored of sitting on my own, having the chance to read the OBO instead of taking minutes (surely the most tedious task imaginable) is rather joyous. Also, Ian Ronald should have stayed home, but don&apos;t be too harsh on him. On a good day he can be quite magnificent.&quot;  158th over: England 488-6 (Prior 27, Swann 13) A maiden over, this one. There are five overs left today. &quot;Is there any such thing as the Joy of Boredom?&quot; asks Richard Harris. &quot;A more pertinent question would be why aren&apos;t we funding research into the Theory of Relative Boredom? Was watching Geoffrey Boycott take 7hrs and 22 minutes to block and pad his way to 77 against New Zealand in 1978 more boring than watching Jonathan Trott or Cook stretch the quest for runs to similar feats of endurance? Arguably yes, because there were fewer alternative distractions and no multi-angle coverage, but have boredom thresholds decreased as the number of TV channels has soared?&quot;  159th over: England 494-6 (Prior 32, Swann 14) Four more for Prior. &quot;Aggers and Geoffrey (PRSY) are discussing the Big Bash trinkets on TMS,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;Boycs, talking about the stumps &quot;explosion&quot; said: &quot;I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d enjoy that, if Michael Holding had knocked my stumps twenty yards back and then they lit up. There was enough noise when I got out, with people jumping up and down all over the place.&quot; Fantastic stuff. But Boycott&apos;s made a very good point, that all the &apos;innovations&apos; are done to T20, and that administrators do nothing out of the ordinary to sell a Test Match. He&apos;s bang on. Why we&apos;d never had day/night tests before now on the sub-continent is beyond me.&quot; Honestly, keep the bloody trinkets. Day/Night Tests have to be worth trying, but otherwise Test cricket is just fine as it is. The last thing it needs is these.  160th over: England 499-6 (Prior 39, Swann 15) Prior murders this delivery from Ojha, I mean, he really kills it, stone dead. What a shot. &quot;I spent a large portion of my younger test-watching days full of false optimism when England got Australia 6-down with a lead of &apos;only&apos; 120 in games like this,&quot; says Stephen Cottrell. &quot;Usually Gilchrist, with Lee or Warne, would then crush all hope out of England. Prior is getting there. 15 more runs and he&apos;ll have made this England&apos;s day.&quot; This is already England&apos;s say, surely? But yes, Prior is fast becoming my favourite cricketer in this team, along with Cook. I am little surprised he&apos;s not the vice captain, to be honest. I wonder if they have appointed anyone to take over from Cook in this match, given that broad isn&apos;t playing? They must have an arrangement in place in case Cook has to go off injured.  161st over: England 503-6 (Prior 39, Swann 19) Sharma is too wide, and pays for it as Swann crashes another four away square. Over in Melbourne, Shane Warne&apos;s first over back in cricket has gone for 19 runs ouch. Aaron Finch hit him for successive sixes.  162nd over: England 507-6 (Prior 40, Swann 19) The penultimate over of the day also happens to be Ojha&apos;s fiftieth of the innings. He&apos;s a weary man, and his mood isn&apos;t improved any when Prior knocks four more past point off his first ball. Ah, well, there we go. &quot;According to the ECB twitter account, Matt Prior is vice-captain for this match,&quot; thanks for that, Lorraine Reese.  163rd over: England 509-6 (Prior 40, Swann 21) The last over of the day will be bowled by Ishant Sharma, and, as has so often been the case, it includes a delivery that was far too wide of off-stump, which Swann knocked away for two. He shouldn&apos;t have got anything for it, but there was a misfield by the man at backward point. That delivery summed up India&apos;s day, in so many ways.  So, that&apos;s all folks. England lead by 193 runs, and I imagine they&apos;ll want to stretch that advantage just a little more tomorrow beginning before beginning the serious business of trying to bowl India out. Rob will be back here at 3.15 am or so to talk you through it.

It has one of the highest population densities of any city in the world combined with one of the wealthiest: gross national income per capita is $45,090 (\u00a328,115). With every square foot of real estate at a premium, people tend to stay out of the home to socialise; local restaurants become neighbourhood living rooms. According to LSE Cities, nearly 45% of all trips in Hong Kong are made on foot. All of which lends itself to a very healthy lifestyle. Its life expectancy, at 82.5, is one of the world&apos;s highest; its infant mortality rate, one of the lowest. It also has a high number of registered doctors \u2013 12,818 to be precise, at the end of 2011, which is a ratio of 1:554 of the population. Given the city&apos;s density, that probably means most people live in the same building as one. 2. Tokyo  Tokyo remains the world&apos;s biggest city with a greater metropolitan population of some 35 million and \u2013 as with Hong Kong \u2013 one of the wealthiest, producing a GDP of $1,479bn (\u00a3922.3bn). Having arguably the world&apos;s best public transport systems leads to healthier lifestyles and (relatively) lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE). According to the London School of Economics professor Ricky Burdett: &quot;The average commute in Tokyo takes one hour, whereas Sao Paulo and Mexico City, which are smaller populations but enormous cities, have average commuting times of four hours.&quot; Japan&apos;s life expectancy remains the highest in the world \u2013 85.9 years for women and 79.4 years for men \u2013 perhaps helped in part by the fact that the number of murders in Tokyo is very low by global urban standards: 7.7 per million people in 2010. 3. Copenhagen  Western Europe&apos;s major cities all fair well in health and wellbeing listings, consistently outperforming any city in North or South America. However, Scandinavia remains the health and wellbeing capital of Europe. Denmark topped Gallup&apos;s Global Wellbeing Index, and Copenhagen is the jewel in its crown. One of the reasons behind its success is that it has achieved something very few cities of more than a million inhabitants have: it has replaced a driving culture with a cycling and walking culture. According to a study by the University of the West of England, pedestrian activity accounts for 80% of all traffic in Copenhagen city centre. Car use for commuting in Copenhagen fell from 42% in 1996 to only 26% in 2004; in contrast, commuting by bicycle accounts for 36% of all work trips. This means that you can take a lungful of air in central Copenhagen without fear: per capita carbon emissions from transport have declined by 9% between 1991 and 2011. 4. Stockholm  Sweden came fourth in Gallup&apos;s Global Wellbeing Index, and Stockholm joint sixth in Mercer&apos;s 2011 global city rankings for personal safety. An increasingly wealthy city, its Gross Value Added per capita has grown by 41% from 1993 to 2010. It is also green \u2013 the world&apos;s first national urban park is Stockholm&apos;s Royal National City Park, which remains an urban lung stretching for six miles within the city. Per capita GGE decreased by a whopping 31% from 1993 to 2010. And Stockholm also scores highly for mental stimulus, with one of the highest concentrations of museums in the world \u2013 there are more than 100. 5. Sydney  Large Asian cities such as Osaka and Singapore could feel rightly aggrieved for not appearing on this list, while this Australian metropolis does \u2013 Sydney&apos;s sprawling suburbs and car-based culture hardly seem the epitome of the healthy city. However Sydney tops the LSE&apos;s Metropolitan Wellbeing index for its quality of education \u2013 a major wellbeing factor \u2013 whilst also coming in the top 10 for health and the top 20 for wealth. It is also the embodiment of a healthy outdoor culture that many cities want to be (see San Francisco and New York) but few actually manage, with a high level of sports clubs and facilities (many the legacy of the Sydney Olympics), parks and beaches, not to mention good weather virtually all year round. Far from resting on its sandy laurels, Sydney is still working at it \u2013 20,000 new street trees are to be planted to increase urban canopy by 50% by 2030, an investment in bicycle infrastructure has seen bike trips triple in peak periods and a retro-fitting programme of City buildings has seen GGE reduce by 18%, with a plan to hit 70% over the next 20 years.

The European champions are due to travel on Saturday evening after their Premier League game at Sunderland, but are understood to be waiting for confirmation from football&apos;s governing body after a strong earthquake centred off the coast of north-eastern Japan shook buildings as far away as Tokyo on Friday and triggered a one-metre tsunami in an area devastated by last year&apos;s Fukushima disaster. The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.3, the US Geological Survey said, adding that there was no risk of a widespread tsunami. There were no immediate reports of death or injury. Chelsea are due to face the Mexican side Monterrey or the South Korean team Ulsan Hyundai in a semi-final in Yokohama on Thursday 13 December, with the final to take place at the same venue three days later. The tournament opened on Thursday with the Japanese side Sanfrecce Hiroshima defeating New Zealand&apos;s Auckland City 1-0 in the first quarter-final. In March 2011 an earthquake and following tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people and triggered the world&apos;s worst nuclear crisis in 25 years when the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was destroyed, leaking radiation into the sea and air. The interim Chelsea manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, has confirmed that the club captain, John Terry, has not recovered from his knee injury in time to join the squad for the Club World Cup. Terry has been advised against travelling to Japan for the tournament as he continues his recovery from the ligament damage sustained against Liverpool last month. &quot;We&apos;ve been talking with the doctor. The inflammation during the flight will not be the best thing for him so he will not travel,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;He wanted to go and to help, but it&apos;s better that he stays here. We don&apos;t know when he will play. We have to wait and see how he reacts.&quot; Ben\u00edtez also confirmed that Frank Lampard is expected to play some part in Saturday&apos;s game at Sunderland and will fly to Japan after recovering from his calf problem. However, Daniel Sturridge&apos;s hamstring injury will prevent him from participating at the Stadium of Light, but the Club World Cup is a realistic target. &quot;Sturridge has been training but it&apos;s too early for him so he will not go to Sunderland. We will fly to Japan from Sunderland and we&apos;ll see if he can do something in Japan,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;Frank Lampard has been training and will be in the squad for Sunderland and if everything is fine he will fly to Japan too. At least one important player is back because we need character, experience and numbers. Frank is a very experienced player so this is quite positive. &quot;At the moment we have a good team but we needed players with more experience. He can have an impact. He scores goals and understands the game. I&apos;m disappointed for the other two, but at least with Frank we have one more body.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["Or Tokyo Sexwale, South Africa&apos;s minister of human settlements and boss of South Africa&apos;s The Apprentice?"], "tags": ["The Apprentice", "Alan Sugar", "Donald Trump", "Wind power", "Scotland", "Television", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-07T13:25:36Z", "title": "Donald Trump and Alan Sugar's Twitter fight \u2013 blow-by-blow", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/dec/07/donald-trump-alan-sugar-twitter-fight", "article": "Step aside, Cheryl Cole and Cher Lloyd.

In the red corner, representing New York, the silliest faction of American Republicans and haircuts that look like monkey bottoms: Donald Trump. In the blue corner, representing corrugated iron industrial parks, pronouncing the word &quot;bloody&quot; as if it has the letter A in it and a million Amstrad Em@iler jokes: Lord Alan Sugar. The pair seem to have been circling each other for months now, both in terms of letting the world know they don&apos;t watch the other&apos;s version of The Apprentice and starting witless online squabbles with anyone they can think of, but yesterday Trump and Sugar finally charged at each other headfirst, and it was spectacular to witness.    How can George Osborne reduce UK debt while spending billions to subsidize Scotland\u2019s garbage wind turbines that are destroying the country?&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2012    First, Trump used Twitter to criticise the UK government&apos;s fondness for wind turbines \u2013 possibly because they might spoil the views from his country-crushing megacorp of a golf course \u2013 to which Sugar replied &quot;The Scottish don&apos;t want you!&quot; Sadly for posterity, Sugar has since deleted his contributions to the row from his Twitter feed.    .@lord_sugarIf you think ugly windmills are good for Scotland you are an even worse businessman than I thought...&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2012    It escalated from there. Trump shot back with: &quot;If you think ugly windmills are good for Scotland you are an even worse businessman than I thought and, in my opinion, should not be doing The Apprentice.&quot; Never a man to take the directionless frothing of an egotist lying down, Sugar quickly hammered out an oblivious missive of his own: &quot;well you have NO SAY in that. The British like me not you. the ugly windmills will bring more revenue and green power to Scotland than your golf project.&quot;    Sugar: @lord_sugar\u2014unlike you, I own The Apprentice. You were never successful enough...&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2012    On and on it went. Trump: &quot;Sugar \u2013 unlike you, I own The Apprentice. You were never successful enough to do The Apprentice but I approved you anyway. Without my show you&apos;d be nothing!&quot; Sugar: &quot;You approved me! What a load of rubbish dream on You don&apos;t own apprentice Mark Burnett does. Shut up and argue with Obama.&quot; Trump: &quot;Keep working hard so I make plenty of $ with your show. You have little persona, but The Apprentice concept is great and lucky for you!&quot; Sugar: &quot;You have had a charisma bypass.&quot;     ... and many others. Drop to your knees, Sugar, and say thank you, Mr. Trump.&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2012    Trump replied: &quot;Drop to your knees, Sugar, and say thank you, Mr. Trump.&quot;    Don't wish to interfere obviously @realdonaldtrump - but it may be time to fire @lord_sugar from YOUR show for his impertinence?&mdash; Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) December 6, 2012    At this point, bang on cue, Piers Morgan \u2013 a man who has flown planes with Alan Sugar, won Trump&apos;s Celebrity Apprentice and will never knowingly let anything high-profile pass without wedging his gelatinous face right in the middle of it \u2013 barged in to suggest that Trump should fire Sugar. And this is where Alan Sugar lost it, ranting: &quot;You are full of sh.. Trump you have no power over the UK Apprentice, just like the Scottish people.&quot; Whether he meant that a) Donald Trump has no power over Scottish people, b) Donald Trump has no power over the UK Apprentice or c) that Scottish people have no power over the UK Apprentice, will for ever be lost to the ages. Who knew that there was so much inter-Apprentice contention? In retrospect, it&apos;s just a shame that other global Apprentice hosts didn&apos;t join in with the mudslinging. What a joy it would have been to see Vladimir Potanin from the Russian show leap into the middle and throw down? Or Tokyo Sexwale, South Africa&apos;s minister of human settlements and boss of South Africa&apos;s The Apprentice? Or Inger Ellen Nicolaisen, the hairdressing magnate formerly in charge of the Norwegian version? That said, she&apos;s a hairdressing magnate. She couldn&apos;t have possibly sided with Trump. It would go against everything she&apos;s ever stood for. Luckily, for all of us, the spat has cooled in the past few hours. All that&apos;s left are the memories, and a fascinating glimpse into the management styles of the two men. Trump, it seems, rules with a mixture of grandiose claims and a kind of General Zod-style imperiousness. Meanwhile, Sugar attacks life with a reckless disregard for grammar and basic punctuation. Both, however, are united in their love of epic, all-powerful, world-ignoring delusion. It&apos;s just a shame they can&apos;t put their differences aside and learn to love each other.

It was, however, a chilling reminder of the 9.0 quake that struck the area in March 2011, triggering a tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people and a triple meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Initially, the appearance on TV screens of a tsunami warning, and repeated announcements to remember last year&apos;s tragedy and flee the coast, prompted fears of a second disaster in less than two years in the worst-affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. Less than an hour later, a tsunami washed ashore in Ishinomaki, one of the hardest-hit towns in last year&apos;s tragedy, where the rebuilding process has barely begun. Mercifully, this time the wave was just a metre high. Two hours after the quake struck 150 miles offshore at 5:18pm local time, the meteorological agency cancelled its tsunami warning. Narita airport closed briefly for safety checks and phone lines were temporarily jammed by the large volume of calls. Several, much smaller, tsunamis lashed other parts of the coast, including Soma city, which lies just outside the 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone imposed around the Fukushima plant.     Map showing where the earthquake struck    On Friday, as on 11 March 2011, the earthquake appeared to have cause minimal damage \u2013 testimony to the unrivalled ability of specially designed Japanese buildings to withstand violent seismic activity that could potentially kill thousands in many other countries. Buildings swayed for several minutes as far away as Tokyo; nearer the epicentre, where coastal towns and villages are largely deserted swaths of flattened land, people fled to higher ground. For all the relief that catastrophe had been diverted, Friday&apos;s earthquake would have added to the anxieties of the 325,000 people in the region still living in temporary accommodation. &quot;I was in the centre of the city the very moment the earthquake struck,&quot; Chikako Iwai, a resident of Ishinomaki, told Reuters. &quot;I immediately jumped into the car and started running towards the mountains. I&apos;m still hiding inside the car. I have the radio on and they say the cars are still stuck in the traffic. I&apos;m planning to stay here for the next couple of hours.&quot; Thoughts quickly turned to the Fukushima plant, declared stable by authorities a year ago but where workers have yet to begin the dangerous task of removing molten fuel from damaged reactors and the long, costly process of decommissioning. The plant&apos;s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said workers had been ordered to shelter inside buildings around the plant, but added that there was no sign of damage or radiation leaks. Police reported that five people had been injured, including a 75-year-old woman who fell while heading for higher ground. Thanks to Japan&apos;s warning system, people in the area had up to six minutes to take precautions between the first estimate of the quake&apos;s intensity and the moment it struck. The earthquake measured a lower five in Miyagi prefecture on Japan&apos;s scale of one to seven, which measures the amount of shaking a quake causes rather than its intensity. Earthquakes of that strength can damage older buildings and roads, which do not have the strict quake-resistant features introduced after more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in Kobe, in January 1995."}, {"sentences": ["Chelsea are awaiting advice from Fifa before travelling to Tokyo for the Club World Cup, following an earthquake off the coast of Japan."], "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-07T16:07:12Z", "title": "The Fiver | Geeky number-crunching | Barry Glendenning", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/07/the-fiver-manchester-derby", "article": "STATS ALL, FOLKS The Fiver can&apos;t get enough of the media propagated myth that Sir Alex Ferguson is some sort of psychological schemer and master-manipulator whose every public utterance is some sort of carefully calculated and devious attempt to get inside the heads of referees or opposing managers and mess with their minds. At his Friday briefing ahead of Sunday&apos;s Manchester derby, Lord Ferg stood behind his pulpit and began sermonising about the number of penalties Manchester City get, stating that &quot;if we got that number there&apos;d be an inquiry in the House of Commons; there&apos;d be a protest.&quot; It was at this point that some of the assembled reporters proceeded to big up Fergie&apos;s observation as an attempt to increase the pressure on referee Martin Atkinson, a man they clearly see as some sort of quivering, easily malleable mental weakling who, in the event of a Rio Ferdinand forearm smash on Sergio Ag\u00fcero in the Manchester City penalty area on Sunday afternoon, will now be too scared to blow his whistle. Meanwhile the Fiver put in a call to its old mucker, the Right Honourable Mr Speaker, presiding officer of the House of Commons, telling him to clear a space in his diary. You see, according to the Fiver&apos;s unpopular stat-obsessed eggheaded bespectacled anorak-wearing non-showering nerdy cousin Opta Fiver, Lord Ferg is indeed correct in his assertion that Manchester City have been awarded 21 penalties since the beginning of last season. Sadly \u2013 or conveniently, depending on your point of view \u2013 it seems to have escaped the Manchester United manager&apos;s attention that his own team have been awarded an identical number of spot-kicks in the exact same period of time. All of which geeky number-crunching suggests that the chances of either side getting a penalty in this weekend&apos;s derby are exactly equal \u2026 although with gravity-deploring winger Ashley Young likely to be selected, they almost certainly swing hugely in United&apos;s favour. With Lord Ferg&apos;s side nursing a three-point lead over City and a hectic Christmas and New Year schedule ahoy for both teams, defeat for either side on Sunday will be far from catastrophic, a state of affairs that will no doubt be reflected in the hundreds of measured, calm, erudite and in no way mouth-foaming comments that will appear under the match report that appears on Big Website at approximately 3.30pm on Sunday afternoon.

Along with the acquisition came Brian McClendon, aka &quot;Bam&quot;, a tall and serious Kansan who in a previous incarnation had supplied high-end graphics software that Hollywood used in films including Jurassic Park and Terminator 2. It turned out to be a very smart move. Today McClendon is Google&apos;s Mr Maps \u2013 presiding over one of the fastest-growing areas in the search giant&apos;s business, one that has recently left arch-rival Apple red-faced and threatens to make Google the most powerful company in mapping the world has ever seen. Google is throwing its considerable resources into building arguably the most comprehensive map ever made. It&apos;s all part of the company&apos;s self-avowed mission is to organize all the world&apos;s information, says McClendon.  &quot;You need to have the basic structure of the world so you can place the relevant information on top of it. If you don&apos;t have an accurate map, everything else is inaccurate,&quot; he says. It&apos;s a message that will make Apple cringe. Apple triggered howls of outrage when it pulled Google Maps off the latest iteration of its iPhone software for its own bug-riddled and often wildly inaccurate map system. &quot;We screwed up,&quot; Apple boss Tim Cook said earlier this week.     Google Maps chief Brian McClendon Photograph: Google    McClendon, pictured, won&apos;t comment on when and if Apple will put Google&apos;s application back on the iPhone. Talks are ongoing and he&apos;s at pains to point out what a &quot;great&quot; product the iPhone is. But when \u2013 or if \u2013 Apple caves, it will be a huge climbdown. In the meantime, what McClendon really cares about is building a better map. This not the first time Google has made a landgrab in the real world, as the publishing industry will attest. Unhappy that online search was missing all the good stuff inside old books, Google \u2013 controversially \u2013 set about scanning the treasures of Oxford&apos;s Bodleian library and some of the world&apos;s other most respected collections.  Its ambitions in maps may be bigger, more far reaching and perhaps more controversial still. For a company developing driverless cars and glasses that are wearable computers, maps are a serious business. There&apos;s no doubting the scale of McClendon&apos;s vision. His license plate reads: ITLLHPN. Until the 1980s, maps were still largely a pen and ink affair. Then mainframe computers allowed the development of geographic information system software (GIS), which was able to display and organise geographic information in new ways. By 2005, when Google launched Google Maps, computing power allowed GIS to go mainstream. Maps were about to change the way we find a bar, a parcel or even a story. Washington DC&apos;s homicidewatch.org, for example, uses Google Maps to track and follow deaths across the city. Now the rise of mobile devices has pushed mapping into everyone&apos;s hands and to the front line in the battle of the tech giants. It&apos;s easy to see why Google is so keen on maps. Some 20% of Google&apos;s queries are now &quot;location specific&quot;. The company doesn&apos;t split the number out but on mobile the percentage is &quot;even higher&quot;, says McClendon, who believes maps are set to unfold themselves ever further into our lives. Google&apos;s approach to making better maps is about layers. Starting with an aerial view, in 2007 Google added Street View, an on-the-ground photographic map snapped from its own fleet of specially designed cars that now covers 5 million of the 27.9 million miles of roads on Google Maps.      Penguins in Antarctica. Photograph: Google.    Google isn&apos;t stopping there. The company has put cameras on bikes to cover harder-to-reach trails, and you can tour the Great Barrier Reef thanks to diving mappers. Luc Vincent, the Google engineer known as &quot;Mr Street View&quot;, carried a 40lb pack of snapping cameras down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and then back up along another trail as fellow hikers excitedly shouted &quot;Google, Google&quot; at the man with the space-age backpack. McClendon, pictured, has also played his part. He took his camera to Antarctica, taking 500 or more photos of a penguin-filled island to add to Google Maps. &quot;The penguins were pretty oblivious. They just don&apos;t care about people,&quot; he says. Now the company has projects called Ground Truth, which corrects errors online, and Map Maker, a service that lets people make their own maps. In the western world the product has been used to add a missing road or correct a one-way street that is pointing the wrong way, and to generally improve what&apos;s already there. In Africa, Asia and other less well covered areas of the world, Google is \u2013 literally \u2013 helping people put themselves on the map. In 2008, it could take six to 18 months for Google to update a map. The company would have to go back to the firm that provided its map information and get them to check the error, correct it and send it back. &quot;At that point we decided we wanted to bring that information in house,&quot; says McClendon. Google now updates its maps hundreds of times a day. Anyone can correct errors with roads signs or add missing roads and other details; Google double checks and relies on other users to spot mistakes. Thousands of people use Google&apos;s Map Maker daily to recreate their world online, says Michael Weiss-Malik, engineering director at Google Maps. &quot;We have some Pakistanis living in the UK who have basically built the whole map,&quot; he says. Using aerial shots and local information, people have created the most detailed, and certainly most up-to-date, maps of cities like Karachi that have probably ever existed. Regions of Africa and Asia have been added by map-mad volunteers. &apos;People want to be found&apos;            Why do they do it? Manik Gupta, who led the Map Maker project in India before moving to Google HQ, says its a very human thing to want to put yourself on the map: &quot;People want to be found. They want you to know where they live, where they come from.&quot; It&apos;s a labour-intensive process for Google as well as its army of unpaid helpers. It&apos;s also the fastest-updating map in history. Google even maintains a live stream, on which you can watch edits happening in real time. &quot;The fact is the real world is changing. Chasing the real world is our measure. It&apos;s not how we compare to our competitors, it&apos;s how we compare to the real world,&quot; says McClendon. It&apos;s not just the great outdoors that Google wants to map. The company is increasingly interested in mapping indoors. McClendon was recently in Tokyo&apos;s Shinjuku station, the world&apos;s busiest transport hub with 35 platforms, more than 200 exits and 3.64 million people per day. Google has it mapped. Once he has his map, McClendon says the real challenge is what not to show. The iconic London Underground map, a design classic that is easy to read if not geographically accurate, is an example of the old-world idea of a map.  &quot;They reduced it down to the most readable form that still contains all the information. They&apos;ve done that so everybody can read that. But imagine if you saw the London underground system only as you use it,&quot; he says. A personal map would let you know which lines are busy and would change to reflect your working pattern, the time of day or what you do at the weekend. &quot;The ability to remove information allows you space to provide another level of more personalized information,&quot; says McClendon. &quot;A map that tries to answer every question for every person is effectively unreadable.&quot; Google&apos;s domination of the map world has some people worried. The company has run into difficulties over privacy, not least in Germany where Street View was abandoned after clashes with the authorities. Google was fined by US authorities after it was found that its Street View cars were collecting private information from people&apos;s wireless networks. Steven Romalewski, director of the mapping service at the Center for Urban Research at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York, says Google has been instrumental in opening up the new era of mapping, but adds that he worries that there isn&apos;t enough competition. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to see one entity controlling the base map,&quot; he says. McClendon says: &quot;There will always be multiple providers. I don&apos;t see us effectively owning the map. We are making a version of the world, as accurate as we can make it.&quot;  World domination has never sounded so benign."}, {"sentences": ["Chelsea will travel to Japan despite the earthquake which struck off the east coast of Japan on Friday with the Premier League club reassured by Fifa that, while the tremors were\u00a0felt in Tokyo, where buildings swayed for several minutes, there is no risk to the tournament which began on Thursday."], "tags": ["Chelsea", "Frank Lampard", "Rafael Ben\u00edtez", "John Terry", "Club World Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-07T23:01:13Z", "title": "Frank Lampard's return boosts Chelsea challenge ahead of Club World Cup", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/07/frank-lampard-chelsea-club-world-cup", "article": "Frank Lampard will be among Chelsea&apos;s substitutes at Sunderland on Saturdayafter an absence of almost seven weeks as Rafael Ben\u00edtez attempts to ensure his side do not fall further behind in the Premier League title race before departing for the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan. The veteran England midfielder damaged his calf in the Champions League defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine back in October and has watched as the holders departed that competition at the group stage shedding the manager, Roberto Di Matteo, en route while he underwent his rehabilitation. Chelsea travel to Wearside without a win in seven league games, their worst sequence since 1995, and 10 points behind Manchester United in the table. Indeed, should they succumb at the Stadium of Light, they could potentially be 19 points adrift of the leaders by the time they next compete in the Premier League. The interim first-team manager will concentrate on Chelsea achieving a first league win since 20 October, with Lampard&apos;s return offering some reassurance, even if the 34-year-old is short of match fitness and will only start on the bench. &quot;It is positive that he is back because we need character, we need numbers, and Frank is an experienced player,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;We&apos;ve got a good team and a strong squad, but we needed players with more experience, and he could make a difference. He adds something, finding players between the lines, getting into the box and scoring goals. He cannot be the box-to-box player he was 10 years ago, but he&apos;ll be important for us when we&apos;re in possession with the players we have up front, people with good movement and ability. You need someone to link with them, and he can play that role. &quot;When I first came here I had a conversation with Frank and [John] Terry, who were both injured, in one of the changing rooms before training once the rest of the squad had gone out to do their warm-up. We spoke about the rivalry between Chelsea and Liverpool when I was there, about how we work and the mentality needed. I have a winning mentality. They had, back then, and still have a winning mentality. They are both important players with big characters.&quot; Terry&apos;s absence will be prolonged until after the team returns from Japan, with the centre-half having suffered minor inflammation around the knee ligaments damaged during the draw with Liverpool last month. He will not travel to the Club World Cup but will instead continue his own rehabilitation at Cobham in the hope he might play some part in the Capital One Cup quarter-final at Leeds on 19 December. Daniel Sturridge, who has been suffering from a hamstring complaint, will also be absent at Sunderland but may join the team in Yokohama next week if necessary. Chelsea will travel to Japan despite the earthquake which struck off the east coast of Japan on Friday with the Premier League club reassured by Fifa that, while the tremors were\u00a0felt in Tokyo, where buildings swayed for several minutes, there is no risk to the tournament which began on Thursday. The London club&apos;s eight-day stay \u2013 they fly from Newcastle immediately after the game against Sunderland, with the final and third-place play-off scheduled for 16 December \u2013 will, however, disrupt their domestic campaign with Manchester United set to have played two more games\u00a0before\u00a0Chelsea next kick off in the league, against Aston Villa on 23 December. &quot;I&apos;m not worried about the distance [from the top],&quot; added Ben\u00edtez. &quot;It&apos;s important we win at Sunderland so we are closer, but all we can do is think about one game at a time. We have to improve the team and be mentally strong enough to compete in the second part of the league. At Valencia, we were eight points behind in January and won the league. If we have to do the same here, we will do it. Obviously we&apos;ll have our chances if we start winning games.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["&quot;Thanks to my Japanese mother I am also a member of the Japan national men&apos;s team (it&apos;s there on Cricinfo), but before coming to Tokyo for work I played in Sheffield for a number of years with Joe Root at Sheffield Collegiate CC, batting together on numerous occasions."], "tags": ["England in India 2012-13", "India cricket team", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-08T10:48:00Z", "title": "India v England \u2013 live! | Rob Smyth and Andy Bull", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/dec/08/india-england-live-cricket-obo", "article": " Preamble Morning. The calendar says December 2012 but this could easily be the winter of 2010-11. Alastair Cook is scoring runs in industrial quantities and England, attempting to win a series away to their opponents for the first time since the mid-80s, are dominating Test matches with a simple game plan: bowl the hosts out for a below-par total, rack up a big one themselves and then get to work again with the turning, reverse-swinging ball. As cunning plans go, it&apos;s a level or two above Baldrick. England will resume on 509 for six, a lead of 193, with the wonderful Matt Prior on 40 and Graeme Swann on 21. Victory is far from certain \u2013 nobody really knows how difficult batting will be with in the third innings \u2013 but England are in a seriously good position. Their performance thus far has been immaculate.  Somewhere in the world, it&apos;s 3.21am on Saturday morning. Good Friday night? Give me some vicarious excitement here. Because of this cricket I&apos;ve only had one Friday night in a month.  WICKET! England 510-7 (Swann c Sehwag b Ojha 21) That didn&apos;t take long. Graeme Swann has gone to the second ball of the day, caught at slip as he attempted to drive a nice, flighted delivery from Pragyan Ojha that turned enough to take the edge.  164th over: England 510-7 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Prior 41, Finn 0) Steven Finn has been promoted ahead of Jimmy Anderson. He can hang about, as he showed against Pakistan in 2010 when he helped Prior to a century, but he can also give it some humpty. For now he settles for careful defence. &quot;Thought I&apos;d get in nice and early so you at least had one e-mail to read to start your day,&quot; says Jonny Hodgetts. &quot;I&apos;ve never been one to put sportsmen up on a pedestal and have had few sporting heroes but one thing they&apos;ve had in common (Steven Redgrave, the &apos;88 GB hockey team) is that they&apos;re older than me. Now, with the rise of Cook, I fear I may have to regress 25 years and stick a poster up on my wall. I hope Jacques Kallis plays forever....&quot;  WICKET! England 510-8 (Prior c Dhoni b Zaheer 41) Now Prior has gone! This is a great start for India, which keeps their slim chance of victory alive. Prior tried to glide a ball from Zaheer that was a bit too close even for that stroke, and MS Dhoni took a good tumbling catch. That&apos;s his 200th catch in Tests. England lead by 194.  165th over: England 515-8 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Finn 4, Anderson 1) &quot;You want Friday night excitement, Bob?&quot; chirps Mac Millings. &quot;You&apos;ve come to the right place. Mrs. Millings finished her exams today, so she went out for drinks with her friends. I stayed at home with the kids and parented, by which I mean we watched the first half or so of the original Karate Kid. The two older kids fell asleep, so the baby and I watched the first episode of season 4 of Peep Show. Apparently it turns rubbish in about two episodes&apos; time, so I&apos;ve got that to look forward to. Wife came home and went straight to bed. Baby&apos;s still awake. Your ones of readers have any advice on that count? Also, do you wish you&apos;d never asked?&quot; On the contrary, I want to know more. I need to know more. What colour underpants are you wearing? Assuming you&apos;re wearing some, and if you&apos;re not please don&apos;t reply to this and please don&apos;t ever contact me again.  166th over: England 516-8 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Finn 4, Anderson 2) &quot;Doesn&apos;t Finn look like an elongated Michael Vaughan under that lid?&quot; says Harry Tuttle. &quot;It&apos;s the cheekbones.&quot; Good spot.  167th over: England 523-8 (in reply to India&apos;s 316; Finn 4, Anderson 9) These two might as well give it some humpty. When Zaheer offers a touch of width, Anderson larrups a swaggering cover drive for four. &quot;What a shot!&quot; says Bumble. &quot;The Burnley Lara!&quot; That was a beautiful stroke, and he times the next ball through midwicket for three more. &quot;Morning Rob, been lovely following the third test on OBO from Shanghai when wi-fi allows,&quot; says Matthew Valentine. &quot;I&apos;m wondering if now&apos;s the time to crawl the archive blogs from the last home Pakistan series when the Cookie monster was Asif and Amir&apos;s bunny for a public naming and shaking of all those contributors who wanted him dropped.&quot; I think, in fairness, almost all of those who wanted him dropped were advocating a little break to freshen up him up mentally and technically rather than a long-term banishment. And he did struggle terribly in that series. Even now he sometimes struggles against the moving ball, which is a strange thing to say for such an amazing batsman. The lovely thing about Cook is that, whatever the problem, he works it out in the end.  WICKET! England 523-9 (Anderson c Sehwag b Ashwin 9) R Ashwin strikes with his second ball of the day. Flight, turn, bounce and a simple edge from Anderson to slip. That turned a fair way.  WICKET! England 523 all out (Panesar LBW b Ashwin 0) Monty goes first ball, LBW to Ashwin. I&apos;m not sure about this decision but well, who cares? I thought it was going down leg; it wasn&apos;t, but there was a big inside edge and that&apos;s a poor decision from the otherwise excellent Kumar Dharmasena. Oh well, nobody died. England&apos;s lead is 207.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: India 6-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 0) Jimmy Anderson&apos;s first ball of the innings swings in nicely to Gautam Gambhir, who times it superbly through square leg for four. Anderson&apos;s hands went straight to his head, because if Gambhir missed that he was plumb. The next ball goes straight on past the outside edge. England would put their dignity on eBay for a couple of new-ball wickets. A fine first over from Anderson. &quot;That photo is seriously depressing,&quot; says Robert Ellson. &quot;It&apos;s like discovering that Paul McCartney was 27 when the Beatles broke up. I&apos;m 37 and have 0,000 Test runs to my name and 0 classic songs. So thanks for that.&quot;  2nd over: India 10-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 4) So, Sehwag. He&apos;s only scored one second-innings century in his Test career; this would be a very decent time to double that. If he&apos;s still there at the close, an Indian win will be a possibility. He gets going with a boundary fourth ball, opening the face to steer Finn through the vacant fourth-slip area. A good over from Finn nonetheless; Anderson and Finn have hit their straps straight away, and the last delivery bounces sharply past Sehwag&apos;s nose. &quot;Too cold to go downstairs to turn on the cricket so got to love Sky Go on the mobile accompanied by OBO,&quot; says Dave Forrest. &quot;Just been clearing out our spare room and came across Is It Cowardly For Rain (which of course was retained). Marvellous reading seven years on and a perfect complement to getting two sets of Ashes tickets this week. Great that Mitchell J is bowling himself back into the team \u2013 the Barmy Army must be salivating at two shite Aussie left armers called Mitchell to abuse!&quot; When Mitchell Starc takes 72 wickets across ten Ashes Tests next year, Dave Forrest&apos;s address will be available on request.  3rd over: India 10-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 4) England are bowling noticeably straight in this innings, which you&apos;d expect on a pitch like this, especially with the uneven bounce. Gambhir plays out a maiden from Anderson, who has started excellently. &quot;Forget Alastair &apos;Braceface&apos; Cook,&quot; says Danielle Tolson. &quot;On the subject of feeling old: this \u2013 a &apos;Freaks and Geeks&apos; reunion, with photos.Also, on a personal and seasonal note, still being able to name every member of Band Aid when I see the video for &apos;Do They Know It&apos;s Christmas?&apos;&quot; We&apos;re all for diversity at the Guardian, so if anyone under the age of 140 is reading, please do send us an email!  4th over: India 11-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 5) Sehwag, fishing outside off, is beaten by a good one from Finn. England are getting a fraction of movement, no more, but their line and length have been really good thus far. &quot;Friday night was good,&quot; says Chris Langmead. &quot;Nothing like drinking too much fizzy disco juice with a load of otherwise highly respectable professors and scientists. My 2am finish was tame compared to my colleagues who were still up at 6am. However, we are currently all sat in a lecture theatre on Melbourne trying desperately to concentrate on important scientific matters \u2013 though one of us is on OBO, obviously...&quot;  5th over: India 12-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 6) Gambhir plays an absent-minded cut at Anderson and is beaten. The pressure is building, with just two runs from the last three overs. In other news, some essential reading here: a superb interview with former Test cricketer Ricky Ponting.  &quot;Cook looks like he was a pretty punchable kid,&quot; goodwills Mac Millings. &quot;Is that a terrible thing to say? I am a teacher.&quot;  6th over: India 13-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 7) This is excellent cricket from both teams. England&apos;s new-ball bowlers have been right on their game from the start; India&apos;s openers have respected the quality of the bowling and been very solid in defence. &quot;Friday night involved a trip to Asda for Rice Crispies and toilet roll and now up and hoping TMS can soothe the baby back to sleep,&quot; says Jon Fortune. &quot;Asking what OBOers get up to on a Friday night? You&apos;ve opened a dull can of worms there.&quot; Yes, I may have ever so slightly misjudged the audience.  7th over: India 21-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 6, Sehwag 15) England have missed a great chance to dismiss Sehwag. He edged an excellent delivery from Anderson between Swann and Cook at second and first slip. Neither got there and it hurried away for four. That was Swann&apos;s catch, but he was really slow to get down to his left. Cook could also have taken it, although his was the trickier chance. The next ball is a poor one from the understandably aggrieved Anderson, a leg-stump half-volley, and Sehwag takes care of business with a roll of the wrists. &quot;Friday night was good, party at the British High Commission in Kolkata with local live band the Supersonics,&quot; says Paul Walsh. &quot;Up early for rugby practice on the maidan, rushed home for tickets to enjoy a day with the Barmy Army at Eden Gardens ... but ... am now sitting on the stairs of my flat as I have managed to lock myself out, tickets inside ... disaster!&quot; Crikey, that&apos;s a shocker. How long before you can get into the flat?  8th over: India 27-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 11, Sehwag 16) Monty comes on for the eighth over of the innings. It&apos;ll be interesting to see his pace in this innings, as it seems the important thing for spinners on this pitch is to bowl the ball pretty slowly. Monty seems to have sussed that out, with a few deliveries in the low 50s. An otherwise decent over is ruined by a last-ball full toss that Gambhir eases through extra cover for four.  9th over: India 30-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 11, Sehwag 19) Anderson&apos;s got a cob on, not unreasonably, and digs in a good short ball that Sehwag gloves round the corner. So, whABUDHABIo fancies chasing 150 on a fifABUDHABIABUDHABIth-day pitcIBAHDUBAh?  10th over: India 32-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 12, Sehwag 20) England were never going to go through India like a dose of salts as they did at Mumbai, so this becomes a game of patience now that Gambhir and Sehwag have got in. I don&apos;t think England&apos;s bowlers have done much wrong so far; it&apos;s been accomplished cricket from both sides. Who needs a drink? The players, that&apos;s who. &quot;Good morning from Guangzhou,&quot; says Tom Carver. &quot;Stinking cold: tick; hangover from Christmas party: tick; cricket on TV: tick; cricket on the radio: tick; cricket on OBO: tick. Marvellous. As an aside, I was trying to find the right word to describe Cook&apos;s batting earlier on and my wife hit the nail on the head when she said he bats like a German. Imagine Schumacher batting and you have our Cookie. Not flash. Not fancy. Ruthless efficiency.&quot; Yes, that&apos;s a nice description. Although Cook has added some flourishes to his game, not least those lazy straight sixes off the spinners.  11th over: India 32-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 12, Sehwag 20) Graeme Swann replaces Anderson, who bowled better than figures of 5-1-18-0 suggest. He has a slip, short leg and short extra cover for Gambhir, who gets well forward in defence. A maiden.  12th over: India 36-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 13, Sehwag 23) Sehwag has a twinge in his left knee and winces through for a single. With no runners allowed any more, he might be more inclined than ever to just stand and Gordon Greenidge it. Now Gambhir has been dropped! Well, not really dropped. He turned Panesar to leg off the face of the bat, and the ball hit the short leg Ian Bell on the arm before he could react. Bell is a magnificent short leg but he had a reaction time of around 0.00000000000000001 seconds there. &quot;OK,&quot; says Paul Connelly. &quot;I&apos;ll call your bluff. I&apos;m willing to say I fancy chasing 150 on a fifth-day pitch. I&apos;ll also say Adelaide if you want. Adelaide, Adelaide.&quot; REDRUM.  13th over: India 40-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 16, Sehwag 24) &quot;Friday night was good for me too,&quot; says Sam Valentine. &quot;I spent it drinking homebrew bitter in the shadow of Eden Gardens and am now feeling very much the worse for wear at work in Kolkata, hoping that, as the sole Englishman in my office, the mockery I&apos;ve doled out to my sullen Indian colleagues doesn&apos;t come back to bite me\u2026 Meanwhile, two miles away, my wife-to-be who recently met the England team without knowing who any of them were and best man are lording it up pitch-side, respectively dressed as a hungover lady and beefeater. Where&apos;s the justice?&quot;  14th over: India 43-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 18, Sehwag 25) India are milking the spinners pretty comfortably at the moment, and there hasn&apos;t been any significant bounce or turn for the spinners. We haven&apos;t seen their average speeds so I don&apos;t know if that has anything to do with it. &quot;My Friday night in Johannesburg was much like every other,&quot; says Stuart Wilson. &quot;Contrary to what readers might think, this didn&apos;t involve being shot at, mugged and dancing with Zulus. It consisted of drinking terrible beer, watching ancient episodes of QI (there is nothing else on) and going to bed at nine for a hot and uncomfortable night&apos;s sleep. However I have still shimmied out of bed at 5.30 this morning to watch England&apos;s slide to loss and despondency.&quot;  15th over: India 52-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 20, Sehwag 32) Samit Patel has come on to replace Graeme Swann, although it&apos;s probably a solitary over to allow the spinners to change ends. His first ball, as usual, is a full toss that Sehwag smears for four. Get that filth out of my sight. A single to long on brings up an excellent fifty partnership, and there are nine from the over. India aren&apos;t too far from being back in this game. Surely, 11 years later, we&apos;re not going to get another Eden Gardens miracle? &quot;Back on the stairs but at least we&apos;ve now located a key with the cleaner,&quot; says Paul Walsh. &quot;But it&apos;ll take time to get here! Ugh.&quot;  16th over: India 61-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 20, Sehwag 37) Swann does switch ends, and his first ball is slog-swept for four by Sehwag. He tries the same stroke next up; this time the ball keeps low and goes through Prior&apos;s legs for four byes. This is fascinating stuff. Sehwag, who played carefully for an hour, is ticking now. &quot;REDRUM,&quot; says Paul Connolly. &quot;So, now that you&apos;ve brought up &apos;The Shining&apos;, which was so called because of a lyric from the John Lennon song, are you saying Ishant Sharma&apos;s going to get you?&quot;  17th over: India 63-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 21, Sehwag 38) Panesar has switched to the High Court End. He was in dudgeon after that LBW from Kumar Dharmsena earlier, and now he is at Dharmasena&apos;s end. Sehwag, who is now dealing in boundaries and strolled singles, takes the latter to the cover sweeper.  &quot;I&apos;ve spent my Friday night in the university library labouring away on an essay that won&apos;t be finished any time soon with the cricket on,&quot; says Sam Robinson. Bloody students, eh, working diligently in the library on a Friday night.  18th over: India 65-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 22, Sehwag 39) Oof. That&apos;s the first sign of misbehaviour in this innings, with Swann spitting a corking delivery past Gambhir&apos;s outside edge. That bounced viciously.  19th over: India 66-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 22, Sehwag 40) Dear Mr Santa, stop buggering about with that sleigh and bring us a wicket please. Good lad. Love and hugs, the OBO.  20th over: India 76-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 23, Sehwag 49) This is getting pretty ominous for England. Sehwag tonks Swann for consecutive boundaries, the first a cut and the second a mighty slog sweep.  21st over: India 86-0 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 33, Sehwag 49) Panesar will bowl the last over of the session. Gambhir gives him the charge and drives handsomely over wide mid-on for six. That prompts a rush of blood to the head and a heave that is dragged just wide of the diving Compton at short midwicket. He ends the session by swiping Monty back over his head for four more. It&apos;s been a perfect morning for India, who took the last four wickets in no time and then reduced the deficit to 121 with some exhilarating batting. Bit by bit \u2013 or rather biff by biff \u2013 they are dragging themselves back in this game. Brilliant stuff. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  LUNCH  WICKET! India 86-1 (Sehwag b Swann 49) Graeme Swann has struck with the first ball of the session! It&apos;s a huge breakthrough for England to dismiss Virender Sehwag, and it was a beautiful delivery: tossed up and turning through the gate to hit the outside of off stump as Sehwag lunged into a woolly drive. Sehwag actually lost control of the bat, with one hand coming off it. Even so, it was a gorgeous piece of bowling.  22nd over: India 86-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 33, Pujara 4) Pujara inside-edges his second ball in the air but wide of short leg. That would have gone straight to short square leg. A wicket maiden from Swann. &quot;Mr Mukharjee, the groundsman has to be thanked for a real sporting wicket,&quot; says Krishan Patel. &quot;This wicket has something in it for everybody. The batters aren&apos;t clueless while the bowlers have some juice in the wicket as well. Think we need to see some reverse magic from Anderson in the post-lunch session to have any hope.&quot;  24th over: India 96-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) I&apos;ve missed an over from Finn. In other news, Pujara gives Swann the charge and scuffs a drive fractionally wide of the diving Cook at short midwicket. India have clearly decided to go after England&apos;s spinners, and later in the over Pujara drives classily through extra cover for four.  25th over: India 96-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) A maiden from Finn to Gambhir.  26th over: India 96-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) &quot;My name is Alex Patmore and first I&apos;d like to say thank you for yesterday&apos;s three mentions of Japan cricket, but today I was hoping to link the current England side to cricket in the far east,&quot; says the very polite Alex Patmore. &quot;Thanks to my Japanese mother I am also a member of the Japan national men&apos;s team (it&apos;s there on Cricinfo), but before coming to Tokyo for work I played in Sheffield for a number of years with Joe Root at Sheffield Collegiate CC, batting together on numerous occasions. Last year we put on 97 for the fsecond wicket in one game, narrowly missing out on the first (I think) century partnership between Japan and (future) England internationals in Yorkshire League cricket. If he needs any advice on the pressure cooker environment of international cricket (Japan finished third in this years ICC World Cricket League Div8) I think he knows who to call. (I also introduced Joe to sushi for the first time \u2013 he now loves it.)&quot; Hang on, look at the opposition. John Major? Dave Brent?  27th over: India 97-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 35, Pujara 8) There&apos;s an inevitable post-Sehwag lull, with Finn bowling a third consecutive maiden. One ball pops from a length, forcing Gambhir to pull the bottom hand out of the way. There&apos;s also a pretty big shout for LBW against Gambhir, but it was surely sliding down from around the wicket.  28th over: India 98-1 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 36, Pujara 8) Swann is bowling really well here, and skids a delivery straight past Pujara&apos;s outside edge. &quot;I wonder if Paul Walsh has got to the ground yet and ejected the oiks I can see sitting in his seat?&quot; says Simon Brereton. &quot;Morning Rob.&quot; Non-linear emails. What a great idea. Maybe we could have MementOBOs, with entries like this: Even so, it was a gorgeous piece of bowling. It&apos;s a huge breakthrough for England to dismiss Virender Sehwag, and it was a beautiful delivery. Graeme Swann has struck with the first ball of the session! Sehwag actually lost control of the bat, with one hand coming off it. Tossed up and turning through the gate to hit the outside of off stump as Sehwag lunged into a woolly drive.  WICKET! India 98-2 (Pujara run out 8) Climie Fisher were wrong: it&apos;s the dismissal of Sehwag that changes everything. India scored at four an over with him at the crease; they&apos;ve scored at 1.5 per over since his dismissal \u2013 and now the pressure has told with a brilliant run out from Ian Bell! Gambhir tucked Finn to leg and set off. Bell, running round from midwicket, picked up and demolished the stumps with the diving Pujara fractionally short of his ground. That was an outstanding piece of work from Bell.  29th over: India 98-2 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 36, Tendulkar 0) Sachin Tendulkar is the new batsman.  29th over: India 98-2 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Gambhir 36, Tendulkar 0) Is this another wicket? Gambhir pushed at Swann, who went up for the LBW, but as he did so Trott took a low catch at slip and set off in celebration. The umpires went upstairs, presumably to check if it carried, which it did \u2013 but Gambhir did not hit it. The problem is that the third umpire cannot overrule on that; his only remit is to determine whether it carried. Gambhir has been not out. This is really controversial. Surely the third umpire can only rule on whether it carried? It appears the third umpire may have taken the law into his hands. Ultimately it&apos;s the right decision \u2013\u00a0Gambhir didn&apos;t hit it \u2013 although that&apos;s not the point. Unless we&apos;re missing something really obvious, which can&apos;t be ruled out, England have been stitched up there. You can&apos;t have the third umpire making it up as he goes along.  WICKET! India 103-3 (Gambhir c Prior b Finn 40) Not even the third umpire can overrule this one! Finn, who has bowled beautifully, strikes with a wide, swinging delivery that tempts Gambhir into a very loose drive. It flies off the edge to the left of Matt Prior, who moves smartly to take a good two-handed catch. The third umpire does try to save Gambhir, checking for the no-ball, but Finn was fine and Gambhir has gone.  31st over: India 103-3 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Tendulkar 1, Kohli 0) India&apos;s fate is in the hands of superstars present and future, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. &quot;It looks like DRS has been wheeled out to save India,&quot; says Andrew Hurley. &quot;How convenient. This is disgusting, it wouldn&apos;t happen anywhere else.&quot; I do wonder if we&apos;re missing something that would explain the decision. If not, it&apos;s a scandal, and the fact Gambhir is out doesn&apos;t change that. The fact it was morally the correct decision is an irrelevance. It might have been LBW for a start.  WICKET! India 107-4 (Tendulkar c Trott b Swann 5) Never mind the DRS fuss, England are running riot! Tendulkar feels for a non-spinning, lifting delivery from Swann and edges it straight to Trott at slip. England&apos;s response to a poor morning session has been quite magnificent.  32nd over: India 107-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 0, Yuvraj 0) Adam Mountford, the producer of TMS, has tweeted that &quot;Non DRS match regulations allow for umpires to ask if ball was hit even if they are only checking for a low catch.&quot; In which case, all is fine and dandy with the Gambhir reprieve. It doesn&apos;t seem right, though, that you can check if a batsman hit it or not. If that&apos;s the case, why couldn&apos;t they check Panesar&apos;s inside edge earlier? Why can you check for catches but not LBWs? I&apos;m boring myself now. Let&apos;s move on.  33rd over: India 111-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 0) Kohli gets off the mark with a princely square drive for four off Finn \u2013 and now he&apos;s dropped by Bell at short square leg! It&apos;s unlike Bell to miss those, even though it was well timed by Kohli. He reached to his left and couldn&apos;t hang on. Two balls later Kohli survives a huge shout for LBW. Kumar Dharmasena took a long time to decide, at least five seconds. It hit Kohli on the back leg but, as ever with Finn, height was an issue. It was extremely close though, and probably would have trimmed the bails. Finn is steaming in here.  34th over: India 119-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 8) Yuvraj helps a poor delivery from Swann to fine leg for four and then drives beautifully down the ground for another boundary. It&apos;s been a breathless afternoon session, but now it&apos;s time for drinks. &quot;Morning from the snowy Netherlands,&quot; says Anand. &quot;I am a bit surprised that everyone is complaining about the right decision being made in Gambhir&apos;s case after umpire referral. I thought that was what the world wanted and just when N Srini introduced his version of the umpire referral, everyone complains. :)&quot; You were doing so well until that smiley.  35th over: India 119-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 8) Anderson comes on for the excellent Finn (9-4-20-1) and finds a bit of reverse swing to Kohli. A maiden. &quot;Has a batsman ever been dropped for poor running?&quot; says Raakesh Natraj. &quot;Gambhir&apos;s certainly made a case for himself.&quot;  36th over: India 120-4 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Yuvraj 9) &quot;To follow up on Alex Patmore&apos;s introduction to cricket in Japan, may I offer you a welcome to Swedish cricket,&quot; says Dan MacDonald. &quot;I play for the Stockholm team SACS (Swedish T20 champions last year dontcha know). We&apos;re always looking for new players \u2013 sacs-cricket.info \u2013 and you can also catch the Swedish National Team in ICC Div. 2 action next summer, since the tournament will be taking place in England.&quot;  WICKET! India 122-5 (Yuvraj b Anderson 11) There&apos;s the uneven bounce! Yuvraj has been torpedoed by Anderson. He switched around the wicket to the left-hander and struck with his first delivery. It was straight, just short of a length, and it grubbed hideously to clean Yuvraj up. There was nothing he could do. He jabbed his bat down desperately and the ball flew off the bottom edge onto the stumps. India have lost five for 36 in 15.3 memorable overs.  37th over: India 122-5 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Dhoni 0) MS Dhoni plays around a reverse inswinger second ball and survives a big shout for LBW. It was going down.  38th over: India 122-5 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Dhoni 0) Kohli can&apos;t get going at all. After another maiden from Swann, he has four from 18 balls. &quot;This is magnificent cricket from England,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;After the disappointing first session, in the context of the series and history, this must be one of England&apos;s greatest ever couple of hours.&quot; I wouldn&apos;t go that far personally, but it has been an awesome performance, particularly coming on the back of such a difficult morning session.  WICKET! India 122-6 (Dhoni c Cook b Anderson 0) Is this really happening? Call 999-BUMBLE, because England are on fire! Anderson has struck again to dismiss MS Dhoni for a duck. It was a good delivery, just short of a length on a perfect fourth-stump line. Dhoni went fishing and edged it low to Cook at first slip. India have lost six for 36 since lunch! This is spellbinding stuff. Anderson has had a sensational game.  39th over: India 122-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 0) Anderson&apos;s first ball to Ashwin is a beautiful reverse inswinger that Ashwin keeps out and later in the over he inside edges a wide delivery not far wide of off stump. Glorious bowling. &quot;My 10 month old Aidan is asleep on my chest after a v bad night,&quot; says Paddy Blewer. &quot;I&apos;m rationing refreshes on crackberry to every 10 mins or so not to wake him. Every refresh something&apos;s happened. Great session.&quot;  40th over: India 122-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 0) &quot;Slept through the morning session,&quot; says Ken Danbury. &quot;Woke up to Swann taking the first wicket. Good decision I reckon.&quot;  41st over: India 125-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 1) Ashwin inside edges Anderson a fraction wide of leg stump. It&apos;s almost a false shot a ball at the moment. &quot;I press refresh, Dhoni&apos;s gone,&quot; says Paddy Blewer. &quot;I refresh again and there&apos;s more detail, plus my email. The power has gone to my head (and lack of sleep). I will hereby finish the Indian innings early by refreshing at a higher frequency.&quot;  42nd over: India 125-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 4, Ashwin 1) Complete the sentence: &apos;This has been England&apos;s session since ...&apos;. Melbourne 2010? The Oval 2009? Swann beats Ashwin with one that goes straight on. We have around 25 minutes to tea, so this match could easily finish today. &quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; says Hugo Hutchison. &quot;I only went next door to change my son&apos;s nappy and I missed a wicket. Are the players aware that this is Test cricket, not T20?&quot; Hang on, you went next door to change your son&apos;s nappy? What David Lynch suburbia do you live in?  43rd over: India 129-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 8, Ashwin 1) Kohli plays a fine stroke, wristily flicking Anderson through midwicket for four. India trail by 78.  &quot;At Milan airport, with the Alps looking as if they are covered in pink snow in the rosy dawn,&quot; says Martin Kettle. &quot;La Scala last night. An Indian batting collapse this morning. It doesn&apos;t get much better than this.&quot;  44th over: India 129-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 10, Ashwin 1) A maiden from Swann to Ashwin. Some very sad news from Kolkata: our ticketless hero Paul Walsh is stuck in a traffic jam. You&apos;ve missed one of the more famous sessions of English cricket since the turn of the century. I sympathise \u2013 I was lying on a hotel bed in Jamaica while Steve Harmison was taking seven for 12 down the road. Nearly nine years later I&apos;m completely over it, clearly.  45th over: India 130-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 11, Ashwin 1) Panesar comes on for Anderson, who bowled a glorious spell of 5-2-8-2. There&apos;s a stumping referral when Ashwin misses a defensive stroke; he did lift his back foot but it was down again in time.  46th over: India 131-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 12, Ashwin 1) India have only lost consecutive home Tests twice since 1977: against Pakistan and West Indies in 1987, and against South Africa in 2000. They have been pretty feeble here, although England have harassed them into surrender. India are nowhere near as bad as England have made the look.  47th over: India 131-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 13, Ashwin 1) &quot;I think England&apos;s best session,&quot; says Jeremy Bunting, &quot;was when they won the Ashes and ended up in 10, Downing St. the following morning.&quot;  48th over: India 138-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 18, Ashwin 2) I&apos;ve tried headbutting the wall, I&apos;ve tried shock therapy, I&apos;ve tried a Berocca buttie, but whatever I do the scoreboard still says that India are six down and England are closing in on a 2-1 lead. In India. After going 1-0 down. And losing all three tosses. It&apos;s ludicrous.  49th over: India 142-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 18, Ashwin 6) Ashwin, on the drive, edges Monty just wide of slip for four. India trail by 63. Kohli and Ashwin, who will be two of the key players in the new India side that will surely emerge after this series, have played well in the last half hour. It would have been pretty easy, too easy, to give it away. &quot;I was driving down to Southampton from London in the early hours of the morning listening to TMS on Radio 4 198 LW in my grandmas hand-me-down micra which is so old it only has a MW and LW radio,&quot; says Richard Webley. &quot;I was getting a familar &apos;here we go again&apos; feeling as India were effortlessly pilling on the runs for no loss. Now I&apos;m on the ferry to the Isle of Wight and everytime I check the OBO on my smartphone india lose a wicket. Great! Made me think that maybe India prefer being listenened to on LW. It definitely fits with their technophobe DRS stance!&quot;  50th over: India 145-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 19, Ashwin 8) Swann has gone around the wicket, an angle from which he bowls well to right-handers because he can beat either edge of the bat. Not much happens. One over to tea.  51st over: India 145-6 (trailed by 207 on first innings; Kohli 19, Ashwin 8) Steven Finn bowls the last over of a momentous session for England. It began with the wicket of Virender Sehwag from the first ball after lunch, and in 30 overs they took six wickets for 59 runs. It was every bit as beautiful as those bare figures suggest. &quot;Well, what the blazes?&quot; emails Andy Bull. He&apos;ll be here after tea, when England will hopefully complete an unforgettable victory. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow or next week.  TEA  Morning all. Andy Bull here now, so send your emails to me please, on andy.bull@theguardian.com. Rob needs his beauty sleep, and doesn&apos;t want to be pestered when he&apos;s trying to nap.  &quot;Waking up and seeing the score on OBO reminds me of watching England demolish Holland in Euro 96 at my friend&apos;s house,&quot; writes a misty-eyed Mark Hooper. &quot;His flatmate came home and, seeing the score (4-0 at the time), made the only logical conclusion: asked &apos;How have you done that?&apos; and looked behind the telly to see if we&apos;d somehow &apos;hooked up a computer to change the score&apos;.&quot; Yup, it was a dizzying session, and England fans can be excused for feeling a little delirious about what they&apos;re watching. I had a familiar feeling last weekend, actually, following the score from Twickenham on my phone while I was watching Wales play Australia in Cardiff. Anyone else got any cherished Victor Meldrew moments - &apos;I don&apos;t believe it&apos; - from following English sport?  While we&apos;re reveling in events in India, I can&apos;t stop myself taking a pot-shot or two at the &quot;cricketainment&quot; passing for serious sport which is underway in Australia. Gideon Haigh skewered the Big Bash League in The Australian today. I can&apos;t link to the piece because if I do you&apos;ll be asked to pay to read it. But if you google &quot;Gideon Haigh Big Bash Bumf&quot; you&apos;ll soon find it:  In fact, the Sixers have played the Thunder precisely once, and pulverised them, as did almost everyone last season. But if you&apos;re in the mood for a quiet barf, proceed no further than the mission statements of the Thunder and Sixers on their cookie-cutter websites. The Thunder? They&apos;re &quot;the real Sydney and will represent the hard-working families from the heartland of Australia&quot;, playing &quot;with the same spirit as their local community - determined and hard-working with a never give in attitude&quot;. The Sixers? They&apos;re for those who &quot;love the glitz and glamour of the harbour city&quot;. And guess what? &quot;They don&apos;t shy away from aiming to be the team that everyone else wants to be. Their uniforms are bright but that&apos;s the way they want it. They&apos;ll be loud and proud on and off the field.&quot; That someone was paid for writing this crud is as miraculous as anything you will witness in the BBL this summer.   Shane Warne, by the way, ended up bowling two overs for 41 runs. Ouch.  52nd over: India 153-6 (Kohli 19 Ashwin 16) Monty starts after tea, bowling from around the wicket to Ashwin. His first ball is a little too far over towards leg stump, and Ashwin glances it away for four. His last is a little wide of off, and Ashwin chops it away for four the other way, to third man. &quot;Greetings from Jakarta,&quot; says John Leavey. &quot;I spent last night and this morning watching the DVD of Melbourne 2010. I remember it well as I watched it on TV in various bars in Bali, surrounded by Aussies. I particularly enjoyed them laughing at me and jumping up and down at the moment we&apos;d been we&apos;d been bowled out. For a 400+ lead. Muppets. Happy days. Today feels like that - a major achievement I thought I&apos;d never see again. Anyone know of an Indian bar in Jakarta?&quot; What a truly inspired way to spend your spare time, John.  53rd over: India 155-6 (Kohli 20 Ashwin 17) Finn is on at the other end. This is now Kohli&apos;s top score of the series so far. He&apos;s more than capable, of course, of making many more this afternoon. Whether or not anyone can stay with him is another question. Ashwin can bat, and has taken a Test match century off the West Indies in his time, but there&apos;s not much to come after him.  WICKET! Kohli c Prior b Finn (India 155-7) What was I saying? Kohli goes, caught behind off a loose drive. It was good bowling from Finn, a three card trick, with the wide away-swinger following two balls that were slanting straight in at the stumps. This match is all but over now. It&apos;s a question of when, not whether, the match will end in this session. Finn almost has Zaheer caught behind off the very first ball, with a delivery that jagged back and may just have flicked the glove on the way through to Prior. The umpire decided that he couldn&apos;t tell whether it did or didn&apos;t, so Zaheer bats on.  54th over: India 159-7 (Ashwin 21 Zaheer 0) &quot;As a British citizen of Pakistani descent this is the kind of performance that would enable me to pass the Tebbit test with flying colours,&quot; cackles Yasir Gulzar. &quot;The fact that the opposition is India at home is merely the icing on the cake (or should that be pistachios on the kulfi?)&quot;  55th over: India 159-7 (Ashwin 21 Zaheer 0) it&apos;s not just that England are winning, it&apos;s the way they&apos;re doing it. This is an utter trouncing. &quot;Perhaps the most novel experience is scrolling up the OBO, watching the clatter of wickets and flurry of runs in the first session and expecting to see us fight back,&quot; says Alex Webster. &quot;I&apos;m not sure when this change happened and I&apos;m not sure how I feel about it. And I don&apos;t even feel the 0.0002g of sympathy for the Indians I felt when we beat them 4-0. I&apos;m really becoming a ruthless, clinical observer of Test matches.&quot; Ha! You&apos;re developing an Australian streak. Soon you&apos;ll just be asking for stronger opposition because you&apos;re bored of watching England win.  WICKET! Khan 0 lbw b Finn (India 159-8) That ball was far too good for a batsman of Zaheer&apos;s quality, slanting in and staying low, beating the dangling bat and hitting the pads. This match has but minutes to run.  56th over: India 162-8 (Ashwin 23, Sharma 1) India need 45 runs to avoid an innings defeat. Ashwin skips down the wicket and tries to launch a lofted drive down the ground, his head full of thoughts of Botham and Headingley &apos;81. He missed the ball, and should have been stumped but Prior fumbled the chance. Monty is furious. Cook consoles him by bringing in another slip.  57th over: India 162-8 (Ashwin 23, Sharma 1) Ishant Sharma is a gangling tripod of a batsman, seeming to sway in the breeze, propped up only by his bat. He doesn&apos;t inspire much confidence. Ashwin, on the other hand, has batted better than any other member of the vaunted middle order. He plays out a maiden from Finn, who also, again, knocks off the bails at the non-striker&apos;s end in his delivery stride. Nick Knight and Nasser Hussain, meanwhile, are having another set-to on the commentary. I don&apos;t know what passed between these two as players, whether it was at Essex or England, but they haven&apos;t got over it yet.  58th over: India 162-8 (Ashwin 23, Sharma 1) Yes, yes, I said &quot;follow-on&quot;, when I meant &quot;innings defeat&quot;. My brain is malfunctioning. As is Matt Prior&apos;s &apos;keeping. He&apos;s just dropped a straightforward sort of chance off Sharma, and this time Monty is seriously unamused.  59th over: India 166-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 1) Fine shot by Ashwin, a pull for four off Finn. &quot;It&apos;s 2 am in Salt Lake City, &quot; says Adam Blackwell. &quot;Where I have a terrible cold and am in great need of some recuperative sleep. So naturally I am following every over of a match whose result is now a foregone conclusion.&quot; Yes, it sort of feels like we should just be able to fast-forward through these last two wickets. England might be thinking the same thing, which would be why Prior has fluffed two chances. In the meantime we can enjoy the fact that Billy Cooper is starting to blast out Knees Up Mother Brown on his trumpet. Nice.  60th over: India 166-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 1) Jimmy Anderson is into the attack now. Sharma somehow keeps him out for an entire over. &quot;I think I speak for a lot of the OBO when I say &apos;Yessssssss!&apos; This is sensational stuff, Ahmedabad seems aeons away, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; says Guy Hornsby I wonder what team we&apos;ll see from India in 4 days? Sachin and DhonI still there, Ohja, Ashwin? Who else?&quot; It&apos;ll be fascinating to see how many changes they feel able to make. Perhaps they&apos;ll give this same time one last chance in this series. Yuvraj, I guess, would be the easiest man to drop.  61st over: India 166-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 1) Bumble is on brilliant form today in the commentary box. He must have finally got his head around the early starts. Either that or he got out to the French House in Soho last night, which, I think, is that&apos;s his usual haunt in London. He&apos;s just whipped out a pair of immaculate impressions of Brian Johnston and Fred Trueman on TMS.  62nd over: India 170-8 (Ashwin 27, Sharma 5) Sharma smears four past point off an inswinging half volley from Anderson. They trail by 37 now.  63rd over: India 174-8 (Ashwin 31, Sharma 5) Four more, for Ashwin this time. It all looks a little easy out there right now, though perhaps that&apos;s just because we&apos;re expecting wickets to fall so easily. England&apos;s biggest win in terms of runs in India is, I think, and innings and 25. At the moment they lead by an innings and 33 here. Ashwin refuses a series of singles, and then calls for a new bat, his current one having cracked at the splice.  64th over: India 178-8 (Ashwin 31, Sharma 9) Monty is on now, with four men crowding around the bat. Sharma chops the ball over the head of Jimmy Anderson at slip, and gets himself four more. &quot;Are India aware that their tactic to restrict Alastair Cook&apos;s run-scoring (by only offering him a single innings per match) is not new,&quot; chortles Christopher Howell, &quot;and that furthermore it wasn&apos;t successful for Australia?&quot;  65th over: India 178-8 (Ashwin 31, Sharma 9) &quot;Yasir gulzar&apos;s comment in over 55 reminds me of when I passed the Tebbit test,&quot; says Siddhu Warrier. &quot;I felt exactly the same as England trounced Pakistan at the Oval two years ago. I was on that great day doing Norman Tebbit proud, waving the cross of St George in the middle of a (slightly annoyed) group of Pakistan supporters. I guess today is when my bad karma sees me get my just desserts (a slightly rancid gulab jamun, to be precise).&quot;  66th over: India 184-8 (Ashwin 33, Sharma 9) Four byes, down the leg side, though Matt Prior couldn&apos;t have done much about them, so much did the ball swing after pitching. India need another 23 to avoid the innings defeat. As Simon McMahon says, &quot;it&apos;s come to something when it would be a victory of sorts for India to make England bat again.&quot;  67th over: India 184-8 (Ashwin 33, Sharma 9) Swann is on now. Here&apos;s hoping he can wrap this innings up quick sharp. Two of his first three balls spin viciously, the second of them ballooning up off Ishant&apos;s pads and looping over Cook at silly point. It&apos;s a maiden.  68th over: India 188-8 (Ashwin 37, Sharma 9) For India, this stand is almost more of a problem than it is a help, given the light it is casting on the effort of the other batsmen. They have out on 28 off 78 balls so far, and have made batting look very easy indeed in the last 30 minutes. &quot;I think these home defeats might be the best thing to happen to Indian cricket,&quot; says Anand, with no little sagacity. &quot;After successive drubbings, the talk was always about walking all over the opposition at home. If that happened, would have plastered over the cracks and no steps taken to overhaul. I hope that the new selection committee sees these defeats as the time to make changes. Unless people everywhere start blaming curators for the inabilities of the players.&quot;  69th over: India 191-8 (Ashwin 39, Sharma 10) This is getting a little tedious, to be honest. Credit to Ashwin and Sharma, of course, for not giving in, but there is no way to win they can win the match from here, and from a spectator&apos;s point of view, their stonewalling isn&apos;t much to enjoy. England, in the meantime, have turned flatter than week-old Tizer.  70th over: India 192-8 (Ashwin 40, Sharma 10) Ashwin thumps a drive in the air through mid-off, but there is no one there to catch it. A reader in need writes: &quot;I&apos;m wondering if the OBOers might be able to help me figure out how to quickly revert my bathroom back from the mini swimming pool it has currently turned into. All my towels are now too sodden to take up any more water and the fan heater just seems to create interesting currents and eddies. Of course, me wandering off for cricket updates and catching up on the action via OBO may mean I&apos;ve perhaps not been as diligent in bailing out as I should be. Any suggestions for how I can speed up the drying process gratefully received (not involving turning up the heating as my 1930s flat has only two settings....). Oh, and if England can hurry up and get the tail end out that would also be marvellous so I can focus properly on the problem.&quot; Any suggestions for Sinj Mukherjee?  71st over: India 193-8 (Ashwin 41, Sharma 10) India need 14 more to make England bat again, and there are 12 overs left today.  71st over: India 196-8 (Ashwin 44, Sharma 10) Ashwin steers two runs down to third man.  Please, please, please let this stumping be out. It&apos;s gone for a review. And it&apos;s not out. Sharma survives.  WICKET! Sharma 10 b Panesar (India 197-9) Well thank goodness for that. Monty bowls Sharma. Phew, Sharma&apos;s interminable innings of 10 from 53 balls is finally over. Well played, sir, but I&apos;ll be happy if I never have to sit through the like again. There&apos;s one wicket needed, and India still trail by ten runs.  73rd over: India 198-9 (Ashwin 45 Ojha 1) This is more like it. Ojha has an almighty swing at his first ball and skies the ball into the outfield. He takes a single, and Ashwin shoots him a dirty look. Ojha ignores him. It may have been irresponsible, but it was entertaining.  74th over: India 208-9 (Ashwin 53 Ojha 1) Ojha&apos;s recklessness seems to be infectious. Ashwin slaps a slog sweep away square for one four, and steers the next past third man for another. So, that brings up his fifty, and also means that the scores are level. England will have to bat again. Ashwin tries a reverse sweep now, for another single, and India lead by one.  75th over: India 217-9 (Ashwin 62 Ojha 2) No one does seem to have any suggestions for poor old Miss Mukherjee with his flooded bathroom. I imagine he&apos;s out of towels by now, too. Ashwin, meanwhile, has walloped a crisp four though cover. A glorious shot that. The next one is good too, a whip off his hips for another boundary. &quot;India have found one here,&quot; says Nasser, &quot;a proper all-rounder.&quot;  76th over: India 218-9 (Ashwin 63 Ojha 2) Oh dear. Now Ojha seems to be blocking too. Swing for six, or die trying man, there&apos;s no glory in the blocking game. The mind of Peter James McKean has been set wondering down memory lane by that photo of young Alastair Cook at the top of the page: &quot;When I was working at Oakham School I once went to Bedford School for an away cricket fixture. As my U15B team trooped into tea I lingered outsidee the pavilion to watch the 1st XI. On cue, a young batsman clipped a ball of his toes to bring up a double century (against an Oakham side containing Stuart Broad, who opened the batting in those days). Frank Hayes, ex. England and Lancashire commented &apos;That&apos;s the best young batsman I&apos;ve seen in 20 years&apos;. It was, of course, Alastair Cook. In a way I wish I&apos;d said something like &quot;Oh, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s all that. Looks a bit dodgy outside off stump&quot; as then I could have joined the ranks of Teachers Who Were Embarrassingly Wrong. But he was pretty good, so I just watched.&quot;  77th over: India 219-9 (Ashwin 63 Ojha 2) India&apos;s lead is 11 now. There are six overs to come after this one, less two for the change of innings. Monty leads a raucous lbw appeal against Ojha, but the ball was turning too much and would have missed leg stump.  78th over: India 222-9 (Ashwin 66 Ojha 2) Cook brings up his fielders, trying to tempt Ashwin into playing a big shot or, at least, ensure that Ojha is on strike for the next over. Ashwin does play a few ludicrous strokes, skipping down the pitch and trying -and failing - to swat a lofted drive down the ground, then swishing a reverse sweep to third man. The terrible truth is starting to dawn on the Sky commentators - they will have to come back tomorrow morning.  79th over: India 228-9 (Ashwin 72 Ojha 3) Oh my. Four more, as Ashwin clips a drive over mid-on &quot;The flat beneath have just been round to shout at me,&quot; says Miss Mukherjee, who has written in to point out that I made the mistake of assuming she was a man the last time I mentioned her. &quot;Luckily they were shouting in Chinese so I happily nodded, waved at my towels and shut the door on them.&quot; Come on readers, what&apos;s the lady to do?  80th over: India 228-9 (Ashwin 70 Ojha 3) &quot;What do you reckon Smyth is thinking right now?&quot; asks Simon McMahon. &quot;Probably hoping these two hang around til the close so he can get up for work at 3am on Sunday, right?&quot; You called it, Simon. Cricket is glorious isn&apos;t it? There are four overs left today, minus two for the change of innings, plus, of course, England could claim the extra half hour to try and win the match tonight. But that&apos;s only if the dying light allows it, though. India lead by 21 now.  81st over: India 232-9 (Ashwin 76 Ojha 3) England could take the new ball now, if the umpires allow them to in this rather murky light. They will, it seems. Cook has called for it, and given it to Anderson. His first ball is way down the leg side. Ashwin could yet come to regret extending this match so long that England have been able to take a new ball - Anderson has rapped him on the hand with sharp, straight delivery, and he&apos;s now in a little pain. The next ball nips back and almost sneaks through the gate. Ashwin carts the next ball back past the bowler for four, and slashes the next away for a single to the leg-side. Infuriatingly, that means Ojha gets off strike for the next over.  82nd over: India 238-9 (Ashwin 82 Ojha 3) Ashwin wallops four more through mid-wicket. He&apos;s playing wonderfully well. But I wish he wasn&apos;t. I realise it&apos;s only the journalists who really care whether or not England win this tonight, but take my word for it, it&apos;s tremendously tense for us professionals. There&apos;s a day off at stake here. Here, just for Miss Mukherjee, is a little practical advice on the problems of a flooded bathroom: &quot;Tools for flooding depend on the depth of the problem (sorry)\u2026&quot; writes Matt Bedford. &quot;When towels and mops can&apos;t cut it anymore you may be best off leaving it be and going to shop for a pump/wet-dry vacuum cleaner. Also essential: a camera \u2013 take loads of photos for insurance purposes\u2026 if neighbours are knocking, you may need those snaps.&quot; That wasn&apos;t the most thrilling email we&apos;ve ever published on the OBO, I have to say.  83rd over: India 239-9 (Ashwin 82 Ojha 3) &quot;Has Sinj turned the water off at the mains?&quot; asks Nick Tebbutt, most helpfully. &quot;That&apos;s the first move. After that, she should probably just leave the house and ignore the problem until evaporation takes its course. Now, can the OBOers suggest a fix for my problem? I&apos;m crushingly hungover and there&apos;s no breakfast in the flat. Everything&apos;s too bright outside, but the gf&apos;s just threatened to hit me if I don&apos;t provide something. What to do?&quot; Oh yes, that one&apos;s easy Nick - first option is to lock yourself in the toilet until she gives in and goes out herself, second option is to get down on your knees and plead that she look in her heart, has mercy on you and goes out to get breakfast herself, third option is to trade it off against promises of future good deeds.  It&apos;s all over, England aren&apos;t allowed the extra half hour, and we&apos;ll all have to come back tomorrow. Ashwin has batted brilliantly - Ojha has only had to face one delivery since the new ball was taken. I&apos;ve watched a little too much English cricket to say that England are bound to win this match tomorrow, but they really should do. India&apos;s lead is 32. Rob Smyth will be here at 3.15am to talk you through it. Poor bugger. Cheerio.

At around six o&apos;clock local time on Sunday, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and his players will touch down at Narita airport outside Tokyo seeking respite from recent toils, the week ahead offering the ailing European Cup winners the chance of world domination. The mid-season fillip has to be seized. Their two-game stay in Yokohama may disrupt Premier League rhythm, casting them further adrift in the title race, but the interim manager and his players have to consider the Fifa World Club Cup an opportunity on the other side of the world. The tournament is often maligned by snootier European leagues, despite Barcelona, Manchester United, Milan and Ben\u00edtez&apos;s Internazionale having claimed the prize in each of the past five years, but Chelsea will be seeking to change the perception. &quot;You can never, ever, say challenging for a trophy comes at a bad time,&quot; Ben\u00edtez says. &quot;It&apos;s silverware and a cup we want to win.&quot; It would offer the world a reminder that this team has not lost its way, despite becoming the first holders to fail to emerge from their Champions League group. Ben\u00edtez arrived at Stamford Bridge last month, convinced he could coax the success expected by Roman Abramovich from a campaign that appeared to be unravelling, and there would be a certain prestige to emerging triumphant from this week-long stay in Japan. The owner was unimpressed that chances to win the Community Shield and European Super Cup were passed up in the autumn. This would be a timely occasion to buck that trend. Ben\u00edtez has experienced this competition twice before. It arguably provided the high point of his brief spell at Inter, in 2010, when the Italians were expected to meet Internacional in the final in Abu Dhabi, but ended up confronting, and defeating, the African champions, Mazembe of Congo. Five years earlier he had taken Liverpool to Yokohama in the first year of the tournament&apos;s current guise, defeating the Costa Ricans Deportivo Saprissa in the semi-final before succumbing, mystifyingly, to S\u00e3o Paulo in the final. The Spaniard ended that evening berating the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, for mistakes made by a\u00a0Mexican referee and a Canadian linesman after seeing three goals disallowed in a 1-0 defeat. His players departed feeling cheated. In truth, the manager&apos;s tournament had been overshadowed by the death of his father, Francisco, in the buildup to the semi-final, Ben\u00edtez plunging himself into his work as he dealt with his grief with dignity. The whole week had felt rather torrid. This time around, he will use the finals as an opportunity to bond with his squad after a helter-skelter few weeks in charge \u2013 albeit in the absence of the injured captain John Terry \u2013 while seeking to repair damaged confidence. &quot;It will be very positive, spending time with them in Japan, and that will help,&quot; he says. &quot;The football will be very tough. It&apos;s a massive competition for a lot of people around the world. Maybe in Europe people don&apos;t consider it as important, but speak to Brazilians or Mexicans and you can see how\u00a0they consider it. For them, it&apos;s an opportunity to show the level they are at, a chance to prove themselves against a big team from Europe. &quot;We are well aware of what this means for the South American teams, and we have Brazilian players in our squad who know already. The other sides have been in Japan for a while, acclimatising, so that will also make it harder for us. But we cannot look at playing Corinthians yet. First, we have to get through our semi-final and, as it proved two years ago, it does not always go as you expect.&quot; That first game is on Thursday and by the time Chelsea arrive in Tokyo they will know if they are to play South Korea&apos;s Ulsan Hyundai or Mexico&apos;s Monterrey at the Yokohama international stadium. Corinthians, fresh from their first Copa Libertadores success, will take on either Sanfrecce Hiroshima or Al-Ahly in their semi-final in Toyota City. &quot;Whoever we have to play, it&apos;ll be really difficult,&quot; Ben\u00edtez says. Yet he may find relief at avoiding any booing from his own supporters and will benefit from a prolonged period of time working at close quarters with his new players.

By Wednesday, though, the current bitterly cold temperatures are expected to have risen to more tolerable levels. Several high-altitude resorts, such as Verbier, Obergurgl, Cervinia, Val Thorens, Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re and Tignes, are already open, along with Arinsal and Pas de la Casa in Andorra. In Courchevel and M\u00e9ribel there is now a metre-and-a-half of snow on Saulire \u2013 the highest point of their joint ski area.  Lifts in Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re and neighbouring Tignes were temporarily closed last week because of 70mph winds and the risk of avalanches. Nick Morgan, managing director of chalet operator Le Ski, said: &quot;A ridiculous amount of snow has fallen in Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re and in Courchevel. It&apos;s a dream start to the season.&quot; In Austria, St Anton, Kitzb\u00fchel, Lech and Saalbach are open, as is the Jungfrau region (Wengen, M\u00fcrren and Grindelwald) in Switzerland. Which brings me to news that the Jungfrau is cutting lift pass prices by 50% (six-day pass CHF157 \u2013 \u00a3105) for December, January and March (20% for February) in a bid to attract skiers back to Switzerland.

Visually, it was stunning. Who wouldn&apos;t be knocked out by William Holman Hunt&apos;s masterpiece The Lady of Shalott, which travelled from the US to the UK for the first time since 1951; or Ford Madox Brown&apos;s endlessly fascinating Work, one of the stars of Birmingham&apos;s collection; or John Everett Millais&apos;s stupendous Scottish landscape Chill October (on loan from Andrew Lloyd Webber) that had Van Gogh writing home to his brother singing its praises? But it&apos;s the story it tells that gives the show, still on at Tate Britain, its particular appeal. Too many people view the pre-Raphaelites as lightweight chocolate-box merchants. This exhibition has elevated them and argues \u2013 convincingly, I think \u2013 that they were Britain&apos;s first modern art movement, pushing boundaries in their innovation and experimentation. It is wonderful to look at Brown&apos;s sublimely silly The Pretty Baa Lambs armed with the knowledge that it is more than it seems, that the artist painted it entirely in the open air \u2013 something no other artist was doing, and an innovation normally credited to the French impressionists.

The show, Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde, has taken five years to bring together and is Tate Britain&apos;s first major survey of the movement for 30 years. It leaves London on 13 January, before heading to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC in the spring and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow in the summer, and then in 2014 to the Mori art centre in Tokyo.

One is the cowardly halfwit who almost took Rio Ferdinand&apos;s eye out with a coin thrown from the safety of the crowd, while the other is the cowardly Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri, whose crime of deserting a defensive wall could only have been more stereotypically French if it turned out he&apos;d actually sparked up a Gauloises after nipping in behind Edin Dzeko to avoid getting hit by the ball. While thetan thespian Tom Cruise, who was present, may have thought the Manchester City winger had been abducted on behalf of the Galactic Confederacy&apos;s alien emperor Xemu, the player&apos;s manager seemed under no illusion about what was responsible for his disappearance from the white heat of battle at such a pivotal moment. &quot;If it hits you in the face, it hits you in the face,&quot; harrumphed Roberto Mancini, in a withering tone that suggested his player might be getting hit in the face later anyway, albeit not by a football. Luckily for Nasri, his team-mate Mario Balotelli also shipped some of the blame for Manchester City&apos;s defeat, with the Italian&apos;s only contribution of note coming in the form of a spectacularly dirty look aimed in the direction of his gaffer as he stormed towards the tunnel after being hooked early in the second half. &quot;When you have a player with Mario&apos;s quality, you can&apos;t believe that he throws his quality out of the window,&quot; said Mancini, a man who is clearly pining for the good old days when the only things being thrown out of the window by his young Italian charge were less expensive objects such as darts and fireworks. On the subject of throwing things, the former Manchester United midfielder and MUTV presenter Paddy Crerand was involved in a tedious and tetchy exchange on Radio Five Live this morning, after initially failing to understand a question about whether or not Ferdinand might have provoked people into firing missiles by celebrating United&apos;s winner within tuppence-chucking range of some City fans. &quot;He gets struck by a coin that somebody&apos;s thrown from about 15 or 20 yards, it&apos;s not like he was standing in front of their supporters jumping up and down,&quot; said Crerand eventually, neglecting to mention that footballers should be allowed to celebrate last-minute winners wherever they like without fear of being blinded by morons who quite literally have more money than sense. Moments after Ferdinand had been hit by the coin, Joe Hart was on hand to step between the clearly incensed defender and a City-supporting pitch invader, perhaps saving the Manchester United player from doing something that might have earned him the kudos of millions and a lengthy spell on the FA&apos;s naughty step. Indeed, if the goalkeeper had moved even a fraction as quickly to block Wayne Rooney&apos;s opener, it&apos;s safe to say his side might have won the match.

The intervention came amid mounting speculation that the Financial Services Authority is preparing to take action against a number of banks in relation to Libor setting. The SFO and City of London police arrested three men aged 33, 41 and 47 after searching a house in Surrey and two properties in Essex. The three were taken to a London police station to be interviewed &quot;in connection with the investigation into the manipulation of Libor&quot;. The three are understood to be Tom Hayes, who has worked for a number of banks including UBS and Citigroup, and two men who worked for City-based inter-dealer broker RP Martin \u2013 Terry Farr and Jim Gilmour. They are either on leave or have left the company. Citi and UBS declined to comment. RP Martin stressed it was co-operating with the authorities but not under investigation. A lawyer for Farr declined to comment, while Gilmour and Hayes could not be contacted. It was anticipated the three would be release on police bail after questioning without being charged. The SFO&apos;s investigation into Libor rigging was sparked by the \u00a3290m fine for Barclays in June, which led to the departures of chairman Marcus Agius, chief executive Bob Diamond and newly promoted chief operating officer Jerry del Missier. Investigators working in collaboration with multiple parallel inquiries around the world are racing to establish the international reach of alleged Libor manipulation rings. Hayes, who had been based in Tokyo during his 10 months with Citi, was let go by the bank. This was about the same time as the Japanese regulator sanctioned the firm following a probe into alleged manipulation of the yen-based interest rates. The director of the SFO, David Green, has told MPs that he knows the agency will be largely judged on the success of the Libor investigation and had deployed 40 staff on the cases which involve more than one firm. The SFO announced a formal investigation into the complex rate-rigging affair on 6 July and by the end of that month had already concluded it had the powers to conduct a criminal investigation. While the Financial Services Authority and regulators in the US have fined Barclays, individuals involved have not been formally named or reprimanded. Barclays&apos; head of investment banking, Rich Ricci, told the banking standards committee that it had &quot;terminated the employment&quot; of five people and that 13 staff had been disciplined in total. Barclays is so far the only bank the regulators have penalised, but speculation is rife that other banks will face penalties before the end of the year. The FSA said that eight financial firms in total, and not just banks, were the subject of investigations by the City regulator. UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland are among those in settlement talks with the FSA that could reach a conclusion shortly. Terry Smith, chief executive of City broker Tullett Prebon, said: &quot;At the time I was astonished that no one thought those involved in Libor manipulation could be prosecuted without new and specific legislation. It is a modern illusion that an act cannot be prosecuted as a crime just because there is not a specific piece of legislation which proscribes it. We have some perfectly good laws, they just need to be applied.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["The 76-year-old Japanese man has been held on death row in Tokyo for the past 44 years, with 30 years in solitary confinement."], "tags": ["Amnesty International", "World news", "Capital punishment", "Campaigning journalism"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-12T10:00:00Z", "title": "Jeremy Irons speaks out on behalf of Hakamada Iwao, the world's longest-serving death row prisoner", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/12/jeremy-irons-hakamada-iwao-japan-death-row", "article": "    Hakamada Iwao is believed to be the world&apos;s longest-serving death row prisoner. The 76-year-old Japanese man has been held on death row in Tokyo for the past 44 years, with 30 years in solitary confinement. Hakamada spends each day in anguish not knowing if the next day will be his last. In Japan, death row inmates are given no advance notice as to when they will be executed, they can be taken from their cell at any point, and hanged \u2013 the uncertainty is excruciating. There are serious concerns about the state of Hakamada&apos;s mental health. Over the past 30 years he has exhibited signs of mental illness \u2013 described by one psychiatrist as &quot;institutional psychosis&quot; and by another as a &quot;state of insanity&quot;.     Hakamada Iwao Photograph: Amnesty International    Arrested in 1966, Hakamada, a former boxer from Shizuoka prefecture, was charged with the murder of his former employer and the man&apos;s wife and two children in the town of Shimizu. He was interrogated by police for 20 days, up to 14 hours a day, without the presence of a lawyer. He confessed to the multiple killing but later retracted this confession saying that he had been beaten and threatened. Hakamada has always maintained his innocence, and he is supported by one of the judges, Kumamoto Norimichi, from his original trial at the Shizuoka District Court that sentenced him to death in 1968. Norimichi spoke out in 2007 to say he believed Hakamada was innocent. Evidence against Hakamada is questionable at best; for example, recent new forensic test results disclosed by Hakamada&apos;s defence team found no match between Hakamada&apos;s DNA and samples taken from clothing he is alleged to have worn at the time of the crime. Amnesty believes Hakamada&apos;s trial was unfair. Opposing the death penalty in all circumstances, Amnesty is urging the Japanese government to stop the execution of Hakamada. This year, as part of Amnesty&apos;s Write for Rights Campaign, Jeremy Irons has spoken out on behalf of Hakamada Iwao. Irons \u2013 whose acting career has spanned the four decades that Iwao has been on death row \u2013 said: &quot;Just five minutes is all it takes to stand up for someone around the world who so desperately needs to know that others care.

South Koreans have the most to fear from the North&apos;s militarism. Memories of the unprovoked 2010 shelling of a South Korean island, and the sinking of a navy warship with the loss of 46 lives, are still fresh. With the two countries still technically in a state of war, the threat posed by the unpredictable panjandrums of Pyongyang now looms larger than ever ahead of next week&apos;s presidential election in South Korea. Park Geun-hye, the conservative leader who is favourite to become South Korea&apos;s first female president in the 19 December poll, has personal reasons for distrusting the North. Her mother was killed in one of several assassination attempts targeting her father, the former South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee, that were ordered by North Korea. Both Park and her principal rival, Moon Jae-in, say they want resumed talks with Pyongyang. In an echo of former West German chancellor Willy Brandt&apos;s Ostpolitik policy of opening up to East Germany, Park has spoken of developing a new, mutual &quot;trustpolitik&quot; with North Korea after the confrontations of recent years. But Park&apos;s demands that the North halt missile tests and cancel its nuclear programme \u2013 which includes several atom bombs, the building of a light water reactor and expanded uranium enrichment \u2013 have elicited an angry response, with North Korean state media labelling her a fascist. In contrast, Moon has said that, if elected, he would resume bilateral aid cut off by South Korea&apos;s outgoing leader, President Lee Myung-bak, and offer new talks without preconditions. Moon&apos;s candidacy is thus more likely to appeal to Pyongyang. But Kim Jong-un, North Korea&apos;s youthful new leader, and his party apparatchiks do not have a vote. And politically speaking, their missile test could now spectacularly backfire south of the border. Having been rudely reminded of the Northern threat, undecided South Koreans may be expected to support Park and her tougher stance in the final days of the campaign. Japan also goes to the polls this weekend in a vote that may produce the country&apos;s seventh prime minister in seven years. Although most Japanese are focused on an underperforming economy that slipped back into recession in the second and third quarters, heightened tensions with North Korea will not help restore the business and consumer confidence that is so sorely lacking. The election&apos;s outcome remains uncertain, but the Democratic party&apos;s unpopular prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, is struggling to hang on to office. The man most likely to succeed him is Shinzo Abe, a former premier who is leading a comeback by the once dominant Liberal Democrats. Abe is a noted hawk and nationalist whose latest visit to Tokyo&apos;s Yasukuni shrine to the spirits of Japan&apos;s war dead in October provoked protests in South Korea and China. He has taken a tough line during the recent maritime disputes with China, and has been active in the past in the cases of Japanese nationals kidnapped by North Korea. If elected, Abe is expected to resume his previous attempts to ease the constraints on Japanese military action imposed by the post-war pacifist constitution. As proposed, Tokyo would drop a self-imposed ban on exercising its right to collective self-defence, or aiding an ally under attack. This would allow Japan&apos;s military to shoot down a North Korean missile heading for US or other cities, assist a US vessel under attack and facilitate joint operations with US forces. Reacting angrily to the North Korean launch, Abe said:  &quot;Japan should work together with the international community to adopt a new resolution at the United Nations to strongly condemn North Korea. The rocket launch was outrageous. The international community needs to impose harsh sanctions.&quot;  China, the only country with any real influence over North Korea, called on Pyongyang earlier this month to help maintain regional peace and security and &quot;not to take any moves to worsen the problem&quot;. Although its advice was ignored, Beijing&apos;s &quot;new&quot; seven-member politburo standing committee is also dominated by elderly conservatives. They can be expected to stick by Pyongyang in the event of a fight."}, {"sentences": ["The candidates include the Japan Restoration party, a new far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo Shintaro Ishihara and his deputy, Osaka&apos;s mayor, Toru Hashimoto.", "With or without Ishihara, Abe will find it hard to resist that trend, according to Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo."], "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Yoshihiko Noda", "China"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-14T17:27:59Z", "title": "Japan's conservatives on cusp of election victory", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/japan-conservatives-election-ldp-shinzo-abe", "article": "Three years after it was kicked out of office in an election that was supposed to herald a new direction for the country, Japan&apos;s biggest conservative party is on the cusp of a return to power. The Liberal Democratic party [LDP], which has governed almost for much of the postwar era, is expected to win Sunday&apos;s election comfortably, led by a man whose first term as prime minister ended five years ago. The likely winner, Shinzo Abe, has been helped by widespread dissatisfaction with the current prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whose Democratic party of Japan [DPJ] won a landslide in 2009 promising to take power out of the hands of bureaucrats, divert money from wasteful public works to families and welfare, and pursue a more independent foreign policy after decades of dependence on the US. Anger at the DPJ&apos;s failure to deliver has been matched by a swing to the right that has benefited Abe, one of the Japan&apos;s most vocal conservatives. The country&apos;s hawks have been given ample ammunition with which to attack Noda, the third DPJ leader in as many years. Abe dismissed as weak-kneed Noda&apos;s response to Chinese provocations over the Senkaku dispute, which took another troubling turn on Thursday after a Chinese plane flew over the islands, known as the Diaoyu in China. North Korea&apos;s successful rocket launch this week will have only boosted Abe&apos;s credentials as a hardliner against the regime in Pyongyang. Opinion polls suggest he will pull off what had seemed impossible only weeks ago \u2013 gaining enough lower house seats with its traditional ally, New Komeito, to overrule the upper house, a regular source of instability for the past five years. Abe&apos;s failure to win a clear majority would trigger a search for a second coalition partner among a myriad of minor parties. The candidates include the Japan Restoration party, a new far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo Shintaro Ishihara and his deputy, Osaka&apos;s mayor, Toru Hashimoto. In the early days of the campaign, Abe attempted to match Ishihara&apos;s nationalist rhetoric. The LDP leader hinted he would &quot;revise&quot; a previous prime minister&apos;s apology for Japan&apos;s wartime conduct. He has questioned claims that Japan had used tens of thousands of Asian women as sex slaves during the war and has said he regretted visiting Yasukuni \u2013 a war shrine revered by nationalists \u2013 when he last led Japan for a year from 2006. Abe has since dropped references to the war, and many believe he will soften his stance on China once in office. &quot;We don&apos;t want to do anything to further worsen the current state of affairs,&quot; Yoshitaka Shindo, an MP in Abe&apos;s party, told Reuters. &quot;We need to calm the situation down and smooth over our relations as Japan doesn&apos;t want to run into any military collision with any neighbouring country.&quot; Some opinion polls have put the Restoration party in second place ahead of the DPJ, which could be reduced to fewer than 70 seats. Even if Ishihara&apos;s band of ultra-conservatives fails to win enough seats to force coalition talks, his party&apos;s rapid rise is evidence of Japan&apos;s rightward shift. With or without Ishihara, Abe will find it hard to resist that trend, according to Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. &quot;This time around, Abe is more reliant on his rightwing backers who formed a part of the broader coalition that helped him get elected as the LDP chief &quot;It seems that his voters have also moved to the right and expect a hardened stance.&quot;"}, {"sentences": ["It was a bad-tempered affair, Nobby Stiles was sent off in the first leg and George Best and Jos\u00e9 Hugo Medina in the second as the Argentinians triumphed 2-1 on\u00a0aggregate 1980 Intercontinental Cup Nacional 1 Nottm Forest 0, Tokyo This was the first match to be played at a neutral venue, 62,000 fans packing into the National Stadium in Tokyo.", "Brian Clough was unable to raise his Forest players, with man-of-the-match Waldemar Victorino scoring the only goal for the Uruguayans 1981 Intercontinental Cup Flamengo 3-0 Liverpool, Tokyo Liverpool were playing in the cup for the first time having declined to take part as European champions in 1977 and 1978.", "They might as well not have bothered as they were outplayed by Zico, below, and his side, conceding three times in the first 45 minutes 1982 Intercontinental Cup Pe\u00f1arol 2-0 Aston Villa, Tokyo A third defeat in three years for English clubs.", "The Copa Libertadores holders had 10 Uruguayans in their side but it was the lone Brazilian, Jair Gon\u00e7alves Prates, who starred, scoring the opening goal and winning the man-of-the-match award 1984 Intercontinental Cup Independiente 1 Liverpool 0, Tokyo England&apos;s dreadful run in the competition continued, Joe Fagan&apos;s team the latest to be beaten.", "Liverpool were the better side but could not equalise Jos\u00e9 Percudani&apos;s goal 1999 Intercontinental Cup Man Utd 1 Palmeiras 0, Tokyo An English name was finally inscribed on the trophy as heavy favourites United beat their Brazilian opponents.", "Roy Keane, who had missed the Champions League final, scored the only goal as United dominated 2000 Club World Championship Vasco da Gama 3 Man Utd 1, Tokyo United&apos;s ill-fated trip to Brazil, which led to their controversial withdrawal from the FA Cup, saw them easily defeated by the hosts in the group stage at the Maracan\u00e3.", "Romario, right, scored twice, with Gary Neville committing a pair of\u00a0howlers 2005 Club World Cup S\u00e3o Paulo 1 Liverpool 0, Tokyo Rafael Ben\u00edtez was the Liverpool manager as the Reds dominated, had three goals disallowed and were defeated by Mineiro&apos;s first-half goal in front of a crowd of 66,821 2008 Club World Cup Man Utd 1 LDU Quito 0, Tokyo After beating Gamba Osaka 5-3 in the semi-final, Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s team emerged as world champions thanks to Wayne Rooney&apos;s winner in a scrappy game against the Ecuadorean team"], "tags": ["Club World Cup", "Football", "Manchester United", "Chelsea", "Liverpool", "Nottingham Forest", "Aston Villa", "Estudiantes", "Nacional", "Palmeiras", "S\u00e3o Paulo", "Flamengo", "Corinthians", "Vasco Da Gama", "Independiente"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-14T19:28:47Z", "title": "English clubs suffer from Latin lessons in Club World Cup", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/14/english-club-world-cup-south-american", "article": "1968 Intercontinental Cup Estudiantes 1 Man Utd 0, Buenos Aires; Man Utd 1 Estudiantes 1, Old Trafford United were England&apos;s first representatives in the annual tie between the European and South American champions.

TV networks will release forecasts of the result after polling stations close at 8pm local time (11am GMT) on Sunday. Opinion polls taken in the runup to the election indicated that the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) would secure a majority in the 480-seat lower house. Turnout was sluggish at just over 27% by mid-afternoon, down 7.8 percentage points from 2009, according to government data. If the forecasts are correct, the LDP leader, Shinzo Abe, will become Japan&apos;s seventh prime minister in just over six years. An 11th-hour plea to voters by the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to turn their backs on the LDP&apos;s &quot;old-style politics&quot; was unlikely to save his Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) from a crushing defeat.

The LDP, which governed for all but 11 months between 1955 and 2009, has capitalised on popular anger over the DPJ government&apos;s failure to deliver on a promise to replace pork-barrel politics with a new focus on families, welfare and healthcare. Many voters feel the DPJ has dawdled over the reconstruction of the region devastated by last year&apos;s earthquake and tsunami. And they associate Noda with an unpopular plan to double the consumption (sales) tax to 10%, a measure that passed only with the support of Abe&apos;s party. But there was little enthusiasm outside polling stations for the LDP and Abe, the grandson of a former prime minister who holds revisionist views on Japan&apos;s wartime conduct and supports a more active overseas role for Japan&apos;s armed forces. Instead, uncertainty over the economy and Japan&apos;s response to the rise of China appears to have sent voters reaching for the familiar \u2013 big spending on public works to boost growth, and close security ties with the US to counter the perceived threat from China. &quot;The Democrats are out because they have been unable to implement their policy manifesto and are divided internally.

Voters, many of whom said they were undecided going into Sunday&apos;s election, have no fewer than 12 parties to choose from. Most are unlikely to have an impact on the outcome, but one possible exception is the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara. His party has placed second in some polls and could force Abe into coalition talks in the event of a hung parliament. Abe, 58, whose first stint as prime minister ended in 2007 amid scandal and ill health, has pledged to take a tougher stance on the Senkaku territorial row with Beijing, and to abandon plans to phase out nuclear power by 2040 \u2013 a measure the DPJ introduced in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.

Combined, the tally would give the parties the &quot;super-majority&quot; they need to take total control of both houses of parliament and end years of policy deadlock and instability. Abe, who resigned as prime minister in 2007 after a year blighted by scandals involving cabinet ministers, has promised to take a tougher stance towards China over the Senkaku islands, give Japan&apos;s armed forces a bigger international role and retain nuclear power, despite growing opposition to atomic energy in the wake of last year&apos;s Fukushima Daiichi meltdown. On the economy \u2013 the single biggest issue of the campaign \u2013 Abe has pledged to return to high spending on public works and ease monetary policy to boost growth. The Japanese economy has been beset by stagnation and deflation for two decades and recently entered its fourth recession since 2000. The governing Democratic party of Japan [DPJ] is expected to suffer a heavy defeat, three years after it ended the LDP&apos;s near-monopoly on power with a landslide victory at the last election. Exit polls said the DPJ could be reduced to fewer than 70 seats. Party officials interviewed by TV networks hinted that its leader, Yoshihiko Noda, would have to take responsibility for its disastrous showing and resign immediately. The election also saw the emergence of a third force in the form of the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara. It was predicted to win around 46 seats. At one point polls suggested the Restoration party could overtake the DPJ as the country&apos;s second-biggest party and act as powerbroker in a hung parliament. That level of influence now looks unlikely, however. Turnout was sluggish at just over 27% by mid-afternoon, down 7.8 percentage points from 2009, according to government data. Abe, 58, will become Japan&apos;s seventh prime minister in just over six years. Noda&apos;s 11th-hour plea to reject the LDP&apos;s &quot;old-style politics&quot; failed to sway voters. The LDP, which governed for all but 11 months between 1955 and 2009, has capitalised on popular anger over the DPJ&apos;s failure to deliver on a promise to replace pork-barrel politics with a focus on families, welfare and healthcare. Many voters feel the DPJ has dithered over the reconstruction of the region devastated by last year&apos;s earthquake and tsunami. And they associate Noda with an unpopular plan to double the consumption (sales) tax to 10%, a measure that passed only with the support of Abe&apos;s party. But there was little enthusiasm outside polling stations for the LDP and Abe, the grandson of a former prime minister who holds revisionist views on Japan&apos;s wartime conduct and supports a more active overseas role for Japan&apos;s armed forces. Instead, uncertainty over the economy and Japan&apos;s response to the rise of China appears to have sent voters reaching for the familiar \u2013 big spending on public works to boost growth, and close security ties with the US to counter the perceived threat from China. &quot;The Democrats are out because they have been unable to implement their policy manifesto and are divided internally. But that doesn&apos;t mean I support the LDP,&quot; said Yosuke Matsumoto, 33. &quot;Nothing will change under them.&quot; Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University, said the election was about punishing the DPJ, which won by a landslide in 2009. &quot;It seems to me that people are driven by nostalgia, as they seem to want to bring the LDP back to power because they lack better alternatives,&quot; he told Reuters. Voters, many of whom said they were undecided going into the election, had no fewer than 12 parties to choose from. Of the 480 seats in Japan&apos;s lower house, 300 are elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 180 through proportional representation in 11 regional blocs."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;If he&apos;s in this for the long game and wants to last longer as prime minister than he did the first time, he certainly has the motivation to be more pragmatic.&quot; Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, predicted Abe would come under pressure from his own party to implement his hawkish agenda.", "The election also saw the emergence of a third force in the form of the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, that was predicted to win between 40 and 61 seats."], "tags": ["Japan", "Senkaku Islands", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-16T17:22:24Z", "title": "Japanese hawk's election victory prompts fears of regional tension", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-hawk-victory-fears-tension", "article": "East Asia is bracing for an era of tension and confrontation after Japan&apos;s general elections returned a hawkish conservative to power. The Liberal Democratic party&apos;s resounding victory on Sunday threatens to further impair relations with China if the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, makes good on promises to take a tough stance in a territorial row. Yesterday&apos;s result marked a dramatic comeback for the LDP, three years after it was ousted by the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), ending its near monopoly on power for five decades. Abe, who is expected to be installed as Japan&apos;s seventh prime minister in six years on Boxing day, has vowed to strengthen Japan&apos;s military in the face of Beijing&apos;s more aggressive posture in the East China Sea and North Korea&apos;s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. A furious reaction is expected from Beijing if the LDP goes ahead with campaign pledges to develop fisheries and build on the Senkakus, a group of islands administered by Japan but also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyu. China&apos;s Xinhua news agency warned Japan to resist the shift to the right that has characterised the election, held months after Chinese demonstrators attacked Japanese businesses following Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands from their private owners. &quot;An economically weak and politically angry Japan will not only hurt the country, but also hurt the region and the world at large,&quot; Xinhua said. &quot;Japan, which brought great harm and devastation to other Asian countries in the second world war, will raise further suspicions among its neighbours if the current political trend of turning right is not stopped in time.&quot; Some analysts believe Abe, who resigned as prime minister in 2007 after only a year in office, will adopt a more conciliatory approach towards China \u2013 Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner \u2013 once the realities of political office kick in, citing his fence-mending visit to Beijing early during his previous term as prime minister. &quot;For all his nationalist credentials, I suspect Abe will be more pragmatic,&quot; said John Swenson-Wright, senior consulting fellow for Asia at Chatham House. &quot;If he&apos;s in this for the long game and wants to last longer as prime minister than he did the first time, he certainly has the motivation to be more pragmatic.&quot; Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, predicted Abe would come under pressure from his own party to implement his hawkish agenda. &quot;During his campaign to lead the LDP, he said he regretted moderating his stance on China the first time he was prime minister,&quot; Nakano said. &quot;This is his last chance, so will he want to go down as someone who moderates his views when in office, or as a conviction politician? My feeling is that he&apos;ll go for the latter. &quot;The right wing of the LDP installed him as party leader, and I don&apos;t think he has the authority or the personality to keep a grip on them. They chose him because they know he&apos;s easy to manipulate.&quot; Speaking on TV after his victory, Abe, 58, signalled that he would make the economy his priority. &quot;First and foremost we have to bring about an economic recovery and pull Japan out of deflation,&quot; he said. The economy had been in dire straits for three years and was his top priority. &quot;We must strengthen our alliance with the US and also improve relations with China, with a strong determination that there is no change in the fact that the Senkaku Islands are our territory.&quot; Exit polls indicated the LDP was on course to win about 300 seats, and its traditional ally, New Komeito, about 30 seats. Combined, that would give them the &quot;supermajority&quot; they need in the 480-seat lower house to pass legislation through both houses of parliament unchallenged. The incumbent prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whose DPJ is expected to win 65 seats \u2013 a fifth of the number it won in 2009 \u2013 said he would resign as party leader to take responsibility for its heavy defeat. &quot;I apologise deeply for our failure to achieve results,&quot; he said. &quot;This was the voters&apos; verdict on our failure to live up to their expectations during our three years and three months in power.&quot; Abe also supports revisions to the constitution to give Japan&apos;s military a more prominent role, and is expected to reverse Noda&apos;s decision to abandon nuclear power \u2013 a response to last year&apos;s triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant \u2013 by 2040. Under Abe, Japan can expect a return to high spending on public works \u2013 a clear sign that the conservative old guard has returned. The election also saw the emergence of a third force in the form of the Japan Restoration party, a far-right group led by the outspoken former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, that was predicted to win between 40 and 61 seats. At one point, polls suggested that the Restoration party could overtake the DPJ as the country&apos;s second-biggest party and act as powerbroker in a hung parliament. That level of influence now looks unlikely, but LDP officials suggested the new administration could turn to Ishihara for support if it decides to revise the constitution \u2013 another measure expected to antagonise China and South Korea."}, {"sentences": ["The Japanese situation is different because after two decades of virtually zero inflation and zero growth, even the ageing savers of Tokyo understand they need a bit of inflation in the system (if only to make people spend a bit more now rather than tomorrow when their spending power is diminished by rising prices)."], "tags": ["Economics", "Business", "Inflation", "Unemployment and employment statistics", "Japan"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-17T18:03:41Z", "title": "Inflation, jobs and intergenerational economics", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/dec/17/inflation-jobs-intergenerational-economics", "article": "Do central banks care about unemployment more than inflation? To some extent it is an intergenerational issue. The question arises after the winner in the Japanese general election on Sunday, the Liberal Democratic party&apos;s Shinzo Abe, demanded the Bank of Japan accept higher inflation as a fair trade off for policies that could kickstart the moribund economy. The demand follows a speech by US central bank chief Ben Bernanke, who has taken the hint that unemployment remains too high and said, in central banker code, that cutting unemployment will be his chief target. If he starts to see prices rises get out of control, then he will pay attention to the old inflation target, but making sure the US avoids millions of long term unemployed is priority number one. In the UK, the Bank of England can already point to three years of measures unemployment targeting at the expense of inflation. Its policy of printing money under its quantitative easing plan has infuriated inflation hawks and savers groups, who want to maintain the pre-crisis focus on fighting high inflation. And here we have the intergenerational issue in a nutshell. Older people with pots of cash in savings and investment accounts want low inflation to protect their assets. Young people, who have only small savings, if any at all, and big debts, are keener on having a job to pay the bills. Constant influxes of migrants and young people into the US labour market keeps the population young and agitating much more for a job than low inflation. Bernanke is susceptible to the younger and poorer element, many of whom voted for president Obama, when he reviews his policies. Old Europe, grey of head and weak of limb, prefers to pay the bills from gains on its savings wealth. Voters in Italy, Belgium and Germany demand the European Central Bank remain unreconstructed. Inflation remains the focus of the ECB board. The UK straddles both camps and as such, charts a middle course somewhere between the ECB and the US Federal Reserve, though the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is expected to start tacking towards the US soon. Governor Sir Mervyn King&apos;s successor, the Canadian Mark Carney, joined in the debate last week when he said inflation targeting could be abandoned completely in favour of tracking nominal GDP, which is another way of saying the central bank should seek to maintain growth (and jobs as a key byproduct). The Japanese situation is different because after two decades of virtually zero inflation and zero growth, even the ageing savers of Tokyo understand they need a bit of inflation in the system (if only to make people spend a bit more now rather than tomorrow when their spending power is diminished by rising prices). Economics, then, is a battle of the generations as much as it is a battle between rich and poor. There are plenty of young people who will be gifted or inherit wealth from their well-off parents, giving them an opportunity to own property denied many of their compatriots. But there are few families these days who can create or pass on a job. The economy needs to create jobs and it can only do that if the economy is moving. The only downside for workers in letting inflation rise jump to more than double its current 2% &quot;optimum level&quot;, as envisaged by dovish central bankers, is that employers feel little pressure to maintain wage rates. Past generations have inflated away their debts knowing they had the power as workers to maintain their wages in real terms. But in an era of declining trade union strength that is harder for the average worker. When employers fail to maintain the spending power of wages, only property owners gain. Maybe that&apos;s the point of the exercise."}, {"sentences": ["But this is not to say that Tokyo is immune from populist lures."], "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China", "South China Sea"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-17T20:33:01Z", "title": "Japan: regional tremors | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/17/japan-regional-tremors-editorial", "article": "The dispute over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea and the extent of Beijing&apos;s claims in the South China Sea are, by common consent, typhoons gathering off shore. Rising Chinese military power, a historic multilateral dispute involving at least six sovereign nations, potentially vast oil and gas reserves, and the busiest shipping lanes in the world are all combining to form one large low-pressure centre. So the election of a Japanese prime minister on a ticket of getting tough in the territorial dispute might appear to be a further cause for concern. China&apos;s Xinhua agency lost no time in seeking to extract gain from Japan&apos;s lurch to the right. It reminded its neighbour of its second world war record and its ability to upset the status quo once more. This is grossly unfair to a modern-day Japan that, under left or rightwing control, has eschewed militarism to the point of exasperating its western allies. But this is not to say that Tokyo is immune from populist lures. If the Liberal Democratic party went ahead with a pledge to build on a group of islands it knows as the Senkakus but which China calls the Diaoyu, it would mark an unnecessary escalation. Japan&apos;s sovereignty over this group of rocks is longstanding, and China&apos;s renewed claim to them is by comparison recent, although this too is disputed. But as neither side has done anything to assert their rival claims, an uneasy peace, broken only by fishing squalls, has prevailed. It is often forgotten that a third power is involved in the dispute \u2013 Taiwan. This is the land to which the islands are closest and with which they are geologically linked. Japan&apos;s relationship with Taiwan has none of the prickliness of its relations with the Chinese mainland. Taiwan&apos;s re-elected President Ma Ying-jeou recently proposed an initiative to shelve the sovereignty dispute and jointly develop the resources that lie around and below the islands. This is the best solution but, being reasonable and internationalist, it is one that could all too easily get drowned out. Japan&apos;s purchase of the islands from their private owners was an attempt to stop nationalists from staging provocative acts. But that in turn provoked waves of attacks on Japanese businesses in China. It would not be the first time that an incoming prime minister abandons an election pledge but that is what Shinzo Abe should now do. China is Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner, and, if he wants to last longer than he did the first time he was premier, Mr Abe should play the long game. That means not upsetting the status quo whereby Japanese sovereignty is maintained by nothing more threatening than coastguard vessels. China&apos;s newly elected leaders also need time to get their feet under\u00a0the table."}, {"sentences": ["Obviously more important things are happening in the world, not least Sunday&apos;s election of a rightwing nationalist government in Tokyo determined to reassert itself against China militarily and everyone else economically."], "tags": ["Andrew Mitchell", "Politics", "Police", "UK news", "Leveson report", "Newspapers & magazines", "Leveson inquiry", "Media", "The Sun", "National newspapers", "Newspapers"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-18T12:13:23Z", "title": "Plebgate and Fleet Street: when both sides can be wrong", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/dec/18/andrew-mitchell-plebgate-leveson", "article": "     I love a good row in which both sides are wrong. There&apos;s one bubbling away today as the extended fallout from Andrew Mitchell&apos;s resignation as chief whip collides with Fleet&apos;s Street&apos;s determination to get away with as little post-Leveson constraint as possible in a world of short attention spans. What&apos;s got everyone excited again is the arrest of a Met police officer suspected of being the source for the original leak to the Sun of the &quot;plebgate&quot; allegations against the bicycling politician and of the alleged transcript to the Daily Telegraph. We note in passing that the newspapers people choose to leak to is always a key indicator of motive over and above our lofty friend, the public interest. Obviously more important things are happening in the world, not least Sunday&apos;s election of a rightwing nationalist government in Tokyo determined to reassert itself against China militarily and everyone else economically. That could prove seriously dangerous. But as it&apos;s almost Christmas let&apos;s stick to relative domestic trivia for now. Today&apos;s Daily Mail is furious (as it usually is) over the &quot;plebgate&quot; arrest on the wholesome grounds that police whistleblowing \u2013 especially over corruption or botched investigations within the police itself \u2013 is an important protection of the public. It&apos;s right. The Guardian&apos;s crime reporter Vikram Dodd explains the problem rather more calmly here. Context matters. One of the more na\u00efve aspects of Lord Justice Leveson&apos;s report was that no unauthorised exchanges should take place between journalists and coppers \u2013 the stuff of quiet information-trading over a drink or mobile phone. Leveson shied away from making the same absurd proposals for political reporters like me, though he did suggest that ministers and staff should log such contacts. That&apos;s the theory at present, actually, Sir Brian; it was one of Alastair Campbell&apos;s dafter attempts at control-freakery, which may still be in place. It&apos;s more serious for the police because they wield more direct and powerful authority \u2013 life and liberty \u2013 over us all than politicians do directly. Worse, a year or so back Elizabeth Filkin, former parliamentary watchdog at Westminster, made the same suggestion about unofficial police contacts with the hacks. In my experience Filkin was a well-meaning busybody, much admired by the priggish, who fell for all sorts of daft complaints against MPs (often by fellow MPs settling scores) and did so with unattractive zeal. Of course, the tabloids loved her censorious enthusiasm at the time and devoted acres to the failings of elected MPs \u2013 much as they later did the MPs&apos; expenses scandal, orchestrated by the Daily Telegraph. Though the paper&apos;s owners, footloose David and Fred Barclay, don&apos;t even seem to contribute much to footing the taxpayer&apos;s bill \u2013 as the Guardian again reported this week. So far, so straightforward. We can all see that such police/reporter contacts can be good for the public&apos;s right to know and useful safety valves for failure of one kind or another. The same applies to private companies, the NHS and everyone else where bland assurances about telling HR or using a confidential hotline are shown to be blather, time and time again. It&apos;s not just a problem for Britain, as those of us who have been watching Denmark&apos;s The Killing series know. But leaks carry a health warning that some award-winning hacks never read. It is motive. Why is he/she telling me this? And is it true? At this point Fleet Street falls into a familiar elephant trap along with the police trade union, the Police Federation. Nowhere does the Mail&apos;s news report or the blowhard column written by Richard Littlejohn give any consideration to the aspect of the affair that the Guardian reports, namely that one of the investigative lines of inquiry is not simply an unauthorised leak or two but the \u2013 to my mind, important \u2013 possibility that the leaked version was untrue in key respects. So the point of principle \u2013 the protection of whistleblowers \u2013 is rightly defended in Fleet Street while the point of practice \u2013 the Street of Shame&apos;s cheerful willingness to print any old bollocks the lawyers say it can get away with \u2013 is ignored, as usual. Ours is a grimly practical trade and you can watch its inner workings (as Nick Clegg now says of the coalition) by observing the way it is rapidly backing away from those pious, post-Leveson pledges to clean out the Augean newsroom. Patrick Wintour has an update here. Surprise, surprise! Did Mitchell use the fatal words &quot;moron&quot; or &quot;pleb&quot;? He has admitted swearing at an over-officious officer who wouldn&apos;t open Downing Street&apos;s big security gate to let him through on his bike. A proper gent of the old school, like fellow biker Sir George Young, who took over as chief whip, would neither have sworn nor made a fuss. But Mitchell is a bit unpolished, a bit cocky too. He lost his temper last September. I don&apos;t know the exact truth. But bad manners does not make him a liar and it struck some of us at the time as remarkable that the media and the public were happy to accept the word of an anonymous copper against that of a cabinet member. It would not happen in many countries without better evidence than that, nor should it. Innocent until proved guilty? Not in Fleet Street, where I&apos;d wager that many of the media-driven cabinet sackings of recent decades should not have occurred but for the mindless frenzy. Rent-a-quote MPs like Tory Phil Davies and Labour&apos;s John Mann are wheeled on to express outrage at the arrest. The Police Federation also called the leaky copper&apos;s arrest &quot;disproportionate&quot; and bad for already-low morale. Well, we can always rely on vested interests to defend their turf. The BMA recoils at the thought of proper weekend shift work in hospitals (&quot;the NHS is not Tesco&quot;) and the RMT union plots to disrupt travellers Christmas for reasons only its members and bien-pensant useful idiots can even half believe. I&apos;d say the sacking of a cabinet minister on the word of an unnamed police constable was a touch disproportionate too. Never mind. But it&apos;s worth recalling the old saying that hard cases make bad law. When dodgy footballers tried to get the courts to ban all mention of their gagging injunctions \u2013 scoring with girls to make up for not scoring on the pitch \u2013 the Guardian joined the tabloids in protesting: the tabloids&apos; prurient interest in the lads&apos; sex lives was not a matter of public interest, but opposition to blanket injunctions was. The same applies here. Coppers should not be banned from talking to crime reporters, but should be prepared to justify what they have done in terms of the public interest. That may apply in the Mitchell case and it may not. We don&apos;t know, but we should care if the &quot;pleb&quot; charge that cost him his job was actually accurate. So should post-Leveson Fleet Street.

If 2011 was dominated by events unfolding in Athens, the agenda of almost every international gathering in 2012 focused on how Madrid would extricate itself from the debt trap that had already claimed Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Spain&apos;s right-of-centre prime minister Mariano Rajoy inherited a policy of denial from his socialist predecessors and, initially at least, adopted the same tactic. But with Spain targeted by international investors as the next domino after Greece to jeopardise the euro currency project, it became the focus of worldwide attention. If only Europe could resolve its debt problems, the global economy would recover its momentum. This was the message from Tokyo, Beijing and Washington, where policymakers felt constrained in the face of Europe&apos;s procrastination. An impending recession in the eurozone made reforms all the more urgent. A strongly growing US economy at the end of 2011 entered a presidential election year with Europe on its back. Thankfully for President Barack Obama, the housing crisis, which had seen prices fall by more than 40% in states such as Nevada and Arizona, bottomed out, small companies began hiring and bank lending eased in time for the November vote. Likewise, Japan began the year in recovery mode. It suffered the double hit of a financial crisis and a tsunami, which wrecked much of the country&apos;s north-east in the spring of 2011. Regaining export orders was the No 1 priority and all seemed to be going well until the summer, when the balance of payments went into reverse, largely as a result of huge gas imports to replace the lack of nuclear power following the Fukushima tragedy. Worse, major electronics firms Sony, Panasonic and Sharp revealed deep losses. The South Korean manufacturing revolution, led by Samsung, had effectively ended 30 years of Japanese dominance. Car manufacture continued to be one of the bright spots, though a dispute over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea put even that in jeopardy. China, which claims the islands along with Japan, allowed nationalists to riot largely unchecked, burning and looting Japanese shops and factories. A boycott of Japanese goods resulted in a slump in sales of Toyotas and Nissans, again allowing the South Koreans a competitive advantage. Part of the problem followed a year-long slowdown in Chinese manufacturing that was already causing jitters across the west. The Chinese powerhouse economy had survived the global financial crisis after a large injection of government funds, but Beijing had little room to repeat the exercise without stoking inflation and an already rampant property bubble. Tentative moves to increase government spending on health, social security and pensions, alongside liberalising laws designed to allow more private-sector involvement in areas previously dominated by the state, helped the economy move forward. Yet a political stasis, ahead of November&apos;s appointment of a successor to premier Wen Jiabao, appeared to hold up progress. Brazil, which saw its income jump above Britain&apos;s in late 2011 to make it the world&apos;s sixth-largest economy, suffered a sharp slowdown following a surge in the value of its currency. Like the other Bric countries of Russia, India and China, Brazil found it was more dependent on Europe and the west than its public statements of economic independence gave credit. It complained about the volume of money printed by western central banks that was making its own more attractive. With hot money pouring in, Brazil&apos;s central bank raised capital controls. Unfortunately the policy had little effect; foreign investment funds continued to pour in and Brazilian exports became more expensive. Only Africa appeared immune to the knock-on effects of the eurozone debt crisis. From Nigeria to Zambia to South Africa, growth rates topped 5% compared with less than 2% in the US and sub-zero in most major European countries by the end of the year. However, a meeting of the World Bank in Tokyo in October revealed widespread disquiet among African trade unions and charities at the distribution of incomes and wealth. World Bank officials were bombarded with stories of poverty among workers while owners, many of them foreign mining companies, made millions of dollars in profits. In Europe, the year ended on a low note. While Spain appeared to get a grip on its bankrupt banking sector and the European Central Bank pencilled in a recovery for 2013 across the continent, Italy appeared to want the limelight. Silvio Berlusconi burst back on to the political scene, potentially stealing the lead role in the debt crisis from Madrid."}, {"sentences": ["In June 2012 the top three cities by number of tweets were Jakarta, Tokyo and London."], "tags": ["Twitter", "Media", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "Social media", "Digital media", "Social networking"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-18T17:51:19Z", "title": "Twitter active users pass 200 million", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/18/twitter-users-pass-200-million", "article": "Twitter now has more than 200 million active users around the world, with some 10 million of those in the UK underlining its rapid growth as a social media tool.

The \u00a3160m portion of the fine levied by the Financial Services Authority is the largest ever imposed by the City regulator and surpasses the previous record of \u00a359.5m imposed on Barclays in June for attempted manipulation of the Libor and Euribor rates. The total Barclays fine was \u00a3290m and led to the resignation of chief executive Bob Diamond days later. At UBS at least 2,000 requests for &quot;inappropriate submissions&quot; to the key rates were documented and at least 45 individuals &quot;including traders, managers and senior managers were involved in, or aware of, the practice of attempting to influence submissions&quot;, the FSA said. It added that every one of those submissions was potentially suspicious. The City regulator said UBS had colluded with interdealer brokers to influence submissions to the yen Libor rate and that corrupt brokerage payments of \u00a315,000 a quarter were made to reward brokers for their efforts to manipulate the Libor submissions of other banks on the panel submitting rates. The UBS fine exposes the full scale of the attempts to manipulate the two rates \u2013 London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor).

He offered to &quot;return the favour&quot; and entered into illicit transactions in order to incentivise and reward his counterparts. For example, on 18 September 2008 a trader explained to a broker: &quot;If you keep 6s [ie, the six-month Japanese yen Libor rate] unchanged today ... I will fucking do one humongous deal with you ... Like a 50,000 buck deal, whatever ... I need you to keep it as low as possible ... if you do that .... I&apos;ll pay you, you know, 50,000 dollars, 100,000 dollars... whatever you want ... I&apos;m a man of my word.&quot; Illicit fees of more than \u00a3170,000 were generated for the broker. Tracey McDermott, the FSA director of enforcement and financial crime, said: &quot;The findings we have set out in our notice today do not make for pretty reading. The integrity of benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor are of fundamental importance to both UK and international financial markets.

The arrival of an indigenous edition of fashion&apos;s most famous glossy magazine has become a barometer of the emergence of an affluent middle class, and a siren call to a luxury industry looking for new markets. Launches in Thailand and Ukraine next year will bring the number of international Vogues to 21. Until the 1960s, there were only five editions of Vogue: in the US, UK, France, Italy and Australia. In the past 40 years, economic growth around the globe has been tracked by the arrival of Vogue editors: Russia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan have had their own Vogues since the 1990s, while the first decade of the 21st century saw launches in China and India, among others. The launch of Turkish Vogue two years ago indicated the country&apos;s emergence as a luxury market. Because the printing cost of a copy of Vogue is much higher than the cover price, advertising is crucial. For this reason, the appetite of the luxury industry to reach consumers in a country is what brings Vogue to the newsstand. As Cond\u00e9 Nast&apos;s chairman, Jonathan Newhouse, said when announcing the 2013 launch of a Kiev-based edition of his magazine: &quot;The Ukraine is ready for Vogue \u2026 Kiev is booming, and there is a strong market demand for luxury products and the experience Vogue can offer the reader.&quot; But the arrival of Vogue has also become a badge of sophistication for a country. The desire among consumers for a Vogue specific to that country, rather than imported editions, grows as a middle class gains confidence. The lofty, imperial decrees of a magazine printed in a distant western capital no longer satisfy women secure in their own ideals of style and beauty and looking for publications which reflect these. When Turkish Vogue launched in 2010, the 562-page debut issue boasted 252 pages of advertising including Dior, Escada and D&amp;G and the masthead featured Mary Fellowes, formerly of British Vogue \u2013 but at the Paris launch party, the editor in chief chose a dress by Turkish designer Hakaan Yildirim. Vogue Thailand recently provided a teaser cover image of its debut cover, featuring the Thai model Si Tanwiboon, who has walked in Paris fashion week shows including Jean Paul Gaultier and Louis Vuitton. Each edition of Vogue takes on something of the character of that country. Japanese Vogue is eccentric and edgy, reflecting the lively fashion cultures of Tokyo. Russian Vogue is edited by Victoria Davydova, whose graduate thesis was on the financial structure of the beauty industry; the models rarely smile. Indian Vogue has had Indian models on every cover in 2012, but this is unusual. China had the Beijing-born model Liu Wen on three consecutive September issues, but has also featured the US models Arizona Muse and Karlie Kloss in 2012. Spanish Vogue&apos;s cover models this year included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, but also Kate Moss dressed as a matador. Vogue Brazil most often features Brazilian models, in particular Gisele B\u00fcndchen, but in Korean Vogue a run of blond models has included Britain&apos;s Cara Delevingne, the Dutch Lara Stone and the American Carolyn Murphy. Japanese Vogue aroused controversy when a video of a shoot with the US model Crystal Renn appeared to show her temples being pulled back to give her eyes a more Japanese appearance. The magazine insisted the technique is commonly used to define bone structure on camera, and was not intended to alter ethnicity."}, {"sentences": ["&quot;UBS&apos;s misconduct was all the more serious because of the orchestrated attempts to manipulate the Japanese yen Libor submissions of other banks, as well as its own, and the collusion with interdealer brokers and other panel banks in co-ordinated efforts to manipulate the fix.&quot; The Swiss regulator Finma said that most of the requests were made by one trader who worked in Tokyo from 2006 to 2009."], "tags": ["UBS", "Banking", "European banks", "Business", "Libor", "UK news", "Switzerland", "Europe", "World news", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-19T18:02:00Z", "title": "Two former UBS employees charged in US over Libor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/19/ubs-1bn-libor-payments-to-brokers", "article": "Two former UBS employees have been charged by the US authorities in connection with allegations they attempted to rig Libor just hours after Swiss bank UBS was fined \u00a3940m by global regulators for manipulating the key rate.

In Washington, attorney general Eric Holder said two former UBS employees \u2013 Tom Hayes and Roger Darin \u2013 had been charged with conspiracy and that Hayes was also charged with wire fraud and an antitrust violation. &quot;By causing UBS and other financial institutions to spread false and misleading information about Libor, these alleged conspirators \u2013 and others at UBS \u2013 manipulated the benchmark interest rate upon which many consumer financial products \u2013 including credit cards, student loans, and mortgages \u2013 are frequently based,&quot; Holder said.

Breuer said the department would seek the extradition of two former employees. &quot;We believe that one of them is in England. The other one is in Switzerland.

But maybe that&apos;s the country&apos;s biggest problem. Until there is a sign that the outside world is prepared to park its savings somewhere else, Tokyo will continue to sail further into debt. The Bank of Japan delivered its third shot of monetary stimulus in four months on Thursday, adding another 10 trillion yen (\u00a373bn) to the \u00a3740bn of electronic money already spent by the bank on its own government&apos;s debt. The move is considered a prelude to more aggressive action next year as the country confronts the prospect of a third decade of low growth. Like the British chancellor, George Osborne, the incoming government of Shinzo Abe has ruled out a budget stimulus. Creating central bank money is the only game in town as ministers seek to boost the amount of funds available for borrowing. How long will it last? Until demand pushes up consumer spending and thereby prices and, with the prospect of rising prices into the future, encourages consumers to spend even more. At the moment companies and consumers are acting as a counterweight to central bank action because they are hoarding their money. Abe wants the Bank of Japan to consider raising its inflation target from 1% to 2%. Alive to the massive political mandate acquired by Abe in the elections last week, the bank governor has agreed to debate the issue with his committee at a meeting next month. &quot;I take it that the BOJ is carrying out what we sought during the election step-by-step,&quot; Abe told a party meeting. A higher inflation target will give the central bank licence to print even more money. Remember the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee has just backed away from increasing the level of quantitative easing from \u00a3375bn because it fears inflation at 2.7% is too high. Like Abe, Osborne is encouraging a higher target. But why should Japanese companies and consumers borrow when they have plenty of savings to spend? Don&apos;t worry about that, argue the pro-monetary easers, it encourages investment in risky assets and that will get the economy moving. It will also bring down the value of the yen as long term interest rates fall even further, boosting exports. Yet this reliance on monetary stimulus, as in the west, follows an abdication by finance ministries of budget reforms that could do much the same job without extending the sum of government/central bank debt. The Tokyo parliament is due to push VAT to 8%, on its way to 10% (in the UK VAT is 20%). But there is every likelihood it will back away rather than face up to its budget deficit and more importantly a debt that is more than double the country&apos;s GDP. Scared of deterring people from spending in the short term, ministers will blow a chance to push up prices that could encourage spending and generate larger tax revenues in the medium term. Long term planning from a parliament that limits its prime minister to a year in post at most, has been woeful. Confidence in government spending as an instrument of growth is understandably shot to pieces after a splurge of infrastructure projects in the 1990s built with debt. In fact a large proportion of the 200% debt to GDP ratio can be accounted for by the concreted rivers and bridges to nowhere that dot the country. If Abe can count on Europe remaining in crisis, investors are likely to continue backing Japan as a safer haven for their assets. But should the eurozone situation improve, Abe could be in real trouble. If his government relies only on monetary stimulus he could find himself in a couple of years with UK-style growth, which is to say zero growth.

The closest we get to authentic crowd-based peril is Guy Fawkes&apos; Night, and that&apos;s traditionally preceded by weeks of stark televised warnings. What are we scared of? Burning to death? Yes. If the fire festival I saw in Japan is anything to go by, the Japanese aren&apos;t. I was in Nozawa Onsen, a hot spring village and ski resort some four hours&apos; drive from Tokyo in Nagano prefecture. It was January, and there was more snow than I&apos;ve ever seen in my life, because I&apos;ve never gone skiing. In fact, on the list of things I&apos;ve always wanted to try, skiing ranks below pushing a power drill into my eye. Not just because it&apos;s clearly a hideous pastime practised by bastards, but because I hate the sensation of sliding on anything. When I put a foot on the ground, I want it to stay where it is. There&apos;s an inherent lack of control with skis, or skates - or skateboards come to think of it - that fundamentally appalls me. I can&apos;t abide the uncertainty. I&apos;m a risk-aware type. Back to that in a bit, but first: snow. Tons of the kind of snow that would shut Britain down for 100 years. Here they just get on with it. There&apos;s no choice. Snow ploughs work overtime, carving roads back into existence. snow. Approaching by bus is like being ferried through an endless white trench. Then you step out and fall on your arse unless you&apos;ve got spikes on your shoes \u2013 just like I didn&apos;t. Thanks to my own ill-prepared idiocy I spent a lot of my time in Nozawa Onsen clinging to walls and drainpipes and worrying about breaking a hip, which slightly undercut the otherwise enchanting snow-dappled storybook visuals of the place. Safer to try out the baths. As well as compound fractures and death-by-fire (more on that later), Nozawa Onsen offers hot springs, some of them outdoors, many of them free and open to the public. Visiting a Japanese bath is daunting at first. Not only does it involve stripping naked, but there&apos;s some fairly strict etiquette surrounding the bath itself, which is for relaxing, not washing. To prove you&apos;re clean before entering, you have to strip naked, sit on a little wooden stool, and wash yourself thoroughly using a little wooden bucket. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s possible to perform this ritual with dignity. I&apos;m equally sure I didn&apos;t. But once you&apos;re over this, relaxing in a hot spring bath, surrounded by snow and silence, is an experience that calms the mind almost as effectively as diazepam. Not that I stayed calm: a few hours later I was watching a cackling, drunken mob apparently trying to murder a group of middle-aged men.     Villagers fuel up on sake before attacking the shrine    This was the Dosojin Fire Festival, one of the weirdest public entertainments I&apos;ve ever seen. As with many insane traditions, it is based in superstition. The ages of 25 and 42 are considered yakudoshi (unlucky) for men, so of course all the 25- and 42-year-old males in the village construct a huge wooden shrine in the centre of the village \u2013 it resembles an air traffic control tower made of sticks \u2013 every 15 January. They also get astronomically drunk on sake, which helps with what comes next. As the sun sets, the 42-year-olds climb to a nest-like area at the top, where they stand, singing and chanting. The 25-year-olds form a perimeter and &quot;guard&quot; the shrine (and the 42-year-olds), while all the other men in the village attempt to storm the structure and burn it to the ground. I discovered all this afterwards. It wasn&apos;t entirely clear during the event itself, which resembled nothing less than a terrifying medieval war. From the back of the crowd, I tried moving closer until it became clear my lack of suitable footwear was a potentially fatal inconvenience given the combination of crowds, flames, ice, darkness and bedlam. I tried moving back. After tumbling down countless deep snow banks and slipping on vast expanses of ice \u2013 which I suddenly didn&apos;t mind, thanks to the free sake they&apos;d been doling out as I arrived \u2013 I eventually found some scaffolding and climbed up for a better view. What I saw astonished me. Imagine what would happen if a huge wooden spaceship full of laughing paedophiles landed in the centre of Hyde Park during a snow storm, and a mob turning up clutching flaming torches to dish out some instant justice. It looked like that \u2013 but conducted amid an air of good-natured, drink-fuelled insanity.     Father and toddler at Dosojin Fire Festival    In fact the crazed glee with which the hordes trying to burn the shrine down went about their task was almost inspiring. Regard for personal safety was entirely absent. The attackers \u2013 one of them had a toddler on his back at the time \u2013 lit torches from huge bonfires then barrelled toward the hapless 25-year-old guards, knocking them over, clattering against them with flaming blocks of wood, and hurling blazing projectiles at the precarious wooden structure. Throughout this often genuinely violent battle, the 42-year-olds continually taunted everyone on the ground, repeatedly hurling armfuls of kindling into the crowd below, all the better to get burnt to a cinder with. It&apos;s a gloriously ridiculous celebration of unnecessary risk \u2013 the precise opposite of health and safety. The war between mob and guards went on for some time, the flames inching ever nearer the shrine, until finally the bellowing drunks at the top stopped laughing in the face of death and began scrambling for safety. The guards acquiesced, the torchbearers moved, and soon the entire structure went up, a cross between an oil rig disaster and the finale of The Wicker Man. After an initial roar, the crowd stood and stared, dumbstruck by the intensity of the blaze. Eventually the flames died down. Dazed, we retraced our steps to the hotel. On the way back I slipped and fell about six times. I didn&apos;t notice. \u2022 The Nozawa fire festival takes places on 15 January every year.

Wherever you heard it or whatever you think it means, in 2012, Gangnam Style \u2013 the annoyingly catchy song with the silly dance by Psy \u2013 catapulted South Korea into the global consciousness on a scale usually reserved for pregnant princesses. It is one of the year&apos;s most Googled search terms and the video became YouTube&apos;s most viewed of all time, topping a billion hits this month. South Korea is hot. But most of us know little about it beyond &quot;He-ey, sexy lady&quot; line and the horsey hip wiggle. Which is why this month South Korean tourist officials released a YouTube guide to the real Gangnam, a video that has since had more than 400,000 hits. This is just one example of how the government and record companies are scrambling to create a tourist-friendly K-pop experience in Seoul, to ensure that current interest lasts longer than a one-hit wonder. In a neat alley in Apgujeong \u2013 the shopping district styled as the Beverly Hills of Seoul, complete with a Rodeo Street \u2013 a group of young girls are peering excitedly into the huge windows of Cube Cafe. &quot;Beast might visit today,&quot; Lee Mi-Hyun tells me distractedly, craning so not to lose sight of the door. Beast, a six-member boy band also known as B2ST, is a hugely popular K-pop act, and 13-year-old Mi-Hyun and her friends are B2UTYs \u2013 fangirls of the band. K-pop is kitschy, catchy, highly produced, seamlessly choreographed, skilfully marketed and performed by (mostly) young, unthreateningly good-looking boy and girl bands with devoted, tech-savvy followings. We in the west may have just cottoned on to it (anyone with preteen children will know better), but there is no overstating its popularity in Asia. K-pop is part of the Korean wave: the popular culture movement also known as hallyu (encompassing music, films, soaps, video games and cartoons), which has been growing in popularity and influence since the 1990s. In 2011 alone, hallyu is said to have contributed more than \u00a32.3bn to the South Korean economy. K-pop&apos;s all-powerful labels are based in Apgujeong, a neighbourhood in Gangnam. But even before Psy put the area on the map, fans had been arriving in such numbers that the Cube Entertainment label opened a cafe for them in its office building.     Fans with merchandise at Cube Cafe. Photograph: Nick Gregan    I join about 20 fans inside Cube Cafe. They solemnly sip lattes as they inspect the racks of merchandise. There are Beast gold trainers and mugs imprinted with band members&apos; lips, and cushions and T-shirts emblazoned with pictures of 4Minute (a hugely popular girl group, whose auburn-haired singer, Kim Hyun-a, features in the Gangnam Style video). Every time a car stops outside, all heads swivel in the hope of spotting the label&apos;s stars on their way to the dance rehearsal and vocal training studios upstairs. &quot;I&apos;ve met them all,&quot; says barista Park Ji-su, with a touch of world-weariness, as more well-behaved fans surge meekly through the door. Is she a fan? &quot;No,&quot; she replies, &quot;I was hired because I speak Japanese.&quot; Behind me, Kayok Himatashi waits patiently to be served: a huge K-pop fan, she has just flown in from Tokyo in the hope of meeting Beast. What makes the band so special? &quot;The standard of their dancing is so much better than Japanese groups: they practise very hard and sing very well,&quot; she says, appreciative of the K-popstars&apos; gruelling schedule of singing, dancing and grooming classes. &quot;And,&quot; she adds, raising a hand to hide her giggle, &quot;they are very handsome.&quot; More fangirls arrive but no bands, so after an hour I follow a group of them on the unofficial K-pop circuit. We walk down the narrow alley lined with boutiques, past carts selling tteokbokki, the ubiquitous gelatinous rice cakes swimming in a spicy red sauce (which taste much nicer than they sound). Two streets over we find fangirls and fanboys hanging around Dunkin&apos; Donuts, on the lookout for acts visiting JYP Entertainment (label of K-pop heavyweights Wonder Girls, 2AM and 2PM) across the street. There&apos;s nothing doing, so we move on to SM Entertainment (home of Super Junior, Shinee, Girls&apos; Generation and TVXQ) two streets away. We kill time licking icing off a donut but no bands appear.     Modern architecture in Gangnam.   Photograph: Alamy    Seoul is an ancient city resplendent with Unesco-listed buildings. Its history is one of invasion and occupation. In the 20th century alone, the Japanese occupied the country for 35 years to 1945, swiftly followed by the North Koreans, who were bombed out by the Americans in 1950. (The bridge across the Han river, over which General MacArthur marched his troops, still stands, pocked with bullet holes.) But rapid industrialisation after the Korean war, helped by the 1988 Olympics and the 2002 World Cup, saw South Korea transform into a hi-tech, global economic power. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Gangnam. Back out on Apgujeong&apos;s main thoroughfare, I dodge pairs of young women shopping: their linked arms bristle with designer carrier bags like extravagant charm bracelets. The only things more numerous than the designer stores (Fendi, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuitton) are the western coffee chains and the plastic surgeons&apos; clinics. It&apos;s easy to see why Psy would parody the place, but irony gets lost on the crowded streets. Organised tours of Gangnam, described in the most recent Lonely Planet guide as &quot;more noted for its numerous bars and restaurants than its tourist sights&quot;, still focus on sights such as the COEX Mall (Asia&apos;s largest underground shopping centre and home of the excellent Kimchi Museum) and the huge Bongeunsa Buddhist temple across the street. Hotel rooms are thin on the ground in Seoul. Visitor numbers to Korea have increased by 15% every year since 1988, and last summer the tourism office announced a shortage of about 26,500 rooms. As a result, there has been a surge in Gangnam locals renting out their flats from about \u00a340 a night (check out the BnBhero.com website). There are also yeogwan (traditional inns) and love motels, though the line between the two is often blurred. Korean love motels are more Vegas than vulgar, and many have fabulous themed rooms and swimming pools. Nice ones around Insadong station cost from \u00a330 a night, though most don&apos;t take bookings. The Sheel Motel by the station is one of the area&apos;s classics. For a something chic, IP Boutique hotel in Itaewon (ipboutiquehotel.com) charges from \u00a380 a night. Or there&apos;s Lady Gaga&apos;s fave, the W, out at Walkerhill (starwoodhotels.com/whotels, rooms from \u00a3185).     South Korean girl group T-ara  on stage. Photograph: Kim Hee-Chul/Corbis    A number of new hotels are opening in Gangnam in 2013, and the South Korean ministry of culture and tourism is planning a dedicated K-pop stadium and Hallyuwood Walk of Fame there \u2013 there&apos;s even talk of a statue of Psy. It is staging slightly bonkers K-pop events as part of a &quot;creative ideas campaign to welcome foreign tourists visiting Korea&quot;. Advertised on Twitter and the Tourist Office website, free events include dance classes, Gangnam Style flashmobs, hairstyling demonstrations and a weekly K-pop chart show (think Top of the K-pops). Today&apos;s hot ticket is a free concert at the Olympic Park. Easily reached on Seoul&apos;s efficient underground network, the park is a sprawling green space dotted with more than 200 giant sculptures and home to the Soma Museum of Art. When excavations started here for the 1988 Olympics, vast third-century earthworks were discovered. Now fully restored, the elevated fortification runs for more than a mile and a half through the park, offering fantastic views of the mountains between Seoul and North Korea, 40 miles to the north. Security is tight in the open-air plaza: boy band Infinite is headlining, and the place is heaving with fangirls. Ticket holders wear numbered bibs to gain access to their precious seats; some pay to be photographed next to lifesize cardboard cut-outs of their idols. Outside the barriers, tickletless fangirls wrap themselves against the cold in homemade &quot;Infinite 4Ever&quot; banners. (Summers in Seoul can hit 40C but winters plunge as low as -15C.) The atmosphere is electric \u2013 imagine Beatlemania or the first time Take That split up. I find myself seated next to a group of foreign students, all here studying Korean, all long-time K-pop fans. &quot;It&apos;s the gateway drug,&quot; laughs Lavinia Pletosu, a 22-year-old from Italy. &quot;The more you get into the music, the more you want to know about the language, the history, the culture, the food ...&quot; Canadian Mary Zhang agrees: &quot;When I was 15, I wanted to learn Korean so I could write to singer Kim Junsu: he&apos;s a total god. After years of listening to K-pop and practising the moves, though, I wanted to come and learn about the country.&quot;     Psy in the Gangnam-style video    Suddenly the whole place goes off like a car alarm, as Infinite take to the stage. Slender and curiously asexual, the seven twentysomething men appear unruffled by the wall of screams that greets them. In their neat brown suits, they look like trainee accountants. That&apos;s until the music starts. Infinite jerk into formation, bursting into song while performing a complicated, synchronised dance routine with almost eerie precision. &quot;It&apos;s the Scorpion,&quot; shrieks a voice behind me. I turn to ask what they mean, only to see the entire (mostly western) audience, doing the dance and singing along at the tops of their lungs in word-perfect Korean. If this is K-pop, Korea has a global hit on its hands. \u2022 Flights were provided by Korean Air (020-7495 8641, koreanair.com), which flies from Heathrow to Seoul from \u00a3649 return.

Twitter&apos;s adoption of media embedding, Instagram&apos;s decision to pull its content from Twitter, Facebook&apos;s launch of Poke and Google&apos;s failure to add a write API to its G+ platform all display an &quot;own the user&quot; mentality. AdSense and AdWords would never have been invented had Larry and Sergey not understood the value of providing a monetization platform for others to benefit from, even for users not on Google. This is the type of thinking required today but currently all roads point to several varied attempts to re-portalize; that is to say, to own your own traffic and seek to monetize it. This is the old Yahoo view of the world and it clearly represents a limited mindset that will not scale to the huge mobile opportunity. For Twitter in particular, which has a large global opportunity as a platform, this trend represents a shrinking of its real opportunity.   There&apos;s plenty more like that, and all his insights are worth paying attention to. Surprise: only 1% of domains drive over 70% of referring traffic &gt;&gt; Conductor Blog  Not long ago, Rand Fishkin mused about the possibility of a long-tail to the web&apos;s referral traffic (Is There a Long Tail to Referral Traffic?).  He theorized: ...that only ~20% of the referrals that the average website receives comes from the tail of the distribution curve, whilst Matt felt that number should be considerably larger.  Rand&apos;s analysis of several domains (broken out separately below because the number of sites used for the two groups differed) showed that the top 10 referring domains (between 0.33% and 1.47% of the total domains driving traffic) drove between 65% and 88% of all referral traffic.  Quad-core Sony smartphone with 1080p display rumored for CES &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  A quad-core Sony Xperia phone is rumored to debut at CES in January, according the Chinese-language site ePrice. The phone&apos;s screen will rival that of the giant Samsung Galaxy Note series at 5 inches, but will outpace its competitor&apos;s displays with a 1080p resolution.  Rumors have been swirling about a Sony phone meant to compete on the level of LG&apos;s Nexus 4 or HTC&apos;s Droid DNA, both of which launched this past fall. The upcoming Sony phone, designated as the Xperia Z L36h, is reported to have a 13-megapixel backside-illuminated camera, Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 quad-core processor with Adreno 320 GPU, 2GB of RAM, and a microSD slot, according to ePrice.   We&apos;re going to have to find things for all those cores to do. Some of those specifications would look good on a PC of a few years ago. Weak Windows 8 demand saps PC sales, Fujitsu President says &gt;&gt; Bloomberg  Fujitsu, Japan&apos;s biggest provider of computer services, said the company will miss its annual shipment target for personal computers amid slow demand for Microsoft&apos;s Windows 8 operating system.  Initial appetite for the software, introduced in October, is &quot;weak,&quot; Fujitsu President Masami Yamamoto, 58, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday. Slumping demand in Europe amid the sovereign-debt crisis will also erode sales, he said. PC deliveries for the year ending March 31 may be more than 6m units, compared with an October estimate of 7m, he said.   That&apos;s a 15% shortfall. Europe&apos;s economic woes, and the US&apos;s slowing appetite for PCs, are likely to be the explanation used by quite a few chief executives later in January.

Ultrabook vendors concerned about revision of MacBook Air in 2013 &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Apple has issued requests for quotations (RFQ) to Taiwan-based supply chain makers for the revision of several notebook models including MacBook Pro and MacBook Air series in June 2013, causing ultrabook vendors to be concerned, according to supply chain makers.  The sources pointed out that the MacBook Air for 2013 will feature a new processor platform, but its industrial design will not see any major changes.  The sources noted that pressure on ultrabook vendors mainly comes from the Air&apos;s price since Apple is likely to reduce the prices for its existing MacBook Airs before the launch of the new models which could take away demand for ultrabooks.  Scaling to different screens - Building Windows 8 &gt;&gt; MSDN Blogs  Looking at the data about devices in the marketplace today, we see that only 1.2% of active Windows 7 users have screens with a resolution of less than 1024x768. When designing a new platform that supports the devices of today and tomorrow (with undoubtedly higher resolutions) we optimized for the majority of today&apos;s screens (i.e. 98.8%) without sacrificing the experience and complicating the developer story for legacy screens. In addition, the runrate of new PCs with screen sizes of 1024x600 and 1280x720 has dramatically fallen and, to the best of our knowledge, almost no new mainstream PCs are being manufactured with this resolution.   All very true. The surprise is that 1366x768 is the most common screen size for Windows 7, with 42% in use. FAA rules make electronic devices on planes dangerous &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  Over the last year, flying with phones and other devices has become increasingly dangerous.  In September, a passenger was arrested in El Paso after refusing to turn off his cellphone as the plane was landing. In October, a man in Chicago was arrested because he used his iPad during takeoff. In November, half a dozen police cars raced across the tarmac at La Guardia Airport in New York, surrounding a plane as if there were a terrorist on board. They arrested a 30-year-old man who had also refused to turn off his phone while on the runway.   Nick Bilton says that dealing with the FAA on this is like arguing with a stubborn teenager: there&apos;s no proof of harm, but they won&apos;t change their mind even so until someone proves it&apos;s completely safe - which is a logical impossibility. Opinion: In business, why 2013 is RIM&apos;s BlackBerry year &gt;&gt; Macworld UK Rob Enderle:   As we look ahead to 2013, it&apos;s becoming increasingly clear that the new year provides an unprecedented opportunity for Research in Motion to make a huge comeback.  This is largely because the market is dominated by two platforms: Android, which is seen as an unsecure malware magnet, and iOS, which comes from a firm that has never learned to spell &quot;IT.&quot; In fact, Apple&apos;s biggest failures were Lisa and the Apple Server, both created on Steve Jobs&apos; watch (Lisa was even his product, initially) and both targeted at the IT market.  While phones and tablets are largely a consumer play, they are increasingly being used for business. Even in a BYOD world, IT still has a great deal of say about the hardware connected to its networks and services. As we start 2013, and as RIM brings out its next-generation products, the company will stand alone as the only mobile solutions provider focused on IT first and the needs of users later.
